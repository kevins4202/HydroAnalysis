initial static shear stress ratio ssr and overconsolidated ratio ocr several useful conclusions are obtained first the total axial strain increases as the ssr increases whereas an increase in the ocr

marine clay overconsolidation initial static shear stress threshold level 1 introduction during the past decades traffic engineering constructions have been completed in the coastal areas of southeast china such as shanghai hangzhou and wenzhou where soft clay deposits are extensively distributed according to previous studies li et al 2011 wang et al 2013a b 2019 guo et al 2013 cai et al 2013 the

among the various ground treatment methods the surcharge pre loading is popular owing to its effectiveness and convenience the process of surcharge pre loading leads to the overconsolidation of surcharged clays for which there is a top crust with an overconsolidated ratio ocr as high as 8 0 in the ground wu et al 2015 thus it is necessary to investigate the influences of the initial static

2011a 2011b further established a unified correlation between the liquefaction resistance of toyoura sand and a state parameter that considered the effects of the relative density of sand and confining pressure based on the threshold of the static shear stress ratio ssr moreover yang et al 2017 found that the conditions that trigger flow deformation under cyclic loading can be interpreted using the instability response of sand under monotonic loading and proposed a unified interpretation to quantify the effects of static shear stress pan et al 2017 investigated the undrained cyclic response of saturated sand and found that different stress conditions lead to two different types of cyclic behaviour cyclic mobility and residual deformation accumulation they proposed a pore

several tests to simulate the application of seismic waves hyodo et al 1994 proposed a semi empirical model to evaluate the development of pore pressure and residual shear strain during earthquakes wang et al 2013a b investigated the influence of an initial shear stress on the stiffness degradation of soft clay however limited numbers n 1000 of cycles were applied in these tests and the effects of the initial static shear stress on the undrained cyclic behaviour of clays subjected to long term cyclic loading n 10 000 have been rarely investigated additionally in view of the overconsolidated state of clays subjected to surcharge pre loading treatment several researchers have investigated the cyclic behaviours of overconsolidated clays fujiwara et al 1990 investigated the effect of pre loading on the post construction consolidation settlement of soft clay subjected to repeated loading silvestri et al 2017 suggested that the response of lightly overconsolidated sensitive clay from louiseville can be divided into three distinct deformation phases the triaxial tests conducted by arnold et al 2017 indicated that the undrained shear strength is not a proper soil parameter but is strongly dependent on the ocr value and the developing stress path the hollow cylinder apparatus test results obtained by shi et al 2017 indicated that the settlements of subgrade clays depend considerably on the ocr however these studies were conducted without consideration of the presence of the initial shear stress to understand the influences of the initial static shear stress on the deformation characteristics of overconsolidated soft marine clays beneath embankments a series of cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on overconsolidated clay in undrained conditions with and without the initial static shear stress the development of the resilient modulus total and permanent axial strains of the clay specimens at various ocrs and ssr were investigated a threshold ssr was then obtained according to the observed interactions between the accumulated permanent axial strain in each test and the ssr value two quantitative relationships between the permanent axial strain and ssr were then established based on this threshold ssr 2 material and methods taking into consideration that uniform undisturbed soft clay samples are considerably difficult to obtain in this study remoulded samples processed in a large consolidation apparatus were prepared by using a slurry consolidation method shi et al 2017 hu et al 2018 cai et al 2018 the undisturbed samples were first dried in an oven and then ground into powder using a crushing machine a screening machine was then used to remove large particles grain sizes 0 3 mm from the powdered specimens which were then mixed with de aired water to a water content of 80 the resulting slurry was then slowly poured into a special custom fabricated slurry consolidator that provided radial sample constraint additionally a vertical pressure was applied incrementally from 12 5 to 25 50 75 and finally 100 kpa a duration of 24 h was allowed for each increment up to 100 kpa after which it took another 3 d or more for the samples to consolidate completely until the settlement of the clay mud reached a steady value less than 0 05 h drainage was allowed on the top bottom and sides of samples to reduce the primary consolidation duration thus approximately 7 d were required to ensure full consolidation thereafter each sample was trimmed into a cylindrical specimen with a diameter of 50 mm and a standard height of 100 mm the basic index characteristics of the reconsolidated soil specimens are summarised in table 1 3 test apparatus and scheme 3 1 test apparatus in this study a series of monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on normally consolidated and overconsolidated soft clays using an advanced dynamic triaxial testing system gds instruments ltd u k that simultaneously applies a deviatoric stress and a confining pressure in this case the confining and back pressures were both controlled by reliable volume controllers that use de aired water the deviatoric stress was applied by an axial actuator and measured by a load transducer mounted on the top of the cell the axial strain was monitored and measured by a highly sensitive linear variable displacement transducer and the pore pressure was measured by a highly accurate transducer that connected the top and base drainages through short stiff tubes with the enforcement of enhanced control and measurement precision as well as the use of a powerful real time data acquisition function this apparatus enabled long term cyclic loading tests at different loading frequencies 3 2 test procedures all samples were trimmed to cylindrical specimens with diameters of 50 mm and lengths of 100 mm and were then mounted in the triaxial cell then a back pressure of 200 kpa and a confining pressure of 220 kpa were applied until the b values became larger than 0 97 indicating that the specimen was fully saturated each specimen was then initially subjected to a pre consolidation pressure of σ oc ocr 100 kpa until the volumetric strain fell below 0 36 min after the completion of pre consolidation the effective confining pressure was reduced to σ p 100 kpa to produce overconsolidated specimens with ocr values of 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 the conditions of the monotonic triaxial tests are summarised in table 2 a series of monotonic triaxial undrained shear tests were conducted with the various ocrs all monotonic tests applied a controlled axial strain rate of 0 05 min and stopped at an axial strain of 10 the cyclic triaxial test programmes are summarised in table 3 in these tests the cyclic deviatoric stress q cyc was superimposed on the initial static shear stress q s at a frequency of 1 hz the loading waves and stress conditions in the cyclic triaxial tests are schematically presented in fig 1 to compare the cyclic behaviour of clay samples with various initial static shear stresses the initial shear stress ratio ssr was selected to serve as the normalised parameter as shown in many previous studies yang et al 2017 pan et al 2018 the ssr is defined as s s r q s σ p in which q s is the magnitude of the initial static shear stress and σ p is the final effective confining stress of the isotropically consolidated stage 4 test results and discussions 4 1 triaxial compression tests the results of the undrained triaxial compression tests are shown in fig 2 a and b in which the relationships of the axial strain ε a to the deviatoric stress q and the excess pore water pressure u are respectively provided fig 2 a indicates that all specimens exhibited strain hardening behaviours irrespective of whether they were normally consolidated or overconsolidated the strains at which the specimens reached the peak stress increased with increasing ocr value in other words the overconsolidation process increased the undrained strength of the clay fig 2 b shows that the pore pressure development trends were closer to those of the stress strain relationships for normally consolidated and slightly overconsolidated specimens for the highly overconsolidated specimens ocr 8 the pore water pressure first reached a peak and then decreased and the duration of the pore water pressure accumulation stage induced by the dilatancy of the samples was short fig 3 shows the effective stress paths in the p q plane owing to the influence of the ocr on the excess pore pressure the effective stress can be observed to exhibit very different types of behaviours according to the ocr value specifically the shapes of the effective stress paths are strongly related to the ocr they start from same origin but move to the upper left ocr 1 and 2 or right ocr 4 and 8 with an increasing deviatoric stress and effective mean principal stress until reaching their respective peak points 4 2 undrained cyclic triaxial tests 4 2 1 accumulation behaviour of total axial strain the accumulation behaviours of total axial strain ε a for all ssr values 0 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 evaluated in this study are presented in fig 4 in each subplot of the figure the ssr values are the same whereas the ocr values are varied from 1 to 2 4 and 8 overall the shapes of all the test curves are similar and the rate of total axial strain accumulation decreased significantly due to the overconsolidation process a comparison of the test results for the same ocr values but different ssr values indicates that the increase in ssr values will lead to larger total axial strains as the ssr increased the total axial strain increased whereas an increase in the ocr reduced the rate of axial strain increase furthermore for ssr 0 3 the total axial strain increased rapidly over a few thousand cycles then increased at a slower rate as the cycles continued and reached its peak value at the final strain when the ssr values were 0 4 and even 0 5 the total axial strain increased more abruptly during the initial stages of the cycling tests taking ocr 1 as an example at n 10 000 ε a for ssr 0 4 was almost three times larger 4 5 versus 1 5 than its counterparts for ssr 0 3 notably the total axial strain for ssr 0 5 and ocr 1 increased sharply with the number of cycles as shown in fig 4 e in fact due to the influence of the initial shear stress a large amount of permanent axial strain was generated in the early loading stage resulting in significant stiffness degradation and failure within 560 cycles 4 2 2 effects on the resilient deformation behaviour to study the effects of the ssr and ocr values on the deformation behaviour figs 5 and 6 present the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops at various ocr and ssr values respectively each plot in figs 5 and 6 depicts the loops at 10 100 1000 and 10 000 cycles note that the permanent axial strain has been subtracted from the diagrams in figs 5 and 6 as shown in fig 5 the range encompassed by the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops decrease with increasing ocr value fig 6 shows the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops at ssr 0 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 when ssr 0 the shapes of the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops can be observed to change inconspicuously with the number of cycles the unloading curve almost coincides with the loading curve indicating that the clay samples exhibited near linear elastic behaviour at a low initial shear stress as the value of ssr increases in fig 6 the shape of the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops gradually changes with increasing cycles and the unloading portion of the stress resilient strain curve no longer coincides with the loading portion i e the clay specimens exhibited significant visco elastic behaviour at a high initial shear stress to compare the resilient modulus m r for various ocr and ssr values the resilient modulus corresponding to each ocr or ssr were first normalised by their counterparts in cycle 10 m r 10 fig 7 a and b show the normalised resilient modulus m r n m r 10 versus the number of cycles for different ocr and ssr values respectively clearly the resilient modulus decreased as a function of the increasing number of cycles and gradually tended to a steady value after approximately 2000 cycles for all ocr and ssr values moreover the steady value of the normalised resilient modulus increased with increasing ocr values whereas it decreased with increasing ssr values fig 8 a and b show the steady value of the normalised resilient modulus m r 10000 m r 10 for different ocr and ssr values in m r 10000 m r 10 ocr and m r 10000 m r 10 log2ocr plots respectively as shown in fig 8 a the steady value of the normalised resilient modulus m r 10000 m r 10 decreased as the ssr value increased for the same ocr value thus indicating that the visco elastic behaviour of the specimens was enhanced by the increasing ssr value however fig 8 b indicates that this tendency towards visco elastic deformation was weakened by an increasing ocr value 4 2 3 accumulation behaviour of permanent axial strain to investigate the influence of the initial static shear stress on the accumulation of permanent axial strain fig 9 plots the development of permanent axial strain with the number of cycles for various ssr values at a constant ocr value in each sub graph it can be observed that the development of the permanent axial strain was very similar to that of the total axial strain at various ssr values and increased at an accelerated rate as a function of ssr considering fig 9 with an ocr 1 as an example when the ssr value increased from 0 to 0 3 with an increment of 0 3 the increase in permanent axial strain after 10 000 cycles was 0 7 from 0 4 to 1 1 in contrast when the ssr increased from 0 3 to 0 4 with an increment of 0 1 only the increase in permanent axial strain after 10 000 cycles was 2 7 from 1 1 to 3 8 it can also be observed that when the ssr was sufficiently high ssr 0 5 the permanent axial strain increased rapidly and reached the peak strain at 560 cycles as the soft marine clay is subjected to a large number of load applications 104 105 at a relatively low stress level the one way cyclic triaxial test which is purely compressive has been widely employed to study the dynamic behaviour of clays under long term traffic loading cai et al 2013 2016 wang et al 2013a b gu et al 2019 therefore in addition to the general trend of permanent axial strain development the influence of long term loading on the development of permanent axial strain should also be discussed fig 10 presents the permanent axial strain at n 1000 and n 10 000 according to ssr value for various ocr values it can be observed that when the ssr is small ssr 3 the permanent axial strain nearly reaches a steady stage after 1000 cycles taking an ssr of 0 2 and ocr of 1 as an example when the number of cycles increased from 1000 to 10 000 the increase in permanent axial strain after 1000 cycles was 0 24 from 0 69 to 0 93 indicating that the effects of long term cyclic loading are slight however when the ssr is large ssr 3 the development of permanent axial strain still follows a clearly increasing trend even after 1000 cycles taking an ssr of 0 5 and ocr of 2 as an example when the number of cycles increased from 1000 to 10 000 the increase in permanent axial strain after 1000 cycles was 1 63 from 3 94 to 5 57 indicating that the degradation of this specimen intensified and required a large number of cycles to reach its plateau therefore the effects of long term loading on the permanent deformation of soft marine clay should not be neglected and the long term deformation of soils under traffic loading cannot be effectively simulated by a limited number of cycles n 1000 fig 11 shows the development of accumulated permanent axial strain according to ssr value after 10 000 cycles at various ocr values when the ssr was less than 0 3 the development of accumulated permanent axial strain was slow and approximately linear for an ocr of 1 when the ssr exceeded 0 3 the accumulated permanent axial strain increased rapidly with an increasing number of cycles and the specimen failed after 560 cycles at a high ssr value of 0 5 indicating that a threshold ssr value may exist in this study a similar lower boundary can be found in the previous literature in which the boundary was defined as the threshold cyclic stress ratio matsui et al 1980 ansal et al 1989 meanwhile cai et al 2017 proposed a modified classification method to investigate the shakedown behaviour of saturated soft clay and the relationship between the cyclic stress ratio and the permanent axial strain in terms of stable metastable and unstable ranges in the phase of stable to metastable the strain response is slight the incremental strain cyclic stress relationship is nearly linear for each cycle the strains remain modest and the rates of increase in strain slow markedly with increasing n in the unstable phase the rates of strain development increase sharply analogously to define threshold value of ssr the permanent axial strain was determined at selected cycle numbers for various ocr values in fig 12 to reveal the relationships between the permanent axial strain and ssr for all four subplots the ε a p s s r test data generally follow a uniform pattern regardless of n or ocr in the phase of stable to metastable when ssr 0 3 the strain ssr relationship is nearly linear for the selected cycle number and the strains remain modest however in the unstable phase when ssr 0 3 the rates of strain development increase sharply therefore the threshold value of ssr is defined as the boundary of ssr between stable to metastable and unstable stage this threshold value of ssr which corresponds to the ratio above at which significant permanent axial strain development and significant stiffness degradation were observed to occur was set at 0 3 in this study to further determine the quantitative relationships between the increment of ssr and the permanent axial strain when the ssr less than the threshold value test data during the last cycle i e n 10 000 are selected for discussion to quantify the effects of the values of ssr on the permanent axial strain fig 13 plots the relationships between the permanent axial strain increments δ ε a 10000 p and the corresponding static shear stress increments δ s s r δ ε a 10000 p and δ s s r are the increases in the values of ε a p at n 10 000 and the increases in the values of ssr from a test with a smaller value of ssr to another test with a larger value of ssr but at the same ocr value fig 13 indicates that there are generally proportional relationships between δ ε a 10000 p and δ s s r for different ocr values the δ ε a 10000 p δ s s r relationships in fig 13 can be expressed as 1 for ocr 1 δ ε a 10000 p 2 81 δ s s r 2 for ocr 2 δ ε a 10000 p 2 28 δ s s r 3 for ocr 4 δ ε a 10000 p 1 29 δ s s r 4 for ocr 8 δ ε a 10000 p 1 05 δ s s r from eqs 1 4 it can be inferred that at n 10 000 one unit δ s s r 0 1 increment in ssr when ssr 0 3 will lead to increases of 281 228 129 and 105 in the permanent axial strain for ocr values of 1 2 4 and 8 respectively this finding indicates that the influence of the ssr on the accumulation of permanent axial strain can be expressed quantitatively by certain fitted equations however as ε a p at n 10 000 is used herein it should be noted that the permanent axial strain depends on not only the value of ssr but also on the value of ocr to establish a unified relationship between δ s s r and δ ε a 10000 p eqs 1 4 are plotted against the corresponding ocr values in fig 14 it indicates that the results can be computed by a unified exponential equation based on considerations of different ocr values namely 5 δ ε a 10000 p 3 1424 δ s s r o c r 0 363 based on the above discussions it is proven that the variation in the initial static shear stress may account for the increase in permanent axial strain in tests with no initial shear stress ssr 0 the permanent axial strain in the tests with the initial static shear stress 0 ssr 0 3 can be decomposed into two components namely 6 ε a 10000 p ε a s s r 0 p δ ε a 10000 p ε a s s r 0 p 3 1424 δ s s r o c r 0 363 to quantify the influence of ssr on the accumulation of permanent axial strain when the value of ssr exceeds its counterparts at threshold the permanent axial strains at selected cycle numbers i e n 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 and 10 000 in the tests for ssr values of 0 4 and 0 5 are plotted against their counterparts at the same cycle numbers for the threshold value of ssr in 0 3 respectively as shown in fig 15 it can be observed that the permanent axial strains for ssr values of 0 4 and 0 5 are generally proportional to their counterparts for an ssr value of 0 3 the ratios of the permanent axial strains for ssr values of 0 4 and 0 5 to their counterpart value of ssr in 0 3 are approximately 3 24 and 5 51 respectively this means that the increment from the threshold value of ssr yields respective increments in permanent axial strain which are approximately equal to 224 and 451 respectively the relationships between the previously calculated ratios 3 24 and 5 51 and the slope values of ssr 0 4 and 0 5 are presented in fig 16 this implies that when the value of ssr exceeds the threshold value of ssr an increment in the ssr value by one unit δ s s r 0 1 will lead to an increase in the permanent axial strain by 2 57 times the permanent axial strain obtained in the test with a threshold ssr value of 0 3 an equation for the prediction of permanent axial strain can therefore be expressed as 7 ε a p ε a s s r 0 3 p 1 2 57 s s r 0 3 0 1 4 2 4 verification of the proposed quantitative relationships fig 17 a and b first verify the accuracy of the proposed quantitative relationships between permanent axial strain and ssr in eqs 6 and 7 respectively by comparison of the predicted values with the measured test data moreover a series of contrast tests were conducted to further verify the accuracy of eqs 6 and 7 the details describing the contrast tests are provided in table 4 the resulting predicted values from eqs 6 and 7 are compared with data of the contrast test in fig 18 as can be observed in figs 17 and 18 the predicted results agree well with the test data implying the proposed quantitative relationships provide generally suitable prediction capabilities 5 conclusions in this study a series of cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on overconsolidated soft marine clay to investigate the accumulation of the axial strain additional tests at various initial static shear stresses have also been conducted the following conclusions are inferred 1 the development of the total axial strain depends on the ssr and ocr values as the ssr increased the total axial strain increased while the increase in ocr reduced the rate of total axial strain increase 2 the shapes of the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops and their development with the number of cycles were found to respectively depend on the ocr and ssr values the area encompassed by the stress resilient strain loop decreased with increasing ocr whereas it increased with increasing ssr furthermore the steady value of the normalised resilient modulus decreased as the value of ssr increased 3 a threshold ssr was obtained from the accumulated permanent axial strain in each test according to the ssr value when the ssr was less than the threshold value a small peak value of the permanent axial strain was maintained when the ssr exceeded the threshold value the permanent axial strain increased more rapidly and the peak value even approached the failure strain 4 when the ssr less than the threshold value the increments in permanent axial strain at n 10 000 were proportional to the increments in ssr a quantitative relationship between the increments in ssr and the increments in permanent axial strain considering different ocr values was established 5 for both the normally consolidated and overconsolidated specimens in which the ssr exceeded the threshold value the accumulation of permanent axial strain accelerated considerably with increasing ssr increments in the value of ssr value by one unit led to increments that were equal to 2 57 times the permanent axial strains obtained in the test ssr 0 3 credit authorship contribution statement jun wang conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

measured by a load transducer mounted on the top of the cell the axial strain was monitored and measured by a highly sensitive linear variable displacement transducer and the pore pressure was measured by a highly accurate transducer that connected the top and base drainages through short stiff tubes with the enforcement of enhanced control and measurement precision as well as the use of a powerful real time data acquisition function this apparatus enabled long term cyclic loading tests at different loading frequencies 3 2 test procedures all samples were trimmed to cylindrical specimens with diameters of 50 mm and lengths of 100 mm and were then mounted in the triaxial cell then a back pressure of 200 kpa and a confining pressure of 220 kpa were applied until the b values became larger than 0 97 indicating that the specimen was fully saturated each specimen was then initially subjected to a pre consolidation pressure of σ oc ocr 100 kpa until the volumetric strain fell below 0 36 min after the completion of pre consolidation the effective confining pressure was reduced to σ p 100 kpa to produce overconsolidated specimens with ocr values of 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 the conditions of the monotonic triaxial tests are summarised in table 2 a series of monotonic triaxial undrained shear tests were conducted with the various ocrs all monotonic tests applied a controlled axial strain rate of 0 05 min and stopped at an axial strain of 10 the cyclic triaxial test programmes are summarised in table 3 in these tests the cyclic deviatoric stress q cyc was superimposed on the initial static shear stress q s at a frequency of 1 hz the loading waves and stress conditions in the cyclic triaxial tests are schematically presented in fig 1 to compare the cyclic behaviour of clay samples with various initial static shear stresses the initial shear stress ratio ssr was selected to serve as the normalised parameter as shown in many previous studies yang et al 2017 pan et al 2018 the ssr is defined as s s r q s σ p in which q s is the magnitude of the initial static shear stress and σ p is the final effective confining stress of the isotropically consolidated stage 4 test results and discussions 4 1 triaxial compression tests the results of the undrained triaxial compression tests are shown in fig 2 a and b in which the relationships of the axial strain ε a to the deviatoric stress q and the excess pore water pressure u are respectively provided fig 2 a indicates that all specimens exhibited strain hardening behaviours irrespective of whether they were normally consolidated or overconsolidated the strains at which the specimens reached the peak stress increased with increasing ocr value in other words the overconsolidation process increased the undrained strength of the clay fig 2 b shows that the pore pressure development trends were closer to those of the stress strain relationships for normally consolidated and slightly overconsolidated specimens for the highly overconsolidated specimens ocr 8 the pore water pressure first reached a peak and then decreased and the duration of the pore water pressure accumulation stage induced by the dilatancy of the samples was short fig 3 shows the effective stress paths in the p q plane owing to the influence of the ocr on the excess pore pressure the effective stress can be observed to exhibit very different types of behaviours according to the ocr value specifically the shapes of the effective stress paths are strongly related to the ocr they start from same origin but move to the upper left ocr 1 and 2 or right ocr 4 and 8 with an increasing deviatoric stress and effective mean principal stress until reaching their respective peak points 4 2 undrained cyclic triaxial tests 4 2 1 accumulation behaviour of total axial strain the accumulation behaviours of total axial strain ε a for all ssr values 0 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 evaluated in this study are presented in fig 4 in each subplot of the figure the ssr values are the same whereas the ocr values are varied from 1 to 2 4 and 8 overall the shapes of all the test curves are similar and the rate of total axial strain accumulation decreased significantly due to the overconsolidation process a comparison of the test results for the same ocr values but different ssr values indicates that the increase in ssr values will lead to larger total axial strains as the ssr increased the total axial strain increased whereas an increase in the ocr reduced the rate of axial strain increase furthermore for ssr 0 3 the total axial strain increased rapidly over a few thousand cycles then increased at a slower rate as the cycles continued and reached its peak value at the final strain when the ssr values were 0 4 and even 0 5 the total axial strain increased more abruptly during the initial stages of the cycling tests taking ocr 1 as an example at n 10 000 ε a for ssr 0 4 was almost three times larger 4 5 versus 1 5 than its counterparts for ssr 0 3 notably the total axial strain for ssr 0 5 and ocr 1 increased sharply with the number of cycles as shown in fig 4 e in fact due to the influence of the initial shear stress a large amount of permanent axial strain was generated in the early loading stage resulting in significant stiffness degradation and failure within 560 cycles 4 2 2 effects on the resilient deformation behaviour to study the effects of the ssr and ocr values on the deformation behaviour figs 5 and 6 present the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops at various ocr and ssr values respectively each plot in figs 5 and 6 depicts the loops at 10 100 1000 and 10 000 cycles note that the permanent axial strain has been subtracted from the diagrams in figs 5 and 6 as shown in fig 5 the range encompassed by the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops decrease with increasing ocr value fig 6 shows the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops at ssr 0 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 when ssr 0 the shapes of the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops can be observed to change inconspicuously with the number of cycles the unloading curve almost coincides with the loading curve indicating that the clay samples exhibited near linear elastic behaviour at a low initial shear stress as the value of ssr increases in fig 6 the shape of the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops gradually changes with increasing cycles and the unloading portion of the stress resilient strain curve no longer coincides with the loading portion i e the clay specimens exhibited significant visco elastic behaviour at a high initial shear stress to compare the resilient modulus m r for various ocr and ssr values the resilient modulus corresponding to each ocr or ssr were first normalised by their counterparts in cycle 10 m r 10 fig 7 a and b show the normalised resilient modulus m r n m r 10 versus the number of cycles for different ocr and ssr values respectively clearly the resilient modulus decreased as a function of the increasing number of cycles and gradually tended to a steady value after approximately 2000 cycles for all ocr and ssr values moreover the steady value of the normalised resilient modulus increased with increasing ocr values whereas it decreased with increasing ssr values fig 8 a and b show the steady value of the normalised resilient modulus m r 10000 m r 10 for different ocr and ssr values in m r 10000 m r 10 ocr and m r 10000 m r 10 log2ocr plots respectively as shown in fig 8 a the steady value of the normalised resilient modulus m r 10000 m r 10 decreased as the ssr value increased for the same ocr value thus indicating that the visco elastic behaviour of the specimens was enhanced by the increasing ssr value however fig 8 b indicates that this tendency towards visco elastic deformation was weakened by an increasing ocr value 4 2 3 accumulation behaviour of permanent axial strain to investigate the influence of the initial static shear stress on the accumulation of permanent axial strain fig 9 plots the development of permanent axial strain with the number of cycles for various ssr values at a constant ocr value in each sub graph it can be observed that the development of the permanent axial strain was very similar to that of the total axial strain at various ssr values and increased at an accelerated rate as a function of ssr considering fig 9 with an ocr 1 as an example when the ssr value increased from 0 to 0 3 with an increment of 0 3 the increase in permanent axial strain after 10 000 cycles was 0 7 from 0 4 to 1 1 in contrast when the ssr increased from 0 3 to 0 4 with an increment of 0 1 only the increase in permanent axial strain after 10 000 cycles was 2 7 from 1 1 to 3 8 it can also be observed that when the ssr was sufficiently high ssr 0 5 the permanent axial strain increased rapidly and reached the peak strain at 560 cycles as the soft marine clay is subjected to a large number of load applications 104 105 at a relatively low stress level the one way cyclic triaxial test which is purely compressive has been widely employed to study the dynamic behaviour of clays under long term traffic loading cai et al 2013 2016 wang et al 2013a b gu et al 2019 therefore in addition to the general trend of permanent axial strain development the influence of long term loading on the development of permanent axial strain should also be discussed fig 10 presents the permanent axial strain at n 1000 and n 10 000 according to ssr value for various ocr values it can be observed that when the ssr is small ssr 3 the permanent axial strain nearly reaches a steady stage after 1000 cycles taking an ssr of 0 2 and ocr of 1 as an example when the number of cycles increased from 1000 to 10 000 the increase in permanent axial strain after 1000 cycles was 0 24 from 0 69 to 0 93 indicating that the effects of long term cyclic loading are slight however when the ssr is large ssr 3 the development of permanent axial strain still follows a clearly increasing trend even after 1000 cycles taking an ssr of 0 5 and ocr of 2 as an example when the number of cycles increased from 1000 to 10 000 the increase in permanent axial strain after 1000 cycles was 1 63 from 3 94 to 5 57 indicating that the degradation of this specimen intensified and required a large number of cycles to reach its plateau therefore the effects of long term loading on the permanent deformation of soft marine clay should not be neglected and the long term deformation of soils under traffic loading cannot be effectively simulated by a limited number of cycles n 1000 fig 11 shows the development of accumulated permanent axial strain according to ssr value after 10 000 cycles at various ocr values when the ssr was less than 0 3 the development of accumulated permanent axial strain was slow and approximately linear for an ocr of 1 when the ssr exceeded 0 3 the accumulated permanent axial strain increased rapidly with an increasing number of cycles and the specimen failed after 560 cycles at a high ssr value of 0 5 indicating that a threshold ssr value may exist in this study a similar lower boundary can be found in the previous literature in which the boundary was defined as the threshold cyclic stress ratio matsui et al 1980 ansal et al 1989 meanwhile cai et al 2017 proposed a modified classification method to investigate the shakedown behaviour of saturated soft clay and the relationship between the cyclic stress ratio and the permanent axial strain in terms of stable metastable and unstable ranges in the phase of stable to metastable the strain response is slight the incremental strain cyclic stress relationship is nearly linear for each cycle the strains remain modest and the rates of increase in strain slow markedly with increasing n in the unstable phase the rates of strain development increase sharply analogously to define threshold value of ssr the permanent axial strain was determined at selected cycle numbers for various ocr values in fig 12 to reveal the relationships between the permanent axial strain and ssr for all four subplots the ε a p s s r test data generally follow a uniform pattern regardless of n or ocr in the phase of stable to metastable when ssr 0 3 the strain ssr relationship is nearly linear for the selected cycle number and the strains remain modest however in the unstable phase when ssr 0 3 the rates of strain development increase sharply therefore the threshold value of ssr is defined as the boundary of ssr between stable to metastable and unstable stage this threshold value of ssr which corresponds to the ratio above at which significant permanent axial strain development and significant stiffness degradation were observed to occur was set at 0 3 in this study to further determine the quantitative relationships between the increment of ssr and the permanent axial strain when the ssr less than the threshold value test data during the last cycle i e n 10 000 are selected for discussion to quantify the effects of the values of ssr on the permanent axial strain fig 13 plots the relationships between the permanent axial strain increments δ ε a 10000 p and the corresponding static shear stress increments δ s s r δ ε a 10000 p and δ s s r are the increases in the values of ε a p at n 10 000 and the increases in the values of ssr from a test with a smaller value of ssr to another test with a larger value of ssr but at the same ocr value fig 13 indicates that there are generally proportional relationships between δ ε a 10000 p and δ s s r for different ocr values the δ ε a 10000 p δ s s r relationships in fig 13 can be expressed as 1 for ocr 1 δ ε a 10000 p 2 81 δ s s r 2 for ocr 2 δ ε a 10000 p 2 28 δ s s r 3 for ocr 4 δ ε a 10000 p 1 29 δ s s r 4 for ocr 8 δ ε a 10000 p 1 05 δ s s r from eqs 1 4 it can be inferred that at n 10 000 one unit δ s s r 0 1 increment in ssr when ssr 0 3 will lead to increases of 281 228 129 and 105 in the permanent axial strain for ocr values of 1 2 4 and 8 respectively this finding indicates that the influence of the ssr on the accumulation of permanent axial strain can be expressed quantitatively by certain fitted equations however as ε a p at n 10 000 is used herein it should be noted that the permanent axial strain depends on not only the value of ssr but also on the value of ocr to establish a unified relationship between δ s s r and δ ε a 10000 p eqs 1 4 are plotted against the corresponding ocr values in fig 14 it indicates that the results can be computed by a unified exponential equation based on considerations of different ocr values namely 5 δ ε a 10000 p 3 1424 δ s s r o c r 0 363 based on the above discussions it is proven that the variation in the initial static shear stress may account for the increase in permanent axial strain in tests with no initial shear stress ssr 0 the permanent axial strain in the tests with the initial static shear stress 0 ssr 0 3 can be decomposed into two components namely 6 ε a 10000 p ε a s s r 0 p δ ε a 10000 p ε a s s r 0 p 3 1424 δ s s r o c r 0 363 to quantify the influence of ssr on the accumulation of permanent axial strain when the value of ssr exceeds its counterparts at threshold the permanent axial strains at selected cycle numbers i e n 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 and 10 000 in the tests for ssr values of 0 4 and 0 5 are plotted against their counterparts at the same cycle numbers for the threshold value of ssr in 0 3 respectively as shown in fig 15 it can be observed that the permanent axial strains for ssr values of 0 4 and 0 5 are generally proportional to their counterparts for an ssr value of 0 3 the ratios of the permanent axial strains for ssr values of 0 4 and 0 5 to their counterpart value of ssr in 0 3 are approximately 3 24 and 5 51 respectively this means that the increment from the threshold value of ssr yields respective increments in permanent axial strain which are approximately equal to 224 and 451 respectively the relationships between the previously calculated ratios 3 24 and 5 51 and the slope values of ssr 0 4 and 0 5 are presented in fig 16 this implies that when the value of ssr exceeds the threshold value of ssr an increment in the ssr value by one unit δ s s r 0 1 will lead to an increase in the permanent axial strain by 2 57 times the permanent axial strain obtained in the test with a threshold ssr value of 0 3 an equation for the prediction of permanent axial strain can therefore be expressed as 7 ε a p ε a s s r 0 3 p 1 2 57 s s r 0 3 0 1 4 2 4 verification of the proposed quantitative relationships fig 17 a and b first verify the accuracy of the proposed quantitative relationships between permanent axial strain and ssr in eqs 6 and 7 respectively by comparison of the predicted values with the measured test data moreover a series of contrast tests were conducted to further verify the accuracy of eqs 6 and 7 the details describing the contrast tests are provided in table 4 the resulting predicted values from eqs 6 and 7 are compared with data of the contrast test in fig 18 as can be observed in figs 17 and 18 the predicted results agree well with the test data implying the proposed quantitative relationships provide generally suitable prediction capabilities 5 conclusions in this study a series of cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on overconsolidated soft marine clay to investigate the accumulation of the axial strain additional tests at various initial static shear stresses have also been conducted the following conclusions are inferred 1 the development of the total axial strain depends on the ssr and ocr values as the ssr increased the total axial strain increased while the increase in ocr reduced the rate of total axial strain increase 2 the shapes of the stress resilient strain hysteretic loops and their development with the number of cycles were found to respectively depend on the ocr and ssr values the area encompassed by the stress resilient strain loop decreased with increasing ocr whereas it increased with increasing ssr furthermore the steady value of the normalised resilient modulus decreased as the value of ssr increased 3 a threshold ssr was obtained from the accumulated permanent axial strain in each test according to the ssr value when the ssr was less than the threshold value a small peak value of the permanent axial strain was maintained when the ssr exceeded the threshold value the permanent axial strain increased more rapidly and the peak value even approached the failure strain 4 when the ssr less than the threshold value the increments in permanent axial strain at n 10 000 were proportional to the increments in ssr a quantitative relationship between the increments in ssr and the increments in permanent axial strain considering different ocr values was established 5 for both the normally consolidated and overconsolidated specimens in which the ssr exceeded the threshold value the accumulation of permanent axial strain accelerated considerably with increasing ssr increments in the value of ssr value by one unit led to increments that were equal to 2 57 times the permanent axial strains obtained in the test ssr 0 3 credit authorship contribution statement jun wang conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

20986,we present an experimental numerical study on air entrainment and the statistics of air bubbles in plunging breaking waves in surf zones on a beach in the experimental investigation the evolution numbers and sizes of air bubbles in breaking waves are recorded the relations are discussed between microscopic behaviors of these air bubbles and influential macrocopic factors including distance to the wave breaking point wave height water depth and depth of measurement empirical expressions for bubble sizes are formulated as functions of these factors base on three dimensional high resolution air bubble resolving numerical modeling a further study is conducted on details of the fields of velocity vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy it is conjectured with evidence that the number of bubbles is linearly correlated to turbulence kinetic energy within breaking waves the multiscale physical phenomena and correlations between air bubbles behaviors and their influential factors revealed in this study shed light on understanding and quantifying air bubbles characteristics in breaking waves within surf zones keywords surf zones plunging breaking wave air bubble size and number of bubbles openfoam 1 introduction as waves propagate from open seas to coastlines they experience a complex nonlinear hydrodynamic process of evolution and breaking in reaction to changes in water depth topography and other factors this process involves various phenomena including wave energy transfer sediment transport sound generation and water gas exchange hoque and aoki 2005 merlivat and memery 1983 melville 1996 jiang et al 2011 in such a process air entrains into breaking waves in surf zones and a large number of air bubbles are generated in water in addition the flow becomes multiscale in nature the waves and bubbles occur at different temporal and spatial scales but interact with each other in order to understand the hydrodynamic process it is crucially important to study air entrainment and characteristics of the resulting air bubbles in surf zones bubble induced turbulence and air water interaction are two important features in wave breaking and air entrainment in surf zones and they have been investigated mostly in vertical bubble column reactors schäfer et al 2002 ekambara and dhotre 2010 however the bubble induced turbulence is strong and complicated in realistic situations and they cannot be well represented by that within these bubble columns for instance during wave breaking an overturning turbulent jet is formed at the crest of a wave which is a common feature of spilling and plunging breakers and the associated turbulence is very different from that in a bubble column hoque and aoki 2005 hoque 2008 as to the air water interaction in wave breaking investigations have been carried out via numerical simulation physical model experiment and occasionally field observation chanson et al 2002 medwin 1970 johnson and cooke 1979 terrill et al 2001 for instance field observations are conducted on the effects of wind speed and water density on numbers and sizes of air bubbles and correlation is presented between probability density of numbers and sizes of the bubbles johnson and cooke 1979 terrill et al 2001 blanchard and woodcock 2016 it is reported that bubble behaviors in freshwater and seawater exhibit certain but minimal difference and a main difference is that more tiny bubbles in the form of foam form on water surface in the latter cartmill and su 1993 blenkinsopp and chaplin 2011 high precision instruments including those based on acoustic techniques laser methods and optical fiber probes lead to a new avenue to study of wave breaking and the associated air entrainment in more realistic situations and these instruments have become increasingly popular in related research for example the void fraction of bubble plumes under action of different types of breakers has been measured with the aid of such instruments lamarre and melville 1994 deane and stokes 2002 rojas and loewen 2007 rojas and loewen 2010 in investigation of energy dissipation caused by bubble entrainment in plunging waves it is found that the energy attenuation is related to wave height and distance to wave breaking point hoque and aoki 2008 2014 furthermore studies suggest that the process of bubble entrainment may lead to a rise in water surface elevation in a nearshore swash zone the sizes of bubbles generated by wave breaking are measured using optical fiber probes and it is revealed that the sizes decrease with distance to wave breaking points blenkinsopp and chaplin 2010 2011 a flow field of multi bubble regions is recorded using particle image velocity piv and bubble image velocity biv and the result indicates that from 54 to 85 of the wave energy is dissipated within one to two wavelength ranges lim et al 2015 in a laboratory experiment it is shown that the maximum void fraction is 20 the bubble size could reach 20 mm and the dissipated energy caused by bubbles in a swash zone accounts for about 1 of the total energy dai et al 2017 in recent years advanced high accuracy two phase numerical flow models have become available to explore breaking waves liu and lin 2008 wang et al 2016 biausser et al 2003 ketabdari et al 2008 guignard et al 2001 these models can effectively make up for the aforementioned insufficiencies of experimental measurements for example a two dimensional 2d volume of fluid vof method is used to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves impinging a bridge deck and generation of air bubbles is captured at its girders immersed in water qu et al 2017 the coherent interaction between a three dimensional 3d vortex structure and air bubbles within plunging waves is visualized by simulation with fine grids lubin and glockner 2015 the relationship between tiny vortex filament structures and bubbles droplets and splashes in breaking waves is studied using a 3d high resolution grid wang et al 2016 in a modeling study a bubble size distribution is divided into two sections described by power exponential functions associated with the hinze scale hinze and shell 1955 the length scale and the hinze scale of the bubble formation are obtained using a 3d direct numerical simulation deike et al 2016 a formula is presented to statistically estimate the total volume of air entrained by a single breaking wave deike et al 2017 in spite of the progresses listed above our understanding of air bubbles in breaking waves is preliminary and challenges remain in research of them particularly still it is impossible to directly measure some aspects of flow fields such as vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy derakhti and james 2014 as indicated by jia 2009 and kikkert et al 2012 there is difficulty in synchronization of measurement devices and this results in inaccuracy of measured data and even unpredictable uncertainties wang et al 2016 additionally research of air bubbles by numerical simulation also encounters difficulties stemming from limitations of numerical methods as well as computing power moreover air bubble phenomena within breaking waves are multiscale in nature and such nature adds more challenges to reliable simulation as a result although it started more than a decade ago e g mori et al 2007 research on air bubbles on beaches is limited and there is lack of detailed simulation on evolution of wave breaking and air entrainment as well as quantitative analysis on the flow fields and bubbles in this study we are motivated to make an effort to advance our understanding of air bubble behaviors and revealing quantitative relations of them by filling knowledge gaps discussed in above paragraph particularly this work studies air bubbles within plunging breaking waves in surf zones on a slope in a flume and with complementary experimental and numerical data it seeks a clear comprehensive illustration on the onset growing and decaying of air bubbles in this paper for the first time the relations are investigated between the numbers as well as sizes of air bubbles in plunging breaking waves on a beach and their influential factors including distance from breaking point wave height and water depth as a further step from the literature showing that the porosity of water flow is correlated to turbulence kinetic energy evidence is presented for a correlation between numbers of air bubbles and turbulence kinetic energy such evidence may serve as a start point for future research on water gas exchange and wave energy dissipation due to action of wave breaking 2 experimental and numerical methods 2 1 laboratory setup measurement and data repeatability we carry out the laboratory experiment in a wave flume of the key laboratory of water sediment sciences and water disaster prevention of hunan province at the changsha university of science and technology as shown in fig 1 the flume is 45 m in length 0 5 m in width and 0 8 m in height the left end of the wave flume is an absorbing flap type wavemaker and its right end is a 1 10 toughened glass beach representing coastal beach topography the side walls of the flume are transparent toughened glass during the experiment tap water was used and water temperature and room temperature were controlled to be about 20 c and 25 c respectively a cartesian coordinate system x y z is set up with its origin at the center of the toe the x direction towards the beach the y direction into the paper not shown in the figure and the z direction pointing upwards fig 1 as seen in fig 1 a particle image velocimeter piv system shangshui china 50 hz is located at x 2 2 m movable in z direction to measure the velocity distribution at specific locations the piv system consists of a high speed ccd camera zyla 4 2 plus andor to capture images of the flows and a double pulsed laser ksp2000 kingder to illuminate the uprush of water from the bottom of the flume seeding particles silver coated hollow neutrally buoyant glass spheres with a median diameter of 15 μm are added into the water for better illumination pairs of images are recorded by the camera with a resolution of 2560 2160 pixels the two images in each pair are separated in time by 1 ms and the frequency of the pair sampling is set at 50 hz the velocity profiles are obtained section by section in areas with 50 overlap and final interrogation areas of 32 32 or 16 16 pixels from the piv image pairs via an adaptive cross correlation algorithm using three iterative steps meanwhile another high speed camera fastcam mini ux100 germany 4000 hz is placed at x 2 5 m to capture the processes of wave breaking and bubble entrainment in addition four ultrasonic wave gauges uwg1 uwg4 uls 80d germany 50 hz are used to record the evolution of free water surfaces fig 1 uwg1 uwg2 uwg3 and uwg4 are installed at x 1 5 0 1 2 2 61 m respectively according to the manufacturer liu et al 2018 the error of the ultrasonic wave gauges is less than 3 10 4 m with regard to water surface additionally in measurements the water level is recorded every 0 02 s providing a high temporal resolution an air bubble measurement system b pop a2 photonic sensors company france with an l shaped optical fiber probe as its sensor is used to measure the number of air bubbles in water the probe sits on a measuring rack that may move up and down and left and right in the measurement as a bubble touches the tip of the optical fiber probe its surface is broken by the probe causing the voltage signal in system to rise see stage 1 2 in fig 2 when the fiber probe is completely inside the bubble the voltage remains as a constant see stage 2 3 as the fiber probe passes through the other side of the bubble s surface the voltage decreases rapidly see stage 3 4 utilizing temporal history of such signal air bubble numbers their sizes void fraction etc can be determined b pop a2 photonic sensors company france the measured void fraction c is determined as the ratio of the time duration when the fiber probe is within a bubble e g stage 2 3 in fig 2 over the total time the details of the principle and the measurement method are available in the literature dai et al 2017 a2 photonic sensors 2015 the probe is able to measure bubble velocities between 0 06 m s and 6 25 m s and detect bubbles with diameters larger than 100 μm the local void fraction becomes reliable when the typical bubble size is above 2 mm which will be the case in this study it is estimated the maximum error in ensemble averaged quantities such as diameters and sizes of bubbles is less than 6 and such error decreases as the number for the average increases more specifics of the a2 photonic sensors are given in pjontek et al 2014 in each experimental run regular waves are continuously generated as incident waves for 300 s and wave breaking is created at specific water depth h wave height h and wave period t the corresponding wave length l is determined using the dispersion equation based on the linear wave theory l g t 2 2 π tanh k h g is the gravity and k is the wave number this study deals with five cases that are combinations of different flow parameters as summarized in table 1 according to the types of wave breaking can be judged by the irribarren number galvin 1968 ξ 0 i h l i is the beach slope and wave breaking is of plunging wave when 0 5 ξ 0 3 3 in all of the five cases ξ 0 is within this range and therefore plunging waves occur in all of them which is confirmed in the observation by the high speed camera in the experiment discussed hereafter fig 7 in these five cases the values of h land h l indicate a finite water depth and mild wave steepness to study the physical phenomena as detailed and clearly as possible the five cases are designed so that under the condition for waves plunge and break on the slope they cover ranges of the experimental parameters water depth wave height as large as permitted by the laboratory settings case 1 2 and 3 reflect the influence of wave height and case 2 4 and 5 bear effect of water depth in the experiment the air void fraction in water body is measured in increments of 5 cm and 1 cm in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively as seen in the zoom in in fig 1 in this study a synchronous system a software package developed by us is adopted to control all instruments and equipment so the data are collected synchronously in air bubble detection measurements are taken at as many points as possible around locations of wave breaking to accurately determine their shapes in view of the randomness in wave breaking and air entrainment each data water surface elevation a number of air bubbles is obtained from an ensemble average value of multiple measurements to reduce its uncertainties tests have been carried out to check the repeatability and stability of equipment and instruments including the wavemaker the ultrasonic wave gauges and the bubble measurement system to ensure the authenticity and validity of the measured data firstly repeatability of the wavemaker and wave gauges is checked via five repeated experimental runs fig 3 shows the measurements of five runs at uwg1 x 1 5 m under condition of case 2 and it is seen from the figure that the measured time series of water surface η in the five runs are basically coincident with each other their maximum deviation is 3 41 and the average deviation is 1 00 secondly stability of the bubble measurement system is examined the void fraction at a same location and under same wave conditions is measured three times in each experimental run the wave making is on for 300 s and the optical fiber probe acquisition instrument is triggered at 60 s after the start of the wave making the sampling time is 180 s about 100 waves measured results of void fraction in three repeated experimental runs of case 2 are shown in fig 4 it is seen from the figure that the measurements of void fraction are close the largest deviation of the 1st 2nd and 3rd measurements to the average of them is 4 44 4 25 and 4 43 respectively therefore although the measured data exhibit certain level of discrepancy they are all considered repeatable and within the error ranges of the instruments 2 2 numerical models and validation an openfoam code is used to simulate the flow of air water mixture in this study https www openfoam com and it is based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t x j u i u j 1 ρ p x i g i 1 ρ τ i j r x j x j v u i x j σ κ ρ α x i where i j 1 2 3 t is the time x i is the cartesian coordinate u i is the corresponding velocity component in the coordinate system p is the pressure ρ is the density g i is the acceleration of gravity σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is curvature of the interface and α is the computed volume fraction the overline indicates an ensemble average value ν is kinematic viscosity which is dynamic viscosity μ divided by density and it is determined by the chosen turbulence model τ i j r is a sub grid stress term ρ u i u j ρ u i u j and it is closed as τ i j r 2 ρ v t s i j δ i j τ k k r 3 with s i j being the strain rate respectively in this work a delayed detached eddy approach s a ddes spalart et al 2006 is selected to for the closure this approach deals with a boundary layer region and the region away from it using a model based on the rans equations and another model based on a large eddy simulation les technique respectively the combination of two different turbulence models is realized effectively with a smooth transition between them spalart et al 2006 the solutions of eqs 1 and 2 include velocity u i pressure p turbulence kinetic energy k u i u i 2 u i being fluctuating velocity and repeat indices indicating summation etc a vof method is used to capture free surfaces of water this method introduces the volume fraction α with α 1 representing water phase α 0 standing for air phase and 0 α 1 referring to a water air interface the equation for the volume fraction is 3 α t α u j x j x j α 1 α u j r 0 the last term on the left side of eq 3 is an artificial compression term and the new introduced u j r is a velocity field greenshields 2015 which is used to compress the interface such an extra term effectively ensures that the solution of the equation is bounded near the air water interface and it has no influence on flows away from it it is straightforward to calculate any of the properties of the fluid in each cell just by weighting them by the volume fraction weller et al 1998 for example density or viscosity of the cell is computed as ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ a or μ α μ w 1 α μ a respectively a finite volume method is used to discretize eqs 1 and 2 in the 3d computational space and an euler method is adopted for their discretization in time the convection term of the equations is discretized by a gauss linear upwind scheme the pressure gradient term by a gauss linear discrete algorithm and the laplace term by a gauss linear corrected method the pimple algorithm piso simple merging algorithm is used to solve the resulting algebraic equations kissling et al 2010 eq 3 is discretized using a gauss muscl scheme for its convection term and a gauss surface compression scheme for its artificial compression term weller 2008 a wave making method is adopted to correct velocity at the entrance of the flume jacobsen et al 2012 a section of the flume is selected as the computational domain as shown in fig 1 which ranges in 33 m x 6 m 0 m y 0 25 m half of the flume and 0 m z 0 8 m wave generation condition is set at the left end symmetry boundary condition is used on the two lateral sides and no slip wall condition is adopted at the channel bottom on the beach and the right end mesh resolution of 2 mm in x y and z direction is adopted in the whole computational domain the total number of grid nodes is about 975 millions the time step δt is adjusted adaptively according courant number c f l δ t u i δ x 0 25 δ t indicates the time step δ x is the scale of the velocity direction grid cell during the computation further adjustments and refinements of the mesh and time step have been tested but no obvious difference in the numerical solutions is observed which implies that the solutions are independent of mesh and time step at above values other parameters in the numerical model are listed in table 2 as seen in fig 5 the measurement and the simulation present very similar evolutions of water surfaces at the four locations of uwgs the skill number is used to quantify their coincidence which is computed as willmott 2013 4 s 1 η num η exp 2 η num η exp η exp η exp 2 where subscript num and exp represent the numerical and experimental value respectively and overline standards for averge value the closer the simulated and measured data the closer the skill number to one as shown in the caption of the figure the skill number is close to one at all locations except the one at uwg4 x 2 61 m which is attributed to the fact that a large number of splashes occur at this location which affects the accuracy of the instrument fig 6 shows the velocity profiles computed by the numerical code and recorded by the piv instrument at three locations the results in the figure show that both horizontal velocity u and vertical velocity w produced by the code are consistent with those measured ones which demonstrates that the code is able to reliably capture the velocity profiles in breaking waves 3 experimental results 3 1 onset and evolution of bubbles fig 7 presents instant images recorded by the high speed camera in case 2 and it illustrates the formation and transport processes of bubbles within breaking waves in general these air bubbles mostly come from air initially above the waves and the processes of their formation and transport start from its entrainment into the waves as seen in fig 7 at t 0 s the water jet just plunges onto the surface of water in its front and it entrains a large amount of air to form an elliptic air cavity at t 0 05 s as the cavity rolls clockwise and forward the water jet continuously pours onto the water surface and generates a large number of splashing water drops at t 0 2 s while the air cavity keeps rolling it is elongated disintegrated and then broken at this time a number of small bubbles at different sizes have formed behind the roller and they travel forward with the roller moreover due to a secondary breaking of the wave air is entrained and a new air cavity is created at t 0 3 s the newly created air cavity has broken completely and this generates an air water mixture with high concentration of air bubbles that keep aggregating and breaking in the water at t 0 4 s many bubbles have arisen to the water surface and escaped into the air and the water surface gradually becomes calm as t 1 6 s the water surface evolves into a stage ready for the onset of the next cycle of wave breaking in view that air bubbles mostly come from the air initially above water surfaces of the waves it is expected that the amount of air entrained into the waves play an important role in wave breaking and behaviors of the bubbles it is a challenging task to accurately evaluate the entrained air mass both in laboratory experiments for instance only one probe is available to record air bubbles in the experiment of this study a numerical approach for a rough estimate may be possible by evaluation of the change in water volume that contains the air bubbles 3 2 quantity of bubbles fig 8 shows the distributions of air bubbles numbers within breaking waves which include the results in all five cases listed in table 1 here the number of bubbles n is the average number of bubbles passing through the bubble probe per second the measurement depth d is the vertical distance from water surface to the probe a general trend in the figure is that the closer to the water surface a location is the more bubbles there are fig 8a depicts distributions of bubble numbers along horizontal distance as seen in this figure when x x b l 0 17 the numbers of bubbles gradually increase with the distance from the breaking location as x x b l 0 17 the numbers decrease slightly with the distance fig 8b indicates that with the increase of h h the numbers of bubbles increase fig 8c shows that the variation of the distributions of bubble numbers with water depth behaves differently at different measurement depths at the smaller measurement depths the bubble number keeps decreasing with value of h gt 2 while at the two larger measurement depth it has a minimum at h gt 2 0 014 the results in fig 8 indicate that the influential factors on the numbers of bubbles in breaking waves are distance from the breaking points wave height and water depth as a general understanding a larger number of air bubbles mean a higher value of void fraction c and this is indeed the case in the experiment see fig 9 which results from the data of all the five cases the figure shows that as a general trend the number of air bubbles is positively correlated to the void fraction 3 3 bubble sizes in order to characterize bubble sizes their probability density function pdf is presented in particular the measurements of bubble size d in all of the five cases are plotted as a cumulative probability density function cdf and then the pdf is derived from the cdf as shown in fig 10 in this figure lines of power 1 and 2 denote the exponent of a power function or the spectral slope ss and they are included for reference it is seen from the figure that in comparison with the two lines of power the pdf of the bubble size essentially follows a power law distribution with a spectral slope ss between 1 and 2 when each of x x b l h h and h gt 2 changes the exponent of the power law in the pdf of bubble sizes is computed as the slope of the bubble size distributions in fig 10 and then plotted in fig 11 it is seen in the figure that the power exponent ss takes values between 1 4 and 1 more specifically ss decreases with x x b l and h h however it increases with h gt 2 or water depth it is noted that in an earlier study in mori et al 2007 a range of 1 5 1 7 for ss is presented and the difference between this range and that in this paper i e 1 4 1 may be attributed to the effects of water depth in comparison to that in mori et al 2007 the water is more shallow in this study and thus the sizes of bubbles are subject to influence to beach surface which is a future topic worth studying additionally it is noted that sizes of air bubbles over wave breakers a setting different from that of this paper are also related to distance to breaking location blenkinsopp and chaplin 2010 2011 let τ be the time of an air bubble to pass the fiber proble in view of the method to measure air bubbles in sec 2 1 it is known that c nτ t using mean values for c and n in figs 9 and 11 respectively it is estimated that τ t c n 0 1 10 0 01 this indicates that τ and t which are respectively the representative scale of the bubble behaviors and the wave motion are different by two magnitude orders moreover it is seen in fig 10 that the bubble sizes are in the range of 2 60 mm note that there may be smaller bubbles that are not resolvable by the instruments additionally as seen in table 1 the sizes of the background flows such as water depth and wave length are at the order of meter in magnitude as a result the air bubbles and the background flows exist and evolve at different temporal and spatial scales the former occur at small scales and the latter bear relatively large scales as a result figs 10 and 11 present a relation between microscopic bubbles and macroscopic background flows unveiling an aspect of a phenomenon that is multiscale in nature 3 4 formulation of bubble size previous field observations and experimental studies have found that two influential factors affecting bubble size distributions are wind speed and surface wave deike et al 2016 2017 the trend between the depth of measurements and wind velocities shows a steepening of the bubble size spectrum with the depth a linear relationship between the depth of measurements and the exponent of the power law of bubble size is obtained from experiment hwang et al 2010 5 s s 2 8 d h s 0 7 0 5 d h s 1 2 where h s is the significant wave height this eq is extracted from data in breaking of irregular waves however the present paper deals with breaking of regular waves and as a modification of above expression we introduce the following eq 6 s s a d h b c where a b and c are coefficients based on the experimental data of all the five cases listed in table 1 these coefficients are obtained by regression and eq 6 becomes 7 s s 1 457 d h 0 396 0 698 the prediction of the formula and experimental data are plotted in fig 12 with coefficient of correlation r2 0 83 as indicated in above section besides water depth distance from the breaking point wave height and measurement depth play a role in the magnitude of the power exponent with this understanding the following equation is obtained by fitting all of the experimental data in fig 10 8 s s 3 831 d h 0 197 h h 0 15 x x b l 0 329 0 273 this equation indicates that ss decreases with measurement depth wave height and distance from wave breaking point but it increases with water depth and wave length the value of s s predicted by eq 8 and from the measurement are plotted in fig 12 by comparison of computation by eqs 7 and 8 it is seen that the latter captures actual behaviors better actually formula 8 leads to a higher coefficient of correlation to the measurement data r2 0 95 note that eq 8 reflects the multiscale features of the flow it presents a relationship between microscopic patterns i e bubble size and macroscopic behaviors water depth and wave length 4 numerical results 4 1 wave breaking and evolution of bubbles in order to better understand the formation and transport of bubbles in breaking waves a 3d view is illustrated the evolution of the free surfaces of water during the process of wave breaking as seen in fig 13 it is seen that during the whole process the water surfaces are changing from a relatively smooth and continuous form into rough and fragmented pieces another observation is that the evolution of water surfaces takes place with high speed velocity which overall decreases as the breaking develops such evolution reflects complicated behaviors of air bubbles in their formation development and dispersion to extract more details of the bubble behaviors in breaking waves the simulated flow on the centerline cross section at different time of fig 13 together with observed images in the experiment is shown in fig 14 it is seen from the figure that the simulation reproduces the general patterns of wave breaking observed in the experiment such as the impinging jet the air cavity its breaking and water splashing moreover fig 14 presents information of breaking waves and air bubble entrainment that is beyond the reach of the experiment in particular the simulated field of velocity vectors on the left panels of the figure is further examined between t 5 85 s and 5 95 s as clearly seen from the directions of flow vectors there is interaction between an uprush from the left and a backwash from the right generating of a jet towards the right at the location they meet a cavity of air starts forming it is seen that the jet bears a large injection speed which could be as high as approximately three times of the speed of the uprush from t 6 05 s 6 15 s the uprush rolls forward continuously air is trapped within water and a cavity has formed at the same time in front of this cavity another jet takes place and its impinging will form a secondary cavity roughly between x 2 78 m and 2 90 m in the time interval from t 6 25 s 6 35 s while continuously rolling forward the two air cavities are constantly fused and broken leading to generation of many bubbles and splashes at different sizes now let us look at the computed vorticity in fig 14 it is seen from the figure that besides the region next to the bottom of the flume high vorticity takes place near water surfaces and in breaking waves also in the scale of the figures vorticity is mostly uneven within the water body and presents many small structures interestingly the distribution of vorticity within water body behind the wave crest exhibits strips in strength at t 5 85 5 95 s in fig 14 and similar finding has been reported in the literature deike et al 2017 4 2 correlation between number of air bubbles and turbulence kinetic energy the distribution of turbulence kinetic energy in breaking waves which is shown in fig 15 is examined as a general pattern in the left panels of the figure it is clearly seen that besides the region next to the bottom turbulence kinetic energy takes high values near water surfaces and in breaking waves such pattern is similar to that of vorticity shown in fig 14 additionally the right panels show that during the breaking turbulence kinetic energy also achieves high values in the regions around air water interfaces shown in purple color especially in those they become twisted as a general understanding there is strong mixing of air and water and thus a large number of air bubbles in the regions where the interfaces are twisted and this is evidenced by the experimental images in fig 14 the discussion in above section indicates that regions with high turbulence kinetic energy and those with larger numbers of air bubbles exhibit high coincidence and this could imply that there are correlations between turbulence strength and behaviors of air bubbles actually it has been shown in earlier studies that turbulence kinetic energy is positively proportional to void fraction of air water mixture in breaking waves mori et al 2007 lance and bataille 1991 and this is also true in the study of this work as seen in fig 16 a the results in the figure present a pattern similar to those in the earlier studies particularly turbulence kinetic energy is roughly linearly correlated to void fraction and it is not zero when viod fraction becomes zero in view that turbulence kinetic energy is correlated to void fraction as shown in fig 16a and the void fraction is positively correlated to the number of air bubbles as shown in fig 9 it is naturally conjectured that the turbulence kinetic energy is correlated to the number of air bubbles in order to verify the conjecture the correlation between the quantity of air bubbles and kinetic energy of the water flows listed in table 1 totally 19 all in wave breaking regions is examined in particular the number of air bubbles passing the measurement probe during a wave period is recorded in experiment in computation the average value of turbulence kinetic energy within water α 0 5 at the location of the probe is also recorded particularly the average value of the sum of turbulent kinetic energy of water in six directions around the point the recorded numbers of air bubbles and computed turbulence kinetic energy at all probes are plotted in fig 16b the panel shows that there is strong correlation indeed between them approximately the number of bubbles increases linearly with the average turbulence kinetic energy indicating that turbulence kinetic energy is an indicator for the number of air bubbles in breaking waves such correlation may be contributed to the fact that a higher turbulence kinetic energy leads to stronger entrainment of air more intensive mixing between air and water and then generation of more air bubbles in water in view the complexity of the entrainment and behaviors of air bubbles further and systematic investigation is necessary to justify the conjectured correlation between kinetic energy and number of air bubbles 5 conclusions an experimental investigation is performed on wave breaking and characteristics of bubbles in breaking waves within surf zones and a complementary modeling study is made to illustrate the corresponding multiscale hydrodynamic processes in detail this work examines microscopic behaviors of air bubbles and features of background flows and breaking waves as well as their correlations the experimental data simulated results and their analysis reveal the following conclusions 1 influential factors of numbers and sizes of bubbles are distance from wave breaking location wave height water depth and measurement depth 2 analytic expressions for bubble sizes are formulated in terms of these influential factors and they match measurement data well 3 numerical modeling reveals the evolution of the air cavities under breaking waves in correlation to the water flows around them 4 the number of bubbles and turbulence kinetic energy in breaking waves are linearly correlated and they may be an indicator for each other we anticipate that this study shed light on mechanism of bubbles within breaking waves and its results may serve as a starting point for future numerical and experimental investigations on this topic it should be pointed out that air bubbles within breaking waves exhibit complex multiscale behaviors and further study is desired in this paper the wave types and laboratory setting are relatively simple and those in real world problems are much more complicated therefore the results obtained in this study may not be directly applicable to realistic scenarios additionally measurements are made in a relatively a small range of parameters such as water depth and wave height investigations with a larger range of parameters will increase our confidence on the conclusions drawn in this study such as item 3 listed above moreover the sizes of the cases studied in this work are much smaller in comparison to those in real coastal settings and results obtained in this study might bear scale effects finally some factors such as salinity of water have influence on characteristics of air bubbles but are not included in this study we will keep all of these as our future topics of study credit authorship contribution statement bin deng conceptualization

20986,we present an experimental numerical study on air entrainment and the statistics of air bubbles in plunging breaking waves in surf zones on a beach in the experimental investigation the evolution numbers and sizes of air bubbles in breaking waves are recorded the relations are discussed between microscopic behaviors of these air bubbles and influential macrocopic factors including distance to the wave breaking point wave height water depth and depth of measurement empirical expressions for bubble sizes are formulated as functions of these factors base on three dimensional high resolution air bubble resolving numerical modeling a further study is conducted on details of the fields of velocity vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy it is conjectured with evidence that the number of bubbles is linearly correlated to turbulence kinetic energy within breaking waves the multiscale physical phenomena and correlations between air bubbles behaviors and their influential factors revealed in this study shed light on understanding and quantifying air bubbles characteristics in breaking waves within surf zones keywords surf zones plunging breaking wave air bubble size and number of bubbles openfoam 1 introduction as waves propagate from open seas to coastlines they experience a complex nonlinear hydrodynamic process of evolution and breaking in reaction to changes in water depth topography and other factors this process involves various phenomena including wave energy transfer sediment transport sound generation and water gas exchange hoque and aoki 2005 merlivat and memery 1983 melville 1996 jiang et al 2011 in such a process air entrains into breaking waves in surf zones and a large number of air bubbles are generated in water in addition the flow becomes multiscale in nature the waves and bubbles occur at different temporal and spatial scales but interact with each other in order to understand the hydrodynamic process it is crucially important to study air entrainment and characteristics of the resulting air bubbles in surf zones bubble induced turbulence and air water interaction are two important features in wave breaking and air entrainment in surf zones and they have been investigated mostly in vertical bubble column reactors schäfer et al 2002 ekambara and dhotre 2010 however the bubble induced turbulence is strong and complicated in realistic situations and they cannot be well represented by that within these bubble columns for instance during wave breaking an overturning turbulent jet is formed at the crest of a wave which is a common feature of spilling and plunging breakers and the associated turbulence is very different from that in a bubble column hoque and aoki 2005 hoque 2008 as to the air water interaction in wave breaking investigations have been carried out via numerical simulation physical model experiment and occasionally field observation chanson et al 2002 medwin 1970 johnson and cooke 1979 terrill et al 2001 for instance field observations are conducted on the effects of wind speed and water density on numbers and sizes of air bubbles and correlation is presented between probability density of numbers and sizes of the bubbles johnson and cooke 1979 terrill et al 2001 blanchard and woodcock 2016 it is reported that bubble behaviors in freshwater and seawater exhibit certain but minimal difference and a main difference is that more tiny bubbles in the form of foam form on water surface in the latter cartmill and su 1993 blenkinsopp and chaplin 2011 high precision instruments including those based on acoustic techniques laser methods and optical fiber probes lead to a new avenue to study of wave breaking and the associated air entrainment in more realistic situations and these instruments have become increasingly popular in related research for example the void fraction of bubble plumes under action of different types of breakers has been measured with the aid of such instruments lamarre and melville 1994 deane and stokes 2002 rojas and loewen 2007 rojas and loewen 2010 in investigation of energy dissipation caused by bubble entrainment in plunging waves it is found that the energy attenuation is related to wave height and distance to wave breaking point hoque and aoki 2008 2014 furthermore studies suggest that the process of bubble entrainment may lead to a rise in water surface elevation in a nearshore swash zone the sizes of bubbles generated by wave breaking are measured using optical fiber probes and it is revealed that the sizes decrease with distance to wave breaking points blenkinsopp and chaplin 2010 2011 a flow field of multi bubble regions is recorded using particle image velocity piv and bubble image velocity biv and the result indicates that from 54 to 85 of the wave energy is dissipated within one to two wavelength ranges lim et al 2015 in a laboratory experiment it is shown that the maximum void fraction is 20 the bubble size could reach 20 mm and the dissipated energy caused by bubbles in a swash zone accounts for about 1 of the total energy dai et al 2017 in recent years advanced high accuracy two phase numerical flow models have become available to explore breaking waves liu and lin 2008 wang et al 2016 biausser et al 2003 ketabdari et al 2008 guignard et al 2001 these models can effectively make up for the aforementioned insufficiencies of experimental measurements for example a two dimensional 2d volume of fluid vof method is used to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves impinging a bridge deck and generation of air bubbles is captured at its girders immersed in water qu et al 2017 the coherent interaction between a three dimensional 3d vortex structure and air bubbles within plunging waves is visualized by simulation with fine grids lubin and glockner 2015 the relationship between tiny vortex filament structures and bubbles droplets and splashes in breaking waves is studied using a 3d high resolution grid wang et al 2016 in a modeling study a bubble size distribution is divided into two sections described by power exponential functions associated with the hinze scale hinze and shell 1955 the length scale and the hinze scale of the bubble formation are obtained using a 3d direct numerical simulation deike et al 2016 a formula is presented to statistically estimate the total volume of air entrained by a single breaking wave deike et al 2017 in spite of the progresses listed above our understanding of air bubbles in breaking waves is preliminary and challenges remain in research of them particularly still it is impossible to directly measure some aspects of flow fields such as vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy derakhti and james 2014 as indicated by jia 2009 and kikkert et al 2012 there is difficulty in synchronization of measurement devices and this results in inaccuracy of measured data and even unpredictable uncertainties wang et al 2016 additionally research of air bubbles by numerical simulation also encounters difficulties stemming from limitations of numerical methods as well as computing power moreover air bubble phenomena within breaking waves are multiscale in nature and such nature adds more challenges to reliable simulation as a result although it started more than a decade ago e g mori et al 2007 research on air bubbles on beaches is limited and there is lack of detailed simulation on evolution of wave breaking and air entrainment as well as quantitative analysis on the flow fields and bubbles in this study we are motivated to make an effort to advance our understanding of air bubble behaviors and revealing quantitative relations of them by filling knowledge gaps discussed in above paragraph particularly this work studies air bubbles within plunging breaking waves in surf zones on a slope in a flume and with complementary experimental and numerical data it seeks a clear comprehensive illustration on the onset growing and decaying of air bubbles in this paper for the first time the relations are investigated between the numbers as well as sizes of air bubbles in plunging breaking waves on a beach and their influential factors including distance from breaking point wave height and water depth as a further step from the literature showing that the porosity of water flow is correlated to turbulence kinetic energy evidence is presented for a correlation between numbers of air bubbles and turbulence kinetic energy such evidence may serve as a start point for future research on water gas exchange and wave energy dissipation due to action of wave breaking 2 experimental and numerical methods 2 1 laboratory setup measurement and data repeatability we carry out the laboratory experiment in a wave flume of the key laboratory of water sediment sciences and water disaster prevention of hunan province at the changsha university of science and technology as shown in fig 1 the flume is 45 m in length 0 5 m in width and 0 8 m in height the left end of the wave flume is an absorbing flap type wavemaker and its right end is a 1 10 toughened glass beach representing coastal beach topography the side walls of the flume are transparent toughened glass during the experiment tap water was used and water temperature and room temperature were controlled to be about 20 c and 25 c respectively a cartesian coordinate system x y z is set up with its origin at the center of the toe the x direction towards the beach the y direction into the paper not shown in the figure and the z direction pointing upwards fig 1 as seen in fig 1 a particle image velocimeter piv system shangshui china 50 hz is located at x 2 2 m movable in z direction to measure the velocity distribution at specific locations the piv system consists of a high speed ccd camera zyla 4 2 plus andor to capture images of the flows and a double pulsed laser ksp2000 kingder to illuminate the uprush of water from the bottom of the flume seeding particles silver coated hollow neutrally buoyant glass spheres with a median diameter of 15 μm are added into the water for better illumination pairs of images are recorded by the camera with a resolution of 2560 2160 pixels the two images in each pair are separated in time by 1 ms and the frequency of the pair sampling is set at 50 hz the velocity profiles are obtained section by section in areas with 50 overlap and final interrogation areas of 32 32 or 16 16 pixels from the piv image pairs via an adaptive cross correlation algorithm using three iterative steps meanwhile another high speed camera fastcam mini ux100 germany 4000 hz is placed at x 2 5 m to capture the processes of wave breaking and bubble entrainment in addition four ultrasonic wave gauges uwg1 uwg4 uls 80d germany 50 hz are used to record the evolution of free water surfaces fig 1 uwg1 uwg2 uwg3 and uwg4 are installed at x 1 5 0 1 2 2 61 m respectively according to the manufacturer liu et al 2018 the error of the ultrasonic wave gauges is less than 3 10 4 m with regard to water surface additionally in measurements the water level is recorded every 0 02 s providing a high temporal resolution an air bubble measurement system b pop a2 photonic sensors company france with an l shaped optical fiber probe as its sensor is used to measure the number of air bubbles in water the probe sits on a measuring rack that may move up and down and left and right in the measurement as a bubble touches the tip of the optical fiber probe its surface is broken by the probe causing the voltage signal in system to rise see stage 1 2 in fig 2 when the fiber probe is completely inside the bubble the voltage remains as a constant see stage 2 3 as the fiber probe passes through the other side of the bubble s surface the voltage decreases rapidly see stage 3 4 utilizing temporal history of such signal air bubble numbers their sizes void fraction etc can be determined b pop a2 photonic sensors company france the measured void fraction c is determined as the ratio of the time duration when the fiber probe is within a bubble e g stage 2 3 in fig 2 over the total time the details of the principle and the measurement method are available in the literature dai et al 2017 a2 photonic sensors 2015 the probe is able to measure bubble velocities between 0 06 m s and 6 25 m s and detect bubbles with diameters larger than 100 μm the local void fraction becomes reliable when the typical bubble size is above 2 mm which will be the case in this study it is estimated the maximum error in ensemble averaged quantities such as diameters and sizes of bubbles is less than 6 and such error decreases as the number for the average increases more specifics of the a2 photonic sensors are given in pjontek et al 2014 in each experimental run regular waves are continuously generated as incident waves for 300 s and wave breaking is created at specific water depth h wave height h and wave period t the corresponding wave length l is determined using the dispersion equation based on the linear wave theory l g t 2 2 π tanh k h g is the gravity and k is the wave number this study deals with five cases that are combinations of different flow parameters as summarized in table 1 according to the types of wave breaking can be judged by the irribarren number galvin 1968 ξ 0 i h l i is the beach slope and wave breaking is of plunging wave when 0 5 ξ 0 3 3 in all of the five cases ξ 0 is within this range and therefore plunging waves occur in all of them which is confirmed in the observation by the high speed camera in the experiment discussed hereafter fig 7 in these five cases the values of h land h l indicate a finite water depth and mild wave steepness to study the physical phenomena as detailed and clearly as possible the five cases are designed so that under the condition for waves plunge and break on the slope they cover ranges of the experimental parameters water depth wave height as large as permitted by the laboratory settings case 1 2 and 3 reflect the influence of wave height and case 2 4 and 5 bear effect of water depth in the experiment the air void fraction in water body is measured in increments of 5 cm and 1 cm in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively as seen in the zoom in in fig 1 in this study a synchronous system a software package developed by us is adopted to control all instruments and equipment so the data are collected synchronously in air bubble detection measurements are taken at as many points as possible around locations of wave breaking to accurately determine their shapes in view of the randomness in wave breaking and air entrainment each data water surface elevation a number of air bubbles is obtained from an ensemble average value of multiple measurements to reduce its uncertainties tests have been carried out to check the repeatability and stability of equipment and instruments including the wavemaker the ultrasonic wave gauges and the bubble measurement system to ensure the authenticity and validity of the measured data firstly repeatability of the wavemaker and wave gauges is checked via five repeated experimental runs fig 3 shows the measurements of five runs at uwg1 x 1 5 m under condition of case 2 and it is seen from the figure that the measured time series of water surface η in the five runs are basically coincident with each other their maximum deviation is 3 41 and the average deviation is 1 00 secondly stability of the bubble measurement system is examined the void fraction at a same location and under same wave conditions is measured three times in each experimental run the wave making is on for 300 s and the optical fiber probe acquisition instrument is triggered at 60 s after the start of the wave making the sampling time is 180 s about 100 waves measured results of void fraction in three repeated experimental runs of case 2 are shown in fig 4 it is seen from the figure that the measurements of void fraction are close the largest deviation of the 1st 2nd and 3rd measurements to the average of them is 4 44 4 25 and 4 43 respectively therefore although the measured data exhibit certain level of discrepancy they are all considered repeatable and within the error ranges of the instruments 2 2 numerical models and validation an openfoam code is used to simulate the flow of air water mixture in this study https www openfoam com and it is based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t x j u i u j 1 ρ p x i g i 1 ρ τ i j r x j x j v u i x j σ κ ρ α x i where i j 1 2 3 t is the time x i is the cartesian coordinate u i is the corresponding velocity component in the coordinate system p is the pressure ρ is the density g i is the acceleration of gravity σ is the surface tension coefficient κ is curvature of the interface and α is the computed volume fraction the overline indicates an ensemble average value ν is kinematic viscosity which is dynamic viscosity μ divided by density and it is determined by the chosen turbulence model τ i j r is a sub grid stress term ρ u i u j ρ u i u j and it is closed as τ i j r 2 ρ v t s i j δ i j τ k k r 3 with s i j being the strain rate respectively in this work a delayed detached eddy approach s a ddes spalart et al 2006 is selected to for the closure this approach deals with a boundary layer region and the region away from it using a model based on the rans equations and another model based on a large eddy simulation les technique respectively the combination of two different turbulence models is realized effectively with a smooth transition between them spalart et al 2006 the solutions of eqs 1 and 2 include velocity u i pressure p turbulence kinetic energy k u i u i 2 u i being fluctuating velocity and repeat indices indicating summation etc a vof method is used to capture free surfaces of water this method introduces the volume fraction α with α 1 representing water phase α 0 standing for air phase and 0 α 1 referring to a water air interface the equation for the volume fraction is 3 α t α u j x j x j α 1 α u j r 0 the last term on the left side of eq 3 is an artificial compression term and the new introduced u j r is a velocity field greenshields 2015 which is used to compress the interface such an extra term effectively ensures that the solution of the equation is bounded near the air water interface and it has no influence on flows away from it it is straightforward to calculate any of the properties of the fluid in each cell just by weighting them by the volume fraction weller et al 1998 for example density or viscosity of the cell is computed as ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ a or μ α μ w 1 α μ a respectively a finite volume method is used to discretize eqs 1 and 2 in the 3d computational space and an euler method is adopted for their discretization in time the convection term of the equations is discretized by a gauss linear upwind scheme the pressure gradient term by a gauss linear discrete algorithm and the laplace term by a gauss linear corrected method the pimple algorithm piso simple merging algorithm is used to solve the resulting algebraic equations kissling et al 2010 eq 3 is discretized using a gauss muscl scheme for its convection term and a gauss surface compression scheme for its artificial compression term weller 2008 a wave making method is adopted to correct velocity at the entrance of the flume jacobsen et al 2012 a section of the flume is selected as the computational domain as shown in fig 1 which ranges in 33 m x 6 m 0 m y 0 25 m half of the flume and 0 m z 0 8 m wave generation condition is set at the left end symmetry boundary condition is used on the two lateral sides and no slip wall condition is adopted at the channel bottom on the beach and the right end mesh resolution of 2 mm in x y and z direction is adopted in the whole computational domain the total number of grid nodes is about 975 millions the time step δt is adjusted adaptively according courant number c f l δ t u i δ x 0 25 δ t indicates the time step δ x is the scale of the velocity direction grid cell during the computation further adjustments and refinements of the mesh and time step have been tested but no obvious difference in the numerical solutions is observed which implies that the solutions are independent of mesh and time step at above values other parameters in the numerical model are listed in table 2 as seen in fig 5 the measurement and the simulation present very similar evolutions of water surfaces at the four locations of uwgs the skill number is used to quantify their coincidence which is computed as willmott 2013 4 s 1 η num η exp 2 η num η exp η exp η exp 2 where subscript num and exp represent the numerical and experimental value respectively and overline standards for averge value the closer the simulated and measured data the closer the skill number to one as shown in the caption of the figure the skill number is close to one at all locations except the one at uwg4 x 2 61 m which is attributed to the fact that a large number of splashes occur at this location which affects the accuracy of the instrument fig 6 shows the velocity profiles computed by the numerical code and recorded by the piv instrument at three locations the results in the figure show that both horizontal velocity u and vertical velocity w produced by the code are consistent with those measured ones which demonstrates that the code is able to reliably capture the velocity profiles in breaking waves 3 experimental results 3 1 onset and evolution of bubbles fig 7 presents instant images recorded by the high speed camera in case 2 and it illustrates the formation and transport processes of bubbles within breaking waves in general these air bubbles mostly come from air initially above the waves and the processes of their formation and transport start from its entrainment into the waves as seen in fig 7 at t 0 s the water jet just plunges onto the surface of water in its front and it entrains a large amount of air to form an elliptic air cavity at t 0 05 s as the cavity rolls clockwise and forward the water jet continuously pours onto the water surface and generates a large number of splashing water drops at t 0 2 s while the air cavity keeps rolling it is elongated disintegrated and then broken at this time a number of small bubbles at different sizes have formed behind the roller and they travel forward with the roller moreover due to a secondary breaking of the wave air is entrained and a new air cavity is created at t 0 3 s the newly created air cavity has broken completely and this generates an air water mixture with high concentration of air bubbles that keep aggregating and breaking in the water at t 0 4 s many bubbles have arisen to the water surface and escaped into the air and the water surface gradually becomes calm as t 1 6 s the water surface evolves into a stage ready for the onset of the next cycle of wave breaking in view that air bubbles mostly come from the air initially above water surfaces of the waves it is expected that the amount of air entrained into the waves play an important role in wave breaking and behaviors of the bubbles it is a challenging task to accurately evaluate the entrained air mass both in laboratory experiments for instance only one probe is available to record air bubbles in the experiment of this study a numerical approach for a rough estimate may be possible by evaluation of the change in water volume that contains the air bubbles 3 2 quantity of bubbles fig 8 shows the distributions of air bubbles numbers within breaking waves which include the results in all five cases listed in table 1 here the number of bubbles n is the average number of bubbles passing through the bubble probe per second the measurement depth d is the vertical distance from water surface to the probe a general trend in the figure is that the closer to the water surface a location is the more bubbles there are fig 8a depicts distributions of bubble numbers along horizontal distance as seen in this figure when x x b l 0 17 the numbers of bubbles gradually increase with the distance from the breaking location as x x b l 0 17 the numbers decrease slightly with the distance fig 8b indicates that with the increase of h h the numbers of bubbles increase fig 8c shows that the variation of the distributions of bubble numbers with water depth behaves differently at different measurement depths at the smaller measurement depths the bubble number keeps decreasing with value of h gt 2 while at the two larger measurement depth it has a minimum at h gt 2 0 014 the results in fig 8 indicate that the influential factors on the numbers of bubbles in breaking waves are distance from the breaking points wave height and water depth as a general understanding a larger number of air bubbles mean a higher value of void fraction c and this is indeed the case in the experiment see fig 9 which results from the data of all the five cases the figure shows that as a general trend the number of air bubbles is positively correlated to the void fraction 3 3 bubble sizes in order to characterize bubble sizes their probability density function pdf is presented in particular the measurements of bubble size d in all of the five cases are plotted as a cumulative probability density function cdf and then the pdf is derived from the cdf as shown in fig 10 in this figure lines of power 1 and 2 denote the exponent of a power function or the spectral slope ss and they are included for reference it is seen from the figure that in comparison with the two lines of power the pdf of the bubble size essentially follows a power law distribution with a spectral slope ss between 1 and 2 when each of x x b l h h and h gt 2 changes the exponent of the power law in the pdf of bubble sizes is computed as the slope of the bubble size distributions in fig 10 and then plotted in fig 11 it is seen in the figure that the power exponent ss takes values between 1 4 and 1 more specifically ss decreases with x x b l and h h however it increases with h gt 2 or water depth it is noted that in an earlier study in mori et al 2007 a range of 1 5 1 7 for ss is presented and the difference between this range and that in this paper i e 1 4 1 may be attributed to the effects of water depth in comparison to that in mori et al 2007 the water is more shallow in this study and thus the sizes of bubbles are subject to influence to beach surface which is a future topic worth studying additionally it is noted that sizes of air bubbles over wave breakers a setting different from that of this paper are also related to distance to breaking location blenkinsopp and chaplin 2010 2011 let τ be the time of an air bubble to pass the fiber proble in view of the method to measure air bubbles in sec 2 1 it is known that c nτ t using mean values for c and n in figs 9 and 11 respectively it is estimated that τ t c n 0 1 10 0 01 this indicates that τ and t which are respectively the representative scale of the bubble behaviors and the wave motion are different by two magnitude orders moreover it is seen in fig 10 that the bubble sizes are in the range of 2 60 mm note that there may be smaller bubbles that are not resolvable by the instruments additionally as seen in table 1 the sizes of the background flows such as water depth and wave length are at the order of meter in magnitude as a result the air bubbles and the background flows exist and evolve at different temporal and spatial scales the former occur at small scales and the latter bear relatively large scales as a result figs 10 and 11 present a relation between microscopic bubbles and macroscopic background flows unveiling an aspect of a phenomenon that is multiscale in nature 3 4 formulation of bubble size previous field observations and experimental studies have found that two influential factors affecting bubble size distributions are wind speed and surface wave deike et al 2016 2017 the trend between the depth of measurements and wind velocities shows a steepening of the bubble size spectrum with the depth a linear relationship between the depth of measurements and the exponent of the power law of bubble size is obtained from experiment hwang et al 2010 5 s s 2 8 d h s 0 7 0 5 d h s 1 2 where h s is the significant wave height this eq is extracted from data in breaking of irregular waves however the present paper deals with breaking of regular waves and as a modification of above expression we introduce the following eq 6 s s a d h b c where a b and c are coefficients based on the experimental data of all the five cases listed in table 1 these coefficients are obtained by regression and eq 6 becomes 7 s s 1 457 d h 0 396 0 698 the prediction of the formula and experimental data are plotted in fig 12 with coefficient of correlation r2 0 83 as indicated in above section besides water depth distance from the breaking point wave height and measurement depth play a role in the magnitude of the power exponent with this understanding the following equation is obtained by fitting all of the experimental data in fig 10 8 s s 3 831 d h 0 197 h h 0 15 x x b l 0 329 0 273 this equation indicates that ss decreases with measurement depth wave height and distance from wave breaking point but it increases with water depth and wave length the value of s s predicted by eq 8 and from the measurement are plotted in fig 12 by comparison of computation by eqs 7 and 8 it is seen that the latter captures actual behaviors better actually formula 8 leads to a higher coefficient of correlation to the measurement data r2 0 95 note that eq 8 reflects the multiscale features of the flow it presents a relationship between microscopic patterns i e bubble size and macroscopic behaviors water depth and wave length 4 numerical results 4 1 wave breaking and evolution of bubbles in order to better understand the formation and transport of bubbles in breaking waves a 3d view is illustrated the evolution of the free surfaces of water during the process of wave breaking as seen in fig 13 it is seen that during the whole process the water surfaces are changing from a relatively smooth and continuous form into rough and fragmented pieces another observation is that the evolution of water surfaces takes place with high speed velocity which overall decreases as the breaking develops such evolution reflects complicated behaviors of air bubbles in their formation development and dispersion to extract more details of the bubble behaviors in breaking waves the simulated flow on the centerline cross section at different time of fig 13 together with observed images in the experiment is shown in fig 14 it is seen from the figure that the simulation reproduces the general patterns of wave breaking observed in the experiment such as the impinging jet the air cavity its breaking and water splashing moreover fig 14 presents information of breaking waves and air bubble entrainment that is beyond the reach of the experiment in particular the simulated field of velocity vectors on the left panels of the figure is further examined between t 5 85 s and 5 95 s as clearly seen from the directions of flow vectors there is interaction between an uprush from the left and a backwash from the right generating of a jet towards the right at the location they meet a cavity of air starts forming it is seen that the jet bears a large injection speed which could be as high as approximately three times of the speed of the uprush from t 6 05 s 6 15 s the uprush rolls forward continuously air is trapped within water and a cavity has formed at the same time in front of this cavity another jet takes place and its impinging will form a secondary cavity roughly between x 2 78 m and 2 90 m in the time interval from t 6 25 s 6 35 s while continuously rolling forward the two air cavities are constantly fused and broken leading to generation of many bubbles and splashes at different sizes now let us look at the computed vorticity in fig 14 it is seen from the figure that besides the region next to the bottom of the flume high vorticity takes place near water surfaces and in breaking waves also in the scale of the figures vorticity is mostly uneven within the water body and presents many small structures interestingly the distribution of vorticity within water body behind the wave crest exhibits strips in strength at t 5 85 5 95 s in fig 14 and similar finding has been reported in the literature deike et al 2017 4 2 correlation between number of air bubbles and turbulence kinetic energy the distribution of turbulence kinetic energy in breaking waves which is shown in fig 15 is examined as a general pattern in the left panels of the figure it is clearly seen that besides the region next to the bottom turbulence kinetic energy takes high values near water surfaces and in breaking waves such pattern is similar to that of vorticity shown in fig 14 additionally the right panels show that during the breaking turbulence kinetic energy also achieves high values in the regions around air water interfaces shown in purple color especially in those they become twisted as a general understanding there is strong mixing of air and water and thus a large number of air bubbles in the regions where the interfaces are twisted and this is evidenced by the experimental images in fig 14 the discussion in above section indicates that regions with high turbulence kinetic energy and those with larger numbers of air bubbles exhibit high coincidence and this could imply that there are correlations between turbulence strength and behaviors of air bubbles actually it has been shown in earlier studies that turbulence kinetic energy is positively proportional to void fraction of air water mixture in breaking waves mori et al 2007 lance and bataille 1991 and this is also true in the study of this work as seen in fig 16 a the results in the figure present a pattern similar to those in the earlier studies particularly turbulence kinetic energy is roughly linearly correlated to void fraction and it is not zero when viod fraction becomes zero in view that turbulence kinetic energy is correlated to void fraction as shown in fig 16a and the void fraction is positively correlated to the number of air bubbles as shown in fig 9 it is naturally conjectured that the turbulence kinetic energy is correlated to the number of air bubbles in order to verify the conjecture the correlation between the quantity of air bubbles and kinetic energy of the water flows listed in table 1 totally 19 all in wave breaking regions is examined in particular the number of air bubbles passing the measurement probe during a wave period is recorded in experiment in computation the average value of turbulence kinetic energy within water α 0 5 at the location of the probe is also recorded particularly the average value of the sum of turbulent kinetic energy of water in six directions around the point the recorded numbers of air bubbles and computed turbulence kinetic energy at all probes are plotted in fig 16b the panel shows that there is strong correlation indeed between them approximately the number of bubbles increases linearly with the average turbulence kinetic energy indicating that turbulence kinetic energy is an indicator for the number of air bubbles in breaking waves such correlation may be contributed to the fact that a higher turbulence kinetic energy leads to stronger entrainment of air more intensive mixing between air and water and then generation of more air bubbles in water in view the complexity of the entrainment and behaviors of air bubbles further and systematic investigation is necessary to justify the conjectured correlation between kinetic energy and number of air bubbles 5 conclusions an experimental investigation is performed on wave breaking and characteristics of bubbles in breaking waves within surf zones and a complementary modeling study is made to illustrate the corresponding multiscale hydrodynamic processes in detail this work examines microscopic behaviors of air bubbles and features of background flows and breaking waves as well as their correlations the experimental data simulated results and their analysis reveal the following conclusions 1 influential factors of numbers and sizes of bubbles are distance from wave breaking location wave height water depth and measurement depth 2 analytic expressions for bubble sizes are formulated in terms of these influential factors and they match measurement data well 3 numerical modeling reveals the evolution of the air cavities under breaking waves in correlation to the water flows around them 4 the number of bubbles and turbulence kinetic energy in breaking waves are linearly correlated and they may be an indicator for each other we anticipate that this study shed light on mechanism of bubbles within breaking waves and its results may serve as a starting point for future numerical and experimental investigations on this topic it should be pointed out that air bubbles within breaking waves exhibit complex multiscale behaviors and further study is desired in this paper the wave types and laboratory setting are relatively simple and those in real world problems are much more complicated therefore the results obtained in this study may not be directly applicable to realistic scenarios additionally measurements are made in a relatively a small range of parameters such as water depth and wave height investigations with a larger range of parameters will increase our confidence on the conclusions drawn in this study such as item 3 listed above moreover the sizes of the cases studied in this work are much smaller in comparison to those in real coastal settings and results obtained in this study might bear scale effects finally some factors such as salinity of water have influence on characteristics of air bubbles but are not included in this study we will keep all of these as our future topics of study credit authorship contribution statement bin deng conceptualization

20987,tsunamis in indonesia 2004 and japan 2011 severely affected communities bordering the indian ocean and japan s east coast despite the plausible findings arising from the available studies the research on the impact of tsunami bore forces applied to bridges of different designs is limited this is because the estimation methods for tsunami induced loads presented in the literature have mainly been developed for buildings and require careful adaptation to apply to bridges the main focus of the present study is to experimentally examine the interaction between a tsunami bore and a box section bridge with different orientations to the direction of the incoming bore bore strengths and deck clearances the experiments were conducted in a 15 m long 1 2 m wide and 1 2 m deep wave flume the forces and pressures applied to the bridge the bore heights and the velocities were measured it was found that the skewed bridge deck is subjected to additional force and moment components namely the cross stream force f y and the rolling and yawing moments m x and m z these components are non existent for the unskewed bridge deck based on the experimental results equations were proposed for estimating tsunami forces for a box section bridge deck keywords tsunami bore skewed box section bridge deck force moment pressure 1 introduction tsunamis are a product of the vertical displacements of a column of water resulting from natural phenomena such as earthquakes volcanic eruptions and landslides the worst tsunamis notably indonesia 2004 chile 2010 and tohoku in japan 2011 led to extensive destruction of human life property and infrastructure tsunamis vary in characteristics and cause leading to different extents of damage on the coastline and inland the variables include geometry topography orientation and configuration of the shoreline as well as the direction of the arriving ocean waves yeh 1991 the cause also defines the manifestation of the tsunamis with the worst cases coming from earthquakes and volcanic eruptions the coastlines are often utilized as resources that accommodate residential and commercial structures coastal areas in the pacific and indian ocean regions have in the past experienced different indices of tsunami that uncover gaps and deficiencies in planning and preparation during the tohoku tsunami 2011 more than 300 nearshore bridges were washed away thus impeding the rescue processes and medical aid aglipay et al 2011 the unpredictability of occurrence coupled with the devastating effects of tsunami events necessitates the design and development of tsunami resistant structures early detection and warning systems and evacuation plans to minimize the extent of damage during and after tsunami events with the progressive development of design guidelines for tsunamis for coastal structures such as guidelines for design of structures for vertical evacuation from tsunamis or federal emergency management agency fema p646 developed by the fema in the usa heintz mahoney fema 2012 the city and county of honolulu building code cch 2000 and 7 16 minimum design loads and associated criteria for buildings and other structures asce 2016 failing to address the impact of tsunami induced forces on bridges experimental investigations are critical in developing more efficient and resilient structural design codes for bridges to facilitate these advancements a broader comprehension of the tsunami bore impact force on critical infrastructure within tsunami inundation zones is imperative gathering from a historical perspective tsunamis exhibit different forms depending on the location and its characteristics as a result the effect of tsunami bore forces on different structures has been subjected to investigation for several decades some of the first studies on the effects of tsunamis on bridges were conducted by kataoka et al 2006 and shoji and mori 2006 kataoka kusakabe et al 2006 investigated the effect of wave forces applied to a bridge deck breaking non breaking and broken waves were the wave scenarios evaluated in their experiments their findings showed that the magnitude of the impulsive force depends on the tsunami wave condition and are in agreement with the results obtained by nouri et al 2010 and ikeno et al 2001 an experimental and numerical investigation was conducted by shoji et al 2011 to evaluate the horizontal and vertical tsunami wave pressures due to the japan tsunami of march 2011 on nine bridge decks that were completely washed away the authors observed a higher tsunami wave pressure than the value reported by kataoka et al 2006 whose model assumed very thin bridge piers which resulted in a reduction of the tsunami induced loads lukkunaprasit and lau 2011 investigated the effect of the tsunami bore induced pressure on a bridge using a complete pier and deck model the results showed an increase of up to 50 on the horizontal pressures applied to the bridge pier of the model which means that the results of the experiments on a standalone pier are not conservative for design purposes lukkunaprasit and lau 2011 kosa nii et al 2010 analyzed two tsunami wave types namely broken waves and unbroken waves on a 1 50 scale bridge deck representing a bridge damaged during the 2004 indian ocean tsunami kosa nii et al 2010 indicated that the streamwise wave force was smaller than the uplift force for an unbroken wave which is the opposite of the broken wave reviewing the past studies and their findings revealed that understanding the distribution of tsunami induced forces on bridges is essential for an economic and safe design several methods have been proposed by researchers for estimating tsunami forces on bridges and buildings as follows a wind driven wave forces on bridge decks douglass et al 2006 b existing design codes specifying tsunami loads on buildings including the city and county of honolulu building code cch 2000 the guidelines for design of structures

hydraulic equations yokoi et al 2013 f the existing requirements of the new zealand transport agency nzta bridge manual for the consideration of tsunami effects on bridges melville shamseldin et al 2014 2015 the main limitation of the wind driven wave approach is that the characteristics of tsunami bores are different from the characteristics of wind driven waves particularly their spatial and temporal scales yim et al 2014 despite the plausible findings arising from the studies research on the impact of tsunami bore forces on bridges of different designs is limited this is because the estimation methods presented have been developed mainly for buildings and require careful adaptation to apply to bridges livermore 2014 the application of the guidance for tsunami loads on buildings to bridges has two main limitations the first limitation is that the reference level for the heights to estimate the tsunami loads on buildings is the ground level of the building while for a bridge this is the underside of the deck the other limitation is the projected area of the structure at right angles to the flow direction which is smaller for a bridge than for a building the tsunami bore flows around a building rather than above or below the structure as is the case of a bridge the lack of proper guidelines to understand the interactions between bridges and tsunami bores highlights the importance of further experimental investigation of tsunami bridge interactions on the development of tsunami resistant bridges kihara et al 2015 in more recent years investigations carried out after major tsunami events provided evidence of the unseating of the deck as a result of vertical hydrodynamic forces and buoyancy effects on submerged and partially submerged bridges aglipay et al 2011 motley et al 2015 post tsunami reconnaissance observations revealed that bridges that were not washed away by the 2011 japan tsunami had concrete decks with wider roadways and shallower girder heights or reinforced concrete moment resisting frames akiyama et al 2013 in addition surveys on the great east japan earthquake 2011 carried out by kawashima et al 2011 concluded that based on weight steel bridges are more susceptible to damage than concrete bridges studies on the damage of bridges and roadways highlight the importance of structural elements such as embankments and how they affect the flow characteristics murakami et al 2012 and the resulting heavy scouring at both abutments at the upstream side of a bridge iemura et al 2005 these studies highlight the importance of the geometry and the type of bridge in minimizing the risk of failure due to a tsunami impact on a bridge deck motley et al 2015 analyzed the dynamics of a bore type tsunami loading on a bridge model using a 3d computational fluids dynamics approach and showed how the skew angle of the bridge deck relative to the incoming wave could affect the loading history motley wong et al 2015 noted that a 2d analysis would fail to capture the 3d effects from the bridge geometry and the local bathymetry motley wong et al 2015 highlighted the lack of physical modeling in the prediction of tsunami loads on skewed bridges skewed bridges are commonly used to cross roadways waterways railways or landscape features that are not perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of a bridge at the intersection skewed bridges are characterized by their skew angle defined as the angle between a line normal to the centerline of the bridge and the centerline of the support abutment or pier this paper attempts to provide a more detailed experimental investigation regarding the effects of the tsunami bore impact on a skewed box section bridge deck with various skew angles there are limited research studies investigating the effect of tsunami induced forces on skewed bridges using numerical modeling and that there is no study focusing on the physical modeling the effect of tsunami induced forces on skewed bridges this paper presents the experimental results of the measurement of tsunami induced forces and moments on a skewed box section bridge deck measurements of the bore height and velocity were taken upstream of the bridge model in the flume the applied streamwise forces were numerically modeled using equations available in the literature by applying relevant drag coefficients based on the experimental results equations were proposed for estimating tsunami streamwise cross stream and uplift forces for a box section bridge deck 2 experimental set up 2 1 facility a 15 m long 1 2 m wide and 1 2 m deep wave flume connected to a 6 4 m long 5 5 m wide and 1 2 m deep reservoir made of concrete block walls was used fig 1 based on the analogies between a tsunami induced bore and a dam break flow described in the literature chanson 2006 a dam break hydraulic bore was used in this study to simulate the tsunami bore this approach has been extensively used by researchers chen et al 2016 nandasena and tanaka 2013 nouri et al 2010 shafiei et al 2016 the flume is equipped with an automatic gate to generate a tsunami bore the flume has a horizontal bottom of moderately smooth concrete to enable the simulation of tsunami bore propagation over a flat dry bed the flume is emptied using the drain gate and the drain channel the 1 2 m wide and 1 2 m high automatic gate consists of a sliding gate which opens rapidly providing near instantaneous water release fig 2 it is timed to remain open for 4 0 s before closing automatically a computer operated hydraulic piston actuator lifts the sliding gate rapidly the opening height of the sliding gate is adjustable combinations of various gate opening heights and water depths in the reservoir enable the generation of different bore strengths 2 2 instrumentation five capacitance type wave gauges were placed 15 mm above the flume floor at the center of the flume along its length to measure the depth of the flow and observe the bore propagation the first wave gauge wg1 was placed 6 7 m downstream of the gate with the remaining gauges wg2 to wg5 equally spaced 1 5 m apart over a total distance of 12 7 m downstream of the gate the last wave gauge was placed 0 5 m upstream of the bridge model fig 3 the approaching bore featured a sloping front which is typical for such experiments the recorded time at which the bore struck each wave gauge was used to calculate the bore velocity the time of the first non zero reading at each wave gauge was taken as the time of the bore arrival the wave gauges were logged at 1 khz the water depth behind the sloping front of the approaching bore was used to measure the bore height pressure sensors honeywell 26 pc series were used to measure the streamwise pressures applied to the bridge deck the pressure sensors had a capacity of 34 47 kpa with a precision of 0 043 kpa and a response time of 1 ms each pressure sensor was fitted with two flexible transparent plastic tubes and the pressure difference between these tubes was measured one tube was placed to sense the reference pressure while the other tube was mounted flush with the surface of the structure the tubes were filled with water and checked for air bubble removal before each experiment the load cell utilized in this experimental study was a jr3 multi axis waterproof load cell model 75e20a4 with the positive x axis aligned with the flow direction fig 4 the load cell was placed underneath the flume floor in a recess to allow the base of the bridge model to be level with the floor of the flume a 6 6 calibration matrix was provided to convert the output signals to force values shafiei et al 2016 2 3 experimental procedure for the experiments the reservoir was filled to depths of 700 900 or 1100 mm and the sliding gate was lifted to a constant height of either 200 300 400 or 500 mm the dimensions of the bridge model were obtained as simple averages of the scaled measurements of five actual bridges across new zealand the bridge model was located 13 2 m downstream of the vertical sliding gate that controls the water release and creates different bore strengths three representative cases case b1 h b 290 mm case b9 h b 210 mm and case b13 h b 160 mm were selected to demonstrate the experimental results these cases cover the range of bore strengths in this study and will be hereafter referred to as strong bore case b1 moderate bore case b9 and weak bore case b13 a box section bridge deck was tested with different bore heights deck clearances and skew angles with five repetitions for each experiment overall 64 individual test cases were conducted to characterize the impact loads of a tsunami bore on this type of bridge deck table 1 lists four different combinations of gate opening heights go and reservoir water depths wl used to generate the experimental test cases with varying bore heights h b and velocities u b a model of a box section bridge was used to quantify the tsunami induced loads fig 5a b c and 6 with different combinations of bore strengths and deck clearances another geometric parameter the skew angle was investigated to determine its effect on the time history of the tsunami induced loads on the box section bridge deck as shown in figs 7 and 8 a box section bridge deck with skew angles of 10 20 and 30 was used in the flume to perform the experiments the skew angles were created by rotating the bridge span around its geometric centroid while keeping it in the same position in relation to the incoming bore the bridge pier remained the same for all the bridge models the corners of the bridge deck were named based on their location front or back of the bridge and the size of the angle acute or obtuse wong 2015 the front acute corner and back obtuse corner were located on the right side of the flume for the box section bridge deck fig 8 3 results and discussion froude scale modeling was used to convert model measurements to prototype quantities geometrical similarity was based on an assumption that the maximum average bore height generated in this study is equivalent to approximately 11 5 m ﬂow depth inundation depth during a real tsunami this assumption is based on ﬁeld measurements of ﬂow depth of previous tsunami events bryant 2014 the assumption resulted in a geometrical similarity scale of 1 40 for this study the 1 40 box section bridge model representing a typical bridge constructed in new zealand was used to perform the experiments dimensions of a typical bridge were obtained as simple averages of the measurements from five actual bridges located at kakanui river otago kowhai river canterbury ngaruroro river diversion hawkes bay and waimakariri river belfast and canterbury a box section bridge deck was tested with different bore heights deck clearances and skew angles with five repetitions for each experiment overall 64 individual test cases were conducted to characterize the impact loads of a tsunami bore on this type of bridge deck 3 1 bore characteristics in the present study the bore front profile was captured by capacitance type wave gauges the time history of the generated bores was recorded at each wave gauge along the flume the measured bore height at each wave gauge location resulted in less than 3 variation over the five repetitions of the experiment as shown in fig 9 for case b1 confirming the ability of the experimental setup to repeatedly generate the same bore fig 10 shows the bore front profile over 4 m from its leading front the graph is consistent with the analytical solution presented by chanson 2006 the approaching bore featured a sloping front which is typical for such experiments as expected higher water depths in the reservoir and higher gate opening heights resulted in higher bores and greater velocities being recorded the generated bore took about 3 3 4 4 s depending on the velocity to travel the length of the flume and reach the bridge model the bore velocities in individual experiments ranged from 3 0 to 4 05 m s corresponding to prototype velocities ranging from 19 to 25 6 m s to the best of the authors knowledge the highest reported velocity was estimated to be 20 m s during the grand banks tsunami bryant 2014 and the highest velocity at prototype scale in this study is approx 25 m s which was due to the limitations associated with the physical tests however the following equation shows that the bore flow characteristics of this study are within the range of the recommended values in the literature the following equation was proposed by different studies to estimate the velocity of a tsunami bore ub as a function of bore height h b 1 u b α u g h b 0 5 where u b is the bore velocity h b is the bore height g is the gravitational acceleration and α u is a constant different values of α u ranging from 0 67 to 3 00 have been proposed by different studies to calculate the bore velocity bryant 2014 heintz and mahoney 2008 iizuka and matsutomi 2000 kirkoz 1983 lukkunaprasit et al 2009 matsutomi and okamoto 2010 t murty 1977 t s murty 1977 nandasena and tanaka 2013 robertson et al 2013 robertson et al 2008 shafiei et al 2016 a α u value of 2 4 was identified in this study which is within the range of recommended values in the literature 3 2 tsunami flow generation over the unskewed bridge deck fig 11 shows a photograph looking upstream taken during bore impingement in the experiments where the bridge deck is perpendicular to the flow direction i e the unskewed box section bridge deck as shown in fig 11 the height of the overtopping above the bridge deck is approximately ten times the deck height the turbulence nature of the bore front during the test divided the impact process into two main stages 1 initial impact and 2 fully inundated condition which is consistent with the findings of azadbakht and yim 2014 and shafiei et al 2016 soon after the first arrival of the bore at the bridge location fig 12 a the water free surface elevation starts to overtop the bridge deck fig 12b the bore flow rapidly becomes quasi steady fig 12c with flow under and over the bridge deck across its full width the amount of water accumulation varies depending on the deck clearance and the bore strength in the case of especially strong bores the overtopped water joins the flow at the downstream side of the bridge instead of ponding on the top surface of the deck a few seconds after the initial bore impact the water level begins to decrease upstream of the bridge model starting the recession stage fig 12d finally the water free surface elevation drops below the bridge deck indicating the end of the experiment 3 3 tsunami bore induced pressures on the unskewed deck fig 13 a b and c show the averaged streamwise pressures over five repetitions at the different sensor locations p 1 p 2 and p 3 for different bore strengths on the unskewed deck the locations of the pressure sensors are shown in fig 5b the time history plots show a sudden increase in the streamwise pressure due to the bore impact resulting from the sloping bore front region cooker and peregrine 1995 hattori et al 1994 okamura 1993 fig 13a b and c also show a reduction of up to 35 of the initial maximum impulsive pressure due to the accumulation of water on the upstream side of the bridge deck these results are consistent with previous studies carried out by azadbakht and yim 2014 motley et al 2015 and wong 2015 in fig 13a b and c t 0 0 s represents the time of gate opening but the individual time history plots have been shifted along the time axis so that the initial positive pressure always occurs at t 3 0 s fig 14 displays the averages of the maximum streamwise force measured from five repetitions of the experiment i e each data point is a representation of five tests and the forces calculated from the integration of the streamwise pressure measured using the pressure sensors mounted on the front face of the bridge deck using the equation f x p d a where f x is the streamwise force p is the measured streamwise pressure by the pressure sensors and a is the projected area of the bridge deck the correlation between the measured and calculated forces shown in fig 14 demonstrates the validity of the force and the pressure measurement techniques used in this study 3 4 tsunami bore induced forces on the unskewed deck the multi axis load cell at the base of the structure was used to the measure the forces and moments applied to the bridge figs 15 17 present the typical time history plots of the streamwise and uplift forces and the pitching moment for the three representative test cases strong moderate and weak bores respectively as the bore strength increased the magnitude of the forces f x and f z and moments m y also increased which is consistent with the findings of past studies azadbakht and yim 2014 wong 2015 as the bore front hit the bridge deck there was a sudden increase in the magnitude of the streamwise and uplift forces this was due to the bore impact resulting from the sloping bore front region and the accumulation of water on the upstream side of the bridge deck the initial rise i e the impulsive streamwise force occurred before the quasi steady streamwise force was fully developed which took around 1 s in the experiments once the bore flow was fully developed a gradual reduction occurred after the impulsive rise of the streamwise force as shown by the time history in fig 15 the decline was more pronounced at a lower bore strength i e the weak bore the measured streamwise force applied to a stand alone pier was subtracted from the total measured force on the deck pier structure to calculate the forces applied only to the deck the streamwise force applied to the stand alone pier ranged from 10 to 20 of the total streamwise force of the deck pier structure depending on the bore strength and the pier height the hydrodynamic force resulting from the resistance of the bridge deck against the bore flow and the hydrostatic force caused by the difference between the water levels upstream and downstream of the bridge were the two factors exerting the streamwise forces on the bridge deck the magnitude of the quasi steady part of the streamwise force shown in fig 15 is expected to be correlated to the tsunami bore flow velocity and to a lesser extent to the tsunami bore height the total streamwise force fht is equal to the sum of the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces which is consistent with information available from the literature cross 1967 nouri 2008 shafiei et al 2016 yokoi et al 2013 yokoi tamakoshi et al 2013 recommended the following equations to estimate the hydrodynamic and total streamwise forces 2 f h d 1 2 c d ρ u b 2 a v 3 f h t f h s f h d where f ht is the total streamwise force f hs is the hydrostatic streamwise force f hd is the hydrodynamic streamwise force ρ is the water density h d is the deck clearance c d is the drag coefficient u b is the bore velocity and a v is the vertical projected area of the model this is the same approach used by kosa et al 2010 ohmori et al 2000 and also adopted by yeh 2007 for estimating tsunami bore induced loads on a bridge model the inundated area of the front face of the bridge deck was used to calculate the hydrostatic force for the strong bore case as shown in fig 18 the magnitude of the hydrostatic component was found to be negligible compared with the hydrodynamic component the values of the drag coefficients for a bridge deck recommended in the literature range from 1 0 to 2 2 arneson 2013 asce 2016 lau et al 2011 melville et al 2015 yim boon intra et al 2011 yokoi et al 2013 the application of eq 2 to the calculated hydrodynamic force gave a c d value of 2 0 for this study which is consistent with the drag coefficients recommended in the literature the time history plots of the vertical force exerted on the bridge deck are shown in fig 16 as seen in fig 16 a sudden initial rise is evident resulting from an increase in pressure under the bridge deck at the time of the bore arrival the initial impulsive force is sometimes identified as a hydrodynamic uplift force livermore 2014 the initial rise of the uplift force was followed by a decline due to the overtopping and ponding of water on the top of the bridge deck which could be the dominant component of the vertical force depending on the bore strength similar to the streamwise force the downward vertical force is the sum of the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces the weight of the water on the top surface of the bridge deck corresponds to the hydrostatic component and the water flowing over the bridge deck corresponds to the hydrodynamic component as fig 16 indicates the resulting vertical force is positive for the stronger bores i e the uplift force is greater than the downward vertical force and starts to decrease for the weaker bores due to the smaller uplift pressure on the underside of the bridge deck in addition as the bore height increases the overtopped water tends to join the flow downstream of the bridge instead of ponding on the top surface of the bridge deck resulting in a smaller downward vertical force for the stronger bores fig 17 shows the time history of the pitching moment measured on the bridge for the three representative cases the figure shows that the shape of the time history of the pitching moment is similar to the time history of the measured streamwise force shown in fig 15 however the pitching moment is the product of both streamwise and uplift forces further numerical simulation is required to determine the relation between the pitching moment and the streamwise and uplift forces fig 18 shows the time history of the streamwise force measured by the load cell averaged from five repetitions the force calculated from the integration of the measured pressure and the hydrostatic hydrodynamic and total streamwise forces the hydrodynamic and total horizontal forces were estimated using eqs 2 and 3 with a drag coefficient of 2 0 for the quasi steady part of the streamwise force calculated from integration from 4 0 to 7 0 s as shown in the time history there were some minor differences that could have been due to the influence of the local bore flow patterns around the pressure sensors nouri et al 2010 the time history plots in fig 18 show consistency between the quasi steady part of the measured and the calculated total streamwise forces fig 18 also shows that the hydrostatic force is an order of magnitude lower than the hydrodynamic force and could be neglected which is in agreement with heintz and mahoney fema 2012 3 5 tsunami flow generation over the skewed bridge deck similar to the unskewed box section bridge deck the impact process was divided into two main stages 1 initial impact and 2 fully inundated condition which are explained in detail in section 3 2 fig 19 a and b show the bore front region impact on the unskewed and skewed bridge decks respectively the bore front hit one side of the deck before the other side in the case of a skewed bridge deck creating a different overtopping process at the instant of the impact compared with an unskewed bridge deck this different mechanism of the initial impact creates a cross stream force f y and rolling and yawing moments m x and m z in addition to the streamwise and uplift forces f x and f z and pitching moment m y observed on the unskewed bridge deck 3 6 tsunami bore induced forces applied to the skewed bridge deck the overall trends of the streamwise and vertical forces shown in the time history plots are identical to the measured forces for the unskewed box section bridge deck as explained in section 3 4 the peak streamwise force is followed by a gradual reduction of approximately 25 on average for all the test cases regardless of the skew angle the front acute corner of the bridge deck is the first point of contact by the bore front which creates a time variation at the instant of impact the time history plots from the individual test cases were synchronized by shifting them so the initial rise occurs at t 3 0 s after the gate opening time this provides a better way to compare the time history of the unskewed and skewed bridges this method of synchronization was applied to all the time history plots presented in this section figs 20 22 and 29 to 31 the time history of the streamwise force fig 20 shows a reduction of approximately 5 11 and 20 on average for the 10 20 and 30 skew angles respectively fig 20 also shows a decrease in the quasi steady part of the streamwise forces with the increase in the skew angle due to the larger surface area for the skewed bridge deck compared with the unskewed bridge deck fig 15 these findings are consistent with the study by wong 2015 in terms of the sensitivity of the streamwise forces to the skew angle however these findings are contradictory in terms of the duration of the initial rise and the magnitude of the streamwise forces wong 2015 found a longer duration for the initial rise and the same magnitude for the quasi steady part of the streamwise forces for different skew angles while in this study a decreasing trend was identified with the increase in the skew angle fig 20 video recordings showed a water diversion towards the flume sidewalls in the y direction due to the skewness of the bridge deck introducing a cross stream force component f y for the skewed bridge deck which is non existent for the unskewed box section bridge deck fig 21 the oscillations observed in the time history of the cross stream force for the unskewed bridge are due to the minor vibration of the bridge connections to the bottom base plate during the impact the magnitude of these oscillations is significantly lower than the measured cross stream forces for skewed bridges as shown in fig 21 similar to the unskewed box section bridge deck fig 16 an initial rise is observable in the time history plots of the vertical forces fig 22 the initial rise of the vertical force was found to be sensitive to the skew angle as seen in fig 22 which is consistent with the results presented by motley et al 2015 a reduction of 6 15 and 22 was observed for the 10 20 and 30 skew angles respectively the reduction of the initial uplift force could be due to the mechanism of the initial impact on the skewed bridge as in this case the tsunami bore hit one side of the bridge deck before reaching the other side the initial rise of the vertical force was followed by a sudden drastic reduction for the skewed bridge test cases compared with the unskewed bridge the time history plots show a decrease of approximately 55 in the vertical force for the unskewed bridge after the initial sudden rise fig 16 while in the test cases for skewed bridge this decrease was more than 90 as shown in fig 22 in other words the magnitude of the downward vertical force increases with the increase in the skew angle for the same bore strength and deck clearance h d a portion of the overtopped water hits the top surface of the unskewed bridge deck and the remaining portion joins the main flow downstream of the bridge model while for the skewed bridge test cases a larger amount of water hits the top surface of the deck due to its geometry the bore flow overtopped the front acute corner first and then hit both sides of the deck especially the side closer to the front obtuse corner therefore a larger amount of water overtops the skewed bridge deck and a smaller portion joins the main flow downstream of the bridge deck compared with the unskewed bridges this flow pattern could increase the downward vertical forces on the skewed bridge decks 3 7 characteristics of the tsunami forces for a skewed bridge deck the tsunami bore forces on a skewed bridge deck depend on the following parameters in this study 4 f f ρ g h b h d u b l l w l d s s θ where ρ is water density g is gravitational acceleration h b is bore height h d is deck clearance l l w l and d ss are deck dimensions and θ is the skew angle the maximum streamwise force was normalized as 0 5 ρ u b 2 a v where a v is the vertical projected area of the bridge deck the submergence ratio of the bridge deck s r was characterized as a dimensionless height parameter as follows 5 s r h b h d after eliminating the constant parameters ρ g l l w l and d ss and based on eq 5 eq 4 can be rewritten as follows 6 f f 0 5 ρ u b 2 a v f s r θ 3 8 equations for estimating tsunami forces on a skewed bridge deck this section provides a series of graphs to demonstrate the effect of the skew angle θ and the submergence ratio s r on the normalized streamwise tsunami bore induced forces fig 23 a shows a decreasing trend for the normalized streamwise force with the increase of the skew angle for the skewed box section bridge deck fig 23a also indicates that the reduction of the normalized streamwise force continued until it was levelled to approximately zero at the 90 skew angle a wide range of f x values varying from 0 5 to 1 5 was observed by different researchers iemura et al 2007 melville et al 2015 shoji et al 2011 yim boon intra et al 2011 fig 23b shows an increasing trend with the increase in the submergence ratio as the magnitude of the tsunami bore forces increased with the increase in the bore height hb and the decrease in the deck clearance hd the normalized streamwise force was found to be greater for the skewed box section bridge deck than for the deck girder section bridge as air was trapped in the voids between the girders and the air bubbles acted as a damper these findings are consistent with the numerical study carried out by yim boon intra et al 2011 the relationship between the normalized streamwise force and the dimensionless parameters tan θ and s r is expressed by eq 7 7 f x f x 0 5 ρ u b 2 a v e 1 25 tan θ ln s r fig 24 compares the streamwise forces measured by the load cell and those estimated by eq 7 for the skewed box section bridge deck the figure shows that the error of the proposed equation is less than 20 fig 25 a shows an increasing trend for the cross stream force with the increase of the skew angle for the skewed box section bridge fig 25a also indicates that the normalized cross stream force reaches its maximum value at the 90 skew angle no previous investigations of the value of f y were found during the literature review carried out for this study fig 25b shows an increasing trend for the normalized cross stream force with the increase in the submergence ratio the normalized cross stream force was found to be larger for the skewed box section deck than for the deck girder section the relationship between the normalized cross stream force and the dimensionless parameters cot θ and s r is expressed by eq 8 8 f y f y 0 5 ρ u b 2 a h e 0 4 cot θ ln s r fig 26 compares the maximum streamwise forces measured by the load cell with those estimated by eq 8 for the skewed box section bridge deck the figures show that the error of the proposed equation is in general less than 20 the normalized uplift force demonstrates a decreasing trend with the increase of the skew angle as shown in fig 27 a for the skewed box section bridge deck fig 27a also indicates that the reduction of the normalized uplift force continued until it was levelled to approximately zero at the 90 skew angle similar to f y no previous investigations of the value of f z were found during the literature review carried out for this study fig 27b shows that as the submergence ratio increases the normalized uplift force also increases the uplift force was normalized as cos θ 0 5 ρ u b 2 a h where a h is the horizontal projected area of the bridge deck the normalized uplift force was found to be greater for the skewed box section bridge deck than for the deck girder section bridge the relationship between the normalized uplift force and the dimensionless parameters tan θ and s r is expressed by eq 9 9 f z f z cos θ 0 5 ρ u b 2 a h c v u c θ e 0 3 tan θ ln s r where c vu is the coefficient of the vertical impulsive force with a value of 0 14 and c θ is the constant with values of 1 15 1 00 0 85 and 0 70 for the θ 0 θ 10 θ 20 and θ 30 respectively fig 28 compares the maximum uplift forces measured by the load cell with those estimated by eq 9 for the skewed box section bridge deck the figures show that the error of the proposed equation is less than 20 3 9 tsunami bore induced moments the measured rolling m x pitching m y and yawing moments m z are given in figs 29 31 respectively for the strong bore and different skew angles as mentioned previously section 3 5 the skew angle has an influence on the magnitude of the tsunami bore induced forces and moments on a skewed bridge deck mainly due to the different geometry and the angle between the longitudinal axis of the bridge deck and the direction of the incoming bore the front acute corner of the bridge deck is the first point hit by the bore front which lifts one side of the deck and rotates it around the flow direction m x subsequently the flow spreads across the entire span this lag in the period of initial impact introduces the yawing moment m z which rotates the bridge in the horizontal plane both m x and m z were non existent for the unskewed bridge deck the overall trend of the pitching moments shown in the time history plots is similar to the observed moments for the unskewed box section bridge deck the plots show a sudden rise that rapidly increases to a maximum soon after the first impact of the tsunami bore on the bridge structure motley et al 2015 wong 2015 the peak is followed by a gradual reduction of up to 50 on average for the 30 skew angle the time history plots of the pitching moments fig 30 show a reduction of approximately 7 15 and 24 on average for the 10 20 and 30 skew angles respectively similar to those observed for the streamwise force fig 20 as expected the asymmetrical geometry of the skewed bridge deck on both sides of the vertical plane of symmetry causes a water diversion towards the flume sidewalls in the y direction and a non synchronous impact in other words the bore flow direction is not perpendicular to the bridge deck longitudinal axis hitting one side of the bridge deck before the other side and introducing rolling and yawing moments m x and m z to the skewed bridge figs 29 and 31 that are non existent for the unskewed box section bridge deck the bore impact described above was captured on video recordings figs 29 and 31 show an increasing trend for the rolling and yawing moments respectively as the skew angle increases the observed oscillations in the time history of the rolling and yawing moments for the unskewed bridge are due to the minor vibration of the bridge connections to the bottom base plate during the impact similar to the time history of the cross stream forces 4 conclusions the literature review of available guidelines revealed the lack of a consensus regarding the general form of the equations and the types of tsunami load on bridges therefore this study has attempted to address some of these shortcomings this work has presented an experimental study of the impact of a tsunami bore on a box type bridge deck with different bore strengths bore heights and bore velocities skew angles and deck clearances the experimental results were presented in terms of the horizontal i e streamwise and cross stream and vertical forces and their corresponding moments applied to the bridge deck the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a good agreement was observed between the forces measured by the load cell and the pressure transducers particularly for the initial rise in the streamwise force observed in the time history plots the available guidance for tsunami loadings recommends a theoretical calculation of the streamwise force as the sum of the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces however this study indicates that the streamwise force applied to a bridge deck is mainly correlated with the tsunami bore flow velocity hydrodynamic force and to a lesser extent to the tsunami bore height hydrostatic force this study suggests a drag coefficient of 2 0 for the maximum hydrodynamic force after bore impact which is consistent with the recommended drag coefficients in the literature the bore front region reaches one side of the skewed bridge deck before the other side but reaches both sides of the upstream edge of the unskewed bridge deck simultaneously this phenomenon introduces a cross stream force f y and rolling and yawing moments m x and m z which are non existent for the unskewed bridge the results showed a decreasing trend for the streamwise and uplift forces f x and f z and the pitching moment m y with the increase in the skew angle on the other hand an increasing trend was observed for the cross stream force f y and rolling m x and yawing moments m z with the increase in the skew angle the time history plots of the vertical force show an initial uplift force followed by a downward vertical force the initial rise of the uplift force was found to be sensitive to the skew angle and a reduction of 6 15 and 22 was observed for the 10 20 and 30 skew angles respectively for the same bore strength and deck clearance h d a portion of the overtopped water hits the top surface of the unskewed bridge deck and the remaining water joins the main flow downstream of the bridge model while for the skewed bridge a larger amount of water hits the top surface of the deck due to its geometry leading to a larger downward vertical force on the skewed bridge deck the results of this study suggest that the equation u b α u g h b 0 5 with α u values of 2 4 gives a reasonable estimation of the bore velocity in terms of the bore height it is recommended that further experimental or numerical investigation is required to determine the relationship between the applied forces and moments on the bridge deck credit authorship contribution

20987,tsunamis in indonesia 2004 and japan 2011 severely affected communities bordering the indian ocean and japan s east coast despite the plausible findings arising from the available studies the research on the impact of tsunami bore forces applied to bridges of different designs is limited this is because the estimation methods for tsunami induced loads presented in the literature have mainly been developed for buildings and require careful adaptation to apply to bridges the main focus of the present study is to experimentally examine the interaction between a tsunami bore and a box section bridge with different orientations to the direction of the incoming bore bore strengths and deck clearances the experiments were conducted in a 15 m long 1 2 m wide and 1 2 m deep wave flume the forces and pressures applied to the bridge the bore heights and the velocities were measured it was found that the skewed bridge deck is subjected to additional force and moment components namely the cross stream force f y and the rolling and yawing moments m x and m z these components are non existent for the unskewed bridge deck based on the experimental results equations were proposed for estimating tsunami forces for a box section bridge deck keywords tsunami bore skewed box section bridge deck force moment pressure 1 introduction tsunamis are a product of the vertical displacements of a column of water resulting from natural phenomena such as earthquakes volcanic eruptions and landslides the worst tsunamis notably indonesia 2004 chile 2010 and tohoku in japan 2011 led to extensive destruction of human life property and infrastructure tsunamis vary in characteristics and cause leading to different extents of damage on the coastline and inland the variables include geometry topography orientation and configuration of the shoreline as well as the direction of the arriving ocean waves yeh 1991 the cause also defines the manifestation of the tsunamis with the worst cases coming from earthquakes and volcanic eruptions the coastlines are often utilized as resources that accommodate residential and commercial structures coastal areas in the pacific and indian ocean regions have in the past experienced different indices of tsunami that uncover gaps and deficiencies in planning and preparation during the tohoku tsunami 2011 more than 300 nearshore bridges were washed away thus impeding the rescue processes and medical aid aglipay et al 2011 the unpredictability of occurrence coupled with the devastating effects of tsunami events necessitates the design and development of tsunami resistant structures early detection and warning systems and evacuation plans to minimize the extent of damage during and after tsunami events with the progressive development of design guidelines for tsunamis for coastal structures such as guidelines for design of structures for vertical evacuation from tsunamis or federal emergency management agency fema p646 developed by the fema in the usa heintz mahoney fema 2012 the city and county of honolulu building code cch 2000 and 7 16 minimum design loads and associated criteria for buildings and other structures asce 2016 failing to address the impact of tsunami induced forces on bridges experimental investigations are critical in developing more efficient and resilient structural design codes for bridges to facilitate these advancements a broader comprehension of the tsunami bore impact force on critical infrastructure within tsunami inundation zones is imperative gathering from a historical perspective tsunamis exhibit different forms depending on the location and its characteristics as a result the effect of tsunami bore forces on different structures has been subjected to investigation for several decades some of the first studies on the effects of tsunamis on bridges were conducted by kataoka et al 2006 and shoji and mori 2006 kataoka kusakabe et al 2006 investigated the effect of wave forces applied to a bridge deck breaking non breaking and broken waves were the wave scenarios evaluated in their experiments their findings showed that the magnitude of the impulsive force depends on the tsunami wave condition and are in agreement with the results obtained by nouri et al 2010 and ikeno et al 2001 an experimental and numerical investigation was conducted by shoji et al 2011 to evaluate the horizontal and vertical tsunami wave pressures due to the japan tsunami of march 2011 on nine bridge decks that were completely washed away the authors observed a higher tsunami wave pressure than the value reported by kataoka et al 2006 whose model assumed very thin bridge piers which resulted in a reduction of the tsunami induced loads lukkunaprasit and lau 2011 investigated the effect of the tsunami bore induced pressure on a bridge using a complete pier and deck model the results showed an increase of up to 50 on the horizontal pressures applied to the bridge pier of the model which means that the results of the experiments on a standalone pier are not conservative for design purposes lukkunaprasit and lau 2011 kosa nii et al 2010 analyzed two tsunami wave types namely broken waves and unbroken waves on a 1 50 scale bridge deck representing a bridge damaged during the 2004 indian ocean tsunami kosa nii et al 2010 indicated that the streamwise wave force was smaller than the uplift force for an unbroken wave which is the opposite of the broken wave reviewing the past studies and their findings revealed that understanding the distribution of tsunami induced forces on bridges is essential for an economic and safe design several methods have been proposed by researchers for estimating tsunami forces on bridges and buildings as follows a wind driven wave forces on

hydraulic equations yokoi et al 2013 f the existing requirements of the new zealand transport agency nzta bridge manual for the consideration of tsunami effects on bridges melville shamseldin et al 2014 2015 the main limitation of the wind driven wave approach is that the characteristics of tsunami bores are different from the characteristics of wind driven waves particularly their spatial and temporal scales yim et al 2014 despite the plausible findings arising from the studies research on the impact of tsunami bore forces on bridges of different designs is limited this is because the estimation methods presented have been developed mainly for buildings and require careful adaptation to apply to bridges livermore 2014 the application of the guidance for tsunami loads on buildings to bridges has two main limitations the first limitation is that the reference level for the heights to estimate the tsunami loads on buildings is the ground level of the building while for a bridge this is the underside of the deck the other limitation is the projected area of the structure at right angles to the flow direction which is smaller for a bridge than for a building the tsunami bore flows around a building rather than above or below the structure as is the case of a bridge the lack of proper guidelines to understand the interactions between bridges and tsunami bores highlights the importance of further experimental investigation of tsunami bridge interactions on the development of tsunami resistant bridges kihara et al 2015 in more recent years investigations carried out after major tsunami events provided evidence of the unseating of the deck as a result of vertical hydrodynamic forces and buoyancy effects on submerged and partially submerged bridges aglipay et al 2011 motley et al 2015 post tsunami reconnaissance observations revealed that bridges that were not washed away by the 2011 japan tsunami had concrete decks with wider roadways and shallower girder heights or reinforced concrete moment resisting frames akiyama et al 2013 in addition surveys on the great east japan earthquake 2011 carried out by kawashima et al 2011 concluded that based on weight steel bridges are more susceptible to damage than concrete bridges studies on the damage of bridges and roadways highlight the importance of structural elements such as embankments and how they affect the flow characteristics murakami et al 2012 and the resulting heavy scouring at both abutments at the upstream side of a bridge iemura et al 2005 these studies highlight the importance of the geometry and the type of bridge in minimizing the risk of failure due to a tsunami impact on a bridge deck motley et al 2015 analyzed the dynamics of a bore type tsunami loading on a bridge model using a 3d computational fluids dynamics approach and showed how the skew angle of the bridge deck relative to the incoming wave could affect the loading history motley wong et al 2015 noted that a 2d analysis would fail to capture the 3d effects from the bridge geometry and the local bathymetry motley wong et al 2015 highlighted the lack of physical modeling in the prediction of tsunami loads on skewed bridges skewed bridges are commonly used to cross roadways waterways railways or landscape features that are not perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of a bridge at the intersection skewed bridges are characterized by their skew angle defined as the angle between a line normal to the centerline of the bridge and the centerline of the support abutment or pier this paper attempts to provide a more detailed experimental investigation regarding the effects of the tsunami bore impact on a skewed box section bridge deck with various skew angles there are limited research studies investigating the effect of tsunami induced forces on skewed bridges using numerical modeling and that there is no study focusing on the physical modeling the effect of tsunami induced forces on skewed bridges this paper presents the experimental results of the measurement of tsunami induced forces and moments on a skewed box section bridge deck measurements of the bore height and velocity were taken upstream of the bridge model in the flume the applied streamwise forces were numerically modeled using equations available in the literature by applying relevant drag coefficients based on the experimental results equations were proposed for estimating tsunami streamwise cross stream and uplift forces for a box section bridge deck 2 experimental set up 2 1 facility a 15 m long 1 2 m wide and 1 2 m deep wave flume connected to a 6 4 m long 5 5 m wide and 1 2 m deep reservoir made of concrete block walls was used fig 1 based on the analogies between a tsunami induced bore and a dam break flow described in the literature chanson 2006 a dam break hydraulic bore was used in this study to simulate the tsunami bore this approach has been extensively used by researchers chen et al 2016 nandasena and tanaka 2013 nouri et al 2010 shafiei et al 2016 the flume is equipped with an automatic gate to generate a tsunami bore the flume has a horizontal bottom of moderately smooth concrete to enable the simulation of tsunami bore propagation over a flat dry bed the flume is emptied using the drain gate and the drain channel the 1 2 m wide and 1 2 m high automatic gate consists of a sliding gate which opens rapidly providing near instantaneous water release fig 2 it is timed to remain open for 4 0 s before closing automatically a computer operated hydraulic piston actuator lifts the sliding gate rapidly the opening height of the sliding gate is adjustable combinations of various gate opening heights and water depths in the reservoir enable the generation of different bore strengths 2 2 instrumentation five capacitance type wave gauges were placed 15 mm above the flume floor at the center of the flume along its length to measure the depth of the flow and observe the bore propagation the first wave gauge wg1 was placed 6 7 m downstream of the gate with the remaining gauges wg2 to wg5 equally spaced 1 5 m apart over a total distance of 12 7 m downstream of the gate the last wave gauge was placed 0 5 m upstream of the bridge model fig 3 the approaching bore featured a sloping front which is typical for such experiments the recorded time at which the bore struck each wave gauge was used to calculate the bore velocity the time of the first non zero reading at each wave gauge was taken as the time of the bore arrival the wave gauges were logged at 1 khz the water depth behind the sloping front of the approaching bore was used to measure the bore height pressure sensors honeywell 26 pc series were used to measure the streamwise pressures applied to the bridge deck the pressure sensors had a capacity of 34 47 kpa with a precision of 0 043 kpa and a response time of 1 ms each pressure sensor was fitted with two flexible transparent plastic tubes and the pressure difference between these tubes was measured one tube was placed to sense the reference pressure while the other tube was mounted flush with the surface of the structure the tubes were filled with water and checked for air bubble removal before each experiment the load cell utilized in this experimental study was a jr3 multi axis waterproof load cell model 75e20a4 with the positive x axis aligned with the flow direction fig 4 the load cell was placed underneath the flume floor in a recess to allow the base of the bridge model to be level with the floor of the flume a 6 6 calibration matrix was provided to convert the output signals to force values shafiei et al 2016 2 3 experimental procedure for the experiments the reservoir was filled to depths of 700 900 or 1100 mm and the sliding gate was lifted to a constant height of either 200 300 400 or 500 mm the dimensions of the bridge model were obtained as simple averages of the scaled measurements of five actual bridges across new zealand the bridge model was located 13 2 m downstream of the vertical sliding gate that controls the water release and creates different bore strengths three representative cases case b1 h b 290 mm case b9 h b 210 mm and case b13 h b 160 mm were selected to demonstrate the experimental results these cases cover the range of bore strengths in this study and will be hereafter referred to as strong bore case b1 moderate bore case b9 and weak bore case b13 a box section bridge deck was tested with different bore heights deck clearances and skew angles with five repetitions for each experiment overall 64 individual test cases were conducted to characterize the impact loads of a tsunami bore on this type of bridge deck table 1 lists four different combinations of gate opening heights go and reservoir water depths wl used to generate the experimental test cases with varying bore heights h b and velocities u b a model of a box section bridge was used to quantify the tsunami induced loads fig 5a b c and 6 with different combinations of bore strengths and deck clearances another geometric parameter the skew angle was investigated to determine its effect on the time history of the tsunami induced loads on the box section bridge deck as shown in figs 7 and 8 a box section bridge deck with skew angles of 10 20 and 30 was used in the flume to perform the experiments the skew angles were created by rotating the bridge span around its geometric centroid while keeping it in the same position in relation to the incoming bore the bridge pier remained the same for all the bridge models the corners of the bridge deck were named based on their location front or back of the bridge and the size of the angle acute or obtuse wong 2015 the front acute corner and back obtuse corner were located on the right side of the flume for the box section bridge deck fig 8 3 results and discussion froude scale modeling was used to convert model measurements to prototype quantities geometrical similarity was based on an assumption that the maximum average bore height generated in this study is equivalent to approximately 11 5 m ﬂow depth inundation depth during a real tsunami this assumption is based on ﬁeld measurements of ﬂow depth of previous tsunami events bryant 2014 the assumption resulted in a geometrical similarity scale of 1 40 for this study the 1 40 box section bridge model representing a typical bridge constructed in new zealand was used to perform the experiments dimensions of a typical bridge were obtained as simple averages of the measurements from five actual bridges located at kakanui river otago kowhai river canterbury ngaruroro river diversion hawkes bay and waimakariri river belfast and canterbury a box section bridge deck was tested with different bore heights deck clearances and skew angles with five repetitions for each experiment overall 64 individual test cases were conducted to characterize the impact loads of a tsunami bore on this type of bridge deck 3 1 bore characteristics in the present study the bore front profile was captured by capacitance type wave gauges the time history of the generated bores was recorded at each wave gauge along the flume the measured bore height at each wave gauge location resulted in less than 3 variation over the five repetitions of the experiment as shown in fig 9 for case b1 confirming the ability of the experimental setup to repeatedly generate the same bore fig 10 shows the bore front profile over 4 m from its leading front the graph is consistent with the analytical solution presented by chanson 2006 the approaching bore featured a sloping front which is typical for such experiments as expected higher water depths in the reservoir and higher gate opening heights resulted in higher bores and greater velocities being recorded the generated bore took about 3 3 4 4 s depending on the velocity to travel the length of the flume and reach the bridge model the bore velocities in individual experiments ranged from 3 0 to 4 05 m s corresponding to prototype velocities ranging from 19 to 25 6 m s to the best of the authors knowledge the highest reported velocity was estimated to be 20 m s during the grand banks tsunami bryant 2014 and the highest velocity at prototype scale in this study is approx 25 m s which was due to the limitations associated with the physical tests however the following equation shows that the bore flow characteristics of this study are within the range of the recommended values in the literature the following equation was proposed by different studies to estimate the velocity of a tsunami bore ub as a function of bore height h b 1 u b α u g h b 0 5 where u b is the bore velocity h b is the bore height g is the gravitational acceleration and α u is a constant different values of α u ranging from 0 67 to 3 00 have been proposed by different studies to calculate the bore velocity bryant 2014 heintz and mahoney 2008 iizuka and matsutomi 2000 kirkoz 1983 lukkunaprasit et al 2009 matsutomi and okamoto 2010 t murty 1977 t s murty 1977 nandasena and tanaka 2013 robertson et al 2013 robertson et al 2008 shafiei et al 2016 a α u value of 2 4 was identified in this study which is within the range of recommended values in the literature 3 2 tsunami flow generation over the unskewed bridge deck fig 11 shows a photograph looking upstream taken during bore impingement in the experiments where the bridge deck is perpendicular to the flow direction i e the unskewed box section bridge deck as shown in fig 11 the height of the overtopping above the bridge deck is approximately ten times the deck height the turbulence nature of the bore front during the test divided the impact process into two main stages 1 initial impact and 2 fully inundated condition which is consistent with the findings of azadbakht and yim 2014 and shafiei et al 2016 soon after the first arrival of the bore at the bridge location fig 12 a the water free surface elevation starts to overtop the bridge deck fig 12b the bore flow rapidly becomes quasi steady fig 12c with flow under and over the bridge deck across its full width the amount of water accumulation varies depending on the deck clearance and the bore strength in the case of especially strong bores the overtopped water joins the flow at the downstream side of the bridge instead of ponding on the top surface of the deck a few seconds after the initial bore impact the water level begins to decrease upstream of the bridge model starting the recession stage fig 12d finally the water free surface elevation drops below the bridge deck indicating the end of the experiment 3 3 tsunami bore induced pressures on the unskewed deck fig 13 a b and c show the averaged streamwise pressures over five repetitions at the different sensor locations p 1 p 2 and p 3 for different bore strengths on the unskewed deck the locations of the pressure sensors are shown in fig 5b the time history plots show a sudden increase in the streamwise pressure due to the bore impact resulting from the sloping bore front region cooker and peregrine 1995 hattori et al 1994 okamura 1993 fig 13a b and c also show a reduction of up to 35 of the initial maximum impulsive pressure due to the accumulation of water on the upstream side of the bridge deck these results are consistent with previous studies carried out by azadbakht and yim 2014 motley et al 2015 and wong 2015 in fig 13a b and c t 0 0 s represents the time of gate opening but the individual time history plots have been shifted along the time axis so that the initial positive pressure always occurs at t 3 0 s fig 14 displays the averages of the maximum streamwise force measured from five repetitions of the experiment i e each data point is a representation of five tests and the forces calculated from the integration of the streamwise pressure measured using the pressure sensors mounted on the front face of the bridge deck using the equation f x p d a where f x is the streamwise force p is the measured streamwise pressure by the pressure sensors and a is the projected area of the bridge deck the correlation between the measured and calculated forces shown in fig 14 demonstrates the validity of the force and the pressure measurement techniques used in this study 3 4 tsunami bore induced forces on the unskewed deck the multi axis load cell at the base of the structure was used to the measure the forces and moments applied to the bridge figs 15 17 present the typical time history plots of the streamwise and uplift forces and the pitching moment for the three representative test cases strong moderate and weak bores respectively as the bore strength increased the magnitude of the forces f x and f z and moments m y also increased which is consistent with the findings of past studies azadbakht and yim 2014 wong 2015 as the bore front hit the bridge deck there was a sudden increase in the magnitude of the streamwise and uplift forces this was due to the bore impact resulting from the sloping bore front region and the accumulation of water on the upstream side of the bridge deck the initial rise i e the impulsive streamwise force occurred before the quasi steady streamwise force was fully developed which took around 1 s in the experiments once the bore flow was fully developed a gradual reduction occurred after the impulsive rise of the streamwise force as shown by the time history in fig 15 the decline was more pronounced at a lower bore strength i e the weak bore the measured streamwise force applied to a stand alone pier was subtracted from the total measured force on the deck pier structure to calculate the forces applied only to the deck the streamwise force applied to the stand alone pier ranged from 10 to 20 of the total streamwise force of the deck pier structure depending on the bore strength and the pier height the hydrodynamic force resulting from the resistance of the bridge deck against the bore flow and the hydrostatic force caused by the difference between the water levels upstream and downstream of the bridge were the two factors exerting the streamwise forces on the bridge deck the magnitude of the quasi steady part of the streamwise force shown in fig 15 is expected to be correlated to the tsunami bore flow velocity and to a lesser extent to the tsunami bore height the total streamwise force fht is equal to the sum of the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces which is consistent with information available from the literature cross 1967 nouri 2008 shafiei et al 2016 yokoi et al 2013 yokoi tamakoshi et al 2013 recommended the following equations to estimate the hydrodynamic and total streamwise forces 2 f h d 1 2 c d ρ u b 2 a v 3 f h t f h s f h d where f ht is the total streamwise force f hs is the hydrostatic streamwise force f hd is the hydrodynamic streamwise force ρ is the water density h d is the deck clearance c d is the drag coefficient u b is the bore velocity and a v is the vertical projected area of the model this is the same approach used by kosa et al 2010 ohmori et al 2000 and also adopted by yeh 2007 for estimating tsunami bore induced loads on a bridge model the inundated area of the front face of the bridge deck was used to calculate the hydrostatic force for the strong bore case as shown in fig 18 the magnitude of the hydrostatic component was found to be negligible compared with the hydrodynamic component the values of the drag coefficients for a bridge deck recommended in the literature range from 1 0 to 2 2 arneson 2013 asce 2016 lau et al 2011 melville et al 2015 yim boon intra et al 2011 yokoi et al 2013 the application of eq 2 to the calculated hydrodynamic force gave a c d value of 2 0 for this study which is consistent with the drag coefficients recommended in the literature the time history plots of the vertical force exerted on the bridge deck are shown in fig 16 as seen in fig 16 a sudden initial rise is evident resulting from an increase in pressure under the bridge deck at the time of the bore arrival the initial impulsive force is sometimes identified as a hydrodynamic uplift force livermore 2014 the initial rise of the uplift force was followed by a decline due to the overtopping and ponding of water on the top of the bridge deck which could be the dominant component of the vertical force depending on the bore strength similar to the streamwise force the downward vertical force is the sum of the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces the weight of the water on the top surface of the bridge deck corresponds to the hydrostatic component and the water flowing over the bridge deck corresponds to the hydrodynamic component as fig 16 indicates the resulting vertical force is positive for the stronger bores i e the uplift force is greater than the downward vertical force and starts to decrease for the weaker bores due to the smaller uplift pressure on the underside of the bridge deck in addition as the bore height increases the overtopped water tends to join the flow downstream of the bridge instead of ponding on the top surface of the bridge deck resulting in a smaller downward vertical force for the stronger bores fig 17 shows the time history of the pitching moment measured on the bridge for the three representative cases the figure shows that the shape of the time history of the pitching moment is similar to the time history of the measured streamwise force shown in fig 15 however the pitching moment is the product of both streamwise and uplift forces further numerical simulation is required to determine the relation between the pitching moment and the streamwise and uplift forces fig 18 shows the time history of the streamwise force measured by the load cell averaged from five repetitions the force calculated from the integration of the measured pressure and the hydrostatic hydrodynamic and total streamwise forces the hydrodynamic and total horizontal forces were estimated using eqs 2 and 3 with a drag coefficient of 2 0 for the quasi steady part of the streamwise force calculated from integration from 4 0 to 7 0 s as shown in the time history there were some minor differences that could have been due to the influence of the local bore flow patterns around the pressure sensors nouri et al 2010 the time history plots in fig 18 show consistency between the quasi steady part of the measured and the calculated total streamwise forces fig 18 also shows that the hydrostatic force is an order of magnitude lower than the hydrodynamic force and could be neglected which is in agreement with heintz and mahoney fema 2012 3 5 tsunami flow generation over the skewed bridge deck similar to the unskewed box section bridge deck the impact process was divided into two main stages 1 initial impact and 2 fully inundated condition which are explained in detail in section 3 2 fig 19 a and b show the bore front region impact on the unskewed and skewed bridge decks respectively the bore front hit one side of the deck before the other side in the case of a skewed bridge deck creating a different overtopping process at the instant of the impact compared with an unskewed bridge deck this different mechanism of the initial impact creates a cross stream force f y and rolling and yawing moments m x and m z in addition to the streamwise and uplift forces f x and f z and pitching moment m y observed on the unskewed bridge deck 3 6 tsunami bore induced forces applied to the skewed bridge deck the overall trends of the streamwise and vertical forces shown in the time history plots are identical to the measured forces for the unskewed box section bridge deck as explained in section 3 4 the peak streamwise force is followed by a gradual reduction of approximately 25 on average for all the test cases regardless of the skew angle the front acute corner of the bridge deck is the first point of contact by the bore front which creates a time variation at the instant of impact the time history plots from the individual test cases were synchronized by shifting them so the initial rise occurs at t 3 0 s after the gate opening time this provides a better way to compare the time history of the unskewed and skewed bridges this method of synchronization was applied to all the time history plots presented in this section figs 20 22 and 29 to 31 the time history of the streamwise force fig 20 shows a reduction of approximately 5 11 and 20 on average for the 10 20 and 30 skew angles respectively fig 20 also shows a decrease in the quasi steady part of the streamwise forces with the increase in the skew angle due to the larger surface area for the skewed bridge deck compared with the unskewed bridge deck fig 15 these findings are consistent with the study by wong 2015 in terms of the sensitivity of the streamwise forces to the skew angle however these findings are contradictory in terms of the duration of the initial rise and the magnitude of the streamwise forces wong 2015 found a longer duration for the initial rise and the same magnitude for the quasi steady part of the streamwise forces for different skew angles while in this study a decreasing trend was identified with the increase in the skew angle fig 20 video recordings showed a water diversion towards the flume sidewalls in the y direction due to the skewness of the bridge deck introducing a cross stream force component f y for the skewed bridge deck which is non existent for the unskewed box section bridge deck fig 21 the oscillations observed in the time history of the cross stream force for the unskewed bridge are due to the minor vibration of the bridge connections to the bottom base plate during the impact the magnitude of these oscillations is significantly lower than the measured cross stream forces for skewed bridges as shown in fig 21 similar to the unskewed box section bridge deck fig 16 an initial rise is observable in the time history plots of the vertical forces fig 22 the initial rise of the vertical force was found to be sensitive to the skew angle as seen in fig 22 which is consistent with the results presented by motley et al 2015 a reduction of 6 15 and 22 was observed for the 10 20 and 30 skew angles respectively the reduction of the initial uplift force could be due to the mechanism of the initial impact on the skewed bridge as in this case the tsunami bore hit one side of the bridge deck before reaching the other side the initial rise of the vertical force was followed by a sudden drastic reduction for the skewed bridge test cases compared with the unskewed bridge the time history plots show a decrease of approximately 55 in the vertical force for the unskewed bridge after the initial sudden rise fig 16 while in the test cases for skewed bridge this decrease was more than 90 as shown in fig 22 in other words the magnitude of the downward vertical force increases with the increase in the skew angle for the same bore strength and deck clearance h d a portion of the overtopped water hits the top surface of the unskewed bridge deck and the remaining portion joins the main flow downstream of the bridge model while for the skewed bridge test cases a larger amount of water hits the top surface of the deck due to its geometry the bore flow overtopped the front acute corner first and then hit both sides of the deck especially the side closer to the front obtuse corner therefore a larger amount of water overtops the skewed bridge deck and a smaller portion joins the main flow downstream of the bridge deck compared with the unskewed bridges this flow pattern could increase the downward vertical forces on the skewed bridge decks 3 7 characteristics of the tsunami forces for a skewed bridge deck the tsunami bore forces on a skewed bridge deck depend on the following parameters in this study 4 f f ρ g h b h d u b l l w l d s s θ where ρ is water density g is gravitational acceleration h b is bore height h d is deck clearance l l w l and d ss are deck dimensions and θ is the skew angle the maximum streamwise force was normalized as 0 5 ρ u b 2 a v where a v is the vertical projected area of the bridge deck the submergence ratio of the bridge deck s r was characterized as a dimensionless height parameter as follows 5 s r h b h d after eliminating the constant parameters ρ g l l w l and d ss and based on eq 5 eq 4 can be rewritten as follows 6 f f 0 5 ρ u b 2 a v f s r θ 3 8 equations for estimating tsunami forces on a skewed bridge deck this section provides a series of graphs to demonstrate the effect of the skew angle θ and the submergence ratio s r on the normalized streamwise tsunami bore induced forces fig 23 a shows a decreasing trend for the normalized streamwise force with the increase of the skew angle for the skewed box section bridge deck fig 23a also indicates that the reduction of the normalized streamwise force continued until it was levelled to approximately zero at the 90 skew angle a wide range of f x values varying from 0 5 to 1 5 was observed by different researchers iemura et al 2007 melville et al 2015 shoji et al 2011 yim boon intra et al 2011 fig 23b shows an increasing trend with the increase in the submergence ratio as the magnitude of the tsunami bore forces increased with the increase in the bore height hb and the decrease in the deck clearance hd the normalized streamwise force was found to be greater for the skewed box section bridge deck than for the deck girder section bridge as air was trapped in the voids between the girders and the air bubbles acted as a damper these findings are consistent with the numerical study carried out by yim boon intra et al 2011 the relationship between the normalized streamwise force and the dimensionless parameters tan θ and s r is expressed by eq 7 7 f x f x 0 5 ρ u b 2 a v e 1 25 tan θ ln s r fig 24 compares the streamwise forces measured by the load cell and those estimated by eq 7 for the skewed box section bridge deck the figure shows that the error of the proposed equation is less than 20 fig 25 a shows an increasing trend for the cross stream force with the increase of the skew angle for the skewed box section bridge fig 25a also indicates that the normalized cross stream force reaches its maximum value at the 90 skew angle no previous investigations of the value of f y were found during the literature review carried out for this study fig 25b shows an increasing trend for the normalized cross stream force with the increase in the submergence ratio the normalized cross stream force was found to be larger for the skewed box section deck than for the deck girder section the relationship between the normalized cross stream force and the dimensionless parameters cot θ and s r is expressed by eq 8 8 f y f y 0 5 ρ u b 2 a h e 0 4 cot θ ln s r fig 26 compares the maximum streamwise forces measured by the load cell with those estimated by eq 8 for the skewed box section bridge deck the figures show that the error of the proposed equation is in general less than 20 the normalized uplift force demonstrates a decreasing trend with the increase of the skew angle as shown in fig 27 a for the skewed box section bridge deck fig 27a also indicates that the reduction of the normalized uplift force continued until it was levelled to approximately zero at the 90 skew angle similar to f y no previous investigations of the value of f z were found during the literature review carried out for this study fig 27b shows that as the submergence ratio increases the normalized uplift force also increases the uplift force was normalized as cos θ 0 5 ρ u b 2 a h where a h is the horizontal projected area of the bridge deck the normalized uplift force was found to be greater for the skewed box section bridge deck than for the deck girder section bridge the relationship between the normalized uplift force and the dimensionless parameters tan θ and s r is expressed by eq 9 9 f z f z cos θ 0 5 ρ u b 2 a h c v u c θ e 0 3 tan θ ln s r where c vu is the coefficient of the vertical impulsive force with a value of 0 14 and c θ is the constant with values of 1 15 1 00 0 85 and 0 70 for the θ 0 θ 10 θ 20 and θ 30 respectively fig 28 compares the maximum uplift forces measured by the load cell with those estimated by eq 9 for the skewed box section bridge deck the figures show that the error of the proposed equation is less than 20 3 9 tsunami bore induced moments the measured rolling m x pitching m y and yawing moments m z are given in figs 29 31 respectively for the strong bore and different skew angles as mentioned previously section 3 5 the skew angle has an influence on the magnitude of the tsunami bore induced forces and moments on a skewed bridge deck mainly due to the different geometry and the angle between the longitudinal axis of the bridge deck and the direction of the incoming bore the front acute corner of the bridge deck is the first point hit by the bore front which lifts one side of the deck and rotates it around the flow direction m x subsequently the flow spreads across the entire span this lag in the period of initial impact introduces the yawing moment m z which rotates the bridge in the horizontal plane both m x and m z were non existent for the unskewed bridge deck the overall trend of the pitching moments shown in the time history plots is similar to the observed moments for the unskewed box section bridge deck the plots show a sudden rise that rapidly increases to a maximum soon after the first impact of the tsunami bore on the bridge structure motley et al 2015 wong 2015 the peak is followed by a gradual reduction of up to 50 on average for the 30 skew angle the time history plots of the pitching moments fig 30 show a reduction of approximately 7 15 and 24 on average for the 10 20 and 30 skew angles respectively similar to those observed for the streamwise force fig 20 as expected the asymmetrical geometry of the skewed bridge deck on both sides of the vertical plane of symmetry causes a water diversion towards the flume sidewalls in the y direction and a non synchronous impact in other words the bore flow direction is not perpendicular to the bridge deck longitudinal axis hitting one side of the bridge deck before the other side and introducing rolling and yawing moments m x and m z to the skewed bridge figs 29 and 31 that are non existent for the unskewed box section bridge deck the bore impact described above was captured on video recordings figs 29 and 31 show an increasing trend for the rolling and yawing moments respectively as the skew angle increases the observed oscillations in the time history of the rolling and yawing moments for the unskewed bridge are due to the minor vibration of the bridge connections to the bottom base plate during the impact similar to the time history of the cross stream forces 4 conclusions the literature review of available guidelines revealed the lack of a consensus regarding the general form of the equations and the types of tsunami load on bridges therefore this study has attempted to address some of these shortcomings this work has presented an experimental study of the impact of a tsunami bore on a box type bridge deck with different bore strengths bore heights and bore velocities skew angles and deck clearances the experimental results were presented in terms of the horizontal i e streamwise and cross stream and vertical forces and their corresponding moments applied to the bridge deck the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a good agreement was observed between the forces measured by the load cell and the pressure transducers particularly for the initial rise in the streamwise force observed in the time history plots the available guidance for tsunami loadings recommends a theoretical calculation of the streamwise force as the sum of the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces however this study indicates that the streamwise force applied to a bridge deck is mainly correlated with the tsunami bore flow velocity hydrodynamic force and to a lesser extent to the tsunami bore height hydrostatic force this study suggests a drag coefficient of 2 0 for the maximum hydrodynamic force after bore impact which is consistent with the recommended drag coefficients in the literature the bore front region reaches one side of the skewed bridge deck before the other side but reaches both sides of the upstream edge of the unskewed bridge deck simultaneously this phenomenon introduces a cross stream force f y and rolling and yawing moments m x and m z which are non existent for the unskewed bridge the results showed a decreasing trend for the streamwise and uplift forces f x and f z and the pitching moment m y with the increase in the skew angle on the other hand an increasing trend was observed for the cross stream force f y and rolling m x and yawing moments m z with the increase in the skew angle the time history plots of the vertical force show an initial uplift force followed by a downward vertical force the initial rise of the uplift force was found to be sensitive to the skew angle and a reduction of 6 15 and 22 was observed for the 10 20 and 30 skew angles respectively for the same bore strength and deck clearance h d a portion of the overtopped water hits the top surface of the unskewed bridge deck and the remaining water joins the main flow downstream of the bridge model while for the skewed bridge a larger amount of water hits the top surface of the deck due to its geometry leading to a larger downward vertical force on the skewed bridge deck the results of this study suggest that the equation u b α u g h b 0 5 with α u values of 2 4 gives a reasonable estimation of the bore velocity in terms of the bore height it is recommended that further experimental or numerical investigation is required to determine the relationship between the applied forces and moments on the bridge deck credit authorship contribution

20988,a numerical model newtank has been developed to study two layered liquid sloshing under horizontal external excitations the model solves spatially averaged nses on a non inertial coordinate for external excitations the two step projection method is employed in numerical solutions and the poisson equation for pressure field is solved by bi cgstab technique a multi layered volume of fluid method is proposed to track both free surface and interface between layered liquids simultaneously in order to validate the accuracy of the model the simulated results of sloshing responses are compared with linear analytical solutions and experimental data good agreements are obtained when response amplitude is within linear regime however when nonlinearity becomes strong deviation from analytical solution will be large due to nonlinear energy transfer from the primary mode to higher modes further investigation reveals that for two layered liquid sloshing there exist two natural frequencies with the smaller one related to response of lower layer liquid and the larger one upper layer therefore different external excitation frequencies may induce upper layer resonance lower layer resonance or resonances of both layers each of which exhibits very different patterns of energy transport between modes and layers finally a violent 3 d sloshing with broken free surface and interface is simulated and discussed keywords layered liquid sloshing multiphase flow multi layered vof method analytical solution non inertial reference frame nonlinear energy transfer 1 introduction sloshing is the phenomenon that the liquid inside a partially filled container is prone to wave motion under external excitations it is well known that when the frequency of external excitations is equal to or near the natural frequency of liquid in the tank the resonant response of sloshing can be violent and the resulting impact pressure on the wall may be so large that it causes damage to the container ibrahim 2005 therefore this phenomenon attracts much attentions in many areas involving liquid transport many researchers have devoted their efforts to investigate liquid sloshing with single layer in the last a few decades by adopting theoretical solution faltinsen et al 2000 zhang et al 2014 experiments akyildiz and ünal 2005 armenio and la rocca 1996 and numerical models cao et al 2014 chen and nokes 2005 luo et al 2016 wang and khoo 2005 wu and chen 2009 zhang et al 2015 for example faltinsen 1978 proposed a linear theory for liquid sloshing in a 2 d rectangular tank under horizontal external excitation wu 2007 utilized the perturbation theory and identified the conditions under which the second order resonance can occur liu and lin 2008 introduced a numerical model solving navier stokes equations and using vof method to track the free surface they have found that in linear wave regime the numerical results can favorably match the faltinsen analytical solution while as the amplitude of excitation grows the response of sloshing can no longer be predicted by linear theory because of the existence of nonlinearity in contrast the experimental data lend confidence to the accuracy of their numerical model when dealing with problems with strong nonlinearity another important problem related to single layered liquid sloshing is how the sloshing response can be reduced one effective solution is to install a variety of baffles in the tank to mitigate the amplitude of sloshing waves liu and lin 2009 xue and lin 2011 xue et al 2017 qin et al 2019 yu et al 2017 in recent years a growing number of floating production storage and offloading fpso systems and ocean going vessels have been produced and utilized to exploit offshore oil and natural gas so the study of layered sloshing inside tanks is needed to ensure the safety of containers for example the layered liquids can be found in ballast tanks or free water knockout fwko vessel in which water oil and emulsion etc coexist and form layered liquid system molin et al 2012 layered liquid system in tanks can also be installed as tuned liquid damper tld in skyscrapers and ocean drilling platforms to reduce vibrations of architecture because such kind of tld can be used to absorb more energy from external excitations as layered liquid has more values of natural frequencies and hence provides broader spectra that can respond to the disturbance from environment shen et al 1996 however in contrast to the intensive study of single layer sloshing not many researches have been conducted to study layered liquid sloshing one of the most important theoretical works on layered sloshing was conducted by veletsos and shivakumar 1993 they derived a linear analytical solution for the sloshing action of liquids with n layers in a horizontally excited cylindrical or rectangular tanks based on potential flow theory tang 1996 also studied the dynamic responses of tanks containing non uniform liquid whose density increases with the liquid depth under horizontal base excitations the effect of tank wall flexibility was also discussed in this study la rocca et al 2002 performed a theoretical and experimental investigation on the sloshing of two immiscible liquid layers without free surface inside a fully closed rectangular tank the effect of nonlinearity is discussed in their study later la rocca et al 2005 further conducted research on the sloshing of a liquid system with both interface between two liquids and free surface the mathematical model based on potential flow theory describing the dynamics of motion is derived they also conducted experiment under pitch excitation to validate their model furthermore sciortino et al 2009 developed a new hamiltonian mathematical model and conducted very interesting experiment with free surface of standing wave style and interface of traveling wave similar to a moving hydraulic jump style however these theoretical analyses based on potential flow theory are not valid for viscous and turbulent flows so the overturning and breaking waves during violent liquid sloshing cannot be described by using these theoretical works besides theoretical approach numerical models can be adopted to study layered liquid sloshing for example valentine and frandsen 2005 employed the potential flow theory and studied the internal waves induced by sloshing a density stratified liquid molin et al 2012 adopted the eole software of principia to study sloshing with three liquids and compared their results with experimental results kargbo et al 2019 and xue et al 2020 utilized a fem model and employed arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method to track interfaces they compared the numerical results of interface elevations with the experimental data obtained in laboratory kim et al 2014 2015 employed a moving particle simulation mps approach to revisit the experiment of molin et al 2012 however so far there has been no report that has systematically studied the energy transfer between different modes and layers in the layered sloshing motion when different layers respond differently to external excitations under resonant conditions in this study we shall present a numerical model called newtank to study the multi layered liquid sloshing under horizontal excitations the computational domain is constructed in a moving non inertial frame to simulate the external excitation a multi layered vof ml vof method is proposed to track both free surface and the interface between different liquids simultaneously for 2 d and 3 d sloshing problems the model is validated by comparing the numerical results with linear analytical solution and experimental data the phenomena of upper layer resonance lower layer resonance and both layer resonances will be investigated with the validated numerical model the nonlinear effects on energy transfer between different modes and different layers will be analyzed and discussed finally a case study of 3 d violent sloshing with breaking free surface and interface will be presented and discussed 2 mathematical model and numerical implementation 2 1 governing equations when we consider the sloshing response of layered liquid the assumption of incompressible fluid can be proved to be valid so the spatially averaged navier stokes equations are used as the governing equations in addition the coordinate system fixed on the moving tank and the non inertial reference frame which follows the tank motion is adopted therefore the nses are modified as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ τ i j r i j x j g i d u e i d t where i j 1 2 3 for three dimensional flow u i is the i th component of the spatially averaged velocity t the time ρ the density ρ ρ 1 in lower liquid ρ ρ 2 in upper liquid ρ ρ a in air see fig 1 p the filtered pressure g i the gravitational acceleration u e i the velocity of external translational excitation τ i j 2 ρ ν s i j the molecular viscous stress tensor with ν being the kinematic viscosity and r i j the stress induced by the filtering process for spatial flow variation that is mainly caused by small scale turbulence to be more specific s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the rate of strain of the filtered flow the stress r i j can be simulated by smagorinsky sub grid scale sgs model from the concept of large eddy simulation les smagorinsky 1963 i e 3 r i j 2 ρ ν t s i j where ν t l s 2 2 s i j s i j is the eddy viscosity and l s is the characteristic length scale which equals to c s δ x δ y δ z 1 3 with c s 0 15 lin and li 2003 the symbol for space filtering will be omitted from herein for simplicity the transport equation of density can be expressed as 4 ρ t u i ρ x i 0 which implies that the incompressibility of fluid is imposed in the entire multiphase flow field 2 2 solver of nse in newtank the finite difference method fdm on a staggered grid mesh system is adopted to solve the governing equations similar numerical method to liu and lin 2008 and liu 2007 has been utilized so the approach is only briefly summarized here a two step projection method is employed with the time derivative term discretized by forward time difference the central difference is used to discretize the pressure gradient terms and stress gradient terms while the combination of the central difference and upwind method is utilized to discretize the convection terms the stability criteria that must be satisfied to make the scheme stable are related to the convection process which is characterized by the courant number cr restriction and to the diffusion process which avoids the negative diffusion the detailed criteria can be found in liu 2007 2 3 free surface and interface tracking ml vof method in order to track both free surface and the interface between two liquids simultaneously a multi layered volume of fluid ml vof method is introduced two sets of vof function f 1 and f a are defined as volumetric fraction of lower liquid and air respectively so the volumetric fraction of upper liquid can be expressed as 1 f 1 f a therefore f 1 1 in lower liquid and f 1 0 in upper liquid and air similarly f a 1 in air and f a 0 in lower and upper liquid fig 1 therefore the average density and kinematic viscosity of fluid in each grid can be updated as 5 ρ f 1 ρ 1 f a ρ a 1 f 1 f a ρ 2 6 ν f 1 ν 1 f a ν a 1 f 1 f a ν 2 if substituting eq 5 into eq 4 we can have 7 ρ 1 ρ 2 f 1 t u i ρ 1 ρ 2 f 1 x i ρ a ρ 2 f a t u i ρ a ρ 2 f a x i 0 when the depth of upper liquid is large enough and the liquid of lower layer would not get in touch with the air we can have the particular solution of eq 7 i e 8 f 1 t u i f 1 x i 0 9 f a t u i f a x i 0 eqs 8 and 9 can be utilized to track the free surface and interface between liquids simultaneously for each set of vof interface tracking method the normal vector of the interface in each grid is calculated by using youngs least square method gueyffier et al 1999 the detailed numerical treatment for volume flux calculation and the vof update scheme can be found in liu 2007 and lin 2008 3 analytical solution based on potential flow theory for two layered liquid sloshing for a rectangular tank partially filled with n layers liquids under surge excitation u e t which is the velocity of the external motion at any time veletsos and shivakumar 1993 give the linear analytical solution for the interface displacement vector η η 1 η n in this section the initial problem setting with n layers of liquids will be degenerated into one with only two liquid layers and the expression of natural frequency for this simplified system and the displacement of free surface and interface between two liquids will be briefly summarized 3 1 natural frequencies of two layered liquid system unlike the natural frequency of single layered sloshing each mode of the two layered system is characterized by two natural frequencies i e ω m 1 and ω m 2 it should be noted that the first subscript m of ω refers to the m th mode of natural frequency and the second subscript 1 or 2 means whether the natural frequency is related to the first layer i e the lower layer or to the second layer i e the upper layer in other words the existence of two natural frequencies for each mode arises from the presence of two moving surfaces and the one with larger value ω m 2 hence sometimes denoted as ω m is related to the movement of free surface but the one with smaller value ω m 1 hence sometimes denoted as ω m is related to the movement of interface between two liquid layers actually if there are n layers for the system there should exist n natural frequencies for each mode the two natural frequencies for each mode of two layered liquid system can be expressed as 10 ω m 1 b m b m 2 4 a m c m 2 a m 11 ω m 2 b m b m 2 4 a m c m 2 a m in which a m 1 ρ 21 tanh λ m h 1 a tanh λ m h 2 a b m tanh λ m h 1 a tanh λ m h 2 a and c m 1 ρ 21 tanh λ m h 1 a tanh λ m h 2 a where ρ 21 ρ 2 ρ 1 λ m 2 m 1 π 2 and a is half length of the tank 3 2 the expressions for displacements of interface and free surface if we consider a two layered sloshing system under external surge excitation for the rectangular system the interface displacements of the lower layer at arbitrary points can be determined by 12 η 1 ξ t a m 1 n 1 2 ε m e d ˆ sin λ m ξ sin λ m a m n t g and the free surface displacements of the upper layer at arbitrary points can be determined by 13 η 2 ξ t a m 1 n 1 2 ε m e sin λ m ξ sin λ m a m n t g in which m denotes the mode number n denotes the number of layer e 1 ρ 21 d ˆ ρ 21 1 ρ 21 d ˆ 2 ρ 21 d ˆ cosh λ m h 2 a λ m g ω m n 2 a sinh λ m h 2 a ξ x a and ε m 2 λ m 2 in eqs 12 and 13 a m n t represents the pseudo acceleration function defined by 14 a m n t ω m n 0 τ u e τ sin ω m n t τ d τ in which u e τ is the acceleration of external excitation in the actual computation of analytical solution m 10 are used in the analytical results and it has been found that further increase of m makes little change of the final solution 4 model validation 4 1 validation of 2 d non resonant sloshing response against analytical solution in this section the investigation will be made by using the numerical model newtank to simulate two layered liquid sloshing in a horizontally excited 2 d rectangular tank with the height of lower layer liquid h 1 the height of upper layer liquid h 2 and tank length l 2a fig 1 the tank is under periodic excitation i e u e b ω e cos ω e t where u e is the velocity of tank b is the displacement amplitude of excitation and ω e is the angular frequency of the external excitation in this study we use the parameters h 1 h 2 0 1 m l 0 51 m ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 and ρ 2 0 846ρ 1 with g 9 81 m s2 two values of the first mode natural frequencies of two layered liquid system can be computed as ω 11 1 6396 s 1 ω 12 7 0813 s 1 in the first case the excitation frequency ω e 0 6 ω 12 4 2488 s 1 and b 0 004 m in the second case the excitation frequency ω e 0 6 ω 11 0 9838 s 1 and b 0 04 m because the frequencies of external excitation in both cases are far from the natural frequency the response of the liquid system should be non resonant in both simulations the turbulence model is turned off and the molecular viscosity is set to 0 to be consistent with potential flow assumption the length of the tank is discretized by 51 uniform grids with mesh size δx 0 01 m and the height of the tank is done by 84 non uniform meshes with minimum δz 0 001 m arranged near the free surface and interface between two layers fixed time step δt 0 004 s is utilized and the simulation runs up to t 60 s it takes about 0 67 cpu hours in intel r core tm i7 7700 cpu 3 60 ghz to finish both computations and all the other simulations in this paper are also run in the same computer the numerical results circle of free surface and interface displacements at x a right boundary of the tank are compared with analytical solution 13 and 12 in figs 2 and 3 for both cases very good agreements are obtained in the comparison it is found that under such external excitations the sloshing amplitude of free surface is usually larger than that of interface between two liquids the mesh convergence test is also conducted for the case with ω e 0 6 ω 12 the additional computations are made by using the minimum mesh sizes double and half of the previous reference test the comparisons are plotted in fig 2 the difference among three numerical results is small especially between the reference test and the fine mesh test implying that the numerical solution is convergent when the reference mesh system is used the coarse mesh system however exhibits higher displacement of both free surface and interface and develops a phase lag after t 40 s 4 2 validation of 2 d non resonant sloshing response against experimental data in order to further validate the performance of numerical model we conducted an experiment in state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering of sichuan university in china the experimental system used to conduct sloshing is driven by a controllable wave maker fig 4 the tank in the system which is 570 mm in length 310 mm in width and 300 mm in height was secured on a shaker driven by the wave maker the chosen lower liquid is fresh water with h 1 0 1 m in depth and the upper one is 0 diesel oil with h 2 0 05 m in depth the density of chosen diesel oil is about 0 846 that of water therefore the natural frequencies of the first mode ω 11 1 2324 s 1 ω 12 5 9885 s 1 two probes near the left and right boundary of tank δ 0 01 m were set up to measure the displacement of interface between water and diesel oil fig 1 the movement of the shaking table follows the sinusoidal function u e b ω e sin ω e t in which the amplitude of external excitation b 0 01 m and the shaking frequency ω e 1 264ω 12 7 57 s 1 in the simulation the employed mesh system has 285 uniform horizontal meshes with mesh size δx 0 002 m and 95 non uniform vertical grids with the minimum grids δz 0 002 m being arranged near the interface and free surface the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure the stability of the numerical model the turbulence model is turned on in this case to simulate the real fluid it used 3 5 h in this computation when the simulation runs up to t 15 s the numerical results of the interface displacement between diesel oil and water at the positions of probe 1 and 2 fig 1 are compared with the experimental data and analytical solution it can be seen from fig 5 a and b that fairly good agreements are obtained in both positions among the numerical analytical and experimental results indicating the response of interface between two liquids is still linear it should be noted that the wave gauge used in the experiment is a capacitance probe so only the change in water level can be precisely detected as a result only the interface displacement is measured in the experiment 5 results of 2 d layered resonant sloshing under horizontal excitation in this section 2 d resonant layered sloshing will be studied systematically especially how the response of lower and upper layers is related to natural frequencies of each mode 5 1 resonant response of upper layer the frequency of external excitation in previous section is off the natural frequency of the two layered liquid system in this section the response under external frequency near or equal to natural frequency will be studied since there are two natural frequencies for each mode in a two layered liquid system we will investigate how the responses of different layers are related to two natural frequencies of each mode in this section we will simulate a case in which the external frequency is near the natural frequency related to the response of free surface in this study the length of the tank l 1 0 m the depth of both layers h 1 h 2 0 25 m the density of lower layer ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 and the density of upper layer ρ 2 0 85ρ 1 therefore with g 9 81 m s2 the first mode of natural frequency related to upper layer response ω 12 5 2914 s 1 and the first mode of natural frequency related to lower layer response ω 11 1 2659 s 1 in the simulation the frequency of external excitation ω e ω 12 5 3 s 1 and b 0 001 m the employed mesh system has 100 uniform horizontal grids with mesh size δx 0 01 m and 200 uniform vertical grids with δz 0 004 m the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure the numerical stability the simulation runs up to t 120 s it used about 15 cpu hours in this computation the snap shots of the free surface and interface at t 20 40 60 80 100 120 s are shown in fig 6 in which the first mode response can be seen the numerical results of free surface and interface displacement at x a right boundary are compared with the analytical solution 13 and 12 in fig 7 a and b it can be clearly seen from the figures that obvious resonant response occurs for the free surface displacement since the frequency of external excitation is close to the first mode of upper layer natural frequency ω 12 the response for the interface between two layers is probably the passive reaction of the free surface resonance in the first 10 s as shown in fig 7 a and b very good agreements are obtained in the comparison between the analytical solution and numerical results for displacement of free surface and interface because the sloshing responses of both upper and lower layers are within the linear regime from t 10 s to t 40 s the deviation gradually develops because of the nonlinear effect the numerical results of wave height are higher than the analytical solution in addition the wave crest becomes sharper and the wave trough becomes flatter when compared to the linear analytical solution of symmetric pattern after t 40 s however the analytical solution of wave height becomes increasingly larger along with time in contrast the actual celerity of sloshing waves will be larger than that of the linear wave and thus the actual natural frequency of nonlinear sloshing waves will be shifted from that of the external excitation as a result the actual wave height stops further increasing and even decreases and thus it will be smaller than the linear analytical solution in the late stage of resonant sloshing nonlinearity can be further confirmed from the spectral analysis using fast fourier transform fft method in fig 7 a and b we can see that the dominant frequency of the energy density is 5 3 s 1 which is equal to the frequency of the external excitation and ω 12 the second and the third peaks which are excited by nonlinearity la rocca et al 2002 xue et al 2019 are equal to 2ω e and 3ω e it can be seen from fig 7 a and b that these two peaks do not exist in the spectra analysis of linear analytical solution in order to investigate the energy transfer mechanism among different modes wavelet transform wt technique is employed to study the change of energy density along with time as can be seen from fig 8 a and b we can also observe three main bands which correspond to ω e 2ω e and 3ω e in time frequency domain five energy density spectra at specific time t 5 25 50 75 100 s are also drawn in fig 8 a and b it can be seen in fig 8 a and b that at t 5 s only dominant frequency corresponding to ω e can be observed in the energy density spectrum indicating no nonlinearity has been developed at this moment however at t 25 s the second peak has been excited which means that some of the energy absorbed from external excitation has been transferred to frequency 2ω e because of nonlinearity from figs 7 and 8 we can see that at about t 40 s when the wave elevation is the largest the liquid system contains the most energy 5 2 resonant response of lower layer the numerical model is then used to study another case in which the frequency of external excitation is near the natural frequency related to the response of interface between two layers in this study the length of the tank l 1 0 m the depth of lower layer h 1 0 1 m the depth of upper layer h 2 0 25 m the density of lower layer ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 and the density of upper layer ρ 2 0 85ρ 1 therefore with g 9 81 m s2 the first mode of natural frequency related to upper layer response ω 12 4 9292 s 1 and the first mode of natural frequency related to lower layer response ω 11 1 0 s 1 the frequency of external excitation ω e ω 11 1 0 s 1 and b 0 2 m the employed mesh system has 100 uniform horizontal grids with mesh size δx 0 01 m and 200 uniform vertical grids with δz 0 003 m the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure the numerical stability the simulation runs up to t 100 s it used about 8 cpu hours in this computation the snap shots of the free surface and interface at t 20 40 60 63 2 80 100 s are shown in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the free surface is standing wave while the interface between two layers exhibits a pattern of traveling wave the shape of which is similar to a hydraulic jump sciortino et al 2009 it should be noted that at t 63 2 s because of the resonant interface droplets of both liquids are formed which are plunged or splashed into the other liquid the numerical results of free surface and interface displacement at x a right boundary are compared with those from analytical solution 13 and 12 in fig 10 a and b it can be found that in the first 15 s the displacements of interface and free surface are in the same order of magnitude and the numerical results of free surface and interface elevations favorably match the analytical solution however after that it becomes obvious that lower layer absorbs much more energy from external excitation and the displacement of interface between two layers becomes much larger than that of free surface again the nonlinearity prevents the displacement of interface from going infinity as behaved in linear analytical solution instead the elevation becomes stable after t 40 s using fft technique the corresponding wave energy density spectrum right column of fig 10 can be obtained for the upper layer the largest three peaks of energy density spectrum from numerical results which correspond to ω e ω 12 and ω 32 match those from linear analytical solution however for the response of lower layer which exhibits resonant pattern only two dominant frequencies exist in the spectrum of linear analytical solution in contrast it can be seen from fig 10 b besides peaks that correspond to ω e and ω 12 a series of frequencies that are equal to the integral times of ω e i e 2ω e 3ω e 6ω e etc are excited because of nonlinearity further investigations on energy transfer mechanism among different modes and layers by utilizing wt technique in order to study the change of energy density along with time as can be seen from fig 11 a and b it can be observed that energy contained in two frequency bands exists throughout time i e ω e ω 11 and ω 12 for free surface despite the external excitation more energy is stored in its natural frequency ω 12 so the dominant frequency of response corresponds to ω 12 for lower layer it is naturally assumed that because the frequency of external excitation equals to its natural frequency most energy should correspond to ω e ω 11 nevertheless the movement of free surface actually affects the response of lower interface from the very beginning and the band corresponding to ω 12 exist all the time in fig 11 b besides the energy transfer between layers we can also observe energy transfer among different modes from fig 11 a and b five energy density spectra at specific time t 5 20 40 60 80 s are also drawn in fig 11 a and b it can be seen from fig 11 a that at t 5 and 20 s unlike frequency patterns in other time frequency corresponding to 2ω e does not exist indicating that little nonlinearity has been developed at these moments and few energies has been transferred to frequency corresponding to 2ω e however as the lower layer absorbs more energy from external excitation some of these energies has been transferred to frequency 2ω e 3ω e 6ω e etc because of nonlinearity from fig 11 we can confirm that after 40 s the response gets stable as the energy density spectra are almost identical in height and shape 5 3 resonant response of both upper and lower layers finally we will investigate a case in which both the free surface and the interface between two layers exhibit resonant effect in this study the parameters are as follows the length of the tank l 1 0 m the depth of lower layer h 1 0 2 m the depth of upper layer h 2 0 1 m the density of lower layer ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 and the density of upper layer is only 0 6 time that of lower layer i e ρ 2 0 6ρ 1 therefore with g 9 81 m s2 the first mode of natural frequency related to upper layer response ω 12 4 6210 s 1 and the third mode of natural frequency related to lower layer response ω 31 4 2991 s 1 in the simulation the amplitude of external excitation b 0 002 m and the frequency of external excitation equals to the third mode of natural frequency related to lower layer and near the first mode of natural frequency related to upper layer i e ω e ω 31 0 93ω 12 the employed mesh system has 100 uniform horizontal grids with mesh size δx 0 01 m and 200 uniform vertical grids with δz 0 0025 m the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure the numerical stability the simulation runs up to t 110 s it used 12 cpu hours in this computation the snap shots of the free surface and interface between two liquid layers at t 0 0 15 0 30 0 45 0 60 0 and 75 0 s are shown in fig 12 in which we can find the third mode response for lower layer and the first mode response for upper layer especially in fig 12 c and d the numerical results of free surface and interface displacement at x a right boundary are also compared with the analytical solution 13 and 12 in fig 13 a and b fairly good agreements are obtained in the comparison in the first 20 s it can be found that in 50 s the resonant displacement of free surface is of beat vibration style but the amplitude of every beat is almost the same nevertheless the resonant style for displacement of interface between two liquid layers is quite different due to the beat vibration of upper layer the displacement of interface of lower layer also exhibits style of beat vibration however we can see that for displacement of interface the amplitude of every beat becomes larger since the frequency of external excitation equals to the third mode of the natural frequency of lower layer therefore after the third beat the displacement of interface grows to the same order to that of the free surface after 35 s it is found that the numerical results of interface amplitude are smaller than those from analytical solution the reason probably arises from the restriction of resonant upper layer from the spectral analysis shown in fig 13 a and b besides peaks that correspond to the frequency of external excitation ω e ω 31 and natural frequencies ω 12 additional peaks that are equal to the sum of the external excitation and natural frequency i e ω e ω 12 twice the external excitation i e 2ω e and twice the natural frequency i e 2ω 12 etc also exist in the energy density spectrum indicating nonlinearity plays significant role in the sloshing process and the energy has been transferred from lower modes to higher modes using wt technique the energy density change along with time can be obtained in fig 14 a and b two energy density spectra at instances of wave crests and wave nodes of both free surface and interface are also drawn in fig 14 a and b for the free surface the chosen time t 58 3 and 68 3 s while for the interface the chosen time t 55 6 and 65 0 s it can be seen from fig 14 that the dominant frequency corresponds to ω e ω 31 and near ω 12 exists throughout time since the modes of resonant responses of free surface and interface are totally different there exists a time difference between the nodes and crests of free surface and interface therefore it is probable that the resonant response with different modes of both free surface and interface may generate nonlinear interaction between two layers and different modes 6 results of 3 d layered sloshing under surge and sway excitation 6 1 validation of 3 d layered sloshing against superposed analytical solution in this section a 3 d simulation of two layered liquid sloshing in a hexahedron tank with tank length 2a and width 2w fig 15 is investigated in x direction the tank is under periodic excitation i e u e x b x ω e x cos ω e x t where u e x is the velocity of tank in x direction b x is the displacement amplitude of surge excitation and ω e x is the angular frequency of the external surge excitation in y direction the tank is also under periodic excitation i e u e y b y ω e y cos ω e y t where u e y is the velocity of tank in y direction b y is the displacement amplitude of sway excitation and ω e y is the angular frequency of the external sway excitation combining the linear analytical solution under 1 d excitation which has been discussed in sec 3 2 in both x direction and y direction the 3 d linear analytical solution of lower layer surface elevation at an arbitrary point x y under both surge and sway excitation is as follows 15 η 1 ξ x y t a m 1 n 1 2 ε m e x d x ˆ sin λ m ξ x sin λ m a m n x t g w m 1 n 1 2 ε m e y d y ˆ sin λ m ξ y sin λ m a m n y t g and the 3 d linear analytical solution of upper layer surface elevation can be determined by 16 η 2 ξ x y t a m 1 n 1 2 ε m e x sin λ m ξ x sin λ m a m n x t g w m 1 n 1 2 ε m e y sin λ m ξ y sin λ m a m n y

ω m n x 0 τ u e x τ sin ω m n x t τ d τ 18 a m n y t ω m n y 0 τ u e y τ sin ω m n y t τ d τ in which u e x τ and u e y τ are the acceleration of surge and sway excitation respectively in the calculation we use the parameters h 1 h 2 0 1 m 2a 0 57 m 2w 0 31 m ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 ρ 2 0 84ρ 1 in the simulation the amplitude of surge excitation b x 0 0005 m and the frequency of surge excitation ω ex 0 95ω 12x 6 1918 s 1 the amplitude of sway excitation b y 0 005 m and the frequency of sway excitation ω ey 0 98ω 11y 2 5019 s 1 the domain is discretized by 114 62 uniform grids in the horizontal plane in contrast 95 non uniform grids with 20 grids the minimum δz 0 0015 m near the free surface and the interface are used in vertical direction the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure the numerical stability the simulations run up to t 45 s the numerical results of free surface and interface displacement at northeast corner numerical wave gauge in fig 15 of the tank are compared with the superposed analytical solution 16 and 15 in fig 16 a and b due to the fact that both frequencies of external excitation in surge and sway motion are near values of first mode of natural frequencies in x and y directions we can see that both free surface and interface exhibit resonant phenomenon the numerical results agree very well with the superposed linear analytical solution in the first 25s using the fast fourier transform fft technique we can obtain the corresponding wave energy density spectrum in fig 16 a and b for upper layer response the dominant twin angular frequencies of the energy density are 6 2 s 1 and 6 5 s 1 which corresponds to the frequency of surge excitation ω ex and the first mode of natural frequency in x direction ω 12x related to the upper layer response the third largest peak is around 9 78 s 1 which is close to the first mode of theoretical natural frequency related to the upper layer response in y direction ω 12y the next largest peak corresponds to the frequency of sway excitation ω ey which is also near the first mode of natural frequency in y direction ω 11y related to the upper layer response on the other hand for the lower layer response the dominant frequency corresponds to the frequency of excitation in y direction ω ey which is near ω 11y therefore it can be seen from fig 16 a and b that the period of sloshing waves in lower layer is larger than that in upper layer using wt technique the energy density change along with time can be obtained in fig 17 a and b five energy density spectra at specific time t 1 9 18 27 36 s are also drawn in fig 17 a and b it can be seen from fig 17 that for both free surface and interface the dominant frequencies correspond to ω ey ω 11 ω ex ω 12 and ω 12y exists throughout time it can be seen from fig 17 b that as the sloshing wave amplitude of interface becomes higher the energy density corresponding to ω ey ω 11 also gets larger along with time 6 2 violent 3 d layered sloshing in this section 3 d simulation of violent two layered liquid sloshing in a hexahedron tank with tank length 2a and width 2w fig 15 is investigated in the calculation we use the parameters h 1 h 2 0 1 m 2a 0 57 m 2w 0 31 m ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 ρ 2 0 84ρ 1 in the simulation the amplitude of surge excitation b x 0 05 m and the frequency of excitation ω ex 4 192 s 1 the amplitude of sway excitation b y 0 05 m and the frequency of excitation ω ey 5 08 s 1 the frequencies of excitation in x and y direction are both far from the natural frequencies related to upper layer however the amplitudes of excitation in x direction and y direction are both relatively large so strong nonlinear phenomenon and even sloshing waves with broken free surface are expected in the simulation the domain is discretized by 57 31 50 uniform grids with δx δy δz 0 01 m the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure numerical stability the simulations run up to t 50 s it takes about 17 cpu hours to complete this case the simulation results of two layered sloshing are shown in fig 18 as the excitation amplitude is large it can be seen that violent response such as ceiling hitting waves broken free surfaces with droplets and bubbles is formed during sloshing the time histories of the free surface and interface elevation which is estimated by integrating vof functions in vertical direction at 0 285 0 155 m are shown in the left column of fig 19 it can be seen that the wave amplitude of free surface is much larger than that of interface between two liquids using fft technique we can obtain the corresponding wave energy density spectrum right column of fig 19 for the upper layer the dominant frequencies of energy density are 4 19 s 1 and 5 08 s 1 which are equal to the frequencies of external surge and sway excitation ω ex and ω ey besides peaks that correspond to natural frequency related to response of upper layer such as ω 12x integral times of the frequencies of external excitations like 2ω ex and 2ω ey can also be found from the spectrum for the lower layer the dominant frequencies of energy density are also equal to ω ex and ω ey we can also find peaks that correspond to natural frequencies related to responses of both upper layer ω 12x and lower layer ω 11y in addition integral times of the frequencies of external excitations such as 2ω ey exist too in the spectrum of lower layer elevation the numerical simulations presented in this section demonstrate the model s excellent performance in terms of three dimensional layered liquid sloshing under surge and sway excitation 7 conclusion in this study a 3 d multiphase fluid flow model newtank has been developed to solve the spatially averaged nses in order to simulate layered sloshing under horizontal external excitations a multi layered volume of fluid ml vof method has been proposed and it has been proven that this method is capable of tracking the free surface and interfaces between two liquids simultaneously provided that the two surfaces are immiscible the model has been employed to study 2 d and 3 d two layered liquid sloshing in rectangular tanks and has the capability of simulating both linear and nonlinear sloshing processes including breaking free surface and breaking interface laboratory experiments are also conducted for layered sloshing under the external excitation of surge motion in order to provide the data for model validation the model is first validated against linear analytical solutions and experimental data for 2 d layered liquid sloshing for small amplitude sloshing the numerical results agree favorably with the linear theories and experimental data on the other hand for layered sloshing with resonant response the numerical results deviate from the linear theory and exhibit obvious nonlinear wave effects the sloshing response of upper and lower layers can be in phase or totally different for example the sloshing response in upper layer is standing wave while that in lower layer is traveling wave especially when the depth of lower layer is relatively small the sloshing of upper layer is of 1st mode response whereas that of lower layer is of 3rd mode response as a result the style of two layered sloshing is much more complicated than that of single layer fluid spectral analysis of the corresponding energy density is made by employing fast fourier transform fft and wavelet transform wt technique upper layer resonance lower layer resonance and resonance of both layers have been studied systematically it has been found that the natural frequency of upper layer liquid ω m2 usually has effects on liquids of both layers and this kind of influence exists from the very beginning of sloshing process when resonance occurs as the amplitude grows more peaks corresponding to integral times of external excitation frequency or sum of different modes can appear but such additional frequencies do not show up from the beginning of sloshing only when the nonlinearity becomes strong enough will the energy start to transfer from lower modes to higher modes finally 3 d liquid sloshing is studied with the numerical model it is found that the analytical solution which is derived for 2 d liquid sloshing can be extended to 3 d cases with linear superposition the violent liquid sloshing with broken free surface interface and strong turbulence can also be simulated by the present model with reasonable accuracy credit authorship contribution statement dongming liu conceptualization methodology validation

20988,a numerical model newtank has been developed to study two layered liquid sloshing under horizontal external excitations the model solves spatially averaged nses on a non inertial coordinate for external excitations the two step projection method is employed in numerical solutions and the poisson equation for pressure field is solved by bi cgstab technique a multi layered volume of fluid method is proposed to track both free surface and interface between layered liquids simultaneously in order to validate the accuracy of the model the simulated results of sloshing responses are compared with linear analytical solutions and experimental data good agreements are obtained when response amplitude is within linear regime however when nonlinearity becomes strong deviation from analytical solution will be large due to nonlinear energy transfer from the primary mode to higher modes further investigation reveals that for two layered liquid sloshing there exist two natural frequencies with the smaller one related to response of lower layer liquid and the larger one upper layer therefore different external excitation frequencies may induce upper layer resonance lower layer resonance or resonances of both layers each of which exhibits very different patterns of energy transport between modes and layers finally a violent 3 d sloshing with broken free surface and interface is simulated and discussed keywords layered liquid sloshing multiphase flow multi layered vof method analytical solution non inertial reference frame nonlinear energy transfer 1 introduction sloshing is the phenomenon that the liquid inside a partially filled container is prone to wave motion under external excitations it is well known that when the frequency of external excitations is equal to or near the natural frequency of liquid in the tank the resonant response of sloshing can be violent and the resulting impact pressure on the wall may be so large that it causes damage to the container ibrahim 2005 therefore this phenomenon attracts much attentions in many areas involving liquid transport many researchers have devoted their efforts to investigate liquid sloshing with single layer in the last a few decades by adopting theoretical solution faltinsen et al 2000 zhang et al 2014 experiments akyildiz and ünal 2005 armenio and la rocca 1996 and numerical models cao et al 2014 chen and nokes 2005 luo et al 2016 wang and khoo 2005 wu and chen 2009 zhang et al 2015 for example faltinsen 1978 proposed a linear theory for liquid sloshing in a 2 d rectangular tank under horizontal external excitation wu 2007 utilized the perturbation theory and identified the conditions under which the second order resonance can occur liu and lin 2008 introduced a numerical model solving navier stokes equations and using vof method to track the free surface they have found that in linear wave regime the numerical results can favorably match the faltinsen analytical solution while as the amplitude of excitation grows the response of sloshing can no longer be predicted by linear theory because of the existence of nonlinearity in contrast the experimental data lend confidence to the accuracy of their numerical model when dealing with problems with strong nonlinearity another important problem related to single layered liquid sloshing is how the sloshing response can be reduced one effective solution is to install a variety of baffles in the tank to mitigate the amplitude of sloshing waves liu and lin 2009 xue and lin 2011 xue et al 2017 qin et al 2019 yu et al 2017 in recent years a growing number of floating production storage and offloading fpso systems and ocean going vessels have been produced and utilized to exploit offshore oil and natural gas so the study of layered sloshing inside tanks is needed to ensure the safety of containers for example the layered liquids can be found in ballast tanks or free water knockout fwko vessel in which water oil and emulsion etc coexist and form layered liquid system molin et al 2012 layered liquid system in tanks can also be installed as tuned liquid damper tld in skyscrapers and ocean drilling platforms to reduce vibrations of architecture because such kind of tld can be used to absorb more energy from external excitations as layered liquid has more values of natural frequencies and hence provides broader spectra that can respond to the disturbance from environment shen et al 1996 however in contrast to the intensive study of single layer sloshing not many researches have been conducted to study layered liquid sloshing one of the most important theoretical works on layered sloshing was conducted by veletsos and shivakumar 1993 they derived a linear analytical solution for the sloshing action of liquids with n layers in a horizontally excited cylindrical or rectangular tanks based on potential flow theory tang 1996 also studied the dynamic responses of tanks containing non uniform liquid whose density increases with the liquid depth under horizontal base excitations the effect of tank wall flexibility was also discussed in this study la rocca et al 2002 performed a theoretical and experimental investigation on the sloshing of two immiscible liquid layers without free surface inside a fully closed rectangular tank the effect of nonlinearity is discussed in their study later la rocca et al 2005 further conducted research on the sloshing of a liquid system with both interface between two liquids and free surface the mathematical model based on potential flow theory describing the dynamics of motion is derived they also conducted experiment under pitch excitation to validate their model furthermore sciortino et al 2009 developed a new hamiltonian mathematical model and conducted very interesting experiment with free surface of standing wave style and interface of traveling wave similar to a moving hydraulic jump style however these theoretical analyses based on potential flow theory are not valid for viscous and turbulent flows so the overturning and breaking waves during violent liquid sloshing cannot be described by using these theoretical works besides theoretical approach numerical models can be adopted to study layered liquid sloshing for example valentine and frandsen 2005 employed the potential flow theory and studied the internal waves induced by sloshing a density stratified liquid molin et al 2012 adopted the eole software of principia to study sloshing with three liquids and compared their results with experimental results kargbo et al 2019 and xue et al 2020 utilized a fem model and employed arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method to track interfaces they compared the numerical results of interface elevations with the experimental data obtained in laboratory kim et al 2014 2015 employed a moving particle simulation mps approach to revisit the experiment of molin et al 2012 however so far there has been no report that has systematically studied the energy transfer between different modes and layers in the layered sloshing motion when different layers respond differently to external excitations under resonant conditions in this study we shall present a numerical model called newtank to study the multi layered liquid sloshing under horizontal excitations the computational domain is constructed in a moving non inertial frame to simulate the external excitation a multi layered vof ml vof method is proposed to track both free surface and the interface between different liquids simultaneously for 2 d and 3 d sloshing problems the model is validated by comparing the numerical results with linear analytical solution and experimental data the phenomena of upper layer resonance lower layer resonance and both layer resonances will be investigated with the validated numerical model the nonlinear effects on energy transfer between different modes and different layers will be analyzed and discussed finally a case study of 3 d violent sloshing with breaking free surface and interface will be presented and discussed 2 mathematical model and numerical implementation 2 1 governing equations when we consider the sloshing response of layered liquid the assumption of incompressible fluid can be proved to be valid so the spatially averaged navier stokes equations are used as the governing equations in addition the coordinate system fixed on the moving tank and the non inertial reference frame which follows the tank motion is adopted therefore the nses are modified as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ τ i j r i j x j g i d u e i d t where i j 1 2 3 for three dimensional flow u i is the i th component of the spatially averaged velocity t the time ρ the density ρ ρ 1 in lower liquid ρ ρ 2 in upper liquid ρ ρ a in air see fig 1 p the filtered pressure g i the gravitational acceleration u e i the velocity of external translational excitation τ i j 2 ρ ν s i j the molecular viscous stress tensor with ν being the kinematic viscosity and r i j the stress induced by the filtering process for spatial flow variation that is mainly caused by small scale turbulence to be more specific s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the rate of strain of the filtered flow the stress r i j can be simulated by smagorinsky sub grid scale sgs model from the concept of large eddy simulation les smagorinsky 1963 i e 3 r i j 2 ρ ν t s i j where ν t l s 2 2 s i j s i j is the eddy viscosity and l s is the characteristic length scale which equals to c s δ x δ y δ z 1 3 with c s 0 15 lin and li 2003 the symbol for space filtering will be omitted from herein for simplicity the transport equation of density can be expressed as 4 ρ t u i ρ x i 0 which implies that the incompressibility of fluid is imposed in the entire multiphase flow field 2 2 solver of nse in newtank the finite difference method fdm on a staggered grid mesh system is adopted to solve the governing equations similar numerical method to liu and lin 2008 and liu 2007 has been utilized so the approach is only briefly summarized here a two step projection method is employed with the time derivative term discretized by forward time difference the central difference is used to discretize the pressure gradient terms and stress gradient terms while the combination of the central difference and upwind method is utilized to discretize the convection terms the stability criteria that must be satisfied to make the scheme stable are related to the convection process which is characterized by the courant number cr restriction and to the diffusion process which avoids the negative diffusion the detailed criteria can be found in liu 2007 2 3 free surface and interface tracking ml vof method in order to track both free surface and the interface between two liquids simultaneously a multi layered volume of fluid ml vof method is introduced two sets of vof function f 1 and f a are defined as volumetric fraction of lower liquid and air respectively so the volumetric fraction of upper liquid can be expressed as 1 f 1 f a therefore f 1 1 in lower liquid and f 1 0 in upper liquid and air similarly f a 1 in air and f a 0 in lower and upper liquid fig 1 therefore the average density and kinematic viscosity of fluid in each grid can be updated as 5 ρ f 1 ρ 1 f a ρ a 1 f 1 f a ρ 2 6 ν f 1 ν 1 f a ν a 1 f 1 f a ν 2 if substituting eq 5 into eq 4 we can have 7 ρ 1 ρ 2 f 1 t u i ρ 1 ρ 2 f 1 x i ρ a ρ 2 f a t u i ρ a ρ 2 f a x i 0 when the depth of upper liquid is large enough and the liquid of lower layer would not get in touch with the air we can have the particular solution of eq 7 i e 8 f 1 t u i f 1 x i 0 9 f a t u i f a x i 0 eqs 8 and 9 can be utilized to track the free surface and interface between liquids simultaneously for each set of vof interface tracking method the normal vector of the interface in each grid is calculated by using youngs least square method gueyffier et al 1999 the detailed numerical treatment for volume flux calculation and the vof update scheme can be found in liu 2007 and lin 2008 3 analytical solution based on potential flow theory for two layered liquid sloshing for a rectangular tank partially filled with n layers liquids under surge excitation u e t which is the velocity of the external motion at any time veletsos and shivakumar 1993 give the linear analytical solution for the interface displacement vector η η 1 η n in this section the initial problem setting with n layers of liquids will be degenerated into one with only two liquid layers and the expression of natural frequency for this simplified system and the displacement of free surface and interface between two liquids will be briefly summarized 3 1 natural frequencies of two layered liquid system unlike the natural frequency of single layered sloshing each mode of the two layered system is characterized by two natural frequencies i e ω m 1 and ω m 2 it should be noted that the first subscript m of ω refers to the m th mode of natural frequency and the second subscript 1 or 2 means whether the natural frequency is related to the first layer i e the lower layer or to the second layer i e the upper layer in other words the existence of two natural frequencies for each mode arises from the presence of two moving surfaces and the one with larger value ω m 2 hence sometimes denoted as ω m is related to the movement of free surface but the one with smaller value ω m 1 hence sometimes denoted as ω m is related to the movement of interface between two liquid layers actually if there are n layers for the system there should exist n natural frequencies for each mode the two natural frequencies for each mode of two layered liquid system can be expressed as 10 ω m 1 b m b m 2 4 a m c m 2 a m 11 ω m 2 b m b m 2 4 a m c m 2 a m in which a m 1 ρ 21 tanh λ m h 1 a tanh λ m h 2 a b m tanh λ m h 1 a tanh λ m h 2 a and c m 1 ρ 21 tanh λ m h 1 a tanh λ m h 2 a where ρ 21 ρ 2 ρ 1 λ m 2 m 1 π 2 and a is half length of the tank 3 2 the expressions for displacements of interface and free surface if we consider a two layered sloshing system under external surge excitation for the rectangular system the interface displacements of the lower layer at arbitrary points can be determined by 12 η 1 ξ t a m 1 n 1 2 ε m e d ˆ sin λ m ξ sin λ m a m n t g and the free surface displacements of the upper layer at arbitrary points can be determined by 13 η 2 ξ t a m 1 n 1 2 ε m e sin λ m ξ sin λ m a m n t g in which m denotes the mode number n denotes the number of layer e 1 ρ 21 d ˆ ρ 21 1 ρ 21 d ˆ 2 ρ 21 d ˆ cosh λ m h 2 a λ m g ω m n 2 a sinh λ m h 2 a ξ x a and ε m 2 λ m 2 in eqs 12 and 13 a m n t represents the pseudo acceleration function defined by 14 a m n t ω m n 0 τ u e τ sin ω m n t τ d τ in which u e τ is the acceleration of external excitation in the actual computation of analytical solution m 10 are used in the analytical results and it has been found that further increase of m makes little change of the final solution 4 model validation 4 1 validation of 2 d non resonant sloshing response against analytical solution in this section the investigation will be made by using the numerical model newtank to simulate two layered liquid sloshing in a horizontally excited 2 d rectangular tank with the height of lower layer liquid h 1 the height of upper layer liquid h 2 and tank length l 2a fig 1 the tank is under periodic excitation i e u e b ω e cos ω e t where u e is the velocity of tank b is the displacement amplitude of excitation and ω e is the angular frequency of the external excitation in this study we use the parameters h 1 h 2 0 1 m l 0 51 m ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 and ρ 2 0 846ρ 1 with g 9 81 m s2 two values of the first mode natural frequencies of two layered liquid system can be computed as ω 11 1 6396 s 1 ω 12 7 0813 s 1 in the first case the excitation frequency ω e 0 6 ω 12 4 2488 s 1 and b 0 004 m in the second case the excitation frequency ω e 0 6 ω 11 0 9838 s 1 and b 0 04 m because the frequencies of external excitation in both cases are far from the natural frequency the response of the liquid system should be non resonant in both simulations the turbulence model is turned off and the molecular viscosity is set to 0 to be consistent with potential flow assumption the length of the tank is discretized by 51 uniform grids with mesh size δx 0 01 m and the height of the tank is done by 84 non uniform meshes with minimum δz 0 001 m arranged near the free surface and interface between two layers fixed time step δt 0 004 s is utilized and the simulation runs up to t 60 s it takes about 0 67 cpu hours in intel r core tm i7 7700 cpu 3 60 ghz to finish both computations and all the other simulations in this paper are also run in the same computer the numerical results circle of free surface and interface displacements at x a right boundary of the tank are compared with analytical solution 13 and 12 in figs 2 and 3 for both cases very good agreements are obtained in the comparison it is found that under such external excitations the sloshing amplitude of free surface is usually larger than that of interface between two liquids the mesh convergence test is also conducted for the case with ω e 0 6 ω 12 the additional computations are made by using the minimum mesh sizes double and half of the previous reference test the comparisons are plotted in fig 2 the difference among three numerical results is small especially between the reference test and the fine mesh test implying that the numerical solution is convergent when the reference mesh system is used the coarse mesh system however exhibits higher displacement of both free surface and interface and develops a phase lag after t 40 s 4 2 validation of 2 d non resonant sloshing response against experimental data in order to further validate the performance of numerical model we conducted an experiment in state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering of sichuan university in china the experimental system used to conduct sloshing is driven by a controllable wave maker fig 4 the tank in the system which is 570 mm in length 310 mm in width and 300 mm in height was secured on a shaker driven by the wave maker the chosen lower liquid is fresh water with h 1 0 1 m in depth and the upper one is 0 diesel oil with h 2 0 05 m in depth the density of chosen diesel oil is about 0 846 that of water therefore the natural frequencies of the first mode ω 11 1 2324 s 1 ω 12 5 9885 s 1 two probes near the left and right boundary of tank δ 0 01 m were set up to measure the displacement of interface between water and diesel oil fig 1 the movement of the shaking table follows the sinusoidal function u e b ω e sin ω e t in which the amplitude of external excitation b 0 01 m and the shaking frequency ω e 1 264ω 12 7 57 s 1 in the simulation the employed mesh system has 285 uniform horizontal meshes with mesh size δx 0 002 m and 95 non uniform vertical grids with the minimum grids δz 0 002 m being arranged near the interface and free surface the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure the stability of the numerical model the turbulence model is turned on in this case to simulate the real fluid it used 3 5 h in this computation when the simulation runs up to t 15 s the numerical results of the interface displacement between diesel oil and water at the positions of probe 1 and 2 fig 1 are compared with the experimental data and analytical solution it can be seen from fig 5 a and b that fairly good agreements are obtained in both positions among the numerical analytical and experimental results indicating the response of interface between two liquids is still linear it should be noted that the wave gauge used in the experiment is a capacitance probe so only the change in water level can be precisely detected as a result only the interface displacement is measured in the experiment 5 results of 2 d layered resonant sloshing under horizontal excitation in this section 2 d resonant layered sloshing will be studied systematically especially how the response of lower and upper layers is related to natural frequencies of each mode 5 1 resonant response of upper layer the frequency of external excitation in previous section is off the natural frequency of the two layered liquid system in this section the response under external frequency near or equal to natural frequency will be studied since there are two natural frequencies for each mode in a two layered liquid system we will investigate how the responses of different layers are related to two natural frequencies of each mode in this section we will simulate a case in which the external frequency is near the natural frequency related to the response of free surface in this study the length of the tank l 1 0 m the depth of both layers h 1 h 2 0 25 m the density of lower layer ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 and the density of upper layer ρ 2 0 85ρ 1 therefore with g 9 81 m s2 the first mode of natural frequency related to upper layer response ω 12 5 2914 s 1 and the first mode of natural frequency related to lower layer response ω 11 1 2659 s 1 in the simulation the frequency of external excitation ω e ω 12 5 3 s 1 and b 0 001 m the employed mesh system has 100 uniform horizontal grids with mesh size δx 0 01 m and 200 uniform vertical grids with δz 0 004 m the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure the numerical stability the simulation runs up to t 120 s it used about 15 cpu hours in this computation the snap shots of the free surface and interface at t 20 40 60 80 100 120 s are shown in fig 6 in which the first mode response can be seen the numerical results of free surface and interface displacement at x a right boundary are compared with the analytical solution 13 and 12 in fig 7 a and b it can be clearly seen from the figures that obvious resonant response occurs for the free surface displacement since the frequency of external excitation is close to the first mode of upper layer natural frequency ω 12 the response for the interface between two layers is probably the passive reaction of the free surface resonance in the first 10 s as shown in fig 7 a and b very good agreements are obtained in the comparison between the analytical solution and numerical results for displacement of free surface and interface because the sloshing responses of both upper and lower layers are within the linear regime from t 10 s to t 40 s the deviation gradually develops because of the nonlinear effect the numerical results of wave height are higher than the analytical solution in addition the wave crest becomes sharper and the wave trough becomes flatter when compared to the linear analytical solution of symmetric pattern after t 40 s however the analytical solution of wave height becomes increasingly larger along with time in contrast the actual celerity of sloshing waves will be larger than that of the linear wave and thus the actual natural frequency of nonlinear sloshing waves will be shifted from that of the external excitation as a result the actual wave height stops further increasing and even decreases and thus it will be smaller than the linear analytical solution in the late stage of resonant sloshing nonlinearity can be further confirmed from the spectral analysis using fast fourier transform fft method in fig 7 a and b we can see that the dominant frequency of the energy density is 5 3 s 1 which is equal to the frequency of the external excitation and ω 12 the second and the third peaks which are excited by nonlinearity la rocca et al 2002 xue et al 2019 are equal to 2ω e and 3ω e it can be seen from fig 7 a and b that these two peaks do not exist in the spectra analysis of linear analytical solution in order to investigate the energy transfer mechanism among different modes wavelet transform wt technique is employed to study the change of energy density along with time as can be seen from fig 8 a and b we can also observe three main bands which correspond to ω e 2ω e and 3ω e in time frequency domain five energy density spectra at specific time t 5 25 50 75 100 s are also drawn in fig 8 a and b it can be seen in fig 8 a and b that at t 5 s only dominant frequency corresponding to ω e can be observed in the energy density spectrum indicating no nonlinearity has been developed at this moment however at t 25 s the second peak has been excited which means that some of the energy absorbed from external excitation has been transferred to frequency 2ω e because of nonlinearity from figs 7 and 8 we can see that at about t 40 s when the wave elevation is the largest the liquid system contains the most energy 5 2 resonant response of lower layer the numerical model is then used to study another case in which the frequency of external excitation is near the natural frequency related to the response of interface between two layers in this study the length of the tank l 1 0 m the depth of lower layer h 1 0 1 m the depth of upper layer h 2 0 25 m the density of lower layer ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 and the density of upper layer ρ 2 0 85ρ 1 therefore with g 9 81 m s2 the first mode of natural frequency related to upper layer response ω 12 4 9292 s 1 and the first mode of natural frequency related to lower layer response ω 11 1 0 s 1 the frequency of external excitation ω e ω 11 1 0 s 1 and b 0 2 m the employed mesh system has 100 uniform horizontal grids with mesh size δx 0 01 m and 200 uniform vertical grids with δz 0 003 m the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure the numerical stability the simulation runs up to t 100 s it used about 8 cpu hours in this computation the snap shots of the free surface and interface at t 20 40 60 63 2 80 100 s are shown in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the free surface is standing wave while the interface between two layers exhibits a pattern of traveling wave the shape of which is similar to a hydraulic jump sciortino et al 2009 it should be noted that at t 63 2 s because of the resonant interface droplets of both liquids are formed which are plunged or splashed into the other liquid the numerical results of free surface and interface displacement at x a right boundary are compared with those from analytical solution 13 and 12 in fig 10 a and b it can be found that in the first 15 s the displacements of interface and free surface are in the same order of magnitude and the numerical results of free surface and interface elevations favorably match the analytical solution however after that it becomes obvious that lower layer absorbs much more energy from external excitation and the displacement of interface between two layers becomes much larger than that of free surface again the nonlinearity prevents the displacement of interface from going infinity as behaved in linear analytical solution instead the elevation becomes stable after t 40 s using fft technique the corresponding wave energy density spectrum right column of fig 10 can be obtained for the upper layer the largest three peaks of energy density spectrum from numerical results which correspond to ω e ω 12 and ω 32 match those from linear analytical solution however for the response of lower layer which exhibits resonant pattern only two dominant frequencies exist in the spectrum of linear analytical solution in contrast it can be seen from fig 10 b besides peaks that correspond to ω e and ω 12 a series of frequencies that are equal to the integral times of ω e i e 2ω e 3ω e 6ω e etc are excited because of nonlinearity further investigations on energy transfer mechanism among different modes and layers by utilizing wt technique in order to study the change of energy density along with time as can be seen from fig 11 a and b it can be observed that energy contained in two frequency bands exists throughout time i e ω e ω 11 and ω 12 for free surface despite the external excitation more energy is stored in its natural frequency ω 12 so the dominant frequency of response corresponds to ω 12 for lower layer it is naturally assumed that because the frequency of external excitation equals to its natural frequency most energy should correspond to ω e ω 11 nevertheless the movement of free surface actually affects the response of lower interface from the very beginning and the band corresponding to ω 12 exist all the time in fig 11 b besides the energy transfer between layers we can also observe energy transfer among different modes from fig 11 a and b five energy density spectra at specific time t 5 20 40 60 80 s are also drawn in fig 11 a and b it can be seen from fig 11 a that at t 5 and 20 s unlike frequency patterns in other time frequency corresponding to 2ω e does not exist indicating that little nonlinearity has been developed at these moments and few energies has been transferred to frequency corresponding to 2ω e however as the lower layer absorbs more energy from external excitation some of these energies has been transferred to frequency 2ω e 3ω e 6ω e etc because of nonlinearity from fig 11 we can confirm that after 40 s the response gets stable as the energy density spectra are almost identical in height and shape 5 3 resonant response of both upper and lower layers finally we will investigate a case in which both the free surface and the interface between two layers exhibit resonant effect in this study the parameters are as follows the length of the tank l 1 0 m the depth of lower layer h 1 0 2 m the depth of upper layer h 2 0 1 m the density of lower layer ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 and the density of upper layer is only 0 6 time that of lower layer i e ρ 2 0 6ρ 1 therefore with g 9 81 m s2 the first mode of natural frequency related to upper layer response ω 12 4 6210 s 1 and the third mode of natural frequency related to lower layer response ω 31 4 2991 s 1 in the simulation the amplitude of external excitation b 0 002 m and the frequency of external excitation equals to the third mode of natural frequency related to lower layer and near the first mode of natural frequency related to upper layer i e ω e ω 31 0 93ω 12 the employed mesh system has 100 uniform horizontal grids with mesh size δx 0 01 m and 200 uniform vertical grids with δz 0 0025 m the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure the numerical stability the simulation runs up to t 110 s it used 12 cpu hours in this computation the snap shots of the free surface and interface between two liquid layers at t 0 0 15 0 30 0 45 0 60 0 and 75 0 s are shown in fig 12 in which we can find the third mode response for lower layer and the first mode response for upper layer especially in fig 12 c and d the numerical results of free surface and interface displacement at x a right boundary are also compared with the analytical solution 13 and 12 in fig 13 a and b fairly good agreements are obtained in the comparison in the first 20 s it can be found that in 50 s the resonant displacement of free surface is of beat vibration style but the amplitude of every beat is almost the same nevertheless the resonant style for displacement of interface between two liquid layers is quite different due to the beat vibration of upper layer the displacement of interface of lower layer also exhibits style of beat vibration however we can see that for displacement of interface the amplitude of every beat becomes larger since the frequency of external excitation equals to the third mode of the natural frequency of lower layer therefore after the third beat the displacement of interface grows to the same order to that of the free surface after 35 s it is found that the numerical results of interface amplitude are smaller than those from analytical solution the reason probably arises from the restriction of resonant upper layer from the spectral analysis shown in fig 13 a and b besides peaks that correspond to the frequency of external excitation ω e ω 31 and natural frequencies ω 12 additional peaks that are equal to the sum of the external excitation and natural frequency i e ω e ω 12 twice the external excitation i e 2ω e and twice the natural frequency i e 2ω 12 etc also exist in the energy density spectrum indicating nonlinearity plays significant role in the sloshing process and the energy has been transferred from lower modes to higher modes using wt technique the energy density change along with time can be obtained in fig 14 a and b two energy density spectra at instances of wave crests and wave nodes of both free surface and interface are also drawn in fig 14 a and b for the free surface the chosen time t 58 3 and 68 3 s while for the interface the chosen time t 55 6 and 65 0 s it can be seen from fig 14 that the dominant frequency corresponds to ω e ω 31 and near ω 12 exists throughout time since the modes of resonant responses of free surface and interface are totally different there exists a time difference between the nodes and crests of free surface and interface therefore it is probable that the resonant response with different modes of both free surface and interface may generate nonlinear interaction between two layers and different modes 6 results of 3 d layered sloshing under surge and sway excitation 6 1 validation of 3 d layered sloshing against superposed analytical solution in this section a 3 d simulation of two layered liquid sloshing in a hexahedron tank with tank length 2a and width 2w fig 15 is investigated in x direction the tank is under periodic excitation i e u e x b x ω e x cos ω e x t where u e x is the velocity of tank in x direction b x is the displacement amplitude of surge excitation and ω e x is the angular frequency of the external surge excitation in y direction the tank is also under periodic excitation i e u e y b y ω e y cos ω e y t where u e y is the velocity of tank in y direction b y is the displacement amplitude of sway excitation and ω e y is the angular frequency of the external sway excitation combining the linear analytical solution under 1 d excitation which has been discussed in sec 3 2 in both x direction and y direction the 3 d linear analytical solution of lower layer surface elevation at an arbitrary point x y under both surge and sway excitation is as follows 15 η 1 ξ x y t a m 1 n 1 2 ε m e x d x ˆ sin λ m ξ x sin λ m a m n x t g w m 1 n 1 2 ε m e y d y ˆ sin λ m ξ y sin λ m a m n y t g and the 3 d linear analytical solution of upper layer surface elevation can be determined by 16 η 2 ξ x y t a m 1 n 1 2 ε m e x sin λ m ξ x sin λ m a m n x t g w m 1 n 1 2 ε m e y sin λ m ξ y sin λ m a m n y

ω m n x 0 τ u e x τ sin ω m n x t τ d τ 18 a m n y t ω m n y 0 τ u e y τ sin ω m n y t τ d τ in which u e x τ and u e y τ are the acceleration of surge and sway excitation respectively in the calculation we use the parameters h 1 h 2 0 1 m 2a 0 57 m 2w 0 31 m ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 ρ 2 0 84ρ 1 in the simulation the amplitude of surge excitation b x 0 0005 m and the frequency of surge excitation ω ex 0 95ω 12x 6 1918 s 1 the amplitude of sway excitation b y 0 005 m and the frequency of sway excitation ω ey 0 98ω 11y 2 5019 s 1 the domain is discretized by 114 62 uniform grids in the horizontal plane in contrast 95 non uniform grids with 20 grids the minimum δz 0 0015 m near the free surface and the interface are used in vertical direction the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure the numerical stability the simulations run up to t 45 s the numerical results of free surface and interface displacement at northeast corner numerical wave gauge in fig 15 of the tank are compared with the superposed analytical solution 16 and 15 in fig 16 a and b due to the fact that both frequencies of external excitation in surge and sway motion are near values of first mode of natural frequencies in x and y directions we can see that both free surface and interface exhibit resonant phenomenon the numerical results agree very well with the superposed linear analytical solution in the first 25s using the fast fourier transform fft technique we can obtain the corresponding wave energy density spectrum in fig 16 a and b for upper layer response the dominant twin angular frequencies of the energy density are 6 2 s 1 and 6 5 s 1 which corresponds to the frequency of surge excitation ω ex and the first mode of natural frequency in x direction ω 12x related to the upper layer response the third largest peak is around 9 78 s 1 which is close to the first mode of theoretical natural frequency related to the upper layer response in y direction ω 12y the next largest peak corresponds to the frequency of sway excitation ω ey which is also near the first mode of natural frequency in y direction ω 11y related to the upper layer response on the other hand for the lower layer response the dominant frequency corresponds to the frequency of excitation in y direction ω ey which is near ω 11y therefore it can be seen from fig 16 a and b that the period of sloshing waves in lower layer is larger than that in upper layer using wt technique the energy density change along with time can be obtained in fig 17 a and b five energy density spectra at specific time t 1 9 18 27 36 s are also drawn in fig 17 a and b it can be seen from fig 17 that for both free surface and interface the dominant frequencies correspond to ω ey ω 11 ω ex ω 12 and ω 12y exists throughout time it can be seen from fig 17 b that as the sloshing wave amplitude of interface becomes higher the energy density corresponding to ω ey ω 11 also gets larger along with time 6 2 violent 3 d layered sloshing in this section 3 d simulation of violent two layered liquid sloshing in a hexahedron tank with tank length 2a and width 2w fig 15 is investigated in the calculation we use the parameters h 1 h 2 0 1 m 2a 0 57 m 2w 0 31 m ρ 1 1 0 10 3 kg m3 ρ 2 0 84ρ 1 in the simulation the amplitude of surge excitation b x 0 05 m and the frequency of excitation ω ex 4 192 s 1 the amplitude of sway excitation b y 0 05 m and the frequency of excitation ω ey 5 08 s 1 the frequencies of excitation in x and y direction are both far from the natural frequencies related to upper layer however the amplitudes of excitation in x direction and y direction are both relatively large so strong nonlinear phenomenon and even sloshing waves with broken free surface are expected in the simulation the domain is discretized by 57 31 50 uniform grids with δx δy δz 0 01 m the time step is automatically adjusted to ensure numerical stability the simulations run up to t 50 s it takes about 17 cpu hours to complete this case the simulation results of two layered sloshing are shown in fig 18 as the excitation amplitude is large it can be seen that violent response such as ceiling hitting waves broken free surfaces with droplets and bubbles is formed during sloshing the time histories of the free surface and interface elevation which is estimated by integrating vof functions in vertical direction at 0 285 0 155 m are shown in the left column of fig 19 it can be seen that the wave amplitude of free surface is much larger than that of interface between two liquids using fft technique we can obtain the corresponding wave energy density spectrum right column of fig 19 for the upper layer the dominant frequencies of energy density are 4 19 s 1 and 5 08 s 1 which are equal to the frequencies of external surge and sway excitation ω ex and ω ey besides peaks that correspond to natural frequency related to response of upper layer such as ω 12x integral times of the frequencies of external excitations like 2ω ex and 2ω ey can also be found from the spectrum for the lower layer the dominant frequencies of energy density are also equal to ω ex and ω ey we can also find peaks that correspond to natural frequencies related to responses of both upper layer ω 12x and lower layer ω 11y in addition integral times of the frequencies of external excitations such as 2ω ey exist too in the spectrum of lower layer elevation the numerical simulations presented in this section demonstrate the model s excellent performance in terms of three dimensional layered liquid sloshing under surge and sway excitation 7 conclusion in this study a 3 d multiphase fluid flow model newtank has been developed to solve the spatially averaged nses in order to simulate layered sloshing under horizontal external excitations a multi layered volume of fluid ml vof method has been proposed and it has been proven that this method is capable of tracking the free surface and interfaces between two liquids simultaneously provided that the two surfaces are immiscible the model has been employed to study 2 d and 3 d two layered liquid sloshing in rectangular tanks and has the capability of simulating both linear and nonlinear sloshing processes including breaking free surface and breaking interface laboratory experiments are also conducted for layered sloshing under the external excitation of surge motion in order to provide the data for model validation the model is first validated against linear analytical solutions and experimental data for 2 d layered liquid sloshing for small amplitude sloshing the numerical results agree favorably with the linear theories and experimental data on the other hand for layered sloshing with resonant response the numerical results deviate from the linear theory and exhibit obvious nonlinear wave effects the sloshing response of upper and lower layers can be in phase or totally different for example the sloshing response in upper layer is standing wave while that in lower layer is traveling wave especially when the depth of lower layer is relatively small the sloshing of upper layer is of 1st mode response whereas that of lower layer is of 3rd mode response as a result the style of two layered sloshing is much more complicated than that of single layer fluid spectral analysis of the corresponding energy density is made by employing fast fourier transform fft and wavelet transform wt technique upper layer resonance lower layer resonance and resonance of both layers have been studied systematically it has been found that the natural frequency of upper layer liquid ω m2 usually has effects on liquids of both layers and this kind of influence exists from the very beginning of sloshing process when resonance occurs as the amplitude grows more peaks corresponding to integral times of external excitation frequency or sum of different modes can appear but such additional frequencies do not show up from the beginning of sloshing only when the nonlinearity becomes strong enough will the energy start to transfer from lower modes to higher modes finally 3 d liquid sloshing is studied with the numerical model it is found that the analytical solution which is derived for 2 d liquid sloshing can be extended to 3 d cases with linear superposition the violent liquid sloshing with broken free surface interface and strong turbulence can also be simulated by the present model with reasonable accuracy credit authorship contribution statement dongming liu conceptualization methodology validation

20989,targeting at the innovative float over deck fod installation with rapid load transfer technique the continuous numerical simulations of the specific mating process are conducted based on the coupled multi body model developed in the paper where the detailed interaction effects of the leg mating unit lmu and the deck support unit dsu especially the time varying hydrodynamic forces are considered simultaneously the established model coincides with the experimental and simo results in terms of barge motion responses both at regular and random wave excitations the motions of barge and topside as well as the corresponding loads of the lmu and dsu are analyzed it shows that the quick load transferring operation leads to significant changes on barge motion responses and the trim angles of barge and topside have significantly influence on the loads of dsu and lmu moreover the feasibility of the rapid fod installation system at harsh open sea condition is carried out and arriving that it is functional well when suffering from long period swell the results prove that the continuous simulation method representing the real situation of the rapid load transfer technique can constantly investigate the consecutive responses and detect the potential risk of the fod installation in advance keywords continuous simulations coupled multi body model float over deck installation rapid load transfer technique long period swell 1 introduction integrated decks have become the most preferential topsides in design construction practice benefiting from the reduced durations of offshore installation hook up and commissioning liu and li 2017 the main technical challenges for the application of them are the installation issues due to growing weight and size in combination with dynamic effects and uncertainties in open waters the fod installation gained prominence for integrated deck operations because of its relatively larger installation capacity and lower costs o neill et al 2000 it was no longer a novel approach that has been widely carried out in over the past 40 years edelson et al 2008 vernes et al 2019 in 1980 the rapid ballast system for hideck float over installation was first presented in offshore technique conference otc abbot et al 1980 in practical terms due to the time consuming operation duration and relatively poor motion characteristics of conventional float over in open waters some innovative deck lowering systems were introduced one of great superiority of them is the broadened installation weather windows by fast load transfer techniques with the application of the hydraulic jacks which can lower the topside within several seconds the hydraulic jacks are first applied for unideck float over installation in initial mating and final separation phases while the conversional ballasting systems are still used in intermediate load transfer process tribout et al 2007 yu et al 2018 the duration of the installation process with unideck float over takes over 12 h under fine weather conditions further in 2018 the world largest construction vessel pioneering spirit completed several heavy integrated topsides installation projects allseas where the full weight of topside was rapidly transferred by using 8 sets of rapid hydraulic lifting beams within a few seconds this rapid load transferring operation keeps the actual installation duration within 4 h until now there are still few researches on the detailed analysis of consecutive effects and elaborate workability of fod with classic barges employing this kind of rapid load transfer technique in order to ensure the safety of fod installation time domain simulation is necessary to catch the extreme motion and impact loads between structures i e the barges topsides and substructure the leg mating unit lmu deck support unit dsu and the fender system etc the cummins equations cummins 1962 in time domain are the most widely used method for simulating the steady state responses of floating body under wave excitations during analysis the steady state hydrodynamic forces are calculated in frequency domain firstly and then transferred into time domain by fourier transformation and volterra series ogilvie 1966 however at the process of lowering down operation the unsteady state responses including time varying mass of barge and hydrodynamic characteristics are not negligible at present one of most common solutions is the discrete phases analysis in which the whole mating process is divided into several steady state sub phases including pre mating phase 0 and 50 and 100 load transfer phases or even more refined chen et al 2014 firstly presented an efficient single degree of freedom wave induced impact model based on cummins equations integrated with state space model perez and fossen 2009 to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of fod system at different stages following the method proposed by chen et al 2014 zou et al 2018 further discussed the complex impact behavior of fod system at 0 25 50 75 and 100 load transfer phases koo et al 2010a b carried out the numerical simulation and experimental tests for catamaran fod installation there was pre mating phase 0 20 50 80 and 100 load transfer phases the motion responses as well as the lateral and vertical forces of lmu were calculated by the multi body time domain analysis software multisim which was developed by paulling 1995 there are some matured software that are also suitable for discontinuous analysis of fod installations such as aqwa ansys 2013 simo marintek 2012 and moses nachlinger 2013 meanwhile many efforts have been made for the consequential phases responses analysis by taking the above software ji and halkyard 2006 jung et al 2018 ma et al 2018 tahar et al 2006 geba et al 2017 carried out the hydrodynamic analysis of several consequential installation phases for proposed floats float over with relatively small water plane area and proved its wider sea state operability hu et al 2017 also adopted state space models to replace the time consuming convolution terms and investigated nonlinear dynamic behaviors of pre mating and 0 phases in the form of bifurcation diagrams and impact map chen et al 2017 and chen et al 2019 developed a coupled heave roll pitch model of fod system to analyze the complex responses behavior of 0 and 100 phases bai et al 2020 presented the experimental study on the unideck float over installation with load transfer by 0 30 70 and 100 phases although extensive researches have been carried out for the discrete phases analysis of mating process of fod installation the available numerical method on the continuous simulation of load transfer process are still inadequate especially when the rapid load transfer technique is employed the main issues of the discrete phases analysis method are the hidden risks of the limited analyzed phases and the ignored effects of the jacking velocity consequently a feasible coupled multi body model is developed in present study to simulate the continuous rapid load transferring operation of the full topside weight the paper is organized as follows firstly the analyzed problem is briefly introduced in section 2 section 3 elaborates on the mathematical model of the continuous multi body coupled model section 4 gives the experimental and numerical validation of the developed multi body coupled model and the code section 5 presents the detailed continuous responses analysis and feasibility analysis of the rapid load transferring process in open waters finally the conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 problem formulation for the fod installation with the application of the innovative rapid load transfer technique the whole procedure can be divided into following steps a docking the float over barge laden with the topside are self propelled or towed into the substructure slot b pre mating the barge is positioned in substructure by the specific positioning system and the topside legs are aligned with the substructure legs c load transferring the jacking system is retracted rapidly to complete 100 load transfer and separation with the topside d undocking the float over barge is removed from the substructure slot in which the load transferring operation is the most critical phase in the whole fod installation procedure a simplified model for the load transfer phase is illustrated in fig 1 the barge topside and a fixed jacket are all considered as rigid bodies the leg mating unit lmu is pre installed on the top of the jacket to absorb the impact loads and reduce the relative horizontal motions between the topside leg and jacket leg the deck support unit dsu is installed between the topside and barge to absorb the impact loads the function of fender system is to reduce the horizontal motions of barge and to absorb the impact loads between the barge and jacket structures the jacking system is used to lower the topsides to carry out the continuing time analysis of the continuous load transfer phase the 12 degree of freedom 12 dof multibody motion equations of barge and topside as well as the modeling of the coupling components including lmu dsu fender system and jacking system should be developed besides due to the significant changes of barge draft caused by the rapid load transfer operation the effects of the time varying hydrodynamic forces should also be considered there are some assumptions are considered in present studies as following a the wind and current are excluded for simplicity and only the random heading waves are considered b the drift motions caused by the second order wave forces are fully compensated by the specific positioning system that means the wave frequency motions are only discussed c the stoke of jacking system is considered large enough during the continuous load transferring operation 3 mathematical model as shown in fig 1 the motions of topside and barge are converted to its independent defined local system o t x t y t z t and o b x b y b z b which are defined at the lower deck of topside and the still waterline respectively in this section the 6 dof motions of barge and topside are firstly presented and then the numerical coupled model between them as well as the time varying hydrodynamic forces are proposed lastly the developed mathematical model is integrated to the carry out the continuing multi body time domain analysis 3 1 motion equations of a rigid body the motions of barge and topside can both considered as a 6 dof nonlinear motion equation of a rigid body based on the newton s second law the rigid body motion equations with respect to the center of gravity can be written as 1 m x g f g 2 i g d ω d t ω i g ω m g where m is the mass of the rigid body x g is the acceleration of the center of gravity i g is the moment of inertia matrix with respect to the center of gravity ω is the angular velocity f g and m g are the applied external forces and moments with respect to the center of gravity the angular acceleration can be rewritten as eq 3 3 d ω d t t 1 α 1 α 2 α 3 t 2 α 1 α 2 α 3 where α α 1 α 2 α 3 t are the euler angles in the roll pitch yaw sequence and 4 t 1 cos α 3 cos α 2 sin α 3 0 sin α 3 cos α 2 cos α 3 0 sin α 2 0 1 5 t 2 α 2 sin α 2 cos α 3 α 3 cos α 2 sin α 3 α 3 cos α 3 0 α 2 sin α 2 sin α 3 α 3 cos α 2 cos α 3 α 3 sin α 3 0 α 2 cos α 2 0 0 the eq 1 and eq 2 are only suitable for the circumstances that the origin of local coordinate system coincides with the center of gravity furthermore the more general motion equations with respect to the defined origin in the study are derived as 6 m x m t t d ω d t r g m t t ω ω r g f 7 i d ω d t ω i ω m r g t x m where i f and m are the moment of

continuous coupled model 3 2 1 transient modeling of lmu fig 2 illustrates the sketch model of lmu that consists of a docking cone to guide the stabbing of topside leg and the elastomeric unit to absorb the impact energy the geometry of docking cone is represented by diameter h height v and cone apex c1 and the effective vertical stroke of elastomeric unit is represented by es during the continuous load transferring phase the impact forces of lmu are real time updated with the instantaneous relative position of docking cones and guiding pins which can be divided into four phases as shown in fig 3 a when the relative position z p 1 z c 1 v there is no contact forces between structures where z p 1 and z c 1 are the vertical coordinates of guiding pin and cone apex respectively b when the relative position 0 z p 1 z c 1 v the force models with different contact forms for lmu are determined by the distance between the guiding pin and bevel of the cone the contact forces are modeled as eq 14 14 f l m u 0 u 0 v 0 k l u c l u u 0 v 0 k l v c l v u 0 v 0 where k l and c l represent the cascade stiffness and damping matrix of lmu and jacket legs c when the relative position e s z p 1 z c 1 0 the guiding pin has fully engaged into the docking cone the impact forces can be described as eq 15 15 f l m u k l x p 1 x c 1 c l x p 1 x c 1 d when the relative position z p 1 z c 1 e s the lmu has been fully compressed and the steel to steel contact forces are written as eq 16 16 f l m u k l e s k l e g x p 1 x c 1 e s c l x p 1 x c 1 where k l e g is the stiffness of jacket legs 3 2 2 simplified dsu and jacking system the dsu and jacking system are pre installed between the topside and barge as shown in fig 4 the sand is used to absorb the impact energy and the jacket rods are retracted to lower the topside rapidly the dsu is considered as a spring damper system while the modeling of jacking system is very complicated due to the cooperative work of control system mechanical system and hydraulic system for simplicity the jacking system is also simplified as a spring in present studies as shown in fig 5 in which k d and k j are the stiffness matrix of dsu and jacking rods respectively and c d is the damping matrix of dsu the maximum compression limit of dsu is represented by e d and the jacking operation is considered with the constant velocity v 0 similar with the modeling of lmu the impact forces are also divided into several phases according to the relative position of contact points represented by d 1 and j 1 the vertical position of j 1 should consider the motions of barge and the lowering motions of jacking system corresponding forces can be described as 17 f d j k d e d k j x d 1 x j 1 e d c d x d 1 x j 1 z d 1 z j 1 0 k d j x d 1 x j 1 c d j x d 1 x j 1 0 z d 1 z j 1 e d 0 z d 1 z j 1 e d where k d j and c d j represent the cascade stiffness and damping matrix of dsu and jacket rods 3 2 3 modeling of fender system the fender system is pre installed onto the fixed jacket legs to reduce the horizontal motions of barge and to absorb the impact loads between the barge and jacket structures the fender systems are modeled by the instantaneous motions of the contact points x b s x f and the external normal direction of barge contact surface n s 1 as shown in fig 6 the force models are given as 18 f f k f x f x b s n s 1 x f x b s n s 1 0 0 x f x b s n s 1 0 where k f is the stiffness matrix and the damping effects are excluded in present studies 3 2 4 time varying hydrodynamic forces the hydrodynamic load is calculated by linear potential flow theory which adopts average hull wetted surface to satisfy solid wall boundary conditions for the draft of barge will be changed significantly as the rapid load transfer of the whole topside weight from barge to substructure of the platforms real time hydrodynamic forces should be considered the direct theoretically method considering the body nonlinearity is to establish the boundary value problem with instantaneous hull wetted surface boundary condition at each time step however the issues of numerical instability and the time consuming solution of boundary value problem are of great limitation for the application of direct time domain method in present studies the fast interpolation using the established database of barge draft dependent hydrodynamic coefficients is adopted to evaluate the time varying hydrodynamic forces as shown in fig 7 in order to perform the interpolation of hydrodynamic loads the static analysis is executed firstly without any external wave loads to determine the changing static draft hydrodynamic coefficients including first order wave excited forces added masses and damping coefficients are calculated in frequency domain for each draft and stored in the database a considering all external forces the instantaneous position of barge is calculated and the corresponding changed static position of barge for the next time step is also obtained without external wave loads b the real time radiation hydrodynamic coefficients are linear interpolated at the new average hull wetted surface while the first order wave loads are linear interpolated at the instantaneous hull position c the first order wave forces can be calculated by eq 19 and eq 20 19 f w t re j 1 n a j f w j ω d i e i ω j t ε j 20 a j 2 s ω j δ ω where d i is the instantaneous hull position at each time step f w j ω d represents the wave excitation forces in frequency domain at draft d i s ω j is the random wave spectrum δ ω is the frequency spacing and ε j is the random phases for each component linear waves d the radiation forces are calculated by eq 21 21 f r t a t d a x t t k t τ d a τ x τ d a τ d τ where d a is the average hull wetted surface at time instance t a t d a is infinite frequency added masses at draft d a d a τ is the average hull wetted surface at time instance τ the convolution term represents the fluid memory effects where the kernel k t d a τ is the retardation function at the draft d a τ which can be calculated by eq 22 b ω d a τ is the potential damping coefficient at the draft d a τ that is calculated in frequency domain 22 k t d a τ 2 π 0 b ω d a τ cos ω t d ω according to the hydrodynamic analysis results the hydrostatic restoring forces are not changed significantly in heading waves at different drafts of barge thus the time invariable hydrostatic restoring coefficients represented by k h s are considered in present studies the hydrostatic restoring forces are calculated by eq 23 23 f h s k h s x 3 3 integration of continuous multi body coupled model based on the established rigid body motion as eq 9 and the transient models of lmu dsu jacking system and fender system as well as the time varying hydrodynamic forces the continuous coupled multi body model in time domain for rapid load transfer process is summarized as 24 m b a t d a 0 0 m t x b t x t t t k t τ d a τ x b τ d a τ d τ 0 0

numerical integration algorithms are of great importance to make the simulations accurate and efficient the selected fod installation system as well as hydrodynamic loads of barge for certain different drafts are presented firstly the detailed numerical integration algorithms for time domain simulation and the validation of established model are elaborate in this section 4 1 fod installation system description 4 1 1 system particulars with the goal of investigating the continuous responses of innovative fod installation with rapid load transfer technique a fod installation model involves a t shaped barge laden with an integrated deck of 10 000 t are developed as shown in fig 8 during the continuous load transferring process the rapid lowering down operation is carried out by the hydraulic jacking system to transfer the full weight of topside from the barges onto a pre installed fixed jacket at 25 m water depth quickly the retractions of jacket rods are operated with a constant velocity until the top of dsu have separated with the topside the barge has different breadth at the bow and the stern which is specially designed to satisfy the breadth limit of the substructure slot and improve the transverse stability for both transportation and mating operation the principal dimensions and mass parameters of t shaped barge and topside are listed in table 1 there are 6 sets of lmus and dsus which are preinstalled onto the top of jacket legs and jacking system the lmus and dsus are anti clockwise numbered as shown in fig 8 for conciseness the load capacities of the lmus dsus are assumed to take 100 of the topside weight considering the eccentricity effect of the topside lmus are modeled as different stiffness and damping coefficient and so are the dsus as shown in fig 9 the maximum compression limits of lmus is 0 5 m and 0 25 m for dsus when the vertical strokes of lmus dsus are fully compressed the contact forces will fall into the steel to steel collisions the specific vertical stiffness value of lmus dsus jacket legs and jacket rods are listed in table 2 in the study the damping coefficients c l d of lmu and dsu are simply calculated through eq 25 chen et al 2017 where δ l d and k l d are the corresponding compression limit and stiffness for each lmu and dsu and μ l d is the damping ratios which is taken as 0 15 and g is the gravitational acceleration the lmus are considered to have the same linear horizontal stiffness and so are the dsus table 3 lists the other main parameters of the fod installation system 25 c l

frequency range from 0 2 rad s to 2 rad s with a step of 0 03 rad s in present studies the hydrodynamic analysis is carried out by wadam 2010 with a step changed drafts of 0 2m as shown in fig 10 fig 12 the first order wave excitation forces in heading direction and the radiation coefficients of added mass and potential damping are compared for certain changed drafts here the incremental twin numbers in definition of the radiation coefficients represent the direction of the barge surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions respectively the results indicate that hydrodynamic loads are changed significantly for barge motions in horizontal plane while it is changed within relatively tight bounds for barge heave roll and pitch motions besides it also shows that the variation trend of the hydrodynamic loads is consistent with the change of barge drafts thus the interpolation method is feasible for the time varying hydrodynamic loads evaluation 4 2 numerical integration algorithm 4 2 1 truncated retardation function state space model is widely used to replace the time consuming convolution term as eq 24 in time domain simulation but for the time varying hydrodynamic forces the identification of parameters of state space model at each time step are time consuming for the memory effects of hydrodynamic force will be decayed to near zero after a short period the directly truncated model of retardation function trf is applied in this study fig 13 and fig 14 show the radiation coefficients of added mass and potential damping calculated by the trf and the frequency domain solved fds results of the maximum and minimum barge drafts the comparison results indicate that the trf is valid for the calculation of the radiation forces 4 2 2 numerical simulation of multi body motion equations the 4th order runge kutta numerical method is applied here to drive the time domain responses described by eq 24 the hydrodynamic coefficients are updated according the barge motions to consider the time varying hydrodynamic effects detailed numerical algorithm is given as following a the multi body motion eq 24 are rewritten as eq 26 the initial value of vectors of displacement and velocity is given as x i x i at t i and the time step is δ t 26 m x f x x b the progressive parameters of algorithm are calculated by eq 27 27 k 11 x i k 21 m 1 f x i x i k 12 x i δ t

with the experimental results that conducted in key laboratory of ocean engineering of shandong province as shown in fig 15 the topside is fixed onto the barge to measure the system motion responses in regular waves the stiffness of dsu is set large enough to represent the rigid connections the scale ratio of the model test is determined to be 1 40 during the experimental tests the fod system motion responses in wave periods of 2s 12s are tested with the limitation of wave making capacity fig 16 shows the corresponding heave roll and pitch motions of barge in regular waves where the established model agree with the experimental results well 4 3 2 validation with software results barge motion responses of coupled multi body models established in this paper are compared with those arriving from simo that is a universally recognized software for time domain simulation of a multi body system in offshore engineering filed marintek 2012 the random wave condition of jonswap spectrum hypothesis with significant wave height of 2m and peak period of 6 7s in beam seas direction is employed here fig 17 shows the amplitudes of sway heave and roll motions at the origin of defined local coordinates of the floating barge in fig 1 thus it can be seen that satisfactory agreement is obtained between the two sets of results 5 results and discussion as for fod installation in open waters the responses of barge are affected significantly by the height and period of incident wave that may lead to them beyond the offshore operation restrictions in the paper the continuous motions of barge and topside as well as the loads of lmu and dsu during rapid load transferring operation under random wave sea state are discussed besides the operation duration and limited weather windows are the great factors dominating success of the whole project soundly and cost effectively with the innovative deck lowering system studied here the feasibility analysis for rapid load transfer technique in long period swell conditions are carried out the static analysis is firstly carried out to determine the changing static draft as listed in table 4 then the simulations are conducted under the random heading waves represented by the theoretical jonswap spectrum with parameters listed in table 5 the random wave surface is described by superimposing a series of regular wave components the time step is determined to be 0 2s for the time domain simulation 5 1 continuous responses analysis of rapid load transferring process 5 1 1 motions of barge and topside the dynamic responses at condition 1 listed in table 3 are discussed in this section fig 18 shows the continuous simulation results of heave motions of barge and topside during the rapid load transferring process at pre mating phase zooming in as fig 13 on the right there are amplitude and phase difference of heave motions between the topside and barge which is mainly caused by the elasticity of the dsu at the initial load transferring stage the clearance as well as the vertical height of docking cones are reduced by the retraction of the jacket rods for the topside is still fully supported by the barge in this time the heave motion of barge does not change a lot as the continued quick lowering down operation the guide pins are fully accessed to the docking cone and the weight of topside is transferring to the substructure rapidly according to slopes of the motion curves the lowering down velocity is reduced because the reaction forces provided by the lmus meanwhile the quick load transferring operation leads to dramatic decrease of barge draft the maximum value of barge heave motions is reaching about 1 6 m at the separation phase highlighted with box index in fig 18 it should be considered into the stroke design of hydraulic jacks eventually the barge heave motions are gradually decay to the wave induced response with a mean value of 1 5m as shown in fig 19 the pitch motions of the barge and topside are synchronic before the load starts transferring as a result of the constraints of lmu the trim angles of topside are slightly less than the barge pitch at the initial load transfer phase the topside pitch is decreased to about 0 6 when the sloped side lmus are fully compressed it is gradually increasing to zero meanwhile the barge trim angle is continued to decrease as the load transferring to the substructure the inertia force produced maximum pitch motion of barge is also observed about 1 9 at the separation phase fig 20 shows the continuous surge motions of barge and topside similar to fig 18 the surge motion of topside is slightly larger than that of barge at pre loading phase due to the same reason in the rapid load transfer phase the barge moves forward as load is transferring the maximum surge motion is around 0 45 m at the separation phase which would attribute to the coupled effects of heave and pitch motions while for the topside the surge motion is greatly restricted by the lmu during the load transfer phase based on the continuous numerical simulation of the motion results of the fod installation system during the rapid load transferring process it can be concluded that the rapid load transfer technique leads to significant changes on barge motion responses the maximum value of barge motions is reaching at the separation phase because of the inertia force produced by the rapid load transfer operation that should be paid certain attention for the design of jacking or positioning system 5 1 2 lmu and dsu loads fig 21 and fig 22 are the time histories of the vertical loads of dsu and lmu due to the topside gravity is decentered in horizontal plane the mass of topside is distributed unevenly on dsus before load starts transferring as the load is transferring the decrease of dsu loads and increase of lmu loads are obvious from the continuous simulation results eventually the vertical loads of dsu reduce to zero while those of lmu reach to its designed static load each more attention should be paid for the loads of dsu during final mating phase zooming in as fig 21 on the right the dsu at different positions separate with the topside in different time that is highlighted with point index the causes are mainly attributed to the trim angles of the barge and topside that lead to the dsu in the sloped side separate earlier with the topside for the same reason the vertical loads of lmu3 and lmu4 in the sloped side increase about 6 comparing with static loads while that is 2 for lmu1 and lmu2 highlighted with box index in fig 22 fig 23 shows the continuous simulation results of lateral loads of dsu in rapid load transferring process the same lateral loads of each dsu are observed due to the zero trim of the barge and topside before the load starts transferring in the rapid load transfer phase the lateral loads are increased which could be attributed to the pitch motions as demonstrated in fig 19 in the final mating phase highlighted with point index in fig 23 on the right the earlier separation of the sloped side of dsu leads to the large increase of lateral loads in remaining connected dsu the lateral loads of lmu during the rapid load transfer process are shown in fig 24 before the load starts transferring the impact loads between the guide pins and docking cones are observed firstly under the external wave loads during the rapid load transfer phase the maximum lateral loads of slope side lmu3 and lmu4 are observed due to the trim angle of topside the continuous contact loads results indicate that trim angles of barge and topside have significantly influence on the loads of dsu and lmu the trim angles lead to the larger vertical and lateral loads for lmu in the sloped side and further bring the larger forces for the remaining connected dsu which should be paid much attention for the system design 5 2 feasibility analysis at harsh wave condition there is no doubt that the rapid load transfer technique has great potential in reducing the installation time for fod installation operation the experimental results bai et al 2020 indicated that fod installation is much more sensitive to wave period in spite of relatively small wave height the operability of rapid load transfer process at harsh wave conditions especially of long period swells should be given attention the feasibility analysis of the fod installation system set up in this paper are carried out with the increased wave period of condition 2 listed in table 5 fig 25 and fig 26 show the comparison of the heave motions of barge and topside during the rapid load transferring process at assumptions of above two sea state before the load starts transferring the heave motions of barge and topside are both increased dramatically at long period swell condition while in rapid load transfer phase there is limited oscillatory motions for barge and topside after the whole weight is transferred to the substructure the topside is located on the substructure safely by the continued retraction of jacking system from the above motion results it can be concluded that with the application of the rapid load transfer technique the effects of heave motions at long period swell conditions during load transfer operation are not too much meanwhile the property of loads of lmus at long period swell condition is of interest here the vertical contact loads of lmu1 that supports the maximum weight of topside is discussed in this section fig 27 shows a comparison of the results according to two wave conditions although the increased impact forces of lmu1 are encountered in long period swell conditions the large impact energy for the topside and substructure are absorbed with the function of the elastomeric unit in the final load transfer phase there are few steel to steel contact forces due to reduced exposure time of fod installation with the application of rapid load transfer technique supposing that the fod installation is operated with long time in long period swell conditions which is considered as condition 3 similar to that of the application of conventional rapid ballast system the associated potential risks are demonstrated in fig 28 it can be seen that with the long exposure time set at condition2 wave excitation more and larger steel to steel contact loads are observed in final load transfer phase zooming in as fig 28 on the right considering the variability of random waves 20 times time domain simulation of each condition with different seeds are conducted fig 29 shows the statistical results of maximum vertical loads of lmu1 in different conditions it is obvious that the significant value as well as the maximum forces are both reduced with the application of rapid load transfer technique based on the investigation of motions and the corresponding loads the conclusion can be drawn that the fod installation duration is functional well in the long period swell conditions with the application of rapid load transfer technique 6 conclusion with the improvement of offshore construction technology and experience accumulation from real projects the rapid load transfer technique that adopts hydraulic jacking system instead of ballasting schemes is emerging in the mating process of it the whole weight of topside is transferred from barge to the substructure within several seconds by the rapid jacking down system focusing on this rapid load transfer operation in open waters the continuous simulations of the dynamic responses of the process based on the coupled multi body model developed in this paper are conducted the model is established based on the detailed contact functions of lmu and dsu with nonlinear stiffness a simplified approximation of jacking and fender system and the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces considering the effect of the time varying wetted surface the developed mathematical multi body model and code are validated against the experimental and software calculated results based on the continuous dynamic responses of given multi body system following conclusions were drawn a due to the full topside weight onto the jacket legs in several seconds through quick load transferring system the barge draft and trim angles are decreased significantly the coupled effects of heave and pitch motions lead to the equilibrium position change of barge surge motions the trim angle of topside is decreased until the sloped side lmu are fully compressed and then will be gradually to be zero b during the separation phase the barge heave pitch and surge motions reach its maximum value due to the inertia force produced by the rapid load transfer operation all these should be paid much attention for the design of jacking system and positioning system to avoid the large impact loads the barge motions are gradually decayed to the wave induced motions eventually c the trim angles of barge and topside have significantly influence on the loads of dsu and lmu from the initial mating phase to the moment when the trim angle of topside decreased to the minimum the loads of the sloped side lmu are increased a lot after that the trim angles further lead to the dsu at different positions separate with the topside in different time the earlier separation of the sloped side dsu leads to the large increase of the lateral loads for the remaining connected dsu d with the application of rapid load transfer technique the fod installation system in the study is functional well in the long period swell conditions in the rapid load transfer phase the limited effects of the increased wave period are observed for both motions and impact loads due to the reduced exposure time of fod installation comparing the responses with the long exposure time simulation results the large and multiple steel to steel contact loads are avoided for rapid load transfer operation the results prove that the continuous simulation method proposed can constantly investigate the consecutive effects and explore the workability of the fod installation using rapid load transfer technique elaborately it should also be noted that a more refined numerical model reflecting the real situation of specific positioning system and motion compensator unit designed for mitigating the impact of motion response on mating process even through the research results of this paper can provide certain reference for validation of positioning and compensator system the real time coupling mechanism among them needs to explicit further in addition experiments on the continuous rapid load transfer process are also necessary in the future study credit authorship contribution statement shujie zhao conceptualization

20989,targeting at the innovative float over deck fod installation with rapid load transfer technique the continuous numerical simulations of the specific mating process are conducted based on the coupled multi body model developed in the paper where the detailed interaction effects of the leg mating unit lmu and the deck support unit dsu especially the time varying hydrodynamic forces are considered simultaneously the established model coincides with the experimental and simo results in terms of barge motion responses both at regular and random wave excitations the motions of barge and topside as well as the corresponding loads of the lmu and dsu are analyzed it shows that the quick load transferring operation leads to significant changes on barge motion responses and the trim angles of barge and topside have significantly influence on the loads of dsu and lmu moreover the feasibility of the rapid fod installation system at harsh open sea condition is carried out and arriving that it is functional well when suffering from long period swell the results prove that the continuous simulation method representing the real situation of the rapid load transfer technique can constantly investigate the consecutive responses and detect the potential risk of the fod installation in advance keywords continuous simulations coupled multi body model float over deck installation rapid load transfer technique long period swell 1 introduction integrated decks have become the most preferential topsides in design construction practice benefiting from the reduced durations of offshore installation hook up and commissioning liu and li 2017 the main technical challenges for the application of them are the installation issues due to growing weight and size in combination with dynamic effects and uncertainties in open waters the fod installation gained prominence for integrated deck operations because of its relatively larger installation capacity and lower costs o neill et al 2000 it was no longer a novel approach that has been widely carried out in over the past 40 years edelson et al 2008 vernes et al 2019 in 1980 the rapid ballast system for hideck float over installation was first presented in offshore technique conference otc abbot et al 1980 in practical terms due to the time consuming operation duration and relatively poor motion characteristics of conventional float over in open waters some innovative deck lowering systems were introduced one of great superiority of them is the broadened installation weather windows by fast load transfer techniques with the application of the hydraulic jacks which can lower the topside within several seconds the hydraulic jacks are first applied for unideck float over installation in initial mating and final separation phases while the conversional ballasting systems are still used in intermediate load transfer process tribout et al 2007 yu et al 2018 the duration of the installation process with unideck float over takes over 12 h under fine weather conditions further in 2018 the world largest construction vessel pioneering spirit completed several heavy integrated topsides installation projects allseas where the full weight of topside was rapidly transferred by using 8 sets of rapid hydraulic lifting beams within a few seconds this rapid load transferring operation keeps the actual installation duration within 4 h until now there are still few researches on the detailed analysis of consecutive effects and elaborate workability of fod with classic barges employing this kind of rapid load transfer technique in order to ensure the safety of fod installation time domain simulation is necessary to catch the extreme motion and impact loads between structures i e the barges topsides and substructure the leg mating unit lmu deck support unit dsu and the fender system etc the cummins equations cummins 1962 in time domain are the most widely used method for simulating the steady state responses of floating body under wave excitations during analysis the steady state hydrodynamic forces are calculated in frequency domain firstly and then transferred into time domain by fourier transformation and volterra series ogilvie 1966 however at the process of lowering down operation the unsteady state responses including time varying mass of barge and hydrodynamic characteristics are not negligible at present one of most common solutions is the discrete phases analysis in which the whole mating process is divided into several steady state sub phases including pre mating phase 0 and 50 and 100 load transfer phases or even more refined chen et al 2014 firstly presented an efficient single degree of freedom wave induced impact model based on cummins equations integrated with state space model perez and fossen 2009 to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of fod system at different stages following the method proposed by chen et al 2014 zou et al 2018 further discussed the complex impact behavior of fod system at 0 25 50 75 and 100 load transfer phases koo et al 2010a b carried out the numerical simulation and experimental tests for catamaran fod installation there was pre mating phase 0 20 50 80 and 100 load transfer phases the motion responses as well as the lateral and vertical forces of lmu were calculated by the multi body time domain analysis software multisim which was developed by paulling 1995 there are some matured software that are also suitable for discontinuous analysis of fod installations such as aqwa ansys 2013 simo marintek 2012 and moses nachlinger 2013 meanwhile many efforts have been made for the consequential phases responses analysis by taking the above software ji and halkyard 2006 jung et al 2018 ma et al 2018 tahar et al 2006 geba et al 2017 carried out the hydrodynamic analysis of several consequential installation phases for proposed floats float over with relatively small water plane area and proved its wider sea state operability hu et al 2017 also adopted state space models to replace the time consuming convolution terms and investigated nonlinear dynamic behaviors of pre mating and 0 phases in the form of bifurcation diagrams and impact map chen et al 2017 and chen et al 2019 developed a coupled heave roll pitch model of fod system to analyze the complex responses behavior of 0 and 100 phases bai et al 2020 presented the experimental study on the unideck float over installation with load transfer by 0 30 70 and 100 phases although extensive researches have been carried out for the discrete phases analysis of mating process of fod installation the available numerical method on the continuous simulation of load transfer process are still inadequate especially when the rapid load transfer technique is employed the main issues of the discrete phases analysis method are the hidden risks of the limited analyzed phases and the ignored effects of the jacking velocity consequently a feasible coupled multi body model is developed in present study to simulate the continuous rapid load transferring operation of the full topside weight the paper is organized as follows firstly the analyzed problem is briefly introduced in section 2 section 3 elaborates on the mathematical model of the continuous multi body coupled model section 4 gives the experimental and numerical validation of the developed multi body coupled model and the code section 5 presents the detailed continuous responses analysis and feasibility analysis of the rapid load transferring process in open waters finally the conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 problem formulation for the fod installation with the application of the innovative rapid load transfer technique the whole procedure can be divided into following steps a docking the float over barge laden with the topside are self propelled or towed into the substructure slot b pre mating the barge is positioned in substructure by the specific positioning system and the topside legs are aligned with the substructure legs c load transferring the jacking system is retracted rapidly to complete 100 load transfer and separation with the topside d undocking the float over barge is removed from the substructure slot in which the load transferring operation is the most critical phase in the whole fod installation procedure a simplified model for the load transfer phase is illustrated in fig 1 the barge topside and a fixed jacket are all considered as rigid bodies the leg mating unit lmu is pre installed on the top of the jacket to absorb the impact loads and reduce the relative horizontal motions between the topside leg and jacket leg the deck support unit dsu is installed between the topside and barge to absorb the impact loads the function of fender system is to reduce the horizontal motions of barge and to absorb the impact loads between the barge and jacket structures the jacking system is used to lower the topsides to carry out the continuing time analysis of the continuous load transfer phase the 12 degree of freedom 12 dof multibody motion equations of barge and topside as well as the modeling of the coupling components including lmu dsu fender system and jacking system should be developed besides due to the significant changes of barge draft caused by the rapid load transfer operation the effects of the time varying hydrodynamic forces should also be considered there are some assumptions are considered in present studies as following a the wind and current are excluded for simplicity and only the random heading waves are considered b the drift motions caused by the second order wave forces are fully compensated by the specific positioning system that means the wave frequency motions are only discussed c the stoke of jacking system is considered large enough during the continuous load transferring operation 3 mathematical model as shown in fig 1 the motions of topside and barge are converted to its independent defined local system o t x t y t z t and o b x b y b z b which are defined at the lower deck of topside and the still waterline respectively in this section the 6 dof motions of barge and topside are firstly presented and then the numerical coupled model between them as well as the time varying hydrodynamic forces are proposed lastly the developed mathematical model is integrated to the carry out the continuing multi body time domain analysis 3 1 motion equations of a rigid body the motions of barge and topside can both considered as a 6 dof nonlinear motion equation of a rigid body based on the newton s second law the rigid body motion equations with respect to the center of gravity can be written as 1 m x g f g 2 i g d ω d t ω i g ω m g where m

the more general motion equations with respect to the defined origin in the study are derived as 6 m x m t t d ω d t r g m t t ω ω r g f 7 i d ω d t ω i ω m r g t x m where i f and m are the moment of inertia matrix external forces and moments with respect to the origin point respectively and r g x g y g z g t is the vector of the center of gravity t is the transfer matrix between the body fixed

continuous coupled model 3 2 1 transient modeling of lmu fig 2 illustrates the sketch model of lmu that consists of a docking cone to guide the stabbing of topside leg and the elastomeric unit to absorb the impact energy the geometry of docking cone is represented by diameter h height v and cone apex c1 and the effective vertical stroke of elastomeric unit is represented by es during the continuous load transferring phase the impact forces of lmu are real time updated with the instantaneous relative position of docking cones and guiding pins which can be divided into four phases as shown in fig 3 a when the relative position z p 1 z c 1 v there is no contact forces between structures where z p 1 and z c 1 are the vertical coordinates of guiding pin and cone apex respectively b when the relative position 0 z p 1 z c 1 v the force models with different contact forms for lmu are determined by the distance between the guiding pin and bevel of the cone the contact forces are modeled as eq 14 14 f l m u 0 u 0 v 0 k l u c l u u 0 v 0 k l v c l v u 0 v 0 where k l and c l represent the cascade stiffness and damping matrix of lmu and jacket legs c when the relative position e s z p 1 z c 1 0 the guiding pin has fully engaged into the docking cone the impact forces can be described as eq 15 15 f l m u k l x p 1 x c 1 c l x p 1 x c 1 d when the relative position z p 1 z c 1 e s the lmu has been fully compressed and the steel to steel contact forces are written as eq 16 16 f l m u k l e s k l e g x p 1 x c 1 e s c l x p 1 x c 1 where k l e g is the stiffness of jacket legs 3 2 2 simplified dsu and jacking system the dsu and jacking system are pre installed between the topside and barge as shown in fig 4 the sand is used to absorb the impact energy and the jacket rods are retracted to lower the topside rapidly the dsu is considered as a spring damper system while the modeling of jacking system is very complicated due to the cooperative work of control system mechanical system and hydraulic system for simplicity the jacking system is also simplified as a spring in present studies as shown in fig 5 in which k d and k j are the stiffness matrix of dsu and jacking rods respectively and c d is the damping matrix of dsu the maximum compression limit of dsu is represented by e d and the jacking operation is considered with the constant velocity v 0 similar with the modeling of lmu the impact forces are also divided into several phases according to the relative position of contact points represented by d 1 and j 1 the vertical position of j 1 should consider the motions of barge and the lowering motions of jacking system corresponding forces can be described as 17 f d j k d e d k j x d 1 x j 1 e d c d x d 1 x j 1 z d 1 z j 1 0 k d j x d 1 x j 1 c d j x d 1 x j 1 0 z d 1 z j 1 e d 0 z d 1 z j 1 e d where k d j and c d j represent the cascade stiffness and damping matrix of dsu and jacket rods 3 2 3 modeling of fender system the fender system is pre installed onto the fixed jacket legs to reduce the horizontal motions of barge and to absorb the impact loads between the barge and jacket structures the fender systems are modeled by the instantaneous motions of the contact points x b s x f and the external normal direction of barge contact surface n s 1 as shown in fig 6 the force models are given as 18 f f k f x f x b s n s 1 x f x b s n s 1 0 0 x f x b s n s 1 0 where k f is the stiffness matrix and the damping effects are excluded in present studies 3 2 4 time varying hydrodynamic forces the hydrodynamic load is calculated by linear potential flow theory which adopts average hull wetted surface to satisfy solid wall boundary conditions for the draft of barge will be changed significantly as the rapid load transfer of the whole topside weight from barge to substructure of the platforms real time hydrodynamic forces should be considered the direct theoretically method considering the body nonlinearity is to establish the boundary value problem with instantaneous hull wetted surface boundary condition at each time step however the issues of numerical instability and the time consuming solution of boundary value problem are of great limitation for the application of direct time domain method in present studies the fast interpolation using the established database of barge draft dependent hydrodynamic coefficients is adopted to evaluate the time varying hydrodynamic forces as shown in fig 7 in order to perform the interpolation of hydrodynamic loads the static analysis is executed firstly without any external wave loads to determine the changing static draft hydrodynamic coefficients including first order wave excited forces added masses and damping coefficients are calculated in frequency domain for each draft and stored in the database a considering all external forces the instantaneous position of barge is calculated and the corresponding changed static position of barge for the next time step is also obtained without external wave loads b the real time radiation hydrodynamic coefficients are linear interpolated at the new average hull wetted surface while the first order wave loads are linear interpolated at the instantaneous hull position c the first order wave forces can be calculated by eq 19 and eq 20 19 f w t re j 1 n a j f w j ω d i e i ω j t ε j 20 a j 2 s ω j δ ω where d i is the instantaneous hull position at each time step f w j ω d represents the wave excitation forces in frequency domain at draft d i s ω j is the random wave spectrum δ ω is the frequency spacing and ε j is the random phases for each component linear waves d the radiation forces are calculated by eq 21 21 f r t a t d a x t t k t τ d a τ x τ d a τ d τ where d a is the average hull wetted surface at time instance t a t d a is infinite frequency added masses at draft d a d a τ is the average hull wetted surface at time instance τ the convolution term represents the fluid memory effects where the kernel k t d a τ is the retardation function at the draft d a τ which can be calculated by eq 22 b ω d a τ is the potential damping coefficient at the draft d a τ that is calculated in frequency domain 22 k t d a τ 2 π 0 b ω d a τ cos ω t d ω according to the hydrodynamic analysis results the hydrostatic restoring forces are not changed significantly in heading waves at different drafts of barge thus the time invariable hydrostatic restoring coefficients represented by k h s are considered in present studies the hydrostatic restoring forces are calculated by eq 23 23 f h s k h s x 3 3 integration of continuous multi body coupled model based on the established rigid body motion as eq 9 and the transient models of lmu dsu jacking system and fender system as well as the time varying hydrodynamic forces the continuous coupled multi body model in time domain for rapid load transfer process is summarized as 24 m b a t d a 0 0 m t x b t x t t t k t τ d a τ x b τ d a τ d τ 0 0

numerical integration algorithms are of great importance to make the simulations accurate and efficient the selected fod installation system as well as hydrodynamic loads of barge for certain different drafts are presented firstly the detailed numerical integration algorithms for time domain simulation and the validation of established model are elaborate in this section 4 1 fod installation system description 4 1 1 system particulars with the goal of investigating the continuous responses of innovative fod installation with rapid load transfer technique a fod installation model involves a t shaped barge laden with an integrated deck of 10 000 t are developed as shown in fig 8 during the continuous load transferring process the rapid lowering down operation is carried out by the hydraulic jacking system to transfer the full weight of topside from the barges onto a pre installed fixed jacket at 25 m water depth quickly the retractions of jacket rods are operated with a constant velocity until the top of dsu have separated with the topside the barge has different breadth at the bow and the stern which is specially designed to satisfy the breadth limit of the substructure slot and improve the transverse stability for both transportation and mating operation the principal dimensions and mass parameters of t shaped barge and topside are listed in table 1 there are 6 sets of lmus and dsus which are preinstalled onto the top of jacket legs and jacking system the lmus and dsus are anti clockwise numbered as shown in fig 8 for conciseness the load capacities of the lmus dsus are assumed to take 100 of the topside weight considering the eccentricity effect of the topside lmus are modeled as different stiffness and damping coefficient and so are the dsus as shown in fig 9 the maximum compression limits of lmus is 0 5 m and 0 25 m for dsus when the vertical strokes of lmus dsus are fully compressed the contact forces will fall into the steel to steel collisions the specific vertical stiffness value of lmus dsus jacket legs and jacket rods are listed in table 2 in the study the damping coefficients c l d of lmu and dsu are simply calculated through eq 25 chen et al 2017 where δ l d and k l d are the corresponding compression limit and stiffness for each lmu and dsu and μ l d is the damping ratios which is taken as 0 15 and g is the gravitational acceleration the lmus are considered to have the same linear horizontal stiffness and so are the dsus table 3 lists the other main parameters of the fod installation system 25 c l

frequency range from 0 2 rad s to 2 rad s with a step of 0 03 rad s in present studies the hydrodynamic analysis is carried out by wadam 2010 with a step changed drafts of 0 2m as shown in fig 10 fig 12 the first order wave excitation forces in heading direction and the radiation coefficients of added mass and potential damping are compared for certain changed drafts here the incremental twin numbers in definition of the radiation coefficients represent the direction of the barge surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions respectively the results indicate that hydrodynamic loads are changed significantly for barge motions in horizontal plane while it is changed within relatively tight bounds for barge heave roll and pitch motions besides it also shows that the variation trend of the hydrodynamic loads is consistent with the change of barge drafts thus the interpolation method is feasible for the time varying hydrodynamic loads evaluation 4 2 numerical integration algorithm 4 2 1 truncated retardation function state space model is widely used to replace the time consuming convolution term as eq 24 in time domain simulation but for the time varying hydrodynamic forces the identification of parameters of state space model at each time step are time consuming for the memory effects of hydrodynamic force will be decayed to near zero after a short period the directly truncated model of retardation function trf is applied in this study fig 13 and fig 14 show the radiation coefficients of added mass and potential damping calculated by the trf and the frequency domain solved fds results of the maximum and minimum barge drafts the comparison results indicate that the trf is valid for the calculation of the radiation forces 4 2 2 numerical simulation of multi body motion equations the 4th order runge kutta numerical method is applied here to drive the time domain responses described by eq 24 the hydrodynamic coefficients are updated according the barge motions to consider the time varying hydrodynamic effects detailed numerical algorithm is given as following a the multi body motion eq 24 are rewritten as eq 26 the initial value of vectors of displacement and velocity is given as x i x i at t i and the time step is δ t 26 m x f x x b the progressive parameters of algorithm are calculated by eq 27 27 k 11 x i k 21 m 1 f x i x i k 12 x i δ t

with the experimental results that conducted in key laboratory of ocean engineering of shandong province as shown in fig 15 the topside is fixed onto the barge to measure the system motion responses in regular waves the stiffness of dsu is set large enough to represent the rigid connections the scale ratio of the model test is determined to be 1 40 during the experimental tests the fod system motion responses in wave periods of 2s 12s are tested with the limitation of wave making capacity fig 16 shows the corresponding heave roll and pitch motions of barge in regular waves where the established model agree with the experimental results well 4 3 2 validation with software results barge motion responses of coupled multi body models established in this paper are compared with those arriving from simo that is a universally recognized software for time domain simulation of a multi body system in offshore engineering filed marintek 2012 the random wave condition of jonswap spectrum hypothesis with significant wave height of 2m and peak period of 6 7s in beam seas direction is employed here fig 17 shows the amplitudes of sway heave and roll motions at the origin of defined local coordinates of the floating barge in fig 1 thus it can be seen that satisfactory agreement is obtained between the two sets of results 5 results and discussion as for fod installation in open waters the responses of barge are affected significantly by the height and period of incident wave that may lead to them beyond the offshore operation restrictions in the paper the continuous motions of barge and topside as well as the loads of lmu and dsu during rapid load transferring operation under random wave sea state are discussed besides the operation duration and limited weather windows are the great factors dominating success of the whole project soundly and cost effectively with the innovative deck lowering system studied here the feasibility analysis for rapid load transfer technique in long period swell conditions are carried out the static analysis is firstly carried out to determine the changing static draft as listed in table 4 then the simulations are conducted under the random heading waves represented by the theoretical jonswap spectrum with parameters listed in table 5 the random wave surface is described by superimposing a series of regular wave components the time step is determined to be 0 2s for the time domain simulation 5 1 continuous responses analysis of rapid load transferring process 5 1 1 motions of barge and topside the dynamic responses at condition 1 listed in table 3 are discussed in this section fig 18 shows the continuous simulation results of heave motions of barge and topside during the rapid load transferring process at pre mating phase zooming in as fig 13 on the right there are amplitude and phase difference of heave motions between the topside and barge which is mainly caused by the elasticity of the dsu at the initial load transferring stage the clearance as well as the vertical height of docking cones are reduced by the retraction of the jacket rods for the topside is still fully supported by the barge in this time the heave motion of barge does not change a lot as the continued quick lowering down operation the guide pins are fully accessed to the docking cone and the weight of topside is transferring to the substructure rapidly according to slopes of the motion curves the lowering down velocity is reduced because the reaction forces provided by the lmus meanwhile the quick load transferring operation leads to dramatic decrease of barge draft the maximum value of barge heave motions is reaching about 1 6 m at the separation phase highlighted with box index in fig 18 it should be considered into the stroke design of hydraulic jacks eventually the barge heave motions are gradually decay to the wave induced response with a mean value of 1 5m as shown in fig 19 the pitch motions of the barge and topside are synchronic before the load starts transferring as a result of the constraints of lmu the trim angles of topside are slightly less than the barge pitch at the initial load transfer phase the topside pitch is decreased to about 0 6 when the sloped side lmus are fully compressed it is gradually increasing to zero meanwhile the barge trim angle is continued to decrease as the load transferring to the substructure the inertia force produced maximum pitch motion of barge is also observed about 1 9 at the separation phase fig 20 shows the continuous surge motions of barge and topside similar to fig 18 the surge motion of topside is slightly larger than that of barge at pre loading phase due to the same reason in the rapid load transfer phase the barge moves forward as load is transferring the maximum surge motion is around 0 45 m at the separation phase which would attribute to the coupled effects of heave and pitch motions while for the topside the surge motion is greatly restricted by the lmu during the load transfer phase based on the continuous numerical simulation of the motion results of the fod installation system during the rapid load transferring process it can be concluded that the rapid load transfer technique leads to significant changes on barge motion responses the maximum value of barge motions is reaching at the separation phase because of the inertia force produced by the rapid load transfer operation that should be paid certain attention for the design of jacking or positioning system 5 1 2 lmu and dsu loads fig 21 and fig 22 are the time histories of the vertical loads of dsu and lmu due to the topside gravity is decentered in horizontal plane the mass of topside is distributed unevenly on dsus before load starts transferring as the load is transferring the decrease of dsu loads and increase of lmu loads are obvious from the continuous simulation results eventually the vertical loads of dsu reduce to zero while those of lmu reach to its designed static load each more attention should be paid for the loads of dsu during final mating phase zooming in as fig 21 on the right the dsu at different positions separate with the topside in different time that is highlighted with point index the causes are mainly attributed to the trim angles of the barge and topside that lead to the dsu in the sloped side separate earlier with the topside for the same reason the vertical loads of lmu3 and lmu4 in the sloped side increase about 6 comparing with static loads while that is 2 for lmu1 and lmu2 highlighted with box index in fig 22 fig 23 shows the continuous simulation results of lateral loads of dsu in rapid load transferring process the same lateral loads of each dsu are observed due to the zero trim of the barge and topside before the load starts transferring in the rapid load transfer phase the lateral loads are increased which could be attributed to the pitch motions as demonstrated in fig 19 in the final mating phase highlighted with point index in fig 23 on the right the earlier separation of the sloped side of dsu leads to the large increase of lateral loads in remaining connected dsu the lateral loads of lmu during the rapid load transfer process are shown in fig 24 before the load starts transferring the impact loads between the guide pins and docking cones are observed firstly under the external wave loads during the rapid load transfer phase the maximum lateral loads of slope side lmu3 and lmu4 are observed due to the trim angle of topside the continuous contact loads results indicate that trim angles of barge and topside have significantly influence on the loads of dsu and lmu the trim angles lead to the larger vertical and lateral loads for lmu in the sloped side and further bring the larger forces for the remaining connected dsu which should be paid much attention for the system design 5 2 feasibility analysis at harsh wave condition there is no doubt that the rapid load transfer technique has great potential in reducing the installation time for fod installation operation the experimental results bai et al 2020 indicated that fod installation is much more sensitive to wave period in spite of relatively small wave height the operability of rapid load transfer process at harsh wave conditions especially of long period swells should be given attention the feasibility analysis of the fod installation system set up in this paper are carried out with the increased wave period of condition 2 listed in table 5 fig 25 and fig 26 show the comparison of the heave motions of barge and topside during the rapid load transferring process at assumptions of above two sea state before the load starts transferring the heave motions of barge and topside are both increased dramatically at long period swell condition while in rapid load transfer phase there is limited oscillatory motions for barge and topside after the whole weight is transferred to the substructure the topside is located on the substructure safely by the continued retraction of jacking system from the above motion results it can be concluded that with the application of the rapid load transfer technique the effects of heave motions at long period swell conditions during load transfer operation are not too much meanwhile the property of loads of lmus at long period swell condition is of interest here the vertical contact loads of lmu1 that supports the maximum weight of topside is discussed in this section fig 27 shows a comparison of the results according to two wave conditions although the increased impact forces of lmu1 are encountered in long period swell conditions the large impact energy for the topside and substructure are absorbed with the function of the elastomeric unit in the final load transfer phase there are few steel to steel contact forces due to reduced exposure time of fod installation with the application of rapid load transfer technique supposing that the fod installation is operated with long time in long period swell conditions which is considered as condition 3 similar to that of the application of conventional rapid ballast system the associated potential risks are demonstrated in fig 28 it can be seen that with the long exposure time set at condition2 wave excitation more and larger steel to steel contact loads are observed in final load transfer phase zooming in as fig 28 on the right considering the variability of random waves 20 times time domain simulation of each condition with different seeds are conducted fig 29 shows the statistical results of maximum vertical loads of lmu1 in different conditions it is obvious that the significant value as well as the maximum forces are both reduced with the application of rapid load transfer technique based on the investigation of motions and the corresponding loads the conclusion can be drawn that the fod installation duration is functional well in the long period swell conditions with the application of rapid load transfer technique 6 conclusion with the improvement of offshore construction technology and experience accumulation from real projects the rapid load transfer technique that adopts hydraulic jacking system instead of ballasting schemes is emerging in the mating process of it the whole weight of topside is transferred from barge to the substructure within several seconds by the rapid jacking down system focusing on this rapid load transfer operation in open waters the continuous simulations of the dynamic responses of the process based on the coupled multi body model developed in this paper are conducted the model is established based on the detailed contact functions of lmu and dsu with nonlinear stiffness a simplified approximation of jacking and fender system and the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces considering the effect of the time varying wetted surface the developed mathematical multi body model and code are validated against the experimental and software calculated results based on the continuous dynamic responses of given multi body system following conclusions were drawn a due to the full topside weight onto the jacket legs in several seconds through quick load transferring system the barge draft and trim angles are decreased significantly the coupled effects of heave and pitch motions lead to the equilibrium position change of barge surge motions the trim angle of topside is decreased until the sloped side lmu are fully compressed and then will be gradually to be zero b during the separation phase the barge heave pitch and surge motions reach its maximum value due to the inertia force produced by the rapid load transfer operation all these should be paid much attention for the design of jacking system and positioning system to avoid the large impact loads the barge motions are gradually decayed to the wave induced motions eventually c the trim angles of barge and topside have significantly influence on the loads of dsu and lmu from the initial mating phase to the moment when the trim angle of topside decreased to the minimum the loads of the sloped side lmu are increased a lot after that the trim angles further lead to the dsu at different positions separate with the topside in different time the earlier separation of the sloped side dsu leads to the large increase of the lateral loads for the remaining connected dsu d with the application of rapid load transfer technique the fod installation system in the study is functional well in the long period swell conditions in the rapid load transfer phase the limited effects of the increased wave period are observed for both motions and impact loads due to the reduced exposure time of fod installation comparing the responses with the long exposure time simulation results the large and multiple steel to steel contact loads are avoided for rapid load transfer operation the results prove that the continuous simulation method proposed can constantly investigate the consecutive effects and explore the workability of the fod installation using rapid load transfer technique elaborately it should also be noted that a more refined numerical model reflecting the real situation of specific positioning system and motion compensator unit designed for mitigating the impact of motion response on mating process even through the research results of this paper can provide certain reference for validation of positioning and compensator system the real time coupling mechanism among them needs to explicit further in addition experiments on the continuous rapid load transfer process are also necessary in the future study credit authorship contribution statement shujie zhao conceptualization
