20655,in this paper a realizable two layer k ε turbulence model and the schnerr sauer cavitation model are used to simulate dynamic behavior of asymmetric ventilated supercavies while considering the effects of internal wave s the effectiveness of the numerical method is verified via comparison with the available experimental data and the analytical solution of the internal wave velocity the results show that the presence of internal waves affects the supercavity closure patterns and shedding periods compared to a system with no internal waves the cavity shedding and pressure pulsation intensity increase and the shedding period is closely related to that of the internal wave internal waves also play an important role in the distribution of ventilated cavitation patterns inside the cavity the local cavitation number is shown to reflect the pressure change during cavity evolution and indicates that the internal wave affects the flow field inside the cavity in addition the effects of internal waves of various amplitudes on cavitator hydrodynamic performance are studied as the internal wave amplitude increases the cavity pulsation evolution becomes more intense furthermore the ventilated cavity intensity lift and drag are closely related to the amplitude of internal waves keywords numerical modeling internal wave dynamic behavior asymmetric ventilated supercavity 1 introduction cavitation occurs when the local pressure reaches the saturated vapor pressure of a liquid batchelor 2000 sun et al 2019a and often causes unsteady pressure pulsations and noise while affecting service life and concealment passandideh fard and roohi 2008 philipp and lauterborn 1998 when an underwater vehicle moves at a high speed a large pressure drop usually occurs around the vehicle typically contributing to cavitation nesteruk 2012 however scholars have studied the phenomenon of cavitation and found that when supercavitation occurs the resistance of the underwater vessel improves significantly ceccio 2010 thus supercavitation has become a key technology for high speed underwater vessels in general supercavitation can be achieved naturally or via gas ventilation however natural supercavitation is often difficult to achieve zhang et al 2016 ventilated supercavitation which improves cavity stability and reduces cavitation hazards is more common and controllable sun et al 2019b reichard 1945 first proposed in 1945 that supercavitation can be generated via artificial ventilation ventilated cavitation has been the focus of scholars from various countries knapp 1955 analyzed cloud cavitation flow and determined that cloud cavitation shedding is caused by the re entrant jet at the closure silberman et al 1961 studied the oscillation law of ventilated cavitation experimentally and obtained the relationship between the amount of ventilation the cavitation shape and the pressure inside the cavity stinebring et al 2001 investigated the major mechanism of gas leakage from a ventilated supercavity and found that the mechanism occurs via gaseous shear layers that form at the gas water interface roohi et al 2013 cheng et al 2020 analyzed the cavitation phenomenon during tip leakage flow with a naca0009 hydrofoil and explored the influence of cavitation on vortex evolution li et al 2019 explored underwater explosion cavity evolution via experiment and simulation and found that there are multiple cavity pulse pressures during the process and that the last peak is the largest an et al 2020 predicted natural cavitation and ventilation cavitation and found that there are high levels of velocity pulsation in the re entrant jet region as well as the interaction region between the main vortex and the secondary vortex after ventilation sun et al 2020 carried out numerical simulations of a naca66 hydrofoil using the schnerr sauer cavitation and large eddy simulation turbulence models and found that shedding occurs faster under ventilated cavitation than under natural cavitation the pressure inside the ventilated supercavity was measured at a fixed location and information regarding the internal velocity and pressure fields remained scarce during periodic gust flows due to limitations in their diagnostic approach limitations huang et al 2019 ma et al 2018 in kinzel et al 2009 the pressure change near an enclosed cavity area was observed and was thought to play a role in recovery of gas into the supercavity fronzeo et al 2019 explored the details of the pressures inside both twin vortex and toroidal vortex cavities via histograms of the internal cavity pressure rather than a uniform pressure detailed investigation of the pressure indicated a multi peak cavity pressure distribution to explore cavitation mechanisms many scholars have studied the external environmental parameters that affect cavitation kinzel et al 2017 performed numerical and experimental investigations to provide valuable results about cavity size interfacial character gas composition and gas entrainment mechanisms schauer 2013 studied the amount of ventilation gas required to maintain artificial cavities at various speeds the shapes of the struts substantially affected air demand via cavity strut wake interactions cao et al 2017 conducted a numerical study of the internal pressure distribution of the ventilated supercavity generated by a backward cavitator under different air entrainment coefficients as the blockage ratio increased the overall pressure within the supercavity and the pressure gradient in the main portion of the supercavity both decreased erfanian and anbarsooz 2018 added a concentric hole to a disk cavitator when the hole diameter was small the changes in the drag coefficient and cavity length were not significant however both decreased as the hole diameter increased wang et al 2018 studied the influence of ventilated cavitation on vortex shedding behind a bluff body and found that the cavity area increased and the vortex shedding frequency decreased as the gas entrainment coefficient increased shao et al 2017 found that the clogging rate can determine the critical ventilation flow when it is lower than the clogging rate the froude number fns decreases and the supercavity collapses to form a foam cavity external conditions affect the closed form of the cavity and thus affect cavitation thus closure of the supercavity is quite important and is one of the main factors that affects ventilated supercavities karn et al 2015 two regimes are common the twin vortex regime where a steady cavity closes with a pair of axially aligned counter rotating vortices and the toroidal vortex regime where the cavity closes with an unsteady single toroidal vortex fronzeo et al 2017 wu et al 2019 studied the closed form of ventilated cavitation of both the re entrant jet and the twin vortex tube experimentally they found that for a re entrant supercavity due to reduction in the re entrant the supercavity needs to elongate to increase the gas entrained by the internal boundary layer twin vortex to balance the ventilation increase as the ventilation input increases wang et al 2015 found that there are two typical leakage mechanisms under different fns namely the annular vortex mode and the two hollow tube vortex modes as fn increases the cavity is transferred from the two hollow tubes to the annular vortex other aspects of underwater vehicle hydrodynamic performance are heavily affected by cavitation when disturbed by waves cavity shapes change easily this results in a decrease in the hydrodynamic performance of the vehicle stinebring et al 2001 rashidi et al 2014 cao et al 2017 motion stability of underwater vehicles is greatly affected by the environment and cavity morphology lee et al 2019 found that the change in cavity shape caused by discrete gust flow is smaller than that of continuous gust flow li and lyu 2020 studied the influence of regular wave parameters including the influence of wave height and wavelength on the cavitation flow and force characteristics of supercavitating vehicles near the water surface huang et al 2019 found that as the wavelength of the flow perturbation approaches the cavity length with increasing gust frequency the cavity experiences stronger wavelike undulation and internal pressure fluctuation but reduced cavitation number variation lee et al 2013 2016 designed a device that can change the pitch angle of a vehicle at a target frequency in a high speed water tunnel and analyzed the change in the cavity morphology at various frequencies and amplitudes the research focused on the relationship between the tail of the vehicle and the cavitation boundary pan et al 2010 used numerical simulation methods to study pressure changes in the cavity during the pitching motion of a ventilated supercavity vessel in a water tunnel through supercavity experiments sanabria et al 2014 found that under the action of a gust generator the forces and moments of the cavitator can be ignored but the tail of the navigable cannot be ignored because of the flow disturbance kaiping et al 2010 used numerical simulation methods to verify the change in the air cavity shape when the ventilated supercavity navigating body was pitched at a natural frequency karn et al 2016 used a gust launcher to disturb the formation of an unstable flow and found that the cavitation closure mode is related to the change in the cavitation number inside the cavitation shao et al 2018 found that ventilated cavities are affected by gusts and can exhibit various states this can cause the supercavity to collapse into a foam cavity but changing the cavitation size and ventilation rate can effectively improve the situation as mentioned above many scholars have paid attention to the influence of environmental turbulence on ventilation cavitation such as the effect of ventilation rate on the closed form of ventilated cavitation the influence of water tunnel blocking rate and the influence of environmental disturbance on cavitation and the internal pressure of cavity much analysis of cavitation size hydrodynamic performance of supercavitating vehicles and cavitation shedding law has also been done however the disturbances of cavity dynamics from the environment still require study especially the pressure fluctuation flow

cavitator model and computational domain are mainly provided according to experiments by ahn et al 2017 fig 1 shows the size and boundary conditions of the calculation domain the entire domain is 1400 mm 190 mm 190 mm the inlet of the domain is 300 mm away from the cavitator and the outlet is 600 mm from the tail of the cavitator the inlet boundary is a velocity inlet and the flow velocity v 8 m s the outlet is a pressure outlet that controls the pressure in the computational domain the other domain walls are slip wall boundaries the far field pressure in the domain p is 61 kpa the density of water ρ is 997 561 kg m3 the viscosity of water ν is 8 899 10 4 pa s and the saturated vapor pressure p v is 3170 34 pa fig 2 shows how the disk cavitator used in this work was 15 8 mm in diameter and 500 mm long a gas vent with a 10 mm diameter and 1 mm side was placed 11 5 mm behind the cavitator the air entrant coefficient c q 0 14 where c q is defined as c q q a v d n 2 and q a is the volumetric gas injection flow rate q a is defined as q a p s q s t a t s p a the gas hole is a mass inlet and the mass flow rate q a 5 2 10 4 k g s fig 2 depicts four pressure monitors were used to monitor the pressure in the far field the near field and inside the cavity at positions 200 mm and 20 mm before the cavitator head and 16 mm and 111 mm after the cavitator head fig 3 shows the mid section mesh of the computational domain to capture the unstable ventilation cavity flow the area around the cavitator and the vent has been refined the grid size transitions gradually as one moves from around the cavitator to the remainder of the computational domain and when approaching the cavitator wall the total number of elements in the domain is 6 7 106 2 5 internal wave model and numerical method validation we use the velocity inlet method to produce an internal wave the numerical internal wave method is defined as 17 v x 8 v y sin 20 π t v z 0 using the elliptic cosine wave velocity function we obtain a speed function of v y such that only half of the momentum of the cosine wave is present and the velocity has half of the speed function because the longitudinal velocity mainly affects cavitation we compare the numerical longitudinal velocity to the analytical solution of the speed function as fig 4 shows that the internal wave period and amplitude from the numerical simulation agree well with the analytical solution of 0 5 v y thus we can use the model to produce internal waves to validate the numerical model results from the numerical simulation and previous experimental data lee et al 2013 are compared in this experiment two hydrofoils are used to make a periodic gust flow the period and amplitude of the gust flow are controlled by adjusting the angle and frequency of the swing of the hydrofoil the velocity of the flow is 8 34 m s the diameter of the cavitator d c is 10 mm and the ventilation rate c q 0 15 when the stable supercavitation is generated the hydrofoil is given a certain rotation fig 5 a shows the change in the shape of the cavity under different conditions wherein the gust flow generator is oscillated periodically between angles of attack of 6 at four different frequencies f g 5 10 15 and 20 hz when the hydrofoil oscillates at 5 hz the shape of the cavity changes little and the tail of the cavity is closed by gravity and form vortex tubes when the frequency increases to 10 hz the same as the experimental value the tail of the cavity bows due to the gust flow as the frequency increases the shape of the cavity becomes gradually wavy and the length of the cavity decreases with an increase in gust flow frequency when the rotational frequency come reaches 20 hz there is an obvious rise in the tail of the wavy cavity fig 5 b gives the total length of a supercavity normalized by the wavelength of the gust flow l c is the cavity length and the velocity of the coming flow u 8 34 m s as shown in fg 5 b for the numerical prediction and experimental results the cavity length both decreases with an increase in gust frequency these results indicate that the change in the shape of the ventilated supercavity obtained by numerical simulation is consistent with that of the experimental results which demonstrates the effectiveness of the numerical simulation method in this paper it should be noted that the diameter of the validation calculation model is 10 mm and the model size studied in this paper is 15 8 mm however the setting of boundary conditions the method of meshing the use of theoretical models etc are all the same hence the established numerical model can be used as an effective method to carry out the study in this paper 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of internal waves on cavity evolution and load performance to evaluate the effects of internal waves on ventilated cavitating flows fig 6 shows changes in the cavity shape at six moments during one period for the internal wave case and the case with no internal wave to reflect the influence of internal waves on the cavity shape a line is used to represent the wave surface of the cross section between the dominant boundary and cavitator to represent the relationship between the internal wave and ventilated cavity the existence of internal waves causes the cavity length to decrease and the cavity closure region exhibits a period change this is different from the case with no internal wave at t 6 the trough passes through the cavity tail the shape of the cavity tail shape changes from one that shrinks as it points upwards to one that closes as it points downwards and cavity shedding occurs where the cavity contacts the cavitator at 2t 6 the tail is at the midpoint between the crest and trough and the cavity shape is greatly affected by the internal wave when the region is located in the middle of the crest and trough the upper part of the cavity tail almost coincides with the wave surface and the high pressure point on the lower part of the cavitator starts to move forward when the wave crest moves to the tail of the cavity 3t 6 the cavity tail floats upward and is divided into two parts at 3t 6 the blue region follows the internal wave movement and shedding while the black region of the cavity remains attached to the cavitator when the internal wave crest enters the cavity tail the closed form of the cavity changes from a toroidal vortex to a twin vortex at 4t 6 in panels c and d two elongated vortices are clearly seen in an enlarged view of the tail at 4t 6 in the top view of the air volume fraction the tube connects the main body of the cavity to the shedding cavity when the middle point of the peak and trough of the internal wave passes through the tail of the cavity 5t 6 fold zones appear on the upper edge of the cavity tail above the corresponding point of the trough the twin vortex with the detached tail also becomes a toroidal vortex at 6t 6 the trough passes through the tail of the cavity the peak pressure point has moved forward the cavity tail tends to pinch off the shape of the cavity points upward and the cavitator fluctuates and rises hence the internal wave causes the cavity to periodically evolve changing the cavity shape and closure and dominating the cavity shedding cycle various pressure measurements are shown in fig 7 here the pressure difference across the cavity is calculated as δ p p p c where p is the pressure of the far flow field and p c is the cavitation pressure obtained from each monitoring point the point with the lowest pressure is taken as the starting point of the cycle and one cycle is divided into six moments when there is no internal wave the pressure fluctuations are not large and there is no obvious periodicity under the effect of internal waves the pressure change exhibits periodicity throughout the flow field and the period of the pressure change matches that period of the internal wave up to 0 05 s cavity pressure fluctuations are more frequent in the first half of the period from 0 through 3t 6 but are smaller during the second half of the period this indicates that more scale cavities shed during the first half of the period when the wave trough passes the cavity tail in general pressure changes at various monitoring points throughout the flow field are similar this result is in line with the conclusions of ahn et al 2017 pressures at various positions inside the cavity such as p3 and p4 are almost identical to analyze the frequency of cavity shedding power spectrum densities psd for cases with and without internal waves are given in fig 8 the spectral density peaks that correspond to different monitoring points are different but the corresponding frequencies are quite similar in the absence of an internal wave the main cavity shedding rate is 143 hz with an internal wave the cavity shedding period is 40 hz and the frequency of the absolute maximum v y of the internal wave is 40 hz which is consistent with the frequency of cavity shedding when there is an internal wave disturbance the frequency of cavity shedding is mainly affected by the frequency of the internal wave itself which drives the cavity to shedding the lift and drag of the cavitator also change substantially due to the internal wave the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d are used to reflect the hydrodynamic transformation the lift coefficient c l is defined as 18 c l f l 1 2 ρ v 2 s where f l is the lift ρ is the density of water and s is the cavitator projection area the drag coefficient c d is defined as 19 c d f d 1 2 ρ v 2 a where f d is drag and a is the effective cross sectional area fig 9 compares the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d for the cavitator with and without internal waves under the action of the internal wave the lift coefficient of the cavitator fluctuates periodically compared to the system with no internal wave the lift coefficient is higher during the first half of the cycle and smaller during the second half combining this information with the positional relationship between the wave surface and cavitator shown in fig 6 indicates that the lift force increases when the wave crest occupies most of the area of the cavity and decreases when the trough occupies most of the cavity area when the internal wave causes the cavity to pitch down and shed the lift coefficient jumps when the cavity tail floats up and causes the cavity to shed the lift coefficient drops suddenly the lift coefficient is driven by the internal wave however within four cycles the average lift coefficient of the cavitator in the internal wave case does not increase significantly compared to the case with no internal wave as fig 9 b shows the drag coefficient fluctuates within a small range when there is no internal wave when the internal wave is present the drag changes periodically and increases significantly these results indicated that internal waves affect the length of cavity development which in turn affects the evolution characteristics of the lift and drag coefficients 3 2 cavitation distribution features inside the cavity the pressure distribution inside the cavity can reflect the relationship between the cavity shape and the pressure field the local cavitation number σ c is used to reflect the pressure distribution inside the cavity it is defined as 20 σ c p p c 0 5 ρ v 2 where the p c is the pressure inside the cavity the diameter of the cavity and the cavitation number attached to the upper surface of the cavitator reactor reflect changes in the cavity morphology fig 10 shows the local cavitation number distribution and the change in the cavity diameter without an internal wave figs 11 16 show distribution diagrams of local cavitation numbers and change in cavity diameter at six moments within a period when an internal wave fig 10 shows that in the absence of an internal wave the probability peak of the local cavitation number distribution is near the ventilation area gas is ejected from the ventilation slot and then diffuses to both ends so the maximum local cavitation number occurs at the ventilation slot attachment and increases towards the two ends of the cavity that peaks 1 and 2 occupy nearly the entire cavity indicates that the process of pressure growth is slow peaks 3 and 4 occupy only small areas of the cavity the cavity diameter changes slowly as the local cavitation number decreases inside the cavity in fig 11 t 6 while the internal wave crest is at the middle of the cavity the entire cavity takes on a convex shape and cavity shedding occurs therefore the cavity diameter decreases to 0 because of the shedding cavity behind the closure also the probability distribution of the low local cavitation number increases and the high pressure region of the cavity tail grows peak 2 decreases substantially and most of the cavity tail is occupied by peak 3 peak 4 has an obvious probability distribution peak in the low local cavitation number area at this peak the cavity diameter is reduced significantly there is a double peak at peak 3 in the cloud chart a shrink cavity appears at peak 3 indicating that low pressure fluctuations occur here and resulting in double peaks this pulsation accelerates cavity elongation and subsequent shedding in fig 12 2t 6 the trough of the internal wave is located near the ventilation slot and the wave peak is located at the rear of the cavity the tail of the cavity starts to rise slowly and tends to be divided into two parts the local cavitation number decreases quickly at the end of the cavity the local cavitation number reduction rate increases the diameter of the cavity also decreases substantially in the tail the area of peak 2 increases while that of peak 3 decreases the amplitude of the probability distribution of peak1 increases and the local cavitation number region of peak1 is reduced in fig 13 3t 6 there are three obvious local cavitation number density distribution peaks and those which correspond to low local cavitation numbers nearly disappear there are sub peaks at peaks 2 and 3 the probability distributions within the local cavitation number region of peak 3 grow and the amplitude of the probability distribution of peak 2 is reduced the local cavitation number reduction rate within the cavity tail increases substantially after peak 3 the internal pressure of the cavity changes both in front of and behind the ventilation slot but the change in cavity closure results in inconsistent gradient changes and the appearance of multiple peaks moreover at 3t 6 when the wave trough has just passed near the back of the vent we can compare the wave shape in fig 6 with the shape of peak 2 the wave like concave shape of peak 2 and the cavity tail rise as the local cavitation number drops quickly both phenomena suggest that the gas flow is affected by the wave in fig 14 4t 6 the boundary of peak 1 rises up which indicates a smaller pressure increase on the upper part of cavitator the probability distribution of the local cavitation number decreases faster in peak 2 the amplitude of the probability distribution of peak 3 decreases but the area and probability distribution amplitude of peak 4 increase greatly peak 4 can better respond to the cavity tail pressure distribution the rate of pressure drop in the cavity tail decreases and the local cavitation number of the entire cavity drops dramatically at 4t 6 the large scale local cavitation cavity sheds and the closure becomes a twin vortex due to the influence of cavity shedding the pressure at the tail of the cavity fluctuates and the local cavitation number probability distribution has sub peaks in peaks 2 and 3 the rate of decrease of the local cavitation number inside the cavity is reduced and the local cavitation number distribution area becomes wider fig 15 expands the range of local cavitation numbers to show areas where cavities affect the tail region and resulting in low pressure a high local cavitation number area appears at the tail of the cavity and makes up the main part of peak 1 peak 1 has a high local cavitation number region with a large probability distribution amplitude peak 2 occupies most of the cavity and peak 3 is small with a small probability distribution amplitude the local cavitation number of peak 4 decreases slowly in fig 16 a fold zone appears at the tail of the cavity with the largest nearby local cavitation number this leads to the cavity to pinch off affected by internal waves the cavitation descends before the fold zone and rises after the fold zone unlike at the other times peak 1 appears at the tail before the fold zone peak 1 and small parts of peaks 2 and 3 appear behind the main body of p4 the amplitude of the probability distribution is also in peak 2 peaks 3 and 4 occupy large areas of the cavity after peak 1 the local cavitation number decreases quickly the closure of the cavity leads to pulsation the distribution density map of the local cavitation number reflects changes in the cavitation pressure field and allows one to explore the effect of pressure on the evolution of cavity morphology the local cavitation number distribution diagram shows that at the cavity closure region the rate at which the local cavitation number decreases in the cavity tail and the cavity evolution and growth rates increase when the tail tends to pinch off the probability distribution amplitude of the local cavitation number becomes higher and the low pressure area becomes more concentrated the cavity number inside the cavity is mainly affected by closure of the cavity which is dominated by the internal wave 3 3 effect of wave amplitudes on the ventilated cavity the longitudinal velocity v y of the internal wave of the flow is tested using five velocity cases with amplitudes of 0 5 m s 0 75 m s 1 m s 1 25 m s and 1 5 m s to compute the influences of various internal wave levels on the cavity as shown in fig 17 a when there is a small amplitude internal wave the cavity length and volume exhibit small decreases however the cavity also exhibits a shedding period at 2t 6 there is no two part shedding at 5t 6 there is no fold at the tail of the cavity and all of the shedding cavities are located at the upper part of the cavitator as the internal wave amplitude increases to 0 75 fig 17 b the cavity size clearly decreases part of the cavity sheds under the cavitator at t 6 two part shedding is not visible at 2t 6 but a twin vortex closure can be found at 4t 6 folds appear at 5t 6 and cavity pinch off is observed at 6t 6 the phenomena described above can be found in all cases of large internal wave amplitude as the amplitude of the internal wave increases further the volume of the shedding cavity increases and the cavity size decreases upon reaching an internal wave amplitude of 1 25 at 2t 6 the cavity tail under the cavitator exhibits pulsation the cavity tail is influenced by internal waves and drops below the cavitator at 6t 6 to better reflect the change in the cavity size the cavity length fig 18 and volume fig 19 are given fig 18 shows how the cavity length typically decreases as the internal wave amplitude increases the cavity length reduction does not change linearly with the increase in the internal wave amplitude but decreases faster in the 0 5 1 amplitude range as the internal wave amplitude increases further the rate of decrease in cavity length falls when the internal wave exceeds an amplitude of 1 25 the cavity length decreases only slightly for the cavity volume shown in fig 19 a when the internal wave amplitude increases the volume fraction of the cavity gradually decreases fig 19 b shows the volume fraction of the cavity decreasing only slightly at an amplitude of 0 5 however the volume of the cavity decreases substantially when the amplitude is 0 75 this suggests that there is a threshold between amplitudes of 0 5 and 0 75 after the internal wave amplitude exceeds the threshold the cavity volume decreases substantially during the increase in the internal wave amplitude from 0 75 to 1 25 the average air volume in the cavity decreases by 4 4 10 5 4 6 10 5 and 4 38 10 5 respectively this relationship is approximately linear the maximum air volume also decreases as the internal wave class increases not all internal wave amplitudes produce significant changes in the cavity size when the amplitude of the internal wave is large enough the influence of the increase in the internal wave amplitude on the cavity size is reduced the change in pressure over time at pressure monitoring point p4 inside the cavity is shown in fig 20 a the pressure change period is similar to that of the internal wave the pressure does not change much as the internal wave amplitude increases and the trends of pressure change are similar for all internal wave cases as shown in fig 20 b at all pressure monitoring points the average pressure exhibits a small gradual decrease as the internal wave amplitude increases this appears to be caused by the internal wave velocity the pressures at points inside the cavity such as p3 and p4 are quite similar when there is an internal wave the fluctuations in the pressure of the ventilating cavitation flow field are periodic and the pressure amplitude increases significantly compared to the case with no internal wave fig 21 shows a comparison of lift coefficients there is no obvious correlation between the changes in the average lift coefficient and the changes in the internal wave amplitude the lift coefficient peak does not exhibit regular change as the internal wave amplitude increases the internal wave affects cavity shedding and causes lift coefficient pulsation but has little effect on the average lift coefficient ig 22 shows a comparison of drag coefficients the change in the drag coefficient is affected primarily by the wet area of the cavitator in fig 22 a as the amplitude of the internal wave increases the drag of the cavitator increases as long as a phase difference is present when the internal wave amplitude increases the cavity tail rises further at 3t 6 and the cavity shedding around the cavitator described above decreases causing the wet area to decrease at 6t 6 the upper part of the cavity is affected by the internal wave and the cavitator cannot be wrapped both cases result in significant reduction of the wet area of the cavitator and thus increase the cavitator drag coefficient this is especially true in the 1 5 amplitude case as the resistance has double peaks in one period this causes the average cavitator pressure to increase substantially phase differences in drag coefficient peaks are shown in fig 22 b when the internal wave amplitude exceeds 0 75 the arrival time of the drag coefficient peak becomes delayed as the internal wave amplitude increases however when the internal wave amplitude is small the drag coefficient peak arrives early to understand this compared the cavity shapes in fig 17 for the 0 75 amplitude case at 3t 6 the cavity tail rises and the shedding cavity is too small to cover the cavitator this causes a peak to appear between 3t 6 and 4t 6 when the internal wave amplitude increases the cavity shedding of the attached cavitator increases at 3t 6 and the extent of cavity decrease between 5t 6 and 6t 6 increases thus the resistance peak arrival time shifts later as shown in fig 22 c under 0 5 amplitude conditions the cavity volume is similar to that of a cavity without internal waves and the difference in the average cavity resistance increase overall as the internal wave amplitude increases the cavity volume decreases and the resistance also gradually increases the above analysis indicates that there is a threshold associated with the longitudinal velocity of the internal wave when the amplitude is less than this threshold the cavity volume does not decrease significantly but the drag increases as the longitudinal velocity of the internal wave increases the pressure at each monitoring point decreases the cavity length and volume decrease this is especially true when the internal wave amplitude is too large such that the cavity tail floats up or down too much before the cavity shedding some of the cavities are unable to wrap the cavitator 4 conclusions in this work the effect of internal waves on the dynamic behavior of an asymmetric ventilated supercavity was studied by analyzing the evolutions of ventilated cavity pressure pulsation and the cavitation number distribution inside the cavity as well as the hydrodynamic cavitation performance patterns the effects of internal waves were evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 the presence of internal waves affects the cavity evolution load characteristic under the action of internal waves the cavity tail transitions from total shedding to two part shedding and then exhibits double vortex tube shedding under the influence of the upward speed of the internal wave as the internal waves continue to move forward folds are formed at the tail of the cavity which then lead to pinch off the pressure lift and drag all change periodically due to the influence of internal waves on cavity evolution the period is similar to that of the internal wave the period of pressure pulsation is similar to that of the internal wave velocity amplitude 2 internal waves play an important role in the distribution of ventilated cavitation patterns inside the cavity changes in pressure data translated into values of local cavitation number within the cavity are closely related to the cavity shape interestingly the peak distribution of local cavitation numbers are different for different cavity closure types specifically for twin vortex and toroidal vortex cavities this is mainly due to the influence of internal waves on the cavity evolution the distribution of and variation in these local cavitation numbers indicate that the flow field inside the ventilated cavity becomes more complex under the action of internal waves 3 ventilated cavitation hydrodynamic performance is closely related to internal wave amplitude with an increase in the amplitude of the internal wave the pulsation evolution of the cavity becomes more obvious and especially the shedding of the cavity in the closure region becomes more complicated meanwhile increasing the amplitude suppresses the development intensity of the ventilated cavity for the amplitude range studied in this paper the lift coefficients at different amplitudes are relatively close however the drag coefficient is more significantly affected by the amplitude of the internal wave both the average value and the maximum value of the drag coefficient show an increasing trend as the amplitude increases credit authorship contribution

20655,in this paper a realizable two layer k ε turbulence model and the schnerr sauer cavitation model are used to simulate dynamic behavior of asymmetric ventilated supercavies while considering the effects of internal wave s the effectiveness of the numerical method is verified via comparison with the available experimental data and the analytical solution of the internal wave velocity the results show that the presence of internal waves affects the supercavity closure patterns and shedding periods compared to a system with no internal waves the cavity shedding and pressure pulsation intensity increase and the shedding period is closely related to that of the internal wave internal waves also play an important role in the distribution of ventilated cavitation patterns inside the cavity the local cavitation number is shown to reflect the pressure change during cavity evolution and indicates that the internal wave affects the flow field inside the cavity in addition the effects of internal waves of various amplitudes on cavitator hydrodynamic performance are studied as the internal wave amplitude increases the cavity pulsation evolution becomes more intense furthermore the ventilated cavity intensity lift and drag are closely related to the amplitude of internal waves keywords numerical modeling internal wave dynamic behavior asymmetric ventilated supercavity 1 introduction cavitation occurs when the local pressure reaches the saturated vapor pressure of a liquid batchelor 2000 sun et al 2019a and often causes unsteady pressure pulsations and noise while affecting service life and concealment passandideh fard and roohi 2008 philipp and lauterborn 1998 when an underwater vehicle moves at a high speed a large pressure drop usually occurs around the vehicle typically contributing to cavitation nesteruk 2012 however scholars have studied the phenomenon of cavitation and found that when supercavitation occurs the resistance of the underwater vessel improves significantly ceccio 2010 thus supercavitation has become a key technology for high speed underwater vessels in general supercavitation can be achieved naturally or via gas ventilation however natural supercavitation is often difficult to achieve zhang et al 2016 ventilated supercavitation which improves cavity stability and reduces cavitation hazards is more common and controllable sun et al 2019b reichard 1945 first proposed in 1945 that supercavitation can be generated via artificial ventilation ventilated cavitation has been the focus of scholars from various countries knapp 1955 analyzed cloud cavitation flow and determined that cloud cavitation shedding is caused by the re entrant jet at the closure silberman et al 1961 studied the oscillation law of ventilated cavitation experimentally and obtained the relationship between the amount of ventilation the cavitation shape and the pressure inside the cavity stinebring et al 2001 investigated the major mechanism of gas leakage from a ventilated supercavity and found that the mechanism occurs via gaseous shear layers that form at the gas water interface roohi et al 2013 cheng et al 2020 analyzed the cavitation phenomenon during tip leakage flow with a naca0009 hydrofoil and explored the influence of cavitation on vortex evolution li et al 2019 explored underwater explosion cavity evolution via experiment and simulation and found that there are multiple cavity pulse pressures during the process and that the last peak is the largest an et al 2020 predicted natural cavitation and ventilation cavitation and found that there are high levels of velocity pulsation in the re entrant jet region as well as the interaction region between the main vortex and the secondary vortex after ventilation sun et al 2020 carried out numerical simulations of a naca66 hydrofoil using the schnerr sauer cavitation and large eddy simulation turbulence models and found that shedding occurs faster under ventilated cavitation than under natural cavitation the pressure inside the ventilated supercavity was measured at a fixed location and information regarding the internal velocity and pressure fields remained scarce during periodic gust flows due to limitations in their diagnostic approach limitations huang et al 2019 ma et al 2018 in kinzel et al 2009 the pressure change near an enclosed cavity area was observed and was thought to play a role in recovery of gas into the supercavity fronzeo et al 2019 explored the details of the pressures inside both twin vortex and toroidal vortex cavities via histograms of the internal cavity pressure rather than a uniform pressure detailed investigation of the pressure indicated a multi peak cavity pressure distribution to explore cavitation mechanisms many scholars have studied the external environmental parameters that affect cavitation kinzel et al 2017 performed numerical and experimental investigations to provide valuable results about cavity size interfacial character gas composition and gas entrainment mechanisms schauer 2013 studied the amount of ventilation gas required to maintain artificial cavities at various speeds the shapes of the struts substantially affected air demand via cavity strut wake interactions cao et al 2017 conducted a numerical study of the internal pressure distribution of the ventilated supercavity generated by a backward cavitator under different air entrainment coefficients as the blockage ratio increased the overall pressure within the supercavity and the pressure gradient in the main portion of the supercavity both decreased erfanian and anbarsooz 2018 added a concentric hole to a disk cavitator when the hole diameter was small the changes in the drag coefficient and cavity length were not significant however both decreased as the hole diameter increased wang et al 2018 studied the influence of ventilated cavitation on vortex shedding behind a bluff body and found that the cavity area increased and the vortex shedding frequency decreased as the gas entrainment coefficient increased shao et al 2017 found that the clogging rate can determine the critical ventilation flow when it is lower than the clogging rate the froude number fns decreases and the supercavity collapses to form a foam cavity external conditions affect the closed form of the cavity and thus affect cavitation thus closure of the supercavity is quite important and is one of the main factors that affects ventilated supercavities karn et al 2015 two regimes are common the twin vortex regime where a steady cavity closes with a pair of axially aligned counter rotating vortices and the toroidal vortex regime where the cavity closes with an unsteady single toroidal vortex fronzeo et al 2017 wu et al 2019 studied the closed form of ventilated cavitation of both the re entrant jet and the twin vortex tube experimentally they found that for a re entrant supercavity due to reduction in the re entrant the supercavity needs to elongate to increase the gas entrained by the internal boundary layer twin vortex to balance the ventilation increase as the ventilation input increases wang et al 2015 found that there are two typical leakage mechanisms under different fns namely the annular vortex mode and the two hollow tube vortex modes as fn increases the cavity is transferred from the two hollow tubes to the annular vortex other aspects of underwater vehicle hydrodynamic performance are heavily affected by cavitation when disturbed by waves cavity shapes change easily this results in a decrease in the hydrodynamic performance of the vehicle stinebring et al 2001 rashidi et al 2014 cao et al 2017 motion stability of underwater vehicles is greatly affected by the environment and cavity morphology lee et al 2019 found that the change in cavity shape caused by discrete gust flow is smaller than that of continuous gust flow li and lyu 2020 studied the influence of regular wave parameters including the influence of wave height and wavelength on the cavitation flow and force characteristics of supercavitating vehicles near the water surface huang et al 2019 found that as the wavelength of the flow perturbation approaches the cavity length with increasing gust frequency the cavity experiences stronger wavelike undulation and internal pressure fluctuation but reduced cavitation number variation lee et al 2013 2016 designed a device that can change the pitch angle of a vehicle at a target frequency in a high speed water tunnel and analyzed the change in the cavity morphology at various frequencies and amplitudes the research focused on the relationship between the tail of the vehicle and the cavitation boundary pan et al 2010 used numerical simulation methods to study pressure changes in the cavity during the pitching motion of a ventilated supercavity vessel in a water tunnel through supercavity experiments sanabria et al 2014 found that under the action of a gust generator the forces and moments of the cavitator can be ignored but the tail of the navigable cannot be ignored because of the flow disturbance kaiping et al 2010 used numerical simulation methods to verify the change in the air cavity shape when the ventilated supercavity navigating body was pitched at a natural frequency karn et al 2016 used a gust launcher to disturb the formation of an unstable flow and found that the cavitation closure mode is related to the change in the cavitation number inside the cavitation shao et al 2018 found that ventilated cavities are affected by gusts and can exhibit various states this can cause the supercavity to collapse into a foam cavity but changing the cavitation size and ventilation rate can effectively improve the situation as mentioned above many scholars have paid attention to the influence of environmental turbulence on ventilation cavitation such as the effect of ventilation rate on the closed form of ventilated cavitation the influence of water tunnel blocking rate and the influence of environmental disturbance on cavitation and the internal pressure of cavity much analysis of cavitation size hydrodynamic performance of supercavitating vehicles and cavitation shedding law has also been done however the disturbances of cavity dynamics from the environment still require study especially the pressure fluctuation flow

cavitator model and computational domain are mainly provided according to experiments by ahn et al 2017 fig 1 shows the size and boundary conditions of the calculation domain the entire domain is 1400 mm 190 mm 190 mm the inlet of the domain is 300 mm away from the cavitator and the outlet is 600 mm from the tail of the cavitator the inlet boundary is a velocity inlet and the flow velocity v 8 m s the outlet is a pressure outlet that controls the pressure in the computational domain the other domain walls are slip wall boundaries the far field pressure in the domain p is 61 kpa the density of water ρ is 997 561 kg m3 the viscosity of water ν is 8 899 10 4 pa s and the saturated vapor pressure p v is 3170 34 pa fig 2 shows how the disk cavitator used in this work was 15 8 mm in diameter and 500 mm long a gas vent with a 10 mm diameter and 1 mm side was placed 11 5 mm behind the cavitator the air entrant coefficient c q 0 14 where c q is defined as c q q a v d n 2 and q a is the volumetric gas injection flow rate q a is defined as q a p s q s t a t s p a the gas hole is a mass inlet and the mass flow rate q a 5 2 10 4 k g s fig 2 depicts four pressure monitors were used to monitor the pressure in the far field the near field and inside the cavity at positions 200 mm and 20 mm before the cavitator head and 16 mm and 111 mm after the cavitator head fig 3 shows the mid section mesh of the computational domain to capture the unstable ventilation cavity flow the area around the cavitator and the vent has been refined the grid size transitions gradually as one moves from around the cavitator to the remainder of the computational domain and when approaching the cavitator wall the total number of elements in the domain is 6 7 106 2 5 internal wave model and numerical method validation we use the velocity inlet method to produce an internal wave the numerical internal wave method is defined as 17 v x 8 v y sin 20 π t v z 0 using the elliptic cosine wave velocity function we obtain a speed function of v y such that only half of the momentum of the cosine wave is present and the velocity has half of the speed function because the longitudinal velocity mainly affects cavitation we compare the numerical longitudinal velocity to the analytical solution of the speed function as fig 4 shows that the internal wave period and amplitude from the numerical simulation agree well with the analytical solution of 0 5 v y thus we can use the model to produce internal waves to validate the numerical model results from the numerical simulation and previous experimental data lee et al 2013 are compared in this experiment two hydrofoils are used to make a periodic gust flow the period and amplitude of the gust flow are controlled by adjusting the angle and frequency of the swing of the hydrofoil the velocity of the flow is 8 34 m s the diameter of the cavitator d c is 10 mm and the ventilation rate c q 0 15 when the stable supercavitation is generated the hydrofoil is given a certain rotation fig 5 a shows the change in the shape of the cavity under different conditions wherein the gust flow generator is oscillated periodically between angles of attack of 6 at four different frequencies f g 5 10 15 and 20 hz when the hydrofoil oscillates at 5 hz the shape of the cavity changes little and the tail of the cavity is closed by gravity and form vortex tubes when the frequency increases to 10 hz the same as the experimental value the tail of the cavity bows due to the gust flow as the frequency increases the shape of the cavity becomes gradually wavy and the length of the cavity decreases with an increase in gust flow frequency when the rotational frequency come reaches 20 hz there is an obvious rise in the tail of the wavy cavity fig 5 b gives the total length of a supercavity normalized by the wavelength of the gust flow l c is the cavity length and the velocity of the coming flow u 8 34 m s as shown in fg 5 b for the numerical prediction and experimental results the cavity length both decreases with an increase in gust frequency these results indicate that the change in the shape of the ventilated supercavity obtained by numerical simulation is consistent with that of the experimental results which demonstrates the effectiveness of the numerical simulation method in this paper it should be noted that the diameter of the validation calculation model is 10 mm and the model size studied in this paper is 15 8 mm however the setting of boundary conditions the method of meshing the use of theoretical models etc are all the same hence the established numerical model can be used as an effective method to carry out the study in this paper 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of internal waves on cavity evolution and load performance to evaluate the effects of internal waves on ventilated cavitating flows fig 6 shows changes in the cavity shape at six moments during one period for the internal wave case and the case with no internal wave to reflect the influence of internal waves on the cavity shape a line is used to represent the wave surface of the cross section between the dominant boundary and cavitator to represent the relationship between the internal wave and ventilated cavity the existence of internal waves causes the cavity length to decrease and the cavity closure region exhibits a period change this is different from the case with no internal wave at t 6 the trough passes through the cavity tail the shape of the cavity tail shape changes from one that shrinks as it points upwards to one that closes as it points downwards and cavity shedding occurs where the cavity contacts the cavitator at 2t 6 the tail is at the midpoint between the crest and trough and the cavity shape is greatly affected by the internal wave when the region is located in the middle of the crest and trough the upper part of the cavity tail almost coincides with the wave surface and the high pressure point on the lower part of the cavitator starts to move forward when the wave crest moves to the tail of the cavity 3t 6 the cavity tail floats upward and is divided into two parts at 3t 6 the blue region follows the internal wave movement and shedding while the black region of the cavity remains attached to the cavitator when the internal wave crest enters the cavity tail the closed form of the cavity changes from a toroidal vortex to a twin vortex at 4t 6 in panels c and d two elongated vortices are clearly seen in an enlarged view of the tail at 4t 6 in the top view of the air volume fraction the tube connects the main body of the cavity to the shedding cavity when the middle point of the peak and trough of the internal wave passes through the tail of the cavity 5t 6 fold zones appear on the upper edge of the cavity tail above the corresponding point of the trough the twin vortex with the detached tail also becomes a toroidal vortex at 6t 6 the trough passes through the tail of the cavity the peak pressure point has moved forward the cavity tail tends to pinch off the shape of the cavity points upward and the cavitator fluctuates and rises hence the internal wave causes the cavity to periodically evolve changing the cavity shape and closure and dominating the cavity shedding cycle various pressure measurements are shown in fig 7 here the pressure difference across the cavity is calculated as δ p p p c where p is the pressure of the far flow field and p c is the cavitation pressure obtained from each monitoring point the point with the lowest pressure is taken as the starting point of the cycle and one cycle is divided into six moments when there is no internal wave the pressure fluctuations are not large and there is no obvious periodicity under the effect of internal waves the pressure change exhibits periodicity throughout the flow field and the period of the pressure change matches that period of the internal wave up to 0 05 s cavity pressure fluctuations are more frequent in the first half of the period from 0 through 3t 6 but are smaller during the second half of the period this indicates that more scale cavities shed during the first half of the period when the wave trough passes the cavity tail in general pressure changes at various monitoring points throughout the flow field are similar this result is in line with the conclusions of ahn et al 2017 pressures at various positions inside the cavity such as p3 and p4 are almost identical to analyze the frequency of cavity shedding power spectrum densities psd for cases with and without internal waves are given in fig 8 the spectral density peaks that correspond to different monitoring points are different but the corresponding frequencies are quite similar in the absence of an internal wave the main cavity shedding rate is 143 hz with an internal wave the cavity shedding period is 40 hz and the frequency of the absolute maximum v y of the internal wave is 40 hz which is consistent with the frequency of cavity shedding when there is an internal wave disturbance the frequency of cavity shedding is mainly affected by the frequency of the internal wave itself which drives the cavity to shedding the lift and drag of the cavitator also change substantially due to the internal wave the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d are used to reflect the hydrodynamic transformation the lift coefficient c l is defined as 18 c l f l 1 2 ρ v 2 s where f l is the lift ρ is the density of water and s is the cavitator projection area the drag coefficient c d is defined as 19 c d f d 1 2 ρ v 2 a where f d is drag and a is the effective cross sectional area fig 9 compares the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d for the cavitator with and without internal waves under the action of the internal wave the lift coefficient of the cavitator fluctuates periodically compared to the system with no internal wave the lift coefficient is higher during the first half of the cycle and smaller during the second half combining this information with the positional relationship between the wave surface and cavitator shown in fig 6 indicates that the lift force increases when the wave crest occupies most of the area of the cavity and decreases when the trough occupies most of the cavity area when the internal wave causes the cavity to pitch down and shed the lift coefficient jumps when the cavity tail floats up and causes the cavity to shed the lift coefficient drops suddenly the lift coefficient is driven by the internal wave however within four cycles the average lift coefficient of the cavitator in the internal wave case does not increase significantly compared to the case with no internal wave as fig 9 b shows the drag coefficient fluctuates within a small range when there is no internal wave when the internal wave is present the drag changes periodically and increases significantly these results indicated that internal waves affect the length of cavity development which in turn affects the evolution characteristics of the lift and drag coefficients 3 2 cavitation distribution features inside the cavity the pressure distribution inside the cavity can reflect the relationship between the cavity shape and the pressure field the local cavitation number σ c is used to reflect the pressure distribution inside the cavity it is defined as 20 σ c p p c 0 5 ρ v 2 where the p c is the pressure inside the cavity the diameter of the cavity and the cavitation number attached to the upper surface of the cavitator reactor reflect changes in the cavity morphology fig 10 shows the local cavitation number distribution and the change in the cavity diameter without an internal wave figs 11 16 show distribution diagrams of local cavitation numbers and change in cavity diameter at six moments within a period when an internal wave fig 10 shows that in the absence of an internal wave the probability peak of the local cavitation number distribution is near the ventilation area gas is ejected from the ventilation slot and then diffuses to both ends so the maximum local cavitation number occurs at the ventilation slot attachment and increases towards the two ends of the cavity that peaks 1 and 2 occupy nearly the entire cavity indicates that the process of pressure growth is slow peaks 3 and 4 occupy only small areas of the cavity the cavity diameter changes slowly as the local cavitation number decreases inside the cavity in fig 11 t 6 while the internal wave crest is at the middle of the cavity the entire cavity takes on a convex shape and cavity shedding occurs therefore the cavity diameter decreases to 0 because of the shedding cavity behind the closure also the probability distribution of the low local cavitation number increases and the high pressure region of the cavity tail grows peak 2 decreases substantially and most of the cavity tail is occupied by peak 3 peak 4 has an obvious probability distribution peak in the low local cavitation number area at this peak the cavity diameter is reduced significantly there is a double peak at peak 3 in the cloud chart a shrink cavity appears at peak 3 indicating that low pressure fluctuations occur here and resulting in double peaks this pulsation accelerates cavity elongation and subsequent shedding in fig 12 2t 6 the trough of the internal wave is located near the ventilation slot and the wave peak is located at the rear of the cavity the tail of the cavity starts to rise slowly and tends to be divided into two parts the local cavitation number decreases quickly at the end of the cavity the local cavitation number reduction rate increases the diameter of the cavity also decreases substantially in the tail the area of peak 2 increases while that of peak 3 decreases the amplitude of the probability distribution of peak1 increases and the local cavitation number region of peak1 is reduced in fig 13 3t 6 there are three obvious local cavitation number density distribution peaks and those which correspond to low local cavitation numbers nearly disappear there are sub peaks at peaks 2 and 3 the probability distributions within the local cavitation number region of peak 3 grow and the amplitude of the probability distribution of peak 2 is reduced the local cavitation number reduction rate within the cavity tail increases substantially after peak 3 the internal pressure of the cavity changes both in front of and behind the ventilation slot but the change in cavity closure results in inconsistent gradient changes and the appearance of multiple peaks moreover at 3t 6 when the wave trough has just passed near the back of the vent we can compare the wave shape in fig 6 with the shape of peak 2 the wave like concave shape of peak 2 and the cavity tail rise as the local cavitation number drops quickly both phenomena suggest that the gas flow is affected by the wave in fig 14 4t 6 the boundary of peak 1 rises up which indicates a smaller pressure increase on the upper part of cavitator the probability distribution of the local cavitation number decreases faster in peak 2 the amplitude of the probability distribution of peak 3 decreases but the area and probability distribution amplitude of peak 4 increase greatly peak 4 can better respond to the cavity tail pressure distribution the rate of pressure drop in the cavity tail decreases and the local cavitation number of the entire cavity drops dramatically at 4t 6 the large scale local cavitation cavity sheds and the closure becomes a twin vortex due to the influence of cavity shedding the pressure at the tail of the cavity fluctuates and the local cavitation number probability distribution has sub peaks in peaks 2 and 3 the rate of decrease of the local cavitation number inside the cavity is reduced and the local cavitation number distribution area becomes wider fig 15 expands the range of local cavitation numbers to show areas where cavities affect the tail region and resulting in low pressure a high local cavitation number area appears at the tail of the cavity and makes up the main part of peak 1 peak 1 has a high local cavitation number region with a large probability distribution amplitude peak 2 occupies most of the cavity and peak 3 is small with a small probability distribution amplitude the local cavitation number of peak 4 decreases slowly in fig 16 a fold zone appears at the tail of the cavity with the largest nearby local cavitation number this leads to the cavity to pinch off affected by internal waves the cavitation descends before the fold zone and rises after the fold zone unlike at the other times peak 1 appears at the tail before the fold zone peak 1 and small parts of peaks 2 and 3 appear behind the main body of p4 the amplitude of the probability distribution is also in peak 2 peaks 3 and 4 occupy large areas of the cavity after peak 1 the local cavitation number decreases quickly the closure of the cavity leads to pulsation the distribution density map of the local cavitation number reflects changes in the cavitation pressure field and allows one to explore the effect of pressure on the evolution of cavity morphology the local cavitation number distribution diagram shows that at the cavity closure region the rate at which the local cavitation number decreases in the cavity tail and the cavity evolution and growth rates increase when the tail tends to pinch off the probability distribution amplitude of the local cavitation number becomes higher and the low pressure area becomes more concentrated the cavity number inside the cavity is mainly affected by closure of the cavity which is dominated by the internal wave 3 3 effect of wave amplitudes on the ventilated cavity the longitudinal velocity v y of the internal wave of the flow is tested using five velocity cases with amplitudes of 0 5 m s 0 75 m s 1 m s 1 25 m s and 1 5 m s to compute the influences of various internal wave levels on the cavity as shown in fig 17 a when there is a small amplitude internal wave the cavity length and volume exhibit small decreases however the cavity also exhibits a shedding period at 2t 6 there is no two part shedding at 5t 6 there is no fold at the tail of the cavity and all of the shedding cavities are located at the upper part of the cavitator as the internal wave amplitude increases to 0 75 fig 17 b the cavity size clearly decreases part of the cavity sheds under the cavitator at t 6 two part shedding is not visible at 2t 6 but a twin vortex closure can be found at 4t 6 folds appear at 5t 6 and cavity pinch off is observed at 6t 6 the phenomena described above can be found in all cases of large internal wave amplitude as the amplitude of the internal wave increases further the volume of the shedding cavity increases and the cavity size decreases upon reaching an internal wave amplitude of 1 25 at 2t 6 the cavity tail under the cavitator exhibits pulsation the cavity tail is influenced by internal waves and drops below the cavitator at 6t 6 to better reflect the change in the cavity size the cavity length fig 18 and volume fig 19 are given fig 18 shows how the cavity length typically decreases as the internal wave amplitude increases the cavity length reduction does not change linearly with the increase in the internal wave amplitude but decreases faster in the 0 5 1 amplitude range as the internal wave amplitude increases further the rate of decrease in cavity length falls when the internal wave exceeds an amplitude of 1 25 the cavity length decreases only slightly for the cavity volume shown in fig 19 a when the internal wave amplitude increases the volume fraction of the cavity gradually decreases fig 19 b shows the volume fraction of the cavity decreasing only slightly at an amplitude of 0 5 however the volume of the cavity decreases substantially when the amplitude is 0 75 this suggests that there is a threshold between amplitudes of 0 5 and 0 75 after the internal wave amplitude exceeds the threshold the cavity volume decreases substantially during the increase in the internal wave amplitude from 0 75 to 1 25 the average air volume in the cavity decreases by 4 4 10 5 4 6 10 5 and 4 38 10 5 respectively this relationship is approximately linear the maximum air volume also decreases as the internal wave class increases not all internal wave amplitudes produce significant changes in the cavity size when the amplitude of the internal wave is large enough the influence of the increase in the internal wave amplitude on the cavity size is reduced the change in pressure over time at pressure monitoring point p4 inside the cavity is shown in fig 20 a the pressure change period is similar to that of the internal wave the pressure does not change much as the internal wave amplitude increases and the trends of pressure change are similar for all internal wave cases as shown in fig 20 b at all pressure monitoring points the average pressure exhibits a small gradual decrease as the internal wave amplitude increases this appears to be caused by the internal wave velocity the pressures at points inside the cavity such as p3 and p4 are quite similar when there is an internal wave the fluctuations in the pressure of the ventilating cavitation flow field are periodic and the pressure amplitude increases significantly compared to the case with no internal wave fig 21 shows a comparison of lift coefficients there is no obvious correlation between the changes in the average lift coefficient and the changes in the internal wave amplitude the lift coefficient peak does not exhibit regular change as the internal wave amplitude increases the internal wave affects cavity shedding and causes lift coefficient pulsation but has little effect on the average lift coefficient ig 22 shows a comparison of drag coefficients the change in the drag coefficient is affected primarily by the wet area of the cavitator in fig 22 a as the amplitude of the internal wave increases the drag of the cavitator increases as long as a phase difference is present when the internal wave amplitude increases the cavity tail rises further at 3t 6 and the cavity shedding around the cavitator described above decreases causing the wet area to decrease at 6t 6 the upper part of the cavity is affected by the internal wave and the cavitator cannot be wrapped both cases result in significant reduction of the wet area of the cavitator and thus increase the cavitator drag coefficient this is especially true in the 1 5 amplitude case as the resistance has double peaks in one period this causes the average cavitator pressure to increase substantially phase differences in drag coefficient peaks are shown in fig 22 b when the internal wave amplitude exceeds 0 75 the arrival time of the drag coefficient peak becomes delayed as the internal wave amplitude increases however when the internal wave amplitude is small the drag coefficient peak arrives early to understand this compared the cavity shapes in fig 17 for the 0 75 amplitude case at 3t 6 the cavity tail rises and the shedding cavity is too small to cover the cavitator this causes a peak to appear between 3t 6 and 4t 6 when the internal wave amplitude increases the cavity shedding of the attached cavitator increases at 3t 6 and the extent of cavity decrease between 5t 6 and 6t 6 increases thus the resistance peak arrival time shifts later as shown in fig 22 c under 0 5 amplitude conditions the cavity volume is similar to that of a cavity without internal waves and the difference in the average cavity resistance increase overall as the internal wave amplitude increases the cavity volume decreases and the resistance also gradually increases the above analysis indicates that there is a threshold associated with the longitudinal velocity of the internal wave when the amplitude is less than this threshold the cavity volume does not decrease significantly but the drag increases as the longitudinal velocity of the internal wave increases the pressure at each monitoring point decreases the cavity length and volume decrease this is especially true when the internal wave amplitude is too large such that the cavity tail floats up or down too much before the cavity shedding some of the cavities are unable to wrap the cavitator 4 conclusions in this work the effect of internal waves on the dynamic behavior of an asymmetric ventilated supercavity was studied by analyzing the evolutions of ventilated cavity pressure pulsation and the cavitation number distribution inside the cavity as well as the hydrodynamic cavitation performance patterns the effects of internal waves were evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 the presence of internal waves affects the cavity evolution load characteristic under the action of internal waves the cavity tail transitions from total shedding to two part shedding and then exhibits double vortex tube shedding under the influence of the upward speed of the internal wave as the internal waves continue to move forward folds are formed at the tail of the cavity which then lead to pinch off the pressure lift and drag all change periodically due to the influence of internal waves on cavity evolution the period is similar to that of the internal wave the period of pressure pulsation is similar to that of the internal wave velocity amplitude 2 internal waves play an important role in the distribution of ventilated cavitation patterns inside the cavity changes in pressure data translated into values of local cavitation number within the cavity are closely related to the cavity shape interestingly the peak distribution of local cavitation numbers are different for different cavity closure types specifically for twin vortex and toroidal vortex cavities this is mainly due to the influence of internal waves on the cavity evolution the distribution of and variation in these local cavitation numbers indicate that the flow field inside the ventilated cavity becomes more complex under the action of internal waves 3 ventilated cavitation hydrodynamic performance is closely related to internal wave amplitude with an increase in the amplitude of the internal wave the pulsation evolution of the cavity becomes more obvious and especially the shedding of the cavity in the closure region becomes more complicated meanwhile increasing the amplitude suppresses the development intensity of the ventilated cavity for the amplitude range studied in this paper the lift coefficients at different amplitudes are relatively close however the drag coefficient is more significantly affected by the amplitude of the internal wave both the average value and the maximum value of the drag coefficient show an increasing trend as the amplitude increases credit authorship contribution

20656,the electrical platform in offshore wind farm is prone to fatigue and damage in wave loads which will threaten the safety and reliability of the structure in this study through the least square fitting analysis of the hydrodynamic response of the jacket structure from the physical model test the hydrodynamic coefficients considering the blockage effect of the complex jacket structure were obtained thus the finite element model of the platform was improved in the simulation of fluid structure interaction on this basis the response results of the strain acceleration displacement and support reactions of the platform at three typical attack angles of regular waves were calculated the results indicated that the hydrodynamic responses of the platform along the elevation are significantly affected by the heavy superstructure thus the acceleration and displacement results present a trend that the farther away from the water surface the smaller the response is while the strain response has a maximum value near the water surface and the bottom of jacket in addition the responses increase rapidly with increasing wave height and variate obviously in different wave directions therefore the responses caused by the external environmental load and wave height in different directions should be fully considered keywords offshore electrical platform hydrodynamic response hydrodynamic coefficient wave attack angle finite element method 1 introduction wind energy is a clean and renewable energy offshore wind power plays an important role in adjusting the energy structure and alleviating environmental pollution considering the economy of offshore power transmission and the safety of grid interconnection of wind farms the use of offshore wind power electrical platforms will be an inevitable choice for the development of large scale offshore wind power in the future see fig 1 and the offshore electrical platform is complex bulky and expensive and it is subjected to the combined loads of marine environmental factors such as wind waves and currents the dynamic effect of the superstructure will aggravate the vibration of the structure and then cause fatigue and even damage to the jacket structure therefore ensuring the safety of the electrical platform and the normal operation of the electrical equipment is a key issue in the design of offshore wind farms each offshore wind farm has only a limited number of electrical platforms the distance between various electrical platforms is more than 10 km while the distance between the electrical platform and the wind turbine is further therefore the interaction between electrical platforms or other structures could be ignored the wave load is directly related to the selection and design of the offshore electric platform so it is very important to accurately estimate the wave load of the electric platform and the response of the structure under the wave load at present a lot of work has gone into hydrodynamic analysis of offshore structures such as ocean petroleum platforms nallayarasu and prasad 2012 nallayarasu and kumar 2017 ships paik et al 2019 offshore wind turbines wang 2021 xu et al 2020 aquaculture facilities xu and dong 2018 and there are many researches on the hydrodynamic characteristics of jacket oil production platforms under wave loads tends to be mature hirdaris

displacement axial force and bending moment along the leg is investigated for regular and extreme conditions abdel raheem 2014 investigated the distribution of displacement axial force and bending moment along the leg under regular and extreme conditions using the finite element method and showed that the nonlinear response investigation was quite crucial for the safe design and the operation of an offshore platform zadeh et al 2015 studied the nonlinear response of a fixed offshore platform under the combined forces of waves wind and sea currents as well as the hydrodynamic load on horizontal and vertical tubular members the dynamic response of an offshore fixed platform coupled with the distribution of displacement axial force and bending moment along the base of the platform for regular and severe cases was investigated santo et al 2018a 2018b and taylor et al 2013 document large laboratory scale measurements of hydrodynamic force time histories on a realistic 1 80 scale space frame jacket structure exposed to combined waves and in line current the aim is to investigate the fluid flow and the associated hydrodynamic force reduction relative to ambient fluid flow due to the presence of a jacket structure as an obstacle array interpreted as a wave current blockage hezarjaribi et al 2013 used a sensitivity analysis method to study the nonlinear response of jacket type platforms against extreme waves to consider the effects of correlation between random variables a robust method of sensitivity analysis named the correlation coefficient approach is also employed the jacket structure has become more popular as the offshore wind turbine support structure k type and inverted k type jacket support structures have superior potential due to their fewer joints and lower cost of manufacturing and installation liao et al 2017 carried out a numerical study on the dynamic responses of k type and inverted k type jacket support structures subjected to different kinds of dynamic loads park et al 2012 established a three dimensional numerical model based on modal analysis and the substructure method using the reliability index obtained from the monte carlo simulation method the reliability of the dynamic response at critical structural members which contained uncertainties due to dynamic forces and structural properties was assessed zhao et al 2019 studied the horizontal wave force of the jacket and column stabilized fish cage under different wave heights periods and incident angles the finite element model of the jacket and the column stabilized fish cage were established according to the test model on the basis of the calculation of the finite element model combined with the wave force obtained from the experiment the hydrodynamic coefficients of the structure were fitted by the least square method and then the drag force inertial force and total force of the structure under different conditions were calculated wei et al 2020

2020 investigated the symmetric motions and loads of the containership undergoing severed green water impact assessed and compared the symmetric dynamic response results from two flexible fluid structure interaction approaches named one and two way coupling methods this research focuses on the hydrodynamic responses of a 10 000 ton electrical platform suitable for offshore wind farms in the open sea a finite element model for dynamic analysis of the offshore electrical platform structure is established and the validity of the numerical model is verified by the corresponding results of the physical model test see fig 2 please refer to our previous research zhang et al 2019 for the specific experimental setup and results a hydrodynamic response analysis of the electrical platform under the action of waves was carried out the stress of key nodes and the motion response of the overall structure of the electrical platform under the action of waves are studied in addition the weak position of the electrical platform under the action of external environmental loads is explored to provide a technical reference for the stability and safety design of the electric platform the dynamic amplification factor of the motion response of the electric platform in various degrees of freedom is determined under the environmental load of waves 2 numerical method the main force bearing component of the electrical platform under normal water depth is the lower jacket structure the jacket structure is usually a large span spatial structure formed by the round rods welded together the ratio of the cross sectional dimension of the rod d to the wavelength l is very small which meets d l 0 2 therefore it should be considered as a small scale component and the wave force on the jacket structure could be calculated according to the morison equation morison et al 1950 combined with the fifth order stokes wave theory and morison equation in ansys apdl 17 2 the wave load is applied on the jacket structure of the electrical platform by adding an inp file thus a corresponding analysis of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the electrical platform is carried out 2 1 governing equation the dynamic response of the structure is described by a second order matrix differential equation given by wilson 1984 1 m u c u k u f for line elements the hydrodynamic loads are calculated using

velocity and acceleration of the structure the first term in eq 2 is the froude krylov force the second term is the hydrodynamic mass force and the third term is the drag force the froude krylov force

c t is coefficient of tangential drag according to the structural parameters the equation of motion is solved by integrating gradually over time from the initial state to obtain the displacement velocity and acceleration of the structure over time during the whole process furthermore the time history of the internal force and deformation of the component can be calculated to realize the finite element time history response analysis of the electrical platform by analyzing the acceleration response curve of the structure and comparing the acceleration frequency response at different positions the maximum acceleration response value of the overall structure is determined and the dynamic amplification factor of the overall structure is obtained 2 2 finite element model the electrical platform is a complex three dimensional jacket structure the platform is 88 m long 72 m wide and 170 m high the superstructure is 41 m high and the jacket structure is 129 m high a finite element model of the electrical platform corresponding to our previous experimental model with a geometric scale of 1 60 zhang et al 2019 was established using ansys see fig 3 the line element was widely used in the finite element model which could effectively simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the electrical platform and improve the computational efficiency with regard to the huge number of grids caused by the solid element according to the boundary conditions of the physical model test a fully constraints were imposed on the end of the equivalent pile in the finite element model herein pipe59 is adopted to simulate the jacket part of the platform structure it is a uniaxial element and cable element that can withstand tension pressure and bending actions and can simulate ocean wave and current loads pipe20 is adopted to simulate the equivalent pile with no hydrodynamic load to model the pile soil interaction of the electrical platform the length of the equivalent pile in the numerical model is consistent with that of the physical model test beam189 is used to simulate the main braces secondary diagonal braces main beams and secondary beams of the superstructure of the platform the wall load is simulated using the seccontrol command for beam189 to define the additional mass per unit length in addition the model platform deck is simulated by shell181 which is suitable for thin to medium thickness shell structures the numerical model adopts a three dimensional rectangular coordinate system x y z and the coordinate origin is taken at the water surface special attention has been focused on the computational grid of the dangerous parts of the structure and the reasonable density of the grid is determined through the convergence study of the computational grid so that the calculation results meet the accuracy requirements the coordinate system and the computational grid of the finite element model are shown in fig 3 2 3 modified method for fluid structure interaction to simulate the hydrodynamic response of the 10 000 ton offshore electrical platform it is necessary to correctly calculate the wave force acting on the jacket structure which is a function of the velocity and acceleration of the water particles as shown in eq 6 the drag coefficient c d and the inertial coefficient c m are the key to the calculation accuracy of the structural wave force as well as the dynamic responses because of the complex rod system of the jacket structure there existing significant blockage and interference effects therefore the fluid structure interaction cannot be ignored when calculating the wave load of the platform in the present study the values of hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c m of the complicated jacket is mainly resulting from a series of physical model tests using the least square method in this way the blockage and interference effects among the rod system of the jacket structure are taken into account using hydrodynamic coefficients which are obviously different from the recommended values based on a single cylinder in specifications based on the modified method for hydrodynamic coefficients of the jacket structure the numerical model as one way coupling model is shown in fig 4 thus the accuracy of numerical simulation for hydrodynamic responses of the platform was improved in the simulation of fluid structure interaction 2 4 wave conditions to study the relationship between wave load and structural response regular wave is used as the external excitation for the electrical platform the range of wave height and wave period of the studied waves covers the design wave of the target sea for the electrical platform and the wave height is 0 10 0 25 m the wave period is 1 2 1 8 s and wave length is 2 31 4 37 m see table 1 it should be noted that the wave length is obtained from fifth order stokes wave theory is slightly different from linear wave theory as the geometric scale is 1 60 the corresponding prototype values of wave height are 3 15 m and the wave period is 7 7 13 9 s the hydrodynamic response of the electrical platform is studied under three different wave attack angles 0 45 and 90 where the attack angle is defined as the angle between wave incidence direction and x axis as shown in fig 3 all the simulation conditions are the same with our previous study zhang et al 2019 3 dynamic response verification in our previous study a physical model test was conducted on the dynamic characteristics of an offshore electrical platform under the combined action of waves the acceleration and strain responses of the platform under three wave incident directions of 0 45 and 90 were obtained taking the waves under normal operating conditions at attack angle of 90 as an example the numerical convergence of time domain was verified first and then the strain acceleration and acceleration response spectrum of the physical model test results and the finite element numerical simulation results are compared and verified all the measuring points have been marked in fig 5 3 1 numerical convergence in time domain for nonlinear and transient dynamic problems such as the hydrodynamic response of the complicated electrical platform in waves automatic time stepping is used as an effective technology to reduce the solution time especially by adjusting the amount of load increment the load increment is also controlled by the automatic time stepping procedure the range of the automatic time stepping is set as 1e 5s 0 005s the initial load increment is set as 0 005s which is consistent with the time interval of corresponding experimental data thus the solution for hydrodynamic response starts with the initial load increment but then the automatic procedure can vary further increments within the range prescribed by the minimum and maximum values the numerical convergence analysis in time domain is shown in fig 6 the scatter plot shows that all the three consequent variables decrease as the calculation time increases and basically becomes stable after 20 s and at this time the load increment is also stable at 0 005s thus the hydrodynamic responses acceleration displacement and strain show a good convergence 3 2 experimental verification of the numerical model the time history results of dynamic response for the measuring points s5 and s6 and j5 and j7 between the physical model test and the numerical calculation are compared in figs 7 and 8 besides the acceleration response in frequency domain using fast fourier transform fft is shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the figures that the results of the physical model test and numerical calculation are basically the same in terms of the peak value and corresponding frequency and the two results are basically consistent in summary the finite element numerical simulation results of the strain response time history acceleration response time history and acceleration response spectrum of the electrical platform under wave action are in good agreement with the corresponding physical model test results 4 numerical results the wave conditions of the numerical simulation are shown in table 1 and the flow chart of the modified finite element model as one way coupling model is shown in fig 4 on this basis the response results of the strain acceleration displacement and support reactions of the platform at three typical attack angles under regular waves are present 4 1 strain responses the location of the strain measuring points of each part of the structure are shown in fig 5 two representative positions s2 and s12 are selected the time history curve of strain at each position changes with wave height see fig 10 and period see fig 11 for clarity data in a time interval from 30 s to 40 s are shown here when t 1 6 s the strain at the four representative positions increases with increasing wave height in time domain as the wave height increases from 0 10 m to 0 25 m see fig 12 a when h 0 15 m during the period from 1 2 s to 1 8 s the strain at the four representative positions increases with the increasing period see fig 12b a comparison of the time history of the strain response at positions s2 and s5 arranged on the pile leg and the strain output positions s11 and s12 arranged on the superstructure is presented in fig 13 the maximum strain peak is at s2 located at the bottom of the structure under the action of wave load the electric platform is subjected to the maximum moment result in that the strain at s2 is the largest the phases of the strain time history curves of s2 and s5 are basically the same while the phase deviation of s11 and s12 is great different it is significant that the strains do not reach the peak at the same time when the direction is 0 and 45 the time history of the strain response at positions arranged in each part of the structure is compared as shown in fig 14 the time history curve shape of the partial strain of the pile leg is close to a sine curve and the peak value of the strain at the position of the pile leg on the wave side is larger see fig 14a the time history curve of the jacket part presents strong nonlinearity and the strain on the wave side at the same height is larger than that on the leeward side see fig 14b the maximum strain on the pile leg for wave attack angle of 0 45 and 90 are 18 86 με at s1 18 73 με at s4 and 22 34 με at s3 respectively under a wave load of 0 the strain on the same leg decreases with increasing elevation under a wave load of 45 the strain at s7 on the same leg is the maximum see fig 14c 4 2 acceleration responses there is much electrical equipment distributed along each layer in the superstructure of the electrical platform to ensure the normal operation of the electrical equipment it is necessary to detect the acceleration response of the sensitive electrical equipment the location and number of acceleration measuring points of the overall structure are shown in fig 5 in the case of wave action with different wave heights in the direction of 90 the acceleration time history responses of the typical acceleration output positions j2 and j10 of the structure are compared j2 represents the measuring point on the jacket and j10 represents the position of the sensitive electrical equipment on the first layer the phase of the time history curve at each position is basically the same with a clear difference in amplitude see fig 15 similarly the responses are compared in waves with different wave periods see fig 16 where the phase of the data is obvious different but the distinction of amplitude is not substantial the acceleration response at each position increases with increasing wave height in the same period see fig 15 when the wave height increases the energy contained in the wave increases which can stimulate a greater acceleration response of the structure compared with the wave height the period has little influence on the peak value of the acceleration response see fig 16 fig 17 shows the curves of the acceleration response peak at each measuring point of the structure changing with wave height and period when the period remains constant at 1 6 s the peak value of the acceleration response at each measuring point of the structure increases with increasing wave height when the wave height is constant and the period changes the variation amplitude of the structural peak acceleration is relatively small 4 3 displacement responses on the basis of calculating the strain and acceleration responses of the structure this study further calculated the displacement value at some measuring points on the electrical platform and analyzed the distribution trend of the displacement response of the structure among which the distribution of measuring points is shown in fig 5 the time history curve of the displacement response at two typical positions u1 and u6 of the structure under regular wave with different wave height as shown in fig 18 the displacement time history curve at each position changes periodically and the magnitude is small approximately 0 1 mm as the wave height increases from 0 10 m to 0 25 m the displacement peak value at each position presents an increasing trend the displacement time history curves of u1 and u6 vary with the period as shown in fig 19 as seen from the figure when the period increases from 1 2 s to 1 8 s the displacement peaks at all positions show an increasing trend therefore under the same conditions a larger wave height or a larger wave period can cause the structure to produce greater displacement which is not conducive to the stability of the structure to analyze the displacement response peak value at each position of each working condition fig 20 shows the variation curve of the displacement response peak value at each measuring point of the structure with the wave height and period it can be seen from the figure that when the period is fixed at 1 6 s the peak value of the displacement response at each measuring point of the structure increases with increasing wave height similarly when the wave height is fixed at 0 15 m the displacement response peak value increase with the increasing period but the amplification is relatively small comparing the displacement response time history curves of each measuring point in the three incident directions it is found that the displacement response peaks at all measuring points are basically the same except that the peak value at u1 is significantly lower in the directions of 45 and 90 4 4 support reaction responses the support reaction force and bending moment of the platform under the action of different wave attack angles are shown in fig 21 and the corresponding wave conditions here are h 0 25 m and t 1 6 s it shows that the maximum force is exerted on the structure along the direction of wave propagation but there is no wave force in the direction perpendicular to the wave direction and the structure is also affected by the wave force along the vertical z direction but its peak value is smaller than the peak value of the horizontal wave force when the wave propagation direction is in the x and y directions due to the symmetry of the lower jacket structure the structure is subjected to moments around the y axis and the x axis and the moment in the z axis direction is always zero by selecting the main support reaction force and bending moment components fy and mx the time history curve of the two changes with wave height as shown in fig 22 and wave period as shown in fig 23 under the same conditions the support reaction force and bending moment increase with increasing wave height and period therefore the greater the wave height or period the more disadvantaged the structure is 5 discussion 5 1 the influence of attack angle on strain response under the same environmental load the incident angle of waves has an important influence on the strength and motion response of the structure regardless of which direction the wave load acts on the platform the trend of structural strain response with regards to elevation is basically the same with increasing elevation the strain response of the jacket reaches the maximum strain near the free water surface and then decreases gradually see fig 24 this is because the main pile as a constraint member of the fixed platform is the main bearing pile it is subjected to a larger wave load and bending moment so it shows a larger level of stress and strain and the wave load on the bar close to the free surface with a large wave effect is also larger than that of other auxiliary bars therefore under the action of waves the maximum strain of the electrical platform usually occurs at the piles near the free surface and also the junction of the main pile and the seafloor when the wave is incident at different angles it corresponds to different wave sides and leeward sides of the bar the bending stress caused by the wave load on the wave side of the electrical platform at the same height is basically at the maximum and the strain will be relatively large see fig 25 in addition combined with the analysis of other working conditions under the action of waves the increase in wave height increases the force of the bar and the strain response of the structure tends to increase at all angles therefore the direction of the most unfavorable load is different for different positions of the electrical platform for example the direction of the most unfavorable load at s7 is 45 and the direction of the most unfavorable load at s6 is 0 the results are consistent with the results presented in fig 24 5 2 the influence of attack angle on acceleration response in the same wave period when the wave height increases the energy contained in the wave increases the acceleration of the structure increases and the peak value of the acceleration response of each measuring point will increase for example the acceleration response of the structure with a wave height of 15 m is approximately 4 times that of the structure with a wave height of 6 m compared with the wave height the period has less influence on the peak acceleration response the phase of the acceleration response time history curve at different positions is basically the same and only the amplitude is slightly different in the direction of height j3 at the free water surface has the maximum acceleration response and j6 at the top floor of the superstructure is always larger see fig 26 which is similar to j9 at the fifth floor under different wave incident angles the peak value of the acceleration response in the direction of 90 is the largest followed by that in the direction of 0 and the peak value of the acceleration response in the direction of 45 is the smallest 5 3 the influence of attack angle on displacement response the displacement at each position of the structure changes periodically with time and the magnitude is small approximately 0 1 mm in the same period the peak value of the displacement response at each measuring point of the structure increases with increasing wave height and the increase in the displacement response is relatively small with increasing period this is because the wave load increases obviously with increasing wave height and the internal force of the structure increases with increasing external load therefore a larger wave height is not conducive to structural stability the displacement response at u2 under the water surface position is at maximum in the direction of 0 and that at position 3 in the water surface position is at maximum in the directions of 45 and 90 the displacement response near the position of the water surface is the largest the superstructure is far from the water surface which is less affected by the wave action and the peak displacements at each point of the superstructure are basically the same see fig 27 the displacement response of the structure is the largest under the 45 direction load followed by 90 and the numerical simulation result of displacement at 0 is the smallest but there is little difference among the three this is because when the incident angle is 45 the pile legs some horizontal struts and inclined struts in the jacket structure are basically perpendicular to the velocity direction of the water quality point which leads to a large displacement in the struts when the incident angle is 0 and 90 the axis direction of some rods is consistent with or oblique to the wave propagation direction so that the interaction surface between rods and waves decreases and the displacement caused by waves along the wave propagation direction is small 5 4 the influence of attack angle on the response of the support reaction because the wave effect is much greater in the water near the free surface than in the deep water the wave load on the structure at this position is also larger under certain conditions the support reaction force and bending moment increase with increasing wave height and period therefore the larger the wave height and period of each incident direction the more disadvantaged the structure is which is also related to the increase in wave energy when the wave angle is 0 the bending moment of the bar is the largest the results of supporting forces in the 45 and 0 directions are close to each other and both are greater than 90 this is because when the wave angle is 0 the wave direction is perpendicular to one side of the platform and the wave propagation direction is just perpendicular to its axis in this direction the shear force of the main pile shows a larger value the anti bending moment capacity of the whole structure of the platform is the weakest and the resulting bending moment is the largest 5 5 maximum value analysis of the electrical platform prototype according to the dimensional data of the model and prototype structure and the stress similarity relation zhang et al 2019 the similarity scale of stress acceleration and displacement can be obtained as 176 31 1 and 60 respectively the prototype structure achieves the maximum stress peak acceleration peak and displacement peak under the working conditions of an actual wave height of 15 m and a period of 12 4 s the maximum displacement peak appears at the junction of the jacket and the superstructure and the value is 7 26 mm the maximum stress peak and the maximum acceleration peak appear on the pile leg at position 3 and the maximum acceleration peak value is 0 00628 m s2 the maximum stress peak value is 15 398 mpa which is much less than the yield stress of 235 mpa and the structure is safe in practical engineering the normal use of the joints of the structure should be fully considered 5 6 the influence of wave height on peak acceleration using modal analysis the natural frequency natural vibration period of the platform structure is obtained and the structural dynamic amplification coefficient iso 2007 corresponding to the first order frequency of the electric platform is calculated to be the largest namely 1 02 to quickly evaluate the dynamic effect of the electrical platform under wave action this study is based on numerical simulation results to fit the variation in the peak acceleration response of the structure with wave height see fig 28 the functional relationship between wave height and acceleration is established and they are finally determined as quadratic functions the coefficients are fitted by the least square method the empirical formula for calculating the peak acceleration at different heights of the electrical platform is shown in the following figure the peak acceleration response of the electrical platform at different heights increases with increasing wave height when the wave height is small the acceleration responses at different elevation positions are basically the same with increasing wave height the influence of the wave height on the jacket below the water surface is weaker than that of the superstructure and the acceleration response at the top of the superstructure and the position of the electrical equipment is basically the same in general this trend is consistent with the dynamic response characteristics of the structure under the action of waves for the fixed 10 000 ton electrical platform located in the open sea the hydrodynamic responses of the platform caused by wave loads have been presented above the hydrodynamic responses of acceleration displacement and strain change obviously in different wave attack angles when the wave height is large huge wave energy will act on the rods of the jacket near the water surface that is the dynamic responses of the platform basically tend to increase with increasing wave height the hydrodynamic responses of the platform along the elevation are significantly affected by the heavy superstructure the greater the mass of the superstructure the greater the inertia force besides the platform is high in height and is fixed to the sea bed by pile foundation resulting in huge structural response values of the strain displacement and acceleration near the water surface under wave action the acceleration and displacement responses show the tendency that the further away from the water surface the smaller the response but for the strain response the variation tendency is slightly different for piles near the mud line the bending moment caused by wave force can promote a larger strain response than that near the water surface compared with the corresponding experimental results the numerical results in this study are in good agreement both in terms of value and response trend therefore it is indicated that the modified finite element model proposed in this study could accurately reflect the dynamic response characteristics of the electrical platform under wave action in addition this model solves the fluid structure coupling problem of complex jacket structure at a quite low computational cost and has certain advantages in computational efficiency 6 conclusions a numerical study was undertaken on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a 10 000 ton offshore electrical platform finite element models for both the jacket structure and the whole platform were established based on the experimental data the least square method was used to fit the hydrodynamic coefficients which took fluid structure interaction into account therefore a modified finite element model was proposed with satisfactory accuracy and high calculation efficiency for the whole structure the hydrodynamic response of the offshore electrical platform was calculated under three typical incident directions at a normal working water depth of 52 m the results including strain acceleration displacement and support reaction were presented and discussed based on the numerical study the main conclusions are as follows i the change in wave height has a significant effect on the acceleration of the platform structure the acceleration response at each position of the structure increases significantly with increasing wave height therefore in practical engineering it is necessary to protect the sensitive electrical equipment inside the superstructure of the platform and the impact of shock waves caused by wave height and storm surge should be fully considered a prevention strategy should be implemented in sea states with large wave heights in order to avoid the excessive acceleration response of the platform affecting the normal operation of sensitive electrical equipment ii with increasing wave height the strain response of the structure under the action of the incident wave at various angles shows an increasing trend however at different locations there is no deterministic relationship between the angle of attack and the extreme value of structural strain therefore in structural design the hydrodynamic load cannot be calculated with a single wave incident angle the extreme values of the stress and strain response caused by external environmental loads in different directions should be fully considered iii under the three typical incident angles the displacement responses at each position of the structure are generally small the displacement response of the structure is the largest at the incident angle of 45 which is 7 56 mm prototype value it is proven that the overall rigidity of the structure is large and the displacement response is relatively small under the action of external loads iv for the studied platform the support reactions in the directions of 0 and 45 are relatively close and are all greater than the results of 90 it is recommended that wave incident directions of 0 and 45 relatively more dangerous than 90 should be considered when calculating the reaction force of the support on the structure credit authorship contribution statement sheng xiao

20656,the electrical platform in offshore wind farm is prone to fatigue and damage in wave loads which will threaten the safety and reliability of the structure in this study through the least square fitting analysis of the hydrodynamic response of the jacket structure from the physical model test the hydrodynamic coefficients considering the blockage effect of the complex jacket structure were obtained thus the finite element model of the platform was improved in the simulation of fluid structure interaction on this basis the response results of the strain acceleration displacement and support reactions of the platform at three typical attack angles of regular waves were calculated the results indicated that the hydrodynamic responses of the platform along the elevation are significantly affected by the heavy superstructure thus the acceleration and displacement results present a trend that the farther away from the water surface the smaller the response is while the strain response has a maximum value near the water surface and the bottom of jacket in addition the responses increase rapidly with increasing wave height and variate obviously in different wave directions therefore the responses caused by the external environmental load and wave height in different directions should be fully considered keywords offshore electrical platform hydrodynamic response hydrodynamic coefficient wave attack angle finite element method 1 introduction wind energy is a clean and renewable energy offshore wind power plays an important role in adjusting the energy structure and alleviating environmental pollution considering the economy of offshore power transmission and the safety of grid interconnection of wind farms the use of offshore wind power electrical platforms will be an inevitable choice for the development of large scale offshore wind power in the future see fig 1 and the offshore electrical platform is complex bulky and expensive and it is subjected to the combined loads of marine environmental factors such as wind waves and currents the dynamic effect of the superstructure will aggravate the vibration of the structure and then cause fatigue and even damage to the jacket structure therefore ensuring the safety of the electrical platform and the normal operation of the electrical equipment is a key issue in the design of offshore wind farms each offshore wind farm has only a limited number of electrical platforms the distance between various electrical platforms is more than 10 km while the distance between the electrical platform and the wind turbine is further therefore the interaction between electrical platforms or other structures could be ignored the wave load is directly related to the selection and design of the offshore electric platform so it is very important to accurately estimate the wave load of the electric platform and the response of the structure under the wave load at present a lot of work has gone into hydrodynamic analysis of offshore structures such as ocean petroleum platforms nallayarasu and prasad 2012 nallayarasu and kumar 2017 ships paik et al 2019 offshore wind turbines wang 2021 xu et al 2020 aquaculture facilities xu and dong 2018 and there are many researches on the hydrodynamic characteristics of jacket oil production platforms under wave loads tends to be mature hirdaris et al 2014 but there are few related studies on the hydrodynamic characteristics of top heavy structures such as electrical platforms elshafey et al 2009 studied the dynamic response characteristics

displacement axial force and bending moment along the leg is investigated for regular and extreme conditions abdel raheem 2014 investigated the distribution of displacement axial force and bending moment along the leg under regular and extreme conditions using the finite element method and showed that the nonlinear response investigation was quite crucial for the safe design and the operation of an offshore platform zadeh et al 2015 studied the nonlinear response of a fixed offshore platform under the combined forces of waves wind and sea currents as well as the hydrodynamic load on horizontal and vertical tubular members the dynamic response of an offshore fixed platform coupled with the distribution of displacement axial force and bending moment along the base of the platform for regular and severe cases was investigated santo et al 2018a 2018b and taylor et al 2013 document large laboratory scale measurements of hydrodynamic force time histories on a realistic 1 80 scale space frame jacket structure exposed to combined waves and in line current the aim is to investigate the fluid flow and the associated hydrodynamic force reduction relative to ambient fluid flow due to the presence of a jacket structure as an obstacle array interpreted as a wave current blockage hezarjaribi et al 2013 used a sensitivity analysis method to study the nonlinear response of jacket type platforms against extreme waves to consider the effects of correlation between random variables a robust method of sensitivity analysis named the correlation coefficient approach is also employed the jacket structure has become more popular as the offshore wind turbine support structure k type and inverted k type jacket support structures have superior potential due to their fewer joints and lower cost of manufacturing and installation liao et al 2017 carried out a numerical study on the dynamic responses of k type and inverted k type jacket support structures subjected to different kinds of dynamic loads park et al 2012 established a three dimensional numerical model based on modal analysis and the substructure method using the reliability index obtained from the monte carlo simulation method the reliability of the dynamic response at critical structural members which contained uncertainties due to dynamic forces and structural properties was assessed zhao et al 2019 studied the horizontal wave force of the jacket and column stabilized fish cage under different wave heights periods and incident angles the finite element model of the jacket and the column stabilized fish cage were established according to the test model on the basis of the calculation of the finite element model combined with the wave force obtained from the experiment the hydrodynamic coefficients of the structure were fitted by the least square method and then the drag force inertial force and total force of the structure under different conditions were calculated wei et al 2020

2020 proposed an approach in developing a pca based method for identifying the structural state from the feature vector constructed by cross correlation functions which was first applied to detect the damage of the numerical model of a jacket platform in the bohai sea and carried out scaled model tests of the studied jacket platform to validate the proposed method lakshmynarayanana and hirdaris 2020 investigated the symmetric motions and loads of the containership undergoing severed green water impact assessed and compared the symmetric dynamic response results from two flexible fluid structure interaction approaches named one and two way coupling methods this research focuses on the hydrodynamic responses of a 10 000 ton electrical platform suitable for offshore wind farms in the open sea a finite element model for dynamic analysis of the offshore electrical platform structure is established and the validity of the numerical model is verified by the corresponding results of the physical model test see fig 2 please refer to our previous research zhang et al 2019 for the specific experimental setup and results a hydrodynamic response analysis of the electrical platform under the action of waves was carried out the stress of key nodes and the motion response of the overall structure of the electrical platform under the action of waves are studied in addition the weak position of the electrical platform under the action of external environmental loads is explored to provide a technical reference for the stability and safety design of the electric platform the dynamic amplification factor of the motion response of the electric platform in various degrees of freedom is determined under the environmental load of waves 2 numerical method the main force bearing component of the electrical platform under normal water depth is the lower jacket structure the jacket structure is usually a large span spatial structure formed by the round rods welded together the ratio of the cross sectional dimension of the rod d to the wavelength l is very small which meets d l 0 2 therefore it should be considered as a small scale component and the wave force on the jacket structure could be calculated according to the morison equation morison et al 1950 combined with the fifth order stokes wave theory and morison equation in ansys apdl 17 2 the wave load is applied on the jacket structure of the electrical platform by adding an inp file thus a corresponding analysis of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the electrical platform is carried out 2 1 governing equation the dynamic response of the structure is described by a second order matrix differential equation given by wilson 1984 1 m u c u k u f for line elements the hydrodynamic loads are calculated using

area of the body d e is the outer pipe diameter ρ is the fluid density c d is the drag coefficient c a is the added mass coefficient v v are the velocity and acceleration of water particle u u are the velocity and acceleration of the structure the first term in eq 2 is the froude krylov force the second term is the hydrodynamic mass force and the third term is the drag force the froude krylov force and hydrodynamic mass force can be rearranged for nonrelative accelerations by using the relationship between c a and c m 3 f ρ c a a u ρ c m a v 1 2 ρ c d d e v u v u where c m c a 1 named inertia

c t is coefficient of tangential drag according to the structural parameters the equation of motion is solved by integrating gradually over time from the initial state to obtain the displacement velocity and acceleration of the structure over time during the whole process furthermore the time history of the internal force and deformation of the component can be calculated to realize the finite element time history response analysis of the electrical platform by analyzing the acceleration response curve of the structure and comparing the acceleration frequency response at different positions the maximum acceleration response value of the overall structure is determined and the dynamic amplification factor of the overall structure is obtained 2 2 finite element model the electrical platform is a complex three dimensional jacket structure the platform is 88 m long 72 m wide and 170 m high the superstructure is 41 m high and the jacket structure is 129 m high a finite element model of the electrical platform corresponding to our previous experimental model with a geometric scale of 1 60 zhang et al 2019 was established using ansys see fig 3 the line element was widely used in the finite element model which could effectively simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the electrical platform and improve the computational efficiency with regard to the huge number of grids caused by the solid element according to the boundary conditions of the physical model test a fully constraints were imposed on the end of the equivalent pile in the finite element model herein pipe59 is adopted to simulate the jacket part of the platform structure it is a uniaxial element and cable element that can withstand tension pressure and bending actions and can simulate ocean wave and current loads pipe20 is adopted to simulate the equivalent pile with no hydrodynamic load to model the pile soil interaction of the electrical platform the length of the equivalent pile in the numerical model is consistent with that of the physical model test beam189 is used to simulate the main braces secondary diagonal braces main beams and secondary beams of the superstructure of the platform the wall load is simulated using the seccontrol command for beam189 to define the additional mass per unit length in addition the model platform deck is simulated by shell181 which is suitable for thin to medium thickness shell structures the numerical model adopts a three dimensional rectangular coordinate system x y z and the coordinate origin is taken at the water surface special attention has been focused on the computational grid of the dangerous parts of the structure and the reasonable density of the grid is determined through the convergence study of the computational grid so that the calculation results meet the accuracy requirements the coordinate system and the computational grid of the finite element model are shown in fig 3 2 3 modified method for fluid structure interaction to simulate the hydrodynamic response of the 10 000 ton offshore electrical platform it is necessary to correctly calculate the wave force acting on the jacket structure which is a function of the velocity and acceleration of the water particles as shown in eq 6 the drag coefficient c d and the inertial coefficient c m are the key to the calculation accuracy of the structural wave force as well as the dynamic responses because of the complex rod system of the jacket structure there existing significant blockage and interference effects therefore the fluid structure interaction cannot be ignored when calculating the wave load of the platform in the present study the values of hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c m of the complicated jacket is mainly resulting from a series of physical model tests using the least square method in this way the blockage and interference effects among the rod system of the jacket structure are taken into account using hydrodynamic coefficients which are obviously different from the recommended values based on a single cylinder in specifications based on the modified method for hydrodynamic coefficients of the jacket structure the numerical model as one way coupling model is shown in fig 4 thus the accuracy of numerical simulation for hydrodynamic responses of the platform was improved in the simulation of fluid structure interaction 2 4 wave conditions to study the relationship between wave load and structural response regular wave is used as the external excitation for the electrical platform the range of wave height and wave period of the studied waves covers the design wave of the target sea for the electrical platform and the wave height is 0 10 0 25 m the wave period is 1 2 1 8 s and wave length is 2 31 4 37 m see table 1 it should be noted that the wave length is obtained from fifth order stokes wave theory is slightly different from linear wave theory as the geometric scale is 1 60 the corresponding prototype values of wave height are 3 15 m and the wave period is 7 7 13 9 s the hydrodynamic response of the electrical platform is studied under three different wave attack angles 0 45 and 90 where the attack angle is defined as the angle between wave incidence direction and x axis as shown in fig 3 all the simulation conditions are the same with our previous study zhang et al 2019 3 dynamic response verification in our previous study a physical model test was conducted on the dynamic characteristics of an offshore electrical platform under the combined action of waves the acceleration and strain responses of the platform under three wave incident directions of 0 45 and 90 were obtained taking the waves under normal operating conditions at attack angle of 90 as an example the numerical convergence of time domain was verified first and then the strain acceleration and acceleration response spectrum of the physical model test results and the finite element numerical simulation results are compared and verified all the measuring points have been marked in fig 5 3 1 numerical convergence in time domain for nonlinear and transient dynamic problems such as the hydrodynamic response of the complicated electrical platform in waves automatic time stepping is used as an effective technology to reduce the solution time especially by adjusting the amount of load increment the load increment is also controlled by the automatic time stepping procedure the range of the automatic time stepping is set as 1e 5s 0 005s the initial load increment is set as 0 005s which is consistent with the time interval of corresponding experimental data thus the solution for hydrodynamic response starts with the initial load increment but then the automatic procedure can vary further increments within the range prescribed by the minimum and maximum values the numerical convergence analysis in time domain is shown in fig 6 the scatter plot shows that all the three consequent variables decrease as the calculation time increases and basically becomes stable after 20 s and at this time the load increment is also stable at 0 005s thus the hydrodynamic responses acceleration displacement and strain show a good convergence 3 2 experimental verification of the numerical model the time history results of dynamic response for the measuring points s5 and s6 and j5 and j7 between the physical model test and the numerical calculation are compared in figs 7 and 8 besides the acceleration response in frequency domain using fast fourier transform fft is shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the figures that the results of the physical model test and numerical calculation are basically the same in terms of the peak value and corresponding frequency and the two results are basically consistent in summary the finite element numerical simulation results of the strain response time history acceleration response time history and acceleration response spectrum of the electrical platform under wave action are in good agreement with the corresponding physical model test results 4 numerical results the wave conditions of the numerical simulation are shown in table 1 and the flow chart of the modified finite element model as one way coupling model is shown in fig 4 on this basis the response results of the strain acceleration displacement and support reactions of the platform at three typical attack angles under regular waves are present 4 1 strain responses the location of the strain measuring points of each part of the structure are shown in fig 5 two representative positions s2 and s12 are selected the time history curve of strain at each position changes with wave height see fig 10 and period see fig 11 for clarity data in a time interval from 30 s to 40 s are shown here when t 1 6 s the strain at the four representative positions increases with increasing wave height in time domain as the wave height increases from 0 10 m to 0 25 m see fig 12 a when h 0 15 m during the period from 1 2 s to 1 8 s the strain at the four representative positions increases with the increasing period see fig 12b a comparison of the time history of the strain response at positions s2 and s5 arranged on the pile leg and the strain output positions s11 and s12 arranged on the superstructure is presented in fig 13 the maximum strain peak is at s2 located at the bottom of the structure under the action of wave load the electric platform is subjected to the maximum moment result in that the strain at s2 is the largest the phases of the strain time history curves of s2 and s5 are basically the same while the phase deviation of s11 and s12 is great different it is significant that the strains do not reach the peak at the same time when the direction is 0 and 45 the time history of the strain response at positions arranged in each part of the structure is compared as shown in fig 14 the time history curve shape of the partial strain of the pile leg is close to a sine curve and the peak value of the strain at the position of the pile leg on the wave side is larger see fig 14a the time history curve of the jacket part presents strong nonlinearity and the strain on the wave side at the same height is larger than that on the leeward side see fig 14b the maximum strain on the pile leg for wave attack angle of 0 45 and 90 are 18 86 με at s1 18 73 με at s4 and 22 34 με at s3 respectively under a wave load of 0 the strain on the same leg decreases with increasing elevation under a wave load of 45 the strain at s7 on the same leg is the maximum see fig 14c 4 2 acceleration responses there is much electrical equipment distributed along each layer in the superstructure of the electrical platform to ensure the normal operation of the electrical equipment it is necessary to detect the acceleration response of the sensitive electrical equipment the location and number of acceleration measuring points of the overall structure are shown in fig 5 in the case of wave action with different wave heights in the direction of 90 the acceleration time history responses of the typical acceleration output positions j2 and j10 of the structure are compared j2 represents the measuring point on the jacket and j10 represents the position of the sensitive electrical equipment on the first layer the phase of the time history curve at each position is basically the same with a clear difference in amplitude see fig 15 similarly the responses are compared in waves with different wave periods see fig 16 where the phase of the data is obvious different but the distinction of amplitude is not substantial the acceleration response at each position increases with increasing wave height in the same period see fig 15 when the wave height increases the energy contained in the wave increases which can stimulate a greater acceleration response of the structure compared with the wave height the period has little influence on the peak value of the acceleration response see fig 16 fig 17 shows the curves of the acceleration response peak at each measuring point of the structure changing with wave height and period when the period remains constant at 1 6 s the peak value of the acceleration response at each measuring point of the structure increases with increasing wave height when the wave height is constant and the period changes the variation amplitude of the structural peak acceleration is relatively small 4 3 displacement responses on the basis of calculating the strain and acceleration responses of the structure this study further calculated the displacement value at some measuring points on the electrical platform and analyzed the distribution trend of the displacement response of the structure among which the distribution of measuring points is shown in fig 5 the time history curve of the displacement response at two typical positions u1 and u6 of the structure under regular wave with different wave height as shown in fig 18 the displacement time history curve at each position changes periodically and the magnitude is small approximately 0 1 mm as the wave height increases from 0 10 m to 0 25 m the displacement peak value at each position presents an increasing trend the displacement time history curves of u1 and u6 vary with the period as shown in fig 19 as seen from the figure when the period increases from 1 2 s to 1 8 s the displacement peaks at all positions show an increasing trend therefore under the same conditions a larger wave height or a larger wave period can cause the structure to produce greater displacement which is not conducive to the stability of the structure to analyze the displacement response peak value at each position of each working condition fig 20 shows the variation curve of the displacement response peak value at each measuring point of the structure with the wave height and period it can be seen from the figure that when the period is fixed at 1 6 s the peak value of the displacement response at each measuring point of the structure increases with increasing wave height similarly when the wave height is fixed at 0 15 m the displacement response peak value increase with the increasing period but the amplification is relatively small comparing the displacement response time history curves of each measuring point in the three incident directions it is found that the displacement response peaks at all measuring points are basically the same except that the peak value at u1 is significantly lower in the directions of 45 and 90 4 4 support reaction responses the support reaction force and bending moment of the platform under the action of different wave attack angles are shown in fig 21 and the corresponding wave conditions here are h 0 25 m and t 1 6 s it shows that the maximum force is exerted on the structure along the direction of wave propagation but there is no wave force in the direction perpendicular to the wave direction and the structure is also affected by the wave force along the vertical z direction but its peak value is smaller than the peak value of the horizontal wave force when the wave propagation direction is in the x and y directions due to the symmetry of the lower jacket structure the structure is subjected to moments around the y axis and the x axis and the moment in the z axis direction is always zero by selecting the main support reaction force and bending moment components fy and mx the time history curve of the two changes with wave height as shown in fig 22 and wave period as shown in fig 23 under the same conditions the support reaction force and bending moment increase with increasing wave height and period therefore the greater the wave height or period the more disadvantaged the structure is 5 discussion 5 1 the influence of attack angle on strain response under the same environmental load the incident angle of waves has an important influence on the strength and motion response of the structure regardless of which direction the wave load acts on the platform the trend of structural strain response with regards to elevation is basically the same with increasing elevation the strain response of the jacket reaches the maximum strain near the free water surface and then decreases gradually see fig 24 this is because the main pile as a constraint member of the fixed platform is the main bearing pile it is subjected to a larger wave load and bending moment so it shows a larger level of stress and strain and the wave load on the bar close to the free surface with a large wave effect is also larger than that of other auxiliary bars therefore under the action of waves the maximum strain of the electrical platform usually occurs at the piles near the free surface and also the junction of the main pile and the seafloor when the wave is incident at different angles it corresponds to different wave sides and leeward sides of the bar the bending stress caused by the wave load on the wave side of the electrical platform at the same height is basically at the maximum and the strain will be relatively large see fig 25 in addition combined with the analysis of other working conditions under the action of waves the increase in wave height increases the force of the bar and the strain response of the structure tends to increase at all angles therefore the direction of the most unfavorable load is different for different positions of the electrical platform for example the direction of the most unfavorable load at s7 is 45 and the direction of the most unfavorable load at s6 is 0 the results are consistent with the results presented in fig 24 5 2 the influence of attack angle on acceleration response in the same wave period when the wave height increases the energy contained in the wave increases the acceleration of the structure increases and the peak value of the acceleration response of each measuring point will increase for example the acceleration response of the structure with a wave height of 15 m is approximately 4 times that of the structure with a wave height of 6 m compared with the wave height the period has less influence on the peak acceleration response the phase of the acceleration response time history curve at different positions is basically the same and only the amplitude is slightly different in the direction of height j3 at the free water surface has the maximum acceleration response and j6 at the top floor of the superstructure is always larger see fig 26 which is similar to j9 at the fifth floor under different wave incident angles the peak value of the acceleration response in the direction of 90 is the largest followed by that in the direction of 0 and the peak value of the acceleration response in the direction of 45 is the smallest 5 3 the influence of attack angle on displacement response the displacement at each position of the structure changes periodically with time and the magnitude is small approximately 0 1 mm in the same period the peak value of the displacement response at each measuring point of the structure increases with increasing wave height and the increase in the displacement response is relatively small with increasing period this is because the wave load increases obviously with increasing wave height and the internal force of the structure increases with increasing external load therefore a larger wave height is not conducive to structural stability the displacement response at u2 under the water surface position is at maximum in the direction of 0 and that at position 3 in the water surface position is at maximum in the directions of 45 and 90 the displacement response near the position of the water surface is the largest the superstructure is far from the water surface which is less affected by the wave action and the peak displacements at each point of the superstructure are basically the same see fig 27 the displacement response of the structure is the largest under the 45 direction load followed by 90 and the numerical simulation result of displacement at 0 is the smallest but there is little difference among the three this is because when the incident angle is 45 the pile legs some horizontal struts and inclined struts in the jacket structure are basically perpendicular to the velocity direction of the water quality point which leads to a large displacement in the struts when the incident angle is 0 and 90 the axis direction of some rods is consistent with or oblique to the wave propagation direction so that the interaction surface between rods and waves decreases and the displacement caused by waves along the wave propagation direction is small 5 4 the influence of attack angle on the response of the support reaction because the wave effect is much greater in the water near the free surface than in the deep water the wave load on the structure at this position is also larger under certain conditions the support reaction force and bending moment increase with increasing wave height and period therefore the larger the wave height and period of each incident direction the more disadvantaged the structure is which is also related to the increase in wave energy when the wave angle is 0 the bending moment of the bar is the largest the results of supporting forces in the 45 and 0 directions are close to each other and both are greater than 90 this is because when the wave angle is 0 the wave direction is perpendicular to one side of the platform and the wave propagation direction is just perpendicular to its axis in this direction the shear force of the main pile shows a larger value the anti bending moment capacity of the whole structure of the platform is the weakest and the resulting bending moment is the largest 5 5 maximum value analysis of the electrical platform prototype according to the dimensional data of the model and prototype structure and the stress similarity relation zhang et al 2019 the similarity scale of stress acceleration and displacement can be obtained as 176 31 1 and 60 respectively the prototype structure achieves the maximum stress peak acceleration peak and displacement peak under the working conditions of an actual wave height of 15 m and a period of 12 4 s the maximum displacement peak appears at the junction of the jacket and the superstructure and the value is 7 26 mm the maximum stress peak and the maximum acceleration peak appear on the pile leg at position 3 and the maximum acceleration peak value is 0 00628 m s2 the maximum stress peak value is 15 398 mpa which is much less than the yield stress of 235 mpa and the structure is safe in practical engineering the normal use of the joints of the structure should be fully considered 5 6 the influence of wave height on peak acceleration using modal analysis the natural frequency natural vibration period of the platform structure is obtained and the structural dynamic amplification coefficient iso 2007 corresponding to the first order frequency of the electric platform is calculated to be the largest namely 1 02 to quickly evaluate the dynamic effect of the electrical platform under wave action this study is based on numerical simulation results to fit the variation in the peak acceleration response of the structure with wave height see fig 28 the functional relationship between wave height and acceleration is established and they are finally determined as quadratic functions the coefficients are fitted by the least square method the empirical formula for calculating the peak acceleration at different heights of the electrical platform is shown in the following figure the peak acceleration response of the electrical platform at different heights increases with increasing wave height when the wave height is small the acceleration responses at different elevation positions are basically the same with increasing wave height the influence of the wave height on the jacket below the water surface is weaker than that of the superstructure and the acceleration response at the top of the superstructure and the position of the electrical equipment is basically the same in general this trend is consistent with the dynamic response characteristics of the structure under the action of waves for the fixed 10 000 ton electrical platform located in the open sea the hydrodynamic responses of the platform caused by wave loads have been presented above the hydrodynamic responses of acceleration displacement and strain change obviously in different wave attack angles when the wave height is large huge wave energy will act on the rods of the jacket near the water surface that is the dynamic responses of the platform basically tend to increase with increasing wave height the hydrodynamic responses of the platform along the elevation are significantly affected by the heavy superstructure the greater the mass of the superstructure the greater the inertia force besides the platform is high in height and is fixed to the sea bed by pile foundation resulting in huge structural response values of the strain displacement and acceleration near the water surface under wave action the acceleration and displacement responses show the tendency that the further away from the water surface the smaller the response but for the strain response the variation tendency is slightly different for piles near the mud line the bending moment caused by wave force can promote a larger strain response than that near the water surface compared with the corresponding experimental results the numerical results in this study are in good agreement both in terms of value and response trend therefore it is indicated that the modified finite element model proposed in this study could accurately reflect the dynamic response characteristics of the electrical platform under wave action in addition this model solves the fluid structure coupling problem of complex jacket structure at a quite low computational cost and has certain advantages in computational efficiency 6 conclusions a numerical study was undertaken on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a 10 000 ton offshore electrical platform finite element models for both the jacket structure and the whole platform were established based on the experimental data the least square method was used to fit the hydrodynamic coefficients which took fluid structure interaction into account therefore a modified finite element model was proposed with satisfactory accuracy and high calculation efficiency for the whole structure the hydrodynamic response of the offshore electrical platform was calculated under three typical incident directions at a normal working water depth of 52 m the results including strain acceleration displacement and support reaction were presented and discussed based on the numerical study the main conclusions are as follows i the change in wave height has a significant effect on the acceleration of the platform structure the acceleration response at each position of the structure increases significantly with increasing wave height therefore in practical engineering it is necessary to protect the sensitive electrical equipment inside the superstructure of the platform and the impact of shock waves caused by wave height and storm surge should be fully considered a prevention strategy should be implemented in sea states with large wave heights in order to avoid the excessive acceleration response of the platform affecting the normal operation of sensitive electrical equipment ii with increasing wave height the strain response of the structure under the action of the incident wave at various angles shows an increasing trend however at different locations there is no deterministic relationship between the angle of attack and the extreme value of structural strain therefore in structural design the hydrodynamic load cannot be calculated with a single wave incident angle the extreme values of the stress and strain response caused by external environmental loads in different directions should be fully considered iii under the three typical incident angles the displacement responses at each position of the structure are generally small the displacement response of the structure is the largest at the incident angle of 45 which is 7 56 mm prototype value it is proven that the overall rigidity of the structure is large and the displacement response is relatively small under the action of external loads iv for the studied platform the support reactions in the directions of 0 and 45 are relatively close and are all greater than the results of 90 it is recommended that wave incident directions of 0 and 45 relatively more dangerous than 90 should be considered when calculating the reaction force of the support on the structure credit authorship contribution statement sheng xiao

20657,the demand for subsea spool deployment is increasing with the expansion of offshore projects for a project to install multiple spools different deployment methods can be used the choice of method may influence the safety and the total cost of the project thus it is important to evaluate different deployment methods in the planning phase this study addresses weather window analysis of two deployment methods for large subsea spools the purpose is to compare the efficiency of the two methods in terms of total installation time for projects with different numbers of spools numerical modeling and time domain simulations of the critical activities are carried out the simulations together with the operational criteria provide the allowable sea states which are the key input for weather window analysis hindcast data from a site in the barents sea are used for weather window analysis the total installation time is compared for various months different total numbers of spools and transportation durations the influence of the possible increase of the allowable sea states for the critical activity on the total installation time is also evaluated through the comparative studies recommendations to select the proper deployment method for different situations are provided keywords subsea spool deployment weather window analysis lift off from barge splash zone lowering 1 introduction there are increasing challenges in the installation of subsea structures in recent years larger and heavier subsea structures are being installed in harsh environments and in deep waters deployment of subsea structures using offshore cranes is a weather sensitive operation and may account for significant downtime in the whole installation project dnvgl 2016 these operations affect the installation costs for a subsea field development and thus can directly impact the overall capital expenditure careful planning with sophisticated analysis is an important prerequisite for safe execution of the installations lifting operations are weather restricted operations for which operational limits need to be established during the planning phase dnvgl 2014 for practical use the operational limits are often expressed in terms of environmental conditions or motions that can be monitored on board the installation vessel li 2016 and guachamin acero et al 2016 described a general methodology to establish the operational limits using response based criteria the operational limits in terms of allowable sea states are obtained by fulfilling the criteria that the characteristic value of the governing response is less than the design capacity the methodology is composed of the following six main steps 1 identification of potentially critical events 2 numerical modeling of operational activities 3 identification of critical events and limiting parameters 4 calculation of characteristic dynamic responses 5 evaluation of the allowable limits 6 assessment of the operational limits examples of application of this methodology and assessment of operational limits can be found in the published literature li et al 2016 gao et al 2016 guachamin acero 2016 verma et al 2019 among the steps to establish operational limits numerical modelling and analysis are of great importance to estimate the critical dynamic responses many studies have been performed to estimate the characteristic responses of various lifting activities including lift off operations graczyk and sandvik 2012 karatas 2020 over boarding li et al 2020 lifting through the splash zone bunnik et al 2006 sarkar and gudmestad 2010 næss et al 2014 amer 2020 heavy lift operations cha et al 2010 zhu et al 2017 acero et al 2017 and mating operations jiang et al 2018 verma et al 2019 due to the complex environmental loading with transient dynamic effects of the lifting system during the operation the prediction of the motions and loads is a challenging task the state of the art approach is to perform time domain simulations of the installation system including the vessel the lifted object structure the hoisting system and other coupling elements between these components for different critical phases of the lifting operation the focus on the analysis also varies for example accurate implementation of the hydrodynamic coefficients is essential for structures that experience high slamming loads during the splash zone crossing molin 2011 such as subsea template and grp covers solaas et al 2017 on the other hand the control of the crane winch and the tugger lines may dominate the motions for lift off and mating operations ren et al 2018 thus different methods should be considered when establishing the operational limits for complex operations for operations dominated by wave motions the allowable sea states can be obtained in terms of significant wave height h s and spectral wave period t p uncertainties in the allowable sea states also need to be evaluated to provide safety margins natskår et al 2015 guachamin acero and li 2018 the allowable sea states and weather forecasts provide the basis for the decision making during the execution of the operation in the planning phase the installation procedure allowable sea states and site conditions serve as input for operability and weather window analysis the operability and weather window analysis are useful to size equipment select installation vessel and optimize the installation method examples of operability and weather window analysis of various operations can be found o connor et al 2013 wu 2014 yang et al 2017 gintautas and sørensen 2017 subsea spool structures are important components in the subsea production systems to connect the pipe ends and the interconnecting facilities bai and bai 2005 spools must be designed to meet functional requirements including pressure temperature thermal expansion environmental loads and installation loads etc there are many studies in the literature focusing on different design aspects such as seismic design yasseri 2020 flow induced vibrations lu et al 2016 and tuned mass damper for vibration control zhang et al 2015 etc the design of the spools is not the emphasis of this study instead this study focuses on the deployment of subsea spools which refers to the phase to lift the spools from the deck of a vessel and lower them to the seabed the spools are normally deployed by offshore construction vessels with onboard cranes the whole installation can be in general divided into several phases parra 2018 the spool is firstly transported by a construction vessel or a feeding barge after lifted off from the deck of the vessel or the barge the spool is lowered through the splash zone the spool is then deeply submerged until it reaches the seabed finally the connections between the spool and the subsea equipment are carried out by remotely operated underwater vehicle rov the main critical activities are the lift off phase and the lowering through the splash zone which require careful numerical modeling and analysis because spools are getting larger and heavier lifting operations become more challenging and are often carried out in relatively low sea states in the summer seasons cosson et al 2018 aarset et al 2011 moreover with the expansion of offshore projects the number of spools that need to be installed in one project is also increasing due to increasing number of wells and redundant wells for production assurance yasseri and bahai 2018 to improve the safety and efficiency of spool installation a robust installation strategy needs to be established in the planning phase this study aims to tackle one of the challenges faced by marine contractors on the choice of deployment method for large subsea spools two deployment methods are compared by weather window analysis the analysis is based on the installation procedure the allowable sea states and the hindcast data at the reference site the total installation time using the two deployment methods is compared for various practical installation situations this paper first describes the two deployment methods followed by numerical methods to derive allowable sea states then weather window analysis results and discussions on the comparative studies are presented finally the conclusions and recommendations from this study are given 2 description of two deployment methods 2 1 deployment method 1 transportation and deployment with construction vessel a common method for installation of subsea spools involves only one construction vessel this method is considered efficient when the number of spools to be installed is small for example less than 5 the main activities for the whole installation are summarized in table 1 four main activity groups are required to install one spool here one activity group refers to a series of activities that cannot be split or interrupted once the weather condition deteriorates activity group no 2 summarized as preparation and deployment includes cutting sea fastening lift off the spool from its own deck over boarding and lowering the spool through the splash zone until it is landed on the target location on the seabed the lowest allowable limits of sea states among these activities should be used as the operational limits for this activity group once the deployment is finished and the lifting gear has been recovered a final survey will be carried out by an rov the most critical activity that determines the allowable sea states for activity group no 2 is lowering the spool through the splash zone where the hydrodynamic loads on the spool may cause unacceptable responses due to large non linearities of the lowering process time domain simulations are required which will be detailed in sec 3 after the first spool is installed the activity groups no 1 4 need to be repeated to install n spools in this case the construction vessel needs to sail back and forth to pick up new spools and deploy them one by one the number of trips back and forth between the harbor and the offshore site is the same as the number of spools which is denoted as n 2 2 deployment method 2 transportation with feeding barge and deployment with construction vessel if the number of spools to be installed is large for example over 10 spools and the distance between the harbor and the offshore site is long then deployment method 1 may not be efficient this is because a large amount of time is spent on transportation an offshore construction vessel is equipped with specialized equipment onboard to perform complex installation tasks and the day rate for such a vessel is much more costly than feeding barges with similar size therefore it may be more beneficial to employ feeding barges to transport the spools while the construction vessel stays at the offshore site to perform the deployment activities thus this deployment method 2 employs one construction vessel and at least one feeding barge it should be mentioned that this study deals with installation of large spools whose shape is usually complex with large horizontal dimensions see fig 1 thus it is only possible to transport one spool using conventional offshore construction vessels or feeding barges per trip the main activities for the whole installation using deployment method 2 are summarized in table 2 the transportation and installation of the first spool is carried out by the construction vessel for the second and the remaining spools the transportation is carried out by one or more feeding barges while the construction vessel is positioned at the offshore site to continue the deployment table 2 only shows the activities that involve the construction vessel the transportation of spools using a feeding barge is carried out in parallel to the activities at the offshore site for example while installing the first spool the barge is transporting the second spool the second spool should arrive at the offshore site by the time the rov survey for the first spool is completed once the weather permits the preparation for lift off of the second spool from the barge will initiate after the lift off the construction vessel will continue with the deployment while the barge sails back to the harbor to pick up a new spool in this way this method avoids mobilization of the construction vessel going back and forth between the harbor and the offshore site when many spools are required to be installed the most critical activity for deployment method 2 is the lift off from barge which is included in activity group no 4 compared to lift off from the own deck of the construction vessel using deployment method 1 the installation system experiences more dynamics due to the relative motions between the barge and the vessel reducing the allowable sea states for lift off from barge moreover the allowable sea states for lift off from barge are lower than lowering the spool through the splash zone see sec 3 3 which is the critical activity for deployment method 1 this indicates that long waiting on weather time may be expected for lift off activity using deployment method 2 although the deployment method 2 seems to be more efficient the current industrial projects hesitate to apply this method due to two main reasons first the number of spools to be installed in one project in the past was often relatively low second the allowable sea states for lift off from barge are too low which results in the waiting time for deployment method 2 even longer than the transportation time in most seasons these two aspects may limit the application of deployment method 2 for many marine contractors however with the expansion of offshore industry there is a need for installing more spools within a project the location of some offshore sites is moving further away from the shore increasing the transportation time moreover new measures can be implemented to potentially increase the allowable sea states for the lift off from barge the above aspects will be considered later when comparing the efficiency of the two deployment methods 3 numerical methods and assessment of operational limits because of the complexity of the multi body dynamic systems experiencing hydrodynamic loadings simplified frequency domain analysis can hardly be used to predict the motion responses under irregular waves thus numerical analyses using time domain methods are required to estimate the motions of the system for critical activities as discussed in sec 2 the critical activities for the two deployment methods are lowering the spool through the splash zone and lift off from barge this section will discuss the numerical models used to estimate the responses and the methods to assess the allowable seas states for these two activities 3 1 system description the installation system contains the construction vessel the feeding barge for deployment method 2 only the subsea spool and the hoisting system the construction vessel is equipped with a crane with a maximum lift capacity of 400 tons the feeding barge is a conventional barge capable to operate in the north sea the barge has a sufficient deck area to transport large subsea spools the main dimensions of the construction vessel and the feeding barge are given in table 3 the subsea spool has a large horizontal dimension and is composed of different sections of tubular members fig 1 presents the side and top views of the spool piece where the horizontal position of the center of gravity cog is highlighted the large horizontal dimension of the spool makes it challenging for the lifting operation a reinforcement pipe is attached to limit compression of the spool and thus the structural failure during the deployment can be avoided the reinforcement pipe is assumed rigidly connected to the termination heads the total mass of the spool and the reinforcement pipe is 45 2 tons the hoisting system for the spool lifting operation includes the slings the lifting wire and the winch the slings connect the spool to the hook and the lifting wire connects the hook and the crane due to the large horizontal dimension of the spool structure seven slings are arranged to distribute the loads on the spool the locations of the seven slings on the spool are shown in fig 1 3 2 numerical methods the detailed numerical models and methods for the two critical activities i e the lowering through the splash zone and the lift off from barge have been studied in detail and published in li et al 2020a 2020b given that the objective of this study is to compare the efficiency of two deployment methods the numerical methods are briefly discussed here 3 2 1 lift off from barge when using deployment method 2 the spool is initially resting on the feeding barge during lift off the hoisting system lifts the spool off from the deck of the barge before lowering it through the splash zone the configuration of the installation system for the lift off operation is illustrated in fig 2 for this activity hydrodynamic loads on the vessel and the feeding barge need to be calculated it should be noted that hydrodynamic interactions between the barge and vessel are considered in the numerical analysis because they are in close vicinity during the lift off operation the hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained using the panel method program dnv 2010 in the frequency domain in comparison with a single vessel standalone the interactions are found to mainly influence the hydrodynamic coefficients of the feeding barge in roll sway and yaw directions parra 2018 the wire couplings through the seven slings and the lifting wire are modeled as linear springs the flexibility of the spool is considered and distributed among the flexibility of the seven slings moreover tugger lines are often used in the spool lifting operation to constrain the horizontal motions of the spool in the current model yaw stiffness has been added to the spool for simplicity to represent the restoring forces from tugger lines the spools are often supported directly on the deck of the barge during transportation thus the contact between the spool and the deck is steel to steel contact during lift off if re hit happens between the deck and the spool the re hit forces may be substantial due to the high stiffness of the deck contact karatas 2020 as an alternative retractable supporting units can be incorporated to support the spool once the spool is lifted the supports will be retracted to avoid re hit however these retractable supporting units need to be designed for this particular purpose and thus the installation cost may be increased in the numerical model the deck fenders are modeled using fender couplings each fender coupling includes a fender point and a fender plane which provides friction force and compression forces when the two bodies have contact see li et al 2020a for details stiffness and damping properties based on the steel to steel contact are specified in this study six fender points are modeled the forces on those fender points during lift off are calculated to assess the operational limits the numerical model was established in sima simo software sintef ocean 2020 and the top view of the model is shown in fig 3 3 2 2 splash zone lowering the second critical activity is the lowering of the spool through the splash zone for deployment method 1 this activity is performed after lift off from own deck and over boarding of the spool to the side of the construction vessel for deployment method 2 the barge will move away from the construction vessel after the lift off from barge followed by the lowering through the splash zone fig 4 shows the layout of the system for the lowering activity in this case the hydrodynamic properties of the vessel alone should be used without interaction with the barge the modeling of the hoisting system is the same as for the lift off operation the challenge in the numerical modeling of the lowering activity is to properly estimate the hydrodynamic forces on the spool when it crosses the splash zone depth dependent added mass and damping coefficients need to be considered for the spool sections experiencing changing positions with respect to the instantaneous free surface moreover the kinematics of the fluid where the spool sections are lowered are disturbed by the vessel motions this is denominated as shielding effects from the vessel when the lifted object is close to the vessel the response amplitude operators raos of the disturbed wave kinematics with respect to undisturbed wave elevation in the frequency domain can be obtained these raos depend on the wave periods and wave direction and vary with locations they are implemented in the time domain to calculate the instantaneous fluid kinematics which are applied to obtain the wave loads on the spool sections using morison s formula a detailed implementation of the shielding effects and sensitivity studies refers to li et al 2020b 3 2 3 time domain simulations responses analyses are performed for the established numerical models to solve the corresponding equations of the motion the model for lift off from barge consists of 21 degrees of freedom dofs in total the construction vessel the barge and the spool are modeled with 6 dofs whereas the hook is modeled with 3 dofs the model for the lowering operation consists of 15 dofs step by step integration method is applied to solve the coupled equations of motion using newmark beta numerical integration with a time step of 0 02 s the lifting wire is paid in with a speed of 0 5 m s during lift off and is paid out with a speed of 0 1 m s during lowering operation both the lift off and the lowering operations are transient processes with nonlinear dynamic loads simulations using different irregular wave realizations are required to account for the variability of waves thus enough wave seeds for the time domain simulations are important to provide statistics to assess operational limits the influences of the seed number on the allowable sea states using different total wave seed numbers were studied in li et al 2020b moreover for lift off operation the wave seeds must be selected to exclude the unreasonable wave seeds that do not fulfill the judgement of the crane operators in the real operation before assessing the operational limits this is done by checking the relative motion between the crane tip and the deck of the barge shortly after lift off this relative motion should increase within a defined short period after the activation of the winch li et al 2020a the wave seeds that do not fulfill such requirement are excluded the wave realizations for the time domain simulations are generated based on jonswap joint north sea wave project spectrum considering short crested seas dnvgl 2017 3 3 assessment of operational limits 3 3 1 operational criterion based on the recommended practice dnvgl 2016 the potential critical events that limit the lift off from barge and the corresponding criteria are as follows 1 potential snap loads in the slings the dynamic load capacity dlc of the sling should not be exceeded based on practical sling properties the dlc of the sling is 318 8 kn 2 slack wire condition for slings the criterion for the slack sling condition is that the minimum dynamic tension in any of the slings during the operation should be larger than zero 3 re hit of the spool against the supporting deck here re hit shall mean the event in which the object hits the supporting deck after any lift attempt the static fender force on the spool is 145 2 kn for the initial condition when the spool is rested on the deck thus this criterion requires that the re hit force on the spool at any fender locations should be lower than the static force for the lowering operation the above criteria 1 and 2 on snap loads and slack wire condition should also be fulfilled besides the lowering operation also requires considering the following critical event and criterion 4 collision between the spool and the vessel minimum clearance between the spool and the vessel should be maintained during the lowering process according to dnvgl 2016 3m is used as the minimum clearance criterion in the assessment of allowable sea states for the spool lowering process due to the large horizontal dimensions of the spool a small rotational motion of the spool may cause large vertical displacements at the end of the spool this can lead to possible high re hit forces during lift off and possible slack wire and snap loads in the slings during both lift off and lowering processes thus the activities studied here are very sensitive to wave conditions when searching for the allowable sea states the above criteria should be fulfilled simultaneously for the corresponding activity the assessment is carried out by comparing the selected statistical values of dynamic responses obtained from each wave condition with the limiting values from the criteria the sea states that fulfill these criteria are considered as allowable sea states 3 3 2 allowable sea states based on the numerical analysis and the operational criteria the operational limits in terms of allowable sea state parameters h s and t p have been obtained for the two critical activities the allowable sea states are sensitive to different parameters including sea state descriptions such as wave spectral type wave direction wave spreading and wave components numerical methods such as the method to calculate hydrodynamic forces and inclusion of shielding effects and statistical methods the fitted distribution model of critical responses and the percentile to choose the extreme responses other factors such as time domain integration methods time step and seed numbers will also introduce uncertainties to the dynamic responses and thus the derived allowable sea states many studies have been devoted to quantifying uncertainties in the allowable sea state assessment for various operations guachamin acero and li 2018 li et al 2021 for complex operations relying on time domain simulations the quantification of the uncertainties requires comprehensive sensitivity studies the uncertainties of the lowering operation of the spool were studied in li et al 2020b fig 5 presents one example of the comparisons on the allowable sea states with and without shielding effects it can be seen that the allowable sea states are sensitive to the shielding effects and the spreading index for short crested waves a detailed discussion on the comparison of sea states with and without shielding effects refers to li et al 2020b in this paper the study on uncertainties in the allowable sea states will not be discussed in detail here the allowable sea states corresponding to the most realistic cases are chosen based on the previous work by li et al 2020a 2020b and applied in the weather window analysis see table 4 as shown in the table the allowable h s for lift off from barge are substantially lower than those for the lowering operation as mentioned in sec 2 2 the low allowable sea states for lift off from barge may result in long waiting on weather for deployment method 2 4 weather window analysis weather window analysis is performed to evaluate the operability and efficiency of the two deployment methods it is important to choose the potential months with minimum total installation time to reduce the costs often the project duration lasts for weeks to months and the weather conditions for the planned project period are unpredictable thus weather window analysis using hindcast data from the past years is often adopted to estimate the total installation time 4 1 wave conditions the hindcast wave data of one reference site at the barents sea is chosen for the weather window analysis in this study the coordinate of this site is 72 02 n 22 1 e with water depth of around 350 m and it is southeast of the johan carlsberg field the hindcast data are from the norwegian reanalysis archive 10 km nora10 database providing wind and sea states characteristics every 3 h from september 1957 to the present reistad et al 2011 the nora10 hindcast data have been widely used in the planning phase of different offshore activities and were validated against offshore measurement data bruserud and haver 2016 50 year wave data from 1961 to 2010 are applied in this study the hindcast data provide h s t p and wave direction for the total sea the wind sea and the swell sea the yearly and seasonal variations of the wave heights for this site are firstly investigated fig 6 presents the averaged maximum and minimum monthly mean h s the mean h s values for individual years are also presented in general higher mean h s values occur in the winter months from october to march than those in the summer season from april to september often it is preferable to perform offshore installations in the summer months for weather sensitive operations to reduce the risks and installation costs however for many occasions due to challenges of the project schedule vessel availability and other practical issues the installations may need to be carried out in winter in this case the planning of the installation activities must be devised to ensure the safety of the operations by considering measures to increase the operational sea states and to make robust contingency plans from fig 6 a large yearly variation of the mean monthly h s values is also observed the variabilities are also larger in the winter months than those in the summer months even in the summer months the differences between maximum and minimum mean h s are larger than 0 8 m representing large uncertainties this indicates the importance to perform weather window analysis based on a large database of wave conditions to provide reliable statistics of the installation time for a given site for an operation with sequential activities waiting on weather often happens before executing the weather sensitive activities with low operational limits the lowering operation for deployment method 1 and the lift off operation for deployment method 2 have the lowest allowable sea states with h s limits between 1 m to 2 5 m as shown in table 4 three h s limits based on the averaged allowable h s values from table 4 are used to study the weather windows by simply comparing the hindcast total h s values with these selected limits fig 7 presents the empirical cumulative distribution functions cdf of the weather window durations for selected h s limits based on 50 years data as expected the duration of the weather windows reduce significantly as the h s limit decreases the duration of the weather window is in general shorter in february and longer in june or august moreover it is seen that the number of available windows for h s 2 m is higher than those for lower h s limits table 5 lists the average number of the weather windows per year and the average duration in hours shown in parentheses when h s limit is 1 m both the number of windows and the duration are in general lower than those with higher h s limits even in the summer months this low operability calls attention to the challenges of installing many spools using deployment method 2 when h s limit is 2 m the average duration of the weather windows in summer is longer than 100 h more than 4 days with around 4 5 windows of over 100 h on average each month potential operability of over 60 can be expected thus based on the site condition some preliminary results can be already obtained by only studying the hindcast data however to provide more extensive results weather window analysis based on both the hindcast data and operational limits for all activities should be carried out 4 2 input for two deployment methods the two deployment methods have been discussed in sec 2 here the key input for the two methods that will be used for the weather window analysis are summarized in table 6 and table 7 respectively the input includes activities reference period and allowable sea states for each activity group the reference period duration of each activity is based on the operational procedure of similar projects and includes contingency time the allowable sea states for the critical activities lowering operation for method 1 and lift off from barge for method 2 refer to the results given in table 4 for less sensitive operations including transportation and rov survey a constant h s limit of 3 m is used based on practical experiences for a total number of n spools the net installation time without any waiting on weather is also given in the tables it is seen that the net installation time is lower using method 2 for n 1 because feeding barges are used to transport the spools instead of the construction vessel 4 3 estimating the total installation time weather window analysis using hindcast data can estimate the total installation time for different total number of spools using two deployment methods here the total installation time for the defined installation task corresponds to the duration of installing all spools including the time for all activities listed in table 6 and table 7 and the time of waiting on weather normally during the planning phase the starting time of the project is decided and the vessel will be rented from the predetermined date until the completion of the whole project if the weather condition is not suitable waiting time before and between the activities is expected and should be accounted for in the total time which reflects the total cost for renting the vessels the weather windows for each activity group can be identified based on the hindcast wave data time history for activities that are only limited by h s a direct comparison of the allowable h s with hindcasted total h s is performed for the critical activities with allowable limits in terms of both h s and t p the allowable h s for each hindcasted t p is firstly calculated and then compared with the hindcasted h s a detailed description of the weather window analysis can refer to guachamin acero et al 2016 it should be mentioned that the required weather window for each activity must be identified in sequence based on the installation procedure and their respective duration with the identified weather windows for each activity group the waiting time between these windows is also found by counting the hours from the starting time to the completion of all the activities to install n spools the total installation time is thus obtained such analysis is repeated for changing n using two deployment methods and the results are discussed in the next section 4 4 results and discussions to obtain sufficient sample data of the total installation time for different months weather window analysis for each installation case is repeated daily assuming that the starting time for the installation is at 0 h each day this setup ensures a 24 h difference between the starting time of each analysis and thus reduces the correlation between the sample data of the total installation time take april as an example if the operation is planned to start in april a sample size of 30 by assuming the installation starts at each day in april for the total installation time can be obtained using the hindcast data for a given year based on this sample data an empirical cdf function for this year can be established by repeating the weather window analysis using 50 years hindcast data a total sample of 1500 total installation time for this month can be generated 4 4 1 comparison of total installation time fig 8 compares the empirical cdf of the total installation time starting at three different months for each subfigure the empirical cdf functions based on yearly data are displayed together strong yearly variations of the distributions are observed for all selected three months which are consistent with the variation of the wave conditions as illustrated in fig 6 the scattering of the distributions in fig 8 reduces from february to june with reduced total installation time this is because the waves become less severe in the summer months two total numbers of spools n 2 and 10 are compared in fig 8 when the spool number increases from 2 to 10 the spread of the yearly empirical distribution increases greatly for all three months more activities need to be carried out to complete the installation task when n increases which demands more weather windows meanwhile the waiting time between the weather windows also increases and introduces larger yearly deviations moreover the limited sample size of each month annually for example 30 data in april each year also introduces large uncertainties in the empirical cdf which contributes to the large spread of the results to further illustrate the statistical uncertainties due to the size of the sample data fig 9 presents the empirical cdf of the total installation time for deployment method 1 in april for n 2 using 5 years and 10 years hindcast data as input respectively when using 5 years hindcast as input the total 50 years data are divided into 10 sets of 5 years the same applies when using 10 years input data the empirical cdf using different sets are presented together to show the spreading of the distributions compared to fig 8 a the scattering of the empirical cdf narrows down significantly with the increasing length of the input data taking the values corresponding to 50 of the cdf as an example the range of the values reduces from 36 208 hours based on yearly pdf to 36 54 and 39 51 hours based on 5 years and 10 years pdf respectively thus it is evident that a longer input hindcast data provides more reliable estimate of the statistic values however it is difficult to suggest a minimum requirement of data because the problems are case dependent if limited hindcast data are available it is recommended to evaluate the uncertainties by statistical methods such as monte carlo simulations in this study to reduce the statistical uncertainties all 50 years hindcast data for each month are used for further analysis the empirical cdf using all hindcast data for three selected months are shown in fig 10 for n 2 case the repeated sample data with the same installation time are removed in the figure compared with the monthly empirical distributions in figs 8 and 9 a larger sample by including all 50 years results provides a more reliable and smoother distribution based on the installation procedure the installation time for two spools without any waiting time are 36 h and 24 h respectively for two deployment methods as shown in fig 10 a the probability of installing 2 spools without any waiting time is around 75 using deployment method 1 if the operation starts in june this probability drops to around 40 and 18 if the operation starts in april and february respectively the whole empirical distribution moves noticeably to the right hand side from june to february indicating a significant increase of the waiting time in the winter months a similar trend is observed for deployment method 2 as shown in fig 10 b however for the same target total installation time in the same month the probability of completing the operation using deployment method 2 is much less than that using method 1 this indicates a much longer waiting time using method 2 due to the lower allowable sea states of the lift off activity moreover the probabilities of completing the installation without any waiting time are also lower using method 2 and they are around 30 12 and 3 for june april and february respectively to discuss how the total installation time changes with the starting months the number of spools and the deployment methods the total installation time corresponding to the probability of 50 p50 and 90 p90 in the empirical distribution as indicated in fig 10 b are used for further comparison the monthly variation of the p50 total installation time for two deployment methods are compared in fig 11 as mentioned weather sensitive operations are often performed in the summer seasons from may to august to reduce waiting time and the installation costs here the results for january to april are also included to provide a wider overview on the monthly change of the installation duration as expected the installation time is much lower when the operation starts in may to august than in january to april for all presented cases in fig 11 when spool number n 2 deployment method 2 consumes much more hours compared to method 1 for all months however when the total number of spools increases to 10 a similar total installation time from may to july is observed among the two deployment methods this indicates that the extra waiting time due to the low allowable sea states of the lift off from barge using deployment method 2 is comparable to the transportation time of the construction vessel using deployment method 1 it is expected that if n or the transportation duration increases deployment method 2 may consume less installation time than method 1 in the summer months 4 4 2 sensitivity study on the total number of spools and transportation time weather window analysis for different n and different transportation durations has been carried out the p50 total installation time for n 2 to 15 with transportation time of 6 h and 12 h is compared in fig 12 four starting months from april to july are chosen for the comparisons when the transportation time is 6 h using deployment method 1 is more efficient for different n however the differences in time are very small for n 12 in may and july if the installation site is further away and longer transportation time is required deployment method 2 using feeding barge for transportation shows a great advantage when the transportation time per single trip is 12 h the total installation time using deployment method 2 is less than using method 1 for n 6 when installing from may to july despite the lift off from barge is riskier with lower allowable sea states than the lowering operation the waiting time for lift off from barge using method 2 in the summer months may be shorter than the transportation time using deployment method 1 when the transportation distance is long with increasing n the accumulated transportation time dominates the total installation time for method 1 making this deployment method less preferable 4 4 3 influence of lift off allowable sea states on deployment method 2 it is observed from fig 12 that if 10 spools need to be installed in july the p50 total installation time is around 200 h when the transportation time is 6 h using both deployment methods for deployment method 1 the net installation time without waiting time is 180 h thus the potential to increase the installation efficiency using method 1 is limited since only a very short time around 10 is used for waiting on weather on the other hand the net installation time is only 72 h using deployment method 2 and more than 60 of the total installation time is for waiting on weather based on the current input therefore there is great potential to increase the efficiency if the waiting time using deployment method 2 can be reduced as discussed the waiting time is mainly caused by the low allowable sea states for the lift off from barge to increase the allowable sea states for the lift off from barge both passive and active methods have been proposed by karatas 2020 the active methods can incorporate winch control during lift off operation to prevent the occurrence of the re hit between the spool and the deck of the barge the active control requires the development of a reliable control algorithm the passive method on the other hand is proposed to use fenders between the spool and the deck during the operation the intention is to absorb the impact energy and reduce the potential re hit forces during lift off sensitivity studies were carried out to compare the influence of different fender properties on the allowable sea states by li et al 2020a fig 13 presents the allowable sea states for the lift off from barge including three different soft fender models in the previous study the allowable sea states for deck corresponds to the case directly lift off from the deck of the barge as listed in table 4 which are used in the weather window analysis in the previous sections as shown all three soft fender models can increase the allowable sea state for the critical lift off operation compared to the deck indicating the potential to reduce total installation time for deployment method 2 however the application of these fenders was only studied numerically and has not been validated in offshore operations so far thus for a conservative comparison the allowable sea states based on soft fender 2 are applied in the weather window analysis based on the results in fig 12 for transportation time of 6 h the total installation time using deployment method 2 with the selected soft fender is obtained and presented in fig 14 significant reductions in the total installation time using method 2 are observed especially for large n take n 10 as an example the total installation time using deployment method 2 in july reduces from around 200 h 120 h when using the soft fender instead of the deck fender among the total time the waiting time reduces from around 64 40 this proves the significant importance of increasing the allowable sea states for the lift off from barge operation if this improvement of allowable sea states can be applied in practice deployment method 2 is preferable especially when the project requires to install many spools in the same campaign 4 5 summary on the weather window analysis the comparison and sensitivity studies performed in this section reveal that the total installation time of the project depends on many parameters including the total number of spools the planned seasons the distance from harbor to the offshore site and the allowable sea states of the critical activities these parameters in turn are relevant to choosing the deployment method the deployment method 1 shows a great advantage compared to deployment method 2 when the transportation distance is short or when the total number of spools is less than 10 with increased distance this advantage is more noticeable when the project is planned to be carried out in non summer months the long waiting time for deployment method 2 due to very low allowable sea states for lift off from barge results in much longer total installation however for longer transportation distance deployment method 2 becomes more beneficial given that the use of feeding barges increases the availability of the construction vessel at the offshore location compared to method 1 moreover it is also observed that for both methods the waiting on weather time accounts for a large percentage of the total installation time this is because of the low allowable sea states for the critical activities i e the lift off from barge and the lowering through splash zone it is crucial to increase the allowable sea states by improving the installation method or equipment one possible way to increase the allowable sea states for the lift off from barge using fenders is discussed the use of the soft fender can increase the averaged allowable h s from around 1 11 m 1 35 m resulting in around 24 decrease of the waiting time for a whole project to install 10 spools in july thus to further reduce the installation total time efforts should be made to increase the operational limits for the critical activities this study is focused on the comparison of the total installation time which determines the renting cost of the construction vessel the cost of the barges in this case is assumed secondary however if the project needs to install many spools for example 15 spools with long transportation distance multiple barges may be needed this is to ensure that the construction vessel performs the deployment task whenever weather permits without waiting for the feeding barge in this case the renting cost of multiple barges for deployment method 2 should be considered when comparing with deployment method 1 therefore in the real engineering projects the choice of deployment methods should consider all these aspects in the planning phase 5 concluding remarks this paper studies and compares two deployment methods for multiple spool installations the objective is to provide suggestions for the selection of installation methods in the planning phase the main approach applied is to perform comprehensive weather window analysis to quantify the total installation time for the two methods using 50 years hindcast data the input for the weather window analysis is based on practical installation procedure whereas the allowable sea states for critical activities are obtained from numerical methods using time domain simulations it is found that the allowable sea states for the critical activities are in general low for the large spool deployment the chosen offshore site for the weather window analysis is close to an existing offshore field in the barents sea the wave condition shows large yearly and seasonal variations indicating the uncertainties in the weather window analysis statistical values of the total installation time corresponding to 50 non exceedance are used for comparison of different installation cases the influences of the total number of spools the transportation time and the allowable sea states of critical activities on the total installation time are discussed in detail it is concluded that deployment method 1 gives lower installation time when the transportation distance is short or when the total number of spools is less than 10 for a longer distance when the transportation distance doubles deployment method 2 becomes more beneficial in the summer months for a large number of spools the use of the soft fender for lift off from barge can increase the averaged allowable h s and thus significantly decrease the waiting time for deployment method 2 however the choice of deployment method also depends on other factors such as vessel availability project schedule and other practical issues the results from this study can be used as a reference for decision making in the early planning phase of the project moreover the methodology applied in this study including numerical methods weather window analysis and sensitivity

20657,the demand for subsea spool deployment is increasing with the expansion of offshore projects for a project to install multiple spools different deployment methods can be used the choice of method may influence the safety and the total cost of the project thus it is important to evaluate different deployment methods in the planning phase this study addresses weather window analysis of two deployment methods for large subsea spools the purpose is to compare the efficiency of the two methods in terms of total installation time for projects with different numbers of spools numerical modeling and time domain simulations of the critical activities are carried out the simulations together with the operational criteria provide the allowable sea states which are the key input for weather window analysis hindcast data from a site in the barents sea are used for weather window analysis the total installation time is compared for various months different total numbers of spools and transportation durations the influence of the possible increase of the allowable sea states for the critical activity on the total installation time is also evaluated through the comparative studies recommendations to select the proper deployment method for different situations are provided keywords subsea spool deployment weather window analysis lift off from barge splash zone lowering 1 introduction there are increasing challenges in the installation of subsea structures in recent years larger and heavier subsea structures are being installed in harsh environments and in deep waters deployment of subsea structures using offshore cranes is a weather sensitive operation and may account for significant downtime in the whole installation project dnvgl 2016 these operations affect the installation costs for a subsea field development and thus can directly impact the overall capital expenditure careful planning with sophisticated analysis is an important prerequisite for safe execution of the installations lifting operations are weather restricted operations for which operational limits need to be established during the planning phase dnvgl 2014 for practical use the operational limits are often expressed in terms of environmental conditions or motions that can be monitored on board the installation vessel li 2016 and guachamin acero et al 2016 described a general methodology to establish the operational limits using response based criteria the operational limits in terms of allowable sea states are obtained by fulfilling the criteria that the characteristic value of the governing response is less than the design capacity the methodology is composed of the following six main steps 1 identification of potentially critical events 2 numerical modeling of operational activities 3 identification of critical events and limiting parameters 4 calculation of characteristic dynamic responses 5 evaluation of the allowable limits 6 assessment of the operational limits examples of application of this methodology and assessment of operational limits can be found in the published literature li et al 2016 gao et al 2016 guachamin acero 2016 verma et al 2019 among the steps to establish operational limits numerical modelling and analysis are of great importance to estimate the critical dynamic responses many studies have been performed to estimate the characteristic responses of various lifting activities including lift off operations graczyk and sandvik 2012 karatas 2020 over boarding li et al 2020 lifting through the splash zone bunnik et al 2006 sarkar and gudmestad 2010 næss et al 2014 amer 2020 heavy lift operations cha et al 2010 zhu et al 2017 acero et al 2017 and mating operations jiang et al 2018 verma et al 2019 due to the complex environmental loading with transient dynamic effects of the lifting system during the operation the prediction of the motions and loads is a challenging task the state of the art approach is to perform time domain simulations of the installation system including the vessel the lifted object structure the hoisting system and other coupling elements between these components for different critical phases of the lifting operation the focus on the analysis also varies for example accurate implementation of the hydrodynamic coefficients is essential for structures that experience high slamming loads during the splash zone crossing molin 2011 such as subsea template and grp covers solaas et al 2017 on the other hand the control of the crane winch and the tugger lines may dominate the motions for lift off and mating operations ren et al 2018 thus different methods should be considered when establishing the operational limits for complex operations for operations dominated by wave motions the allowable sea states can be obtained in terms of significant wave height h s and spectral wave period t p uncertainties in the allowable sea states also need to be evaluated to provide safety margins natskår et al 2015 guachamin acero and li 2018 the allowable sea states and weather forecasts provide the basis for the decision making during the execution of the operation in the planning phase the installation procedure allowable sea states and site conditions serve as input for operability and weather window analysis the operability and weather window analysis are useful to size equipment select installation vessel and optimize the installation method examples of operability and weather window analysis of various operations can be found o connor et al 2013 wu 2014 yang et al 2017 gintautas and sørensen 2017 subsea spool structures are important components in the subsea production systems to connect the pipe ends and the interconnecting facilities bai and bai 2005 spools must be designed to meet functional requirements including pressure temperature thermal expansion environmental loads and installation loads etc there are many studies in the literature focusing on different design aspects such as seismic design yasseri 2020 flow induced vibrations lu et al 2016 and tuned mass damper for vibration control zhang et al 2015 etc the design of the spools is not the emphasis of this study instead this study focuses on the deployment of subsea spools which refers to the phase to lift the spools from the deck of a vessel and lower them to the seabed the spools are normally deployed by offshore construction vessels with onboard cranes the whole installation can be in general divided into several phases parra 2018 the spool is firstly transported by a construction vessel or a feeding barge after lifted off from the deck of the vessel or the barge the spool is lowered through the splash zone the spool is then deeply submerged until it reaches the seabed finally the connections between the spool and the subsea equipment are carried out by remotely operated underwater vehicle rov the main critical activities are the lift off phase and the lowering through the splash zone which require careful numerical modeling and analysis because spools are getting larger and heavier lifting operations become more challenging and are often carried out in relatively low sea states in the summer seasons cosson et al 2018 aarset et al 2011 moreover with the expansion of offshore projects the number of spools that need to be installed in one project is also increasing due to increasing number of wells and redundant wells for production assurance yasseri and bahai 2018 to improve the safety and efficiency of spool installation a robust installation strategy needs to be established in the planning phase this study aims to tackle one of the challenges faced by marine contractors on the choice of deployment method for large subsea spools two deployment methods are compared by weather window analysis the analysis is based on the installation procedure the allowable sea states and the hindcast data at the reference site the total installation time using the two deployment methods is compared for various practical installation situations this paper first describes the two deployment methods followed by numerical methods to derive allowable sea states then weather window analysis results and discussions on the comparative studies are presented finally the conclusions and recommendations from this study are given 2 description of two deployment methods 2 1 deployment method 1 transportation and deployment with construction vessel a common method for installation of subsea spools involves only one construction vessel this method is considered efficient when the number of spools to be installed is small for example less than 5 the main activities for the whole installation are summarized in table 1 four main activity groups are required to install one spool here one activity group refers to a series of activities that cannot be split or interrupted once the weather condition deteriorates activity group no 2 summarized as preparation and deployment includes cutting sea fastening lift off the spool from its own deck over boarding and lowering the spool through the splash zone until it is landed on the target location on the seabed the lowest allowable limits of sea states among these activities should be used as the operational limits for this activity group once the deployment is finished and the lifting gear has been recovered a final survey will be carried out by an rov the most critical activity that determines the allowable sea states for activity group no 2 is lowering the spool through the splash zone where the hydrodynamic loads on the spool may cause unacceptable responses due to large non linearities of the lowering process time domain simulations are required which will be detailed in sec 3 after the first spool is installed the activity groups no 1 4 need to be repeated to install n spools in this case the construction vessel needs to sail back and forth to pick up new spools and deploy them one by one the number of trips back and forth between the harbor and the offshore site is the same as the number of spools which is denoted as n 2 2 deployment method 2 transportation with feeding barge and deployment with construction vessel if the number of spools to be installed is large for example over 10 spools and the distance between the harbor and the offshore site is long then deployment method 1 may not be efficient this is because a large amount of time is spent on transportation an offshore construction vessel is equipped with specialized equipment onboard to perform complex installation tasks and the day rate for such a vessel is much more costly than feeding barges with similar size therefore it may be more beneficial to employ feeding barges to transport the spools while the construction vessel stays at the offshore site to perform the deployment activities thus this deployment method 2 employs one construction vessel and at least one feeding barge it should be mentioned that this study deals with installation of large spools whose shape is usually complex with large horizontal dimensions see fig 1 thus it is only possible to transport one spool using conventional offshore construction vessels or feeding barges per trip the main activities for the whole installation using deployment method 2 are summarized in table 2 the transportation and installation of the first spool is carried out by the construction vessel for the second and the remaining spools the transportation is carried out by one or more feeding barges while the construction vessel is positioned at the offshore site to continue the deployment table 2 only shows the activities that involve the construction vessel the transportation of spools using a feeding barge is carried out in parallel to the activities at the offshore site for example while installing the first spool the barge is transporting the second spool the second spool should arrive at the offshore site by the time the rov survey for the first spool is completed once the weather permits the preparation for lift off of the second spool from the barge will initiate after the lift off the construction vessel will continue with the deployment while the barge sails back to the harbor to pick up a new spool in this way this method avoids mobilization of the construction vessel going back and forth between the harbor and the offshore site when many spools are required to be installed the most critical activity for deployment method 2 is the lift off from barge which is included in activity group no 4 compared to lift off from the own deck of the construction vessel using deployment method 1 the installation system experiences more dynamics due to the relative motions between the barge and the vessel reducing the allowable sea states for lift off from barge moreover the allowable sea states for lift off from barge are lower than lowering the spool through the splash zone see sec 3 3 which is the critical activity for deployment method 1 this indicates that long waiting on weather time may be expected for lift off activity using deployment method 2 although the deployment method 2 seems to be more efficient the current industrial projects hesitate to apply this method due to two main reasons first the number of spools to be installed in one project in the past was often relatively low second the allowable sea states for lift off from barge are too low which results in the waiting time for deployment method 2 even longer than the transportation time in most seasons these two aspects may limit the application of deployment method 2 for many marine contractors however with the expansion of offshore industry there is a need for installing more spools within a project the location of some offshore sites is moving further away from the shore increasing the transportation time moreover new measures can be implemented to potentially increase the allowable sea states for the lift off from barge the above aspects will be considered later when comparing the efficiency of the two deployment methods 3 numerical methods and assessment of operational limits because of the complexity of the multi body dynamic systems experiencing hydrodynamic loadings simplified frequency domain analysis can hardly be used to predict the motion responses under irregular waves thus numerical analyses using time domain methods are required to estimate the motions of the system for critical activities as discussed in sec 2 the critical activities for the two deployment methods are lowering the spool through the splash zone and lift off from barge this section will discuss the numerical models used to estimate the responses and the methods to assess the allowable seas states for these two activities 3 1 system description the installation system contains the construction vessel the feeding barge for deployment method 2 only the subsea spool and the hoisting system the construction vessel is equipped with a crane with a maximum lift capacity of 400 tons the feeding barge is a conventional barge capable to operate in the north sea the barge has a sufficient deck area to transport large subsea spools the main dimensions of the construction vessel and the feeding barge are given in table 3 the subsea spool has a large horizontal dimension and is composed of different sections of tubular members fig 1 presents the side and top views of the spool piece where the horizontal position of the center of gravity cog is highlighted the large horizontal dimension of the spool makes it challenging for the lifting operation a reinforcement pipe is attached to limit compression of the spool and thus the structural failure during the deployment can be avoided the reinforcement pipe is assumed rigidly connected to the termination heads the total mass of the spool and the reinforcement pipe is 45 2 tons the hoisting system for the spool lifting operation includes the slings the lifting wire and the winch the slings connect the spool to the hook and the lifting wire connects the hook and the crane due to the large horizontal dimension of the spool structure seven slings are arranged to distribute the loads on the spool the locations of the seven slings on the spool are shown in fig 1 3 2 numerical methods the detailed numerical models and methods for the two critical activities i e the lowering through the splash zone and the lift off from barge have been studied in detail and published in li et al 2020a 2020b given that the objective of this study is to compare the efficiency of two deployment methods the numerical methods are briefly discussed here 3 2 1 lift off from barge when using deployment method 2 the spool is initially resting on the feeding barge during lift off the hoisting system lifts the spool off from the deck of the barge before lowering it through the splash zone the configuration of the installation system for the lift off operation is illustrated in fig 2 for this activity hydrodynamic loads on the vessel and the feeding barge need to be calculated it should be noted that hydrodynamic interactions between the barge and vessel are considered in the numerical analysis because they are in close vicinity during the lift off operation the hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained using the panel method program dnv 2010 in the frequency domain in comparison with a single vessel standalone the interactions are found to mainly influence the hydrodynamic coefficients of the feeding barge in roll sway and yaw directions parra 2018 the wire couplings through the seven slings and the lifting wire are modeled as linear springs the flexibility of the spool is considered and distributed among the flexibility of the seven slings moreover tugger lines are often used in the spool lifting operation to constrain the horizontal motions of the spool in the current model yaw stiffness has been added to the spool for simplicity to represent the restoring forces from tugger lines the spools are often supported directly on the deck of the barge during transportation thus the contact between the spool and the deck is steel to steel contact during lift off if re hit happens between the deck and the spool the re hit forces may be substantial due to the high stiffness of the deck contact karatas 2020 as an alternative retractable supporting units can be incorporated to support the spool once the spool is lifted the supports will be retracted to avoid re hit however these retractable supporting units need to be designed for this particular purpose and thus the installation cost may be increased in the numerical model the deck fenders are modeled using fender couplings each fender coupling includes a fender point and a fender plane which provides friction force and compression forces when the two bodies have contact see li et al 2020a for details stiffness and damping properties based on the steel to steel contact are specified in this study six fender points are modeled the forces on those fender points during lift off are calculated to assess the operational limits the numerical model was established in sima simo software sintef ocean 2020 and the top view of the model is shown in fig 3 3 2 2 splash zone lowering the second critical activity is the lowering of the spool through the splash zone for deployment method 1 this activity is performed after lift off from own deck and over boarding of the spool to the side of the construction vessel for deployment method 2 the barge will move away from the construction vessel after the lift off from barge followed by the lowering through the splash zone fig 4 shows the layout of the system for the lowering activity in this case the hydrodynamic properties of the vessel alone should be used without interaction with the barge the modeling of the hoisting system is the same as for the lift off operation the challenge in the numerical modeling of the lowering activity is to properly estimate the hydrodynamic forces on the spool when it crosses the splash zone depth dependent added mass and damping coefficients need to be considered for the spool sections experiencing changing positions with respect to the instantaneous free surface moreover the kinematics of the fluid where the spool sections are lowered are disturbed by the vessel motions this is denominated as shielding effects from the vessel when the lifted object is close to the vessel the response amplitude operators raos of the disturbed wave kinematics with respect to undisturbed wave elevation in the frequency domain can be obtained these raos depend on the wave periods and wave direction and vary with locations they are implemented in the time domain to calculate the instantaneous fluid kinematics which are applied to obtain the wave loads on the spool sections using morison s formula a detailed implementation of the shielding effects and sensitivity studies refers to li et al 2020b 3 2 3 time domain simulations responses analyses are performed for the established numerical models to solve the corresponding equations of the motion the model for lift off from barge consists of 21 degrees of freedom dofs in total the construction vessel the barge and the spool are modeled with 6 dofs whereas the hook is modeled with 3 dofs the model for the lowering operation consists of 15 dofs step by step integration method is applied to solve the coupled equations of motion using newmark beta numerical integration with a time step of 0 02 s the lifting wire is paid in with a speed of 0 5 m s during lift off and is paid out with a speed of 0 1 m s during lowering operation both the lift off and the lowering operations are transient processes with nonlinear dynamic loads simulations using different irregular wave realizations are required to account for the variability of waves thus enough wave seeds for the time domain simulations are important to provide statistics to assess operational limits the influences of the seed number on the allowable sea states using different total wave seed numbers were studied in li et al 2020b moreover for lift off operation the wave seeds must be selected to exclude the unreasonable wave seeds that do not fulfill the judgement of the crane operators in the real operation before assessing the operational limits this is done by checking the relative motion between the crane tip and the deck of the barge shortly after lift off this relative motion should increase within a defined short period after the activation of the winch li et al 2020a the wave seeds that do not fulfill such requirement are excluded the wave realizations for the time domain simulations are generated based on jonswap joint north sea wave project spectrum considering short crested seas dnvgl 2017 3 3 assessment of operational limits 3 3 1 operational criterion based on the recommended practice dnvgl 2016 the potential critical events that limit the lift off from barge and the corresponding criteria are as follows 1 potential snap loads in the slings the dynamic load capacity dlc of the sling should not be exceeded based on practical sling properties the dlc of the sling is 318 8 kn 2 slack wire condition for slings the criterion for the slack sling condition is that the minimum dynamic tension in any of the slings during the operation should be larger than zero 3 re hit of the spool against the supporting deck here re hit shall mean the event in which the object hits the supporting deck after any lift attempt the static fender force on the spool is 145 2 kn for the initial condition when the spool is rested on the deck thus this criterion requires that the re hit force on the spool at any fender locations should be lower than the static force for the lowering operation the above criteria 1 and 2 on snap loads and slack wire condition should also be fulfilled besides the lowering operation also requires considering the following critical event and criterion 4 collision between the spool and the vessel minimum clearance between the spool and the vessel should be maintained during the lowering process according to dnvgl 2016 3m is used as the minimum clearance criterion in the assessment of allowable sea states for the spool lowering process due to the large horizontal dimensions of the spool a small rotational motion of the spool may cause large vertical displacements at the end of the spool this can lead to possible high re hit forces during lift off and possible slack wire and snap loads in the slings during both lift off and lowering processes thus the activities studied here are very sensitive to wave conditions when searching for the allowable sea states the above criteria should be fulfilled simultaneously for the corresponding activity the assessment is carried out by comparing the selected statistical values of dynamic responses obtained from each wave condition with the limiting values from the criteria the sea states that fulfill these criteria are considered as allowable sea states 3 3 2 allowable sea states based on the numerical analysis and the operational criteria the operational limits in terms of allowable sea state parameters h s and t p have been obtained for the two critical activities the allowable sea states are sensitive to different parameters including sea state descriptions such as wave spectral type wave direction wave spreading and wave components numerical methods such as the method to calculate hydrodynamic forces and inclusion of shielding effects and statistical methods the fitted distribution model of critical responses and the percentile to choose the extreme responses other factors such as time domain integration methods time step and seed numbers will also introduce uncertainties to the dynamic responses and thus the derived allowable sea states many studies have been devoted to quantifying uncertainties in the allowable sea state assessment for various operations guachamin acero and li 2018 li et al 2021 for complex operations relying on time domain simulations the quantification of the uncertainties requires comprehensive sensitivity studies the uncertainties of the lowering operation of the spool were studied in li et al 2020b fig 5 presents one example of the comparisons on the allowable sea states with and without shielding effects it can be seen that the allowable sea states are sensitive to the shielding effects and the spreading index for short crested waves a detailed discussion on the comparison of sea states with and without shielding effects refers to li et al 2020b in this paper the study on uncertainties in the allowable sea states will not be discussed in detail here the allowable sea states corresponding to the most realistic cases are chosen based on the previous work by li et al 2020a 2020b and applied in the weather window analysis see table 4 as shown in the table the allowable h s for lift off from barge are substantially lower than those for the lowering operation as mentioned in sec 2 2 the low allowable sea states for lift off from barge may result in long waiting on weather for deployment method 2 4 weather window analysis weather window analysis is performed to evaluate the operability and efficiency of the two deployment methods it is important to choose the potential months with minimum total installation time to reduce the costs often the project duration lasts for weeks to months and the weather conditions for the planned project period are unpredictable thus weather window analysis using hindcast data from the past years is often adopted to estimate the total installation time 4 1 wave conditions the hindcast wave data of one reference site at the barents sea is chosen for the weather window analysis in this study the coordinate of this site is 72 02 n 22 1 e with water depth of around 350 m and it is southeast of the johan carlsberg field the hindcast data are from the norwegian reanalysis archive 10 km nora10 database providing wind and sea states characteristics every 3 h from september 1957 to the present reistad et al 2011 the nora10 hindcast data have been widely used in the planning phase of different offshore activities and were validated against offshore measurement data bruserud and haver 2016 50 year wave data from 1961 to 2010 are applied in this study the hindcast data provide h s t p and wave direction for the total sea the wind sea and the swell sea the yearly and seasonal variations of the wave heights for this site are firstly investigated fig 6 presents the averaged maximum and minimum monthly mean h s the mean h s values for individual years are also presented in general higher mean h s values occur in the winter months from october to march than those in the summer season from april to september often it is preferable to perform offshore installations in the summer months for weather sensitive operations to reduce the risks and installation costs however for many occasions due to challenges of the project schedule vessel availability and other practical issues the installations may need to be carried out in winter in this case the planning of the installation activities must be devised to ensure the safety of the operations by considering measures to increase the operational sea states and to make robust contingency plans from fig 6 a large yearly variation of the mean monthly h s values is also observed the variabilities are also larger in the winter months than those in the summer months even in the summer months the differences between maximum and minimum mean h s are larger than 0 8 m representing large uncertainties this indicates the importance to perform weather window analysis based on a large database of wave conditions to provide reliable statistics of the installation time for a given site for an operation with sequential activities waiting on weather often happens before executing the weather sensitive activities with low operational limits the lowering operation for deployment method 1 and the lift off operation for deployment method 2 have the lowest allowable sea states with h s limits between 1 m to 2 5 m as shown in table 4 three h s limits based on the averaged allowable h s values from table 4 are used to study the weather windows by simply comparing the hindcast total h s values with these selected limits fig 7 presents the empirical cumulative distribution functions cdf of the weather window durations for selected h s limits based on 50 years data as expected the duration of the weather windows reduce significantly as the h s limit decreases the duration of the weather window is in general shorter in february and longer in june or august moreover it is seen that the number of available windows for h s 2 m is higher than those for lower h s limits table 5 lists the average number of the weather windows per year and the average duration in hours shown in parentheses when h s limit is 1 m both the number of windows and the duration are in general lower than those with higher h s limits even in the summer months this low operability calls attention to the challenges of installing many spools using deployment method 2 when h s limit is 2 m the average duration of the weather windows in summer is longer than 100 h more than 4 days with around 4 5 windows of over 100 h on average each month potential operability of over 60 can be expected thus based on the site condition some preliminary results can be already obtained by only studying the hindcast data however to provide more extensive results weather window analysis based on both the hindcast data and operational limits for all activities should be carried out 4 2 input for two deployment methods the two deployment methods have been discussed in sec 2 here the key input for the two methods that will be used for the weather window analysis are summarized in table 6 and table 7 respectively the input includes activities reference period and allowable sea states for each activity group the reference period duration of each activity is based on the operational procedure of similar projects and includes contingency time the allowable sea states for the critical activities lowering operation for method 1 and lift off from barge for method 2 refer to the results given in table 4 for less sensitive operations including transportation and rov survey a constant h s limit of 3 m is used based on practical experiences for a total number of n spools the net installation time without any waiting on weather is also given in the tables it is seen that the net installation time is lower using method 2 for n 1 because feeding barges are used to transport the spools instead of the construction vessel 4 3 estimating the total installation time weather window analysis using hindcast data can estimate the total installation time for different total number of spools using two deployment methods here the total installation time for the defined installation task corresponds to the duration of installing all spools including the time for all activities listed in table 6 and table 7 and the time of waiting on weather normally during the planning phase the starting time of the project is decided and the vessel will be rented from the predetermined date until the completion of the whole project if the weather condition is not suitable waiting time before and between the activities is expected and should be accounted for in the total time which reflects the total cost for renting the vessels the weather windows for each activity group can be identified based on the hindcast wave data time history for activities that are only limited by h s a direct comparison of the allowable h s with hindcasted total h s is performed for the critical activities with allowable limits in terms of both h s and t p the allowable h s for each hindcasted t p is firstly calculated and then compared with the hindcasted h s a detailed description of the weather window analysis can refer to guachamin acero et al 2016 it should be mentioned that the required weather window for each activity must be identified in sequence based on the installation procedure and their respective duration with the identified weather windows for each activity group the waiting time between these windows is also found by counting the hours from the starting time to the completion of all the activities to install n spools the total installation time is thus obtained such analysis is repeated for changing n using two deployment methods and the results are discussed in the next section 4 4 results and discussions to obtain sufficient sample data of the total installation time for different months weather window analysis for each installation case is repeated daily assuming that the starting time for the installation is at 0 h each day this setup ensures a 24 h difference between the starting time of each analysis and thus reduces the correlation between the sample data of the total installation time take april as an example if the operation is planned to start in april a sample size of 30 by assuming the installation starts at each day in april for the total installation time can be obtained using the hindcast data for a given year based on this sample data an empirical cdf function for this year can be established by repeating the weather window analysis using 50 years hindcast data a total sample of 1500 total installation time for this month can be generated 4 4 1 comparison of total installation time fig 8 compares the empirical cdf of the total installation time starting at three different months for each subfigure the empirical cdf functions based on yearly data are displayed together strong yearly variations of the distributions are observed for all selected three months which are consistent with the variation of the wave conditions as illustrated in fig 6 the scattering of the distributions in fig 8 reduces from february to june with reduced total installation time this is because the waves become less severe in the summer months two total numbers of spools n 2 and 10 are compared in fig 8 when the spool number increases from 2 to 10 the spread of the yearly empirical distribution increases greatly for all three months more activities need to be carried out to complete the installation task when n increases which demands more weather windows meanwhile the waiting time between the weather windows also increases and introduces larger yearly deviations moreover the limited sample size of each month annually for example 30 data in april each year also introduces large uncertainties in the empirical cdf which contributes to the large spread of the results to further illustrate the statistical uncertainties due to the size of the sample data fig 9 presents the empirical cdf of the total installation time for deployment method 1 in april for n 2 using 5 years and 10 years hindcast data as input respectively when using 5 years hindcast as input the total 50 years data are divided into 10 sets of 5 years the same applies when using 10 years input data the empirical cdf using different sets are presented together to show the spreading of the distributions compared to fig 8 a the scattering of the empirical cdf narrows down significantly with the increasing length of the input data taking the values corresponding to 50 of the cdf as an example the range of the values reduces from 36 208 hours based on yearly pdf to 36 54 and 39 51 hours based on 5 years and 10 years pdf respectively thus it is evident that a longer input hindcast data provides more reliable estimate of the statistic values however it is difficult to suggest a minimum requirement of data because the problems are case dependent if limited hindcast data are available it is recommended to evaluate the uncertainties by statistical methods such as monte carlo simulations in this study to reduce the statistical uncertainties all 50 years hindcast data for each month are used for further analysis the empirical cdf using all hindcast data for three selected months are shown in fig 10 for n 2 case the repeated sample data with the same installation time are removed in the figure compared with the monthly empirical distributions in figs 8 and 9 a larger sample by including all 50 years results provides a more reliable and smoother distribution based on the installation procedure the installation time for two spools without any waiting time are 36 h and 24 h respectively for two deployment methods as shown in fig 10 a the probability of installing 2 spools without any waiting time is around 75 using deployment method 1 if the operation starts in june this probability drops to around 40 and 18 if the operation starts in april and february respectively the whole empirical distribution moves noticeably to the right hand side from june to february indicating a significant increase of the waiting time in the winter months a similar trend is observed for deployment method 2 as shown in fig 10 b however for the same target total installation time in the same month the probability of completing the operation using deployment method 2 is much less than that using method 1 this indicates a much longer waiting time using method 2 due to the lower allowable sea states of the lift off activity moreover the probabilities of completing the installation without any waiting time are also lower using method 2 and they are around 30 12 and 3 for june april and february respectively to discuss how the total installation time changes with the starting months the number of spools and the deployment methods the total installation time corresponding to the probability of 50 p50 and 90 p90 in the empirical distribution as indicated in fig 10 b are used for further comparison the monthly variation of the p50 total installation time for two deployment methods are compared in fig 11 as mentioned weather sensitive operations are often performed in the summer seasons from may to august to reduce waiting time and the installation costs here the results for january to april are also included to provide a wider overview on the monthly change of the installation duration as expected the installation time is much lower when the operation starts in may to august than in january to april for all presented cases in fig 11 when spool number n 2 deployment method 2 consumes much more hours compared to method 1 for all months however when the total number of spools increases to 10 a similar total installation time from may to july is observed among the two deployment methods this indicates that the extra waiting time due to the low allowable sea states of the lift off from barge using deployment method 2 is comparable to the transportation time of the construction vessel using deployment method 1 it is expected that if n or the transportation duration increases deployment method 2 may consume less installation time than method 1 in the summer months 4 4 2 sensitivity study on the total number of spools and transportation time weather window analysis for different n and different transportation durations has been carried out the p50 total installation time for n 2 to 15 with transportation time of 6 h and 12 h is compared in fig 12 four starting months from april to july are chosen for the comparisons when the transportation time is 6 h using deployment method 1 is more efficient for different n however the differences in time are very small for n 12 in may and july if the installation site is further away and longer transportation time is required deployment method 2 using feeding barge for transportation shows a great advantage when the transportation time per single trip is 12 h the total installation time using deployment method 2 is less than using method 1 for n 6 when installing from may to july despite the lift off from barge is riskier with lower allowable sea states than the lowering operation the waiting time for lift off from barge using method 2 in the summer months may be shorter than the transportation time using deployment method 1 when the transportation distance is long with increasing n the accumulated transportation time dominates the total installation time for method 1 making this deployment method less preferable 4 4 3 influence of lift off allowable sea states on deployment method 2 it is observed from fig 12 that if 10 spools need to be installed in july the p50 total installation time is around 200 h when the transportation time is 6 h using both deployment methods for deployment method 1 the net installation time without waiting time is 180 h thus the potential to increase the installation efficiency using method 1 is limited since only a very short time around 10 is used for waiting on weather on the other hand the net installation time is only 72 h using deployment method 2 and more than 60 of the total installation time is for waiting on weather based on the current input therefore there is great potential to increase the efficiency if the waiting time using deployment method 2 can be reduced as discussed the waiting time is mainly caused by the low allowable sea states for the lift off from barge to increase the allowable sea states for the lift off from barge both passive and active methods have been proposed by karatas 2020 the active methods can incorporate winch control during lift off operation to prevent the occurrence of the re hit between the spool and the deck of the barge the active control requires the development of a reliable control algorithm the passive method on the other hand is proposed to use fenders between the spool and the deck during the operation the intention is to absorb the impact energy and reduce the potential re hit forces during lift off sensitivity studies were carried out to compare the influence of different fender properties on the allowable sea states by li et al 2020a fig 13 presents the allowable sea states for the lift off from barge including three different soft fender models in the previous study the allowable sea states for deck corresponds to the case directly lift off from the deck of the barge as listed in table 4 which are used in the weather window analysis in the previous sections as shown all three soft fender models can increase the allowable sea state for the critical lift off operation compared to the deck indicating the potential to reduce total installation time for deployment method 2 however the application of these fenders was only studied numerically and has not been validated in offshore operations so far thus for a conservative comparison the allowable sea states based on soft fender 2 are applied in the weather window analysis based on the results in fig 12 for transportation time of 6 h the total installation time using deployment method 2 with the selected soft fender is obtained and presented in fig 14 significant reductions in the total installation time using method 2 are observed especially for large n take n 10 as an example the total installation time using deployment method 2 in july reduces from around 200 h 120 h when using the soft fender instead of the deck fender among the total time the waiting time reduces from around 64 40 this proves the significant importance of increasing the allowable sea states for the lift off from barge operation if this improvement of allowable sea states can be applied in practice deployment method 2 is preferable especially when the project requires to install many spools in the same campaign 4 5 summary on the weather window analysis the comparison and sensitivity studies performed in this section reveal that the total installation time of the project depends on many parameters including the total number of spools the planned seasons the distance from harbor to the offshore site and the allowable sea states of the critical activities these parameters in turn are relevant to choosing the deployment method the deployment method 1 shows a great advantage compared to deployment method 2 when the transportation distance is short or when the total number of spools is less than 10 with increased distance this advantage is more noticeable when the project is planned to be carried out in non summer months the long waiting time for deployment method 2 due to very low allowable sea states for lift off from barge results in much longer total installation however for longer transportation distance deployment method 2 becomes more beneficial given that the use of feeding barges increases the availability of the construction vessel at the offshore location compared to method 1 moreover it is also observed that for both methods the waiting on weather time accounts for a large percentage of the total installation time this is because of the low allowable sea states for the critical activities i e the lift off from barge and the lowering through splash zone it is crucial to increase the allowable sea states by improving the installation method or equipment one possible way to increase the allowable sea states for the lift off from barge using fenders is discussed the use of the soft fender can increase the averaged allowable h s from around 1 11 m 1 35 m resulting in around 24 decrease of the waiting time for a whole project to install 10 spools in july thus to further reduce the installation total time efforts should be made to increase the operational limits for the critical activities this study is focused on the comparison of the total installation time which determines the renting cost of the construction vessel the cost of the barges in this case is assumed secondary however if the project needs to install many spools for example 15 spools with long transportation distance multiple barges may be needed this is to ensure that the construction vessel performs the deployment task whenever weather permits without waiting for the feeding barge in this case the renting cost of multiple barges for deployment method 2 should be considered when comparing with deployment method 1 therefore in the real engineering projects the choice of deployment methods should consider all these aspects in the planning phase 5 concluding remarks this paper studies and compares two deployment methods for multiple spool installations the objective is to provide suggestions for the selection of installation methods in the planning phase the main approach applied is to perform comprehensive weather window analysis to quantify the total installation time for the two methods using 50 years hindcast data the input for the weather window analysis is based on practical installation procedure whereas the allowable sea states for critical activities are obtained from numerical methods using time domain simulations it is found that the allowable sea states for the critical activities are in general low for the large spool deployment the chosen offshore site for the weather window analysis is close to an existing offshore field in the barents sea the wave condition shows large yearly and seasonal variations indicating the uncertainties in the weather window analysis statistical values of the total installation time corresponding to 50 non exceedance are used for comparison of different installation cases the influences of the total number of spools the transportation time and the allowable sea states of critical activities on the total installation time are discussed in detail it is concluded that deployment method 1 gives lower installation time when the transportation distance is short or when the total number of spools is less than 10 for a longer distance when the transportation distance doubles deployment method 2 becomes more beneficial in the summer months for a large number of spools the use of the soft fender for lift off from barge can increase the averaged allowable h s and thus significantly decrease the waiting time for deployment method 2 however the choice of deployment method also depends on other factors such as vessel availability project schedule and other practical issues the results from this study can be used as a reference for decision making in the early planning phase of the project moreover the methodology applied in this study including numerical methods weather window analysis and sensitivity studies can also be applied for similar types of marine operations credit authorship contribution statement lin li conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft xinying zhu

20658,rovs remotely operated vehicles are playing an important role in installation construction and maintenance of subsea systems during operation rovs are usually connected to surface facilities through umbilical lines where the entire umbilical rov system is affected by vessel motions wave and current induced loads during the design process it is commonly assumed that the current profile that leads to the extreme response of an offshore structural system has a typical profile with a uniform direction however in deep water the variation of current direction along water depth becomes more apparent hence the effect of direction variation cannot be neglected when establishing the extreme current profile for deep water rov operation the study focuses on how to efficiently acquire the multidirectional extreme current profiles through a new multi round clustering method firstly static analysis of a typical deep water umbilical rov system was performed under thousands of multidirectional current profiles extracted from a database of one year continuously recorded ocean current different responses of the system such as rov offset umbilical lateral displacement and maximum tension in the umbilical were investigated and set as a benchmark for further process then a multi round clustering procedure using a modified maximum dissimilarity algorithm for rov operation was introduced and applied to extract the extreme multidirectional current profile more efficiently it is shown that the proposed multi round clustering methodology can be implemented efficiently and accurately in capturing the extreme vertical current profiles from a current database for rov operation in different working depths the study also showed that the effect of bottom current on deep water rov operation is more significant than the surface current therefore for rov operation in deep waters more precautions shall be made on the bottom current profiles keywords deep water extreme current profile rov clustering process umbilical most dissimilar algorithm 1 introduction rov remotely operated vehicle is an underwater vehicle which is connected to a surface facility by an umbilical line in rov operations the umbilical plays an important role since the transmission of data power hydraulic and electric signals between the rov and surface facility are performed through the umbilical wernli sr and christ 2014 the hydrodynamic loads greatly affect the motion of the umbilical and may induce a significant disturbance on the rov during the operation after the loss of an ultra deep water rov kaiko in 2003 momma et al 2004 several developments on rov structural design aspects have been made either by improving the numerical model of the flexible umbilical buckham et al 2004 gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 quan et al 2016 wang and sun 2015 or by redesigning the rov configuration to minimize the hydrodynamic loads bowen et al 2009 however one key design challenge which has not been studied in sufficient detail is the effect of multidirectional current for rov operation in deep water in structural analysis of an umbilical rov system the magnitude and direction of ocean current between the surface facility and the target operation location needs to be defined in a vertical current profile the horizontal speed and direction are defined at different depths from sea surface to the seabed in normal offshore engineering practice due to the absence of measurement data the vertical current profile is usually assumed to be unidirectional and follow a uniform linear slab or power profile bsi 2005 nowadays measurement data of current speed and direction exist for several locations around the world the data shows that for areas with water depth more than 1 km a multidirectional current becomes more prevalent shaffer et al 1995 sheinbaum et al 2007 thereby suggesting that the assumption of unidirectional current profile may be too severe furthermore forristall and cooper 1997 showed that the error due to the simplification of current profile as unidirectional cannot be neglected for flexible systems such as umbilical rov system since flexible structures are sensitive to the shape of vertical current profile therefore finding the extreme current profile i e the current profile corresponding to extreme response of the umbilical rov system where the rov may have to operate in is a challenging task in structural design of offshore structures several attempts have been made through statistical methods to capture an extreme vertical current profile in traditional procedure to capture the extreme current profile it is assumed that there is no dependency between current speeds at different depth in this case by utilizing the time series of current speed from a measurement database the extreme current speed for each depth is defined independently as a current speed with a certain exceedance percentile combining the extreme current speeds from each depth produces the extreme vertical current profile for certain exceedance percentile furthermore the extreme vertical current profile is assumed as a unidirectional profile by analyzing the data of ocean current at faroe shetland channel west of shetland islands jeans et al 2003 showed that this procedure leads to a misleading and very severe extreme current profile since the extreme speeds on different depths are unlikely to occur at the same time therefore to develop a more accurate extreme current profile through statistical analysis the correlation between the current speeds from different depth shall be maintained winterstein et al 2009 developed the conditional current analysis cca an improved statistical approach for establishing the extreme vertical current profile in cca method the traditional statistical approach of establishing extreme vertical current profile was modified by introducing turkstra load combination rule liu et al 2018 utilized the average conditional exceedance rate acer method to predict the extreme current profile in south china sea acer is another improved statistical approach for establishing extreme vertical current profile by utilizing the average conditional exceedance rate for certain time window and threshold in oceanography the empirical orthogonal function eof is proven as a useful methodology to analyze different aspects of ocean current davis 1976 edwards and seim 2008 preisendorfer and mobley 1988 forristall and cooper 1997 introduced the application of eof to capture the extreme vertical current profile for offshore structures in general in this case instead of treating the vertical current profile time series as a combination of current speed time series from different depths it is represented as a combination of several different current mode shapes multiplied by their corresponding time series of amplitude since the analysis is based on the current mode shapes the correlation of current speed between different depths is preserved in addition not all modes are required to create a good remake of the original time series of vertical current profile allowing for input parameter reduction in further statistical analysis in eof the extreme current profile can be constructed by performing inverse first order reliability method iform on the time series of amplitude for several dominant current mode shapes forristall and cooper 1997 in the past decades the clustering approach has gained popularity in oceanography liu and weisberg 2005 used self organizing map som on vertical current profile to study the ocean current variability in west florida shelf then they used the same approach to estimate the ocean current and sea surface at the same location liu and weisberg 2007 fereday et al 2008 used the k mean algorithm kma to study the atmospheric circulation in north atlantic european hamilton 2010 used the clustering procedure to define a set of typical wave spectra in the north west shelf of australia camus et al 2011 compared the performance of som kma and most dissimilar algorithm mda on characterizing the wave climate based on significant wave height mean period and mean direction shchekinova and kumkar 2015 used the clustering approach to define the high drifter area based on wind and current data for search and rescue purposes recently sonnewald et al 2019 applied the kma algorithm to define the global ocean dynamical region in term of finding the extreme current profile for offshore structure the simplest clustering method was presented by jeans et al 2012 which they referred as current profile characterization cpc in this method thousands of current profiles from the measurement data were grouped into a number of classes based on their shapes each class was represented by a vertical current profile and its number of occurrences the class representation that produced the largest response on the structure was determined as the extreme vertical current profile jeans et al 2012 claimed that the cpc method was more appropriate than eof because the eof required a large number of modes to adequately represent the original current time series however for a more refined vertical current profiles cpc also does not perform well due to the inefficient grouping procedure in other works by prevosto et al 2012 and jeans et al 2015 the same principle of cpc method was used with more advanced clustering techniques such as som kma and mda by using the advanced grouping techniques the total number of classes of vertical current profile can be optimized even for a refined vertical current profile though several techniques exist to predict the extreme vertical current profile during the design phase of deep water rovs the current profile is still traditionally assumed to follow a slab linear or uniform profile in an old rov study by nomoto and hattori 1986 a slab linear current profile was utilized to simulate the operation of dolphin 3k rov up to 3 km depth which was similar to the one adopted by webster and bowen 2003 for the study of abismo in a relatively new rov study by quan et al 2016 unidirectional and linear current profiles were used to test the rov system up to 3 5 km depth lubis et al 2021 combined the multidirectional current with randomly generated waves and vessel motion to study the dynamic response of an rov umbilical system though only one current profile was used in the simulation the existing methods to capture the extreme current profile are still not commonly used for structural response analysis of deep water rov systems due to the lack of ocean current data during the design phase of rov most of the existing rov structural response studies are also focused on addressing the effect of wave on its umbilical buckham et al 2003 driscoll et al 2000a 2000b khojasteh and kamali 2017 lubis et al 2021 quan et al 2016 hence the presented study tries to incorporate a more accurate representation of multidirectional extreme current profile for rov operation in deep water using a real ocean current dataset a modified version of the clustering procedure to capture the extreme current profile for the rov operation in a more efficient way referenced as multi round clustering method is introduced in this study the main aim of the study is to simulate a simplified rov umbilical system during a deep water operation under existing deep water ocean current dataset and to investigate the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed multi round clustering procedure in this study a real one year continuously recorded current data in the gulf of mexico and its statistical parameters were evaluated first then independent static simulations of umbilical rov system under the one year measured current data were performed and the time series record of the responses was analyzed extreme responses of the umbilical rov system and their corresponding characteristics were investigated eventually the multi round clustering method was applied to the current data and the predicted extreme current profiles were compared with those ones from one year time history simulations it is shown that the proposed approach can accurately and efficiently determine the extreme vertical current profile from the recorded data 2 multi round clustering method to determine extreme current profile in the clustering method different vertical current profiles are grouped based on their similarity or dissimilarity using advanced grouping techniques such as som kohonen 2001 kma hastie et al 2009 and mda kennard and stone 1969 the number of classes can be optimized som kma and mda are well established unsupervised clustering algorithms where it assumes that there is no priori information about the data classes som is a type of artificial neural network which uses the neighborhood function to produce a discrete representation of the input space of the training samples kma is a clustering technique that tries to minimize the mean of every class for each iteration of the clustering process mda is also a clustering technique but it uses the most dissimilar individual sample in the data to establish a set of classes for som kma and mda the grouping process as implemented by prevosto et al 2012 and jeans et al 2015 is started by calculating the dissimilarity between different individual vertical current profiles in the measurement data the formulation of dissimilarity between two individual current profiles strongly dictates the result of the clustering process in the previous clustering analysis for extreme current profile jeans et al 2015 only considered the information about the current magnitude and neglected the information about the current direction in each depth in other words they assumed all vertical current profiles in the measurement data as unidirectional in this case the dissimilarity between two vertical current profiles of a and b namely d a b was calculated using eq 1 1 m 1 m c a m c b m 2 d a b where c a m current speed of vertical current profile a at elevation m c b m current speed of vertical current profile b at elevation m m elevation index m 1 2 3 m m total number of elevations in this study the clustering methodology was improved by considering the directional information from the current dataset one way to account for the information about current direction in each elevation is by decomposing the current speed into two orthogonal components east west and north south components improving the unidirectional current dissimilarity concept introduced by jeans et al 2015 as shown in eq 1 the dissimilarity between two multidirectional current profiles of a and b now can be calculated using the euclidean distance of current speed on all depth from their two components which is mathematically presented in eq 2 2 m 1 m u a m e w u b m e w 2 m 1 m u a m n s u b m n s 2 d a b where d a b dissimilarity between vertical current profiles a and b u a m e w east west component of vertical current profile a at elevation m u b m e w east west component of vertical current profile b at elevation m u a m n s north south component of vertical current profile a at elevation m u b m n s north south component of vertical current profile b at elevation m eq 2 is a good tool as far as the dissimilarity between two different current profiles is based on their shapes and the mean direction of each current profile is concerned however eq 2 leads to a misleading dissimilarity if the mean direction is not important for instance fig 1 a illustrates a simple vertical current profile with two current magnitudes c1 and c2 in two directions θ1 and θ2 at two different elevations z1 and z2 fig 1 b shows the same vertical current profile from fig 1 a but rotated by an angle of β resulting a different mean direction using eq 2 the dissimilarity between the current profiles in fig 1 a and b is a non zero value but it is evident that both current profiles produce the same maximum static line tension and the same offset absolute value of horizontal displacements of an umbilical rov system therefore the two current profiles in fig 1 a and b should be grouped in the same class for cases where the current mean direction is not important e g when analysing induced tension in the umbilical line or absolute displacement of the rov the overall orientation of two compared current profiles a and b should be aligned first before calculating the dissimilarity between them this can be done by restricting the vertical current profile a and rotating current profile b with an aligned angle of α the final aligned angle of α is the angle used to rotate the current profile b to get smallest directional dissimilarity to the vertical current profile a hence the dissimilarity between vertical current profiles a and b da b is mathematically calculated using eq 3 in this case it is better to represent the current profiles as a series of current speeds c and directions θ on every considered depth instead of working with east west ue w and north south un s components to avoid exhausting computational process to ensure that each current speed from the considered depth has an equal importance the difference in the current magnitude is normalized by mc m while the difference in direction is normalized by 2π by dividing the euclidian distance with the square root of 2m the value of d a b is set in the range of 0 and 1 3 d a b min d a b α where 4 m 1 m c a m c b m m c m 2 m 1 m min 2 π δ θ a b m α δ θ a b m α 2 π 2 d a b α 1 2 m 5 δ θ a b m α θ a m θ b m α f o r π α π 6 m c m max c 1 m c n m min c 1 m c n m and d a b α dissimilarity between vertical current profiles a and b for given α c current speed θ current direction α aligned angle n current profile index n 1 2 3 n n total number of current profiles the relation between da b α and α is nonlinear therefore finding α that gives the minimum da b α is not a simple process da b can be found by varying α in the range of π and π an optimization algorithm can be used to speed up the process for n number of vertical current profiles the size of dissimilarity matrix d is n x n in addition d is a symmetric matrix with all diagonal components equal to zero using mda the vertical current profile representation of a class is directly selected from the most dissimilar vertical current profile in the dataset on the opposite som and kma utilize the mean of the class to establish their representative vertical current profile however when the dissimilarity is defined by eq 3 finding the mean in the vertical current profile class is not a straightforward process since α differs for each pair of vertical current profile in the class therefore in this study only the mda grouping technique is modified to capture the multidirectional current profile besides modifying the dissimilarity matrix the clustering steps are also adjusted for structural analysis of rov umbilical system in the previous applications the extreme current profile is directly defined after the clustering process by performing structural response on each class representation in this case a large number of classes should be utilized to ensure the homogeneity of each class in this paper a modified clustering approach is proposed and referred as multi round clustering methodology the basic idea behind the multi round clustering is to repeat the clustering several times and search for the extreme vertical current profile only within the promising class in each round of clustering unnecessary classes in each step will be eliminated fig 2 shows the flowchart of the proposed multi round clustering method and its main steps are as follows 1 the dissimilarity between each current profile in the data set is calculated using eq 3 2 mda is utilized to group n number of vertical current profile into p number of classes where p n 3 the umbilical rov static analysis is performed only for the representative vertical current profiles in each class i e only p static analyses in total 4 the winning class is the class with the largest static umbilical rov response 5 steps 2 thru 4 are repeated on the winning class in step 4 for another clustering round to refine the winning class this will be repeated until the total number of the current profiles in the winning class is less than the predefined number of classes p in the multi round clustering method each clustering round is utilized to filter the dataset to find the extreme vertical current profile compared to the common clustering in finding extreme current profile the multi round clustering can start with smaller number of classes and has a higher possibility on catching the real extreme vertical current profile in the dataset 3 one year ocean current data two one year continuous current data measurement collected in the gulf of mexico were used in this study the data were acquired from two different locations namely as l4 and l6 with the deepest depth of 3 35 km and 3 62 km respectively in each location the measurements were performed using combination of two different types of devices current meter and acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the current speeds were measured at 49 and 90 different depths in l4 and l6 locations respectively more information about l4 and l6 data measurement can be found in the reports by donohue et al 2006 and sheinbaum et al 2007 respectively due to the finer vertical current profile and deeper depth the results presented in this paper were mainly focused on the l6 location the l6 database includes time history of recorded current speeds for 11 359 time intervals hourly averaged data for more than a year at 90 different depth elevations table 1 shows a brief summary of the measurement elevations at l6 location three of these depth ranges have finer intervals between the measurement points and therefore more detailed current profile is expected from these three depth ranges fig 3 shows the time history of vertical current profile in l6 location with 11 359 hourly readings from 90 different depths the current data was decomposed into east west and the north south components in fig 3 a and b respectively the x axis shows the time in hours the y axis indicates the water depth which was set to zero at the mean surface level and the color indicates the speed and direction of the current fig 3 indicates strong multidirectional and multilayer current profile for deep water in some particular time intervals for example around t 4 000 h the surface current strongly blows to the south west while around the bottom elevation the current moves toward north east in general the surface current speed is stronger than the bottom one the correlation of current speed between different elevations was determined utilizing the time history of east west and north south components the correlation coefficient of time history of speed at elevation i to time history of speed at elevation j was calculated using eq 7 7 ρ u i u j cov u i u j var u i var u j n 1 n u n i u i u n j u j n 1 n u n i u i 2 n 1 n u n j u j 2 where u i n current component east west or north south at elevation i and time interval n i j elevation index where i or j 1 2 m u i u j time average of current speed at elevation i and j fig 4 shows the contour plot of correlation coefficients between different elevations for east west fig 4a and north south fig 4b components both axes indicate the water depth from the surface elevation 0 0 m coordinate to the seabed 3 5 3 5 km coordinate in general the correlation coefficient of any location in the first depth range 40 m to 350 m to any location from the other depth range is less than 0 6 however the correlation between any location inside the first depth range is larger than 0 6 ρ u i u j 0 6 is also observed between locations in the depth range of 700 m to 3 340 m moreover ρ u i u j 0 9 is observed between elevations in the depth range of 1 400 m to 3 340 m based on the correlation coefficient plots in fig 4 it can be concluded that there is a multilayer pattern in the current profile at l6 location this implies that the maximum current speed at the surface layer may not occur in the same time instance and direction as the maximum current speed at the bottom layer therefore assuming a slab current profile that utilizes simultaneous maximum current speeds in all elevations can lead to very conservative response of the structure mainly for deep water locations 4 umbilical rov model in reality the rov will manoeuvre within a certain radius from its initial point while the current load may also push the rov away from its initial point in this study the initial point was defined as the position of rov with no environmental load the target location may be located far from the rov location after being displaced by the current load in this case the rov thrusters can be utilized to move it towards the desired location usually the most important umbilical rov responses for safe operation of the system in deep waters are the lateral and vertical movements of the rov namely rov horizontal and vertical offsets and the maximum tension in the umbilical line numerically the boundary condition of the rov end in an umbilical rov system under the current loads varies between free end with no thruster load and fixed end with maximum thruster load numerical simulation for all possible rov target locations and all thrust loading scenarios is prohibitive due to the large number of combinations therefore the umbilical rov study in this paper was simplified into two extreme conditions free end and fixed end models in both models the rov was directly connected to the ship using an umbilical which is commonly known as a free flying configuration wernli sr and christ 2014 the free end numerical model represents the rov operation close to the seabed with no activation of thrusters the bottom end of the umbilical where the rov is connected to was assumed to be displaced freely by the current load the displacement of the rov due to the current load was measured from the rov initial point in the fixed end model it was assumed that there is enough thrust load generated by the rov to stabilize and keep the rov in its initial location an example ultra deep water rov system was studied in this paper table 2 shows the specifications of the umbilical and rov for the numerical model both of the umbilical rov numerical models i e free end and fixed end models were created using orcaflex software orcina 2019 the umbilical in the orcaflex model was defined as a line discretized through a series of lumped masses and springs the axial stiffness of the spring was set equal to the axial stiffness of the umbilical in addition the bending stiffness was represented by rotational springs torsion and material damping were neglected more detail info about line element in orcaflex can be found in orcina 2019 in both models the top end of the umbilical was fixed at 8m above the mean sea level i e the vessel movements were ignored in the free end model the rov was simplistically represented as a 3d buoy with 3 translational dofs only in the fixed end model the bottom end of the umbilical i e rov location was fixed and hence did not contain any rov representation the effect of rov omission in the fixed end model on the tension along the umbilical was insignificant there were two sequential loading stages in all orcaflex simulations in the first loading stage the entire system was analyzed under its self weight only and then in the next stage the system was analyzed under the ocean current loading as per the l6 data set the changing rate of the current speed between hourly time intervals is low and hence there was no need for dynamic analysis of the system under current loading therefore the umbilical rov system was analyzed statically under each vertical current profile at a given time instance 5 rov operation in deep water under current loading in this paper the extreme vertical current profile is defined as the one leading to the largest response of the umbilical rov system among the one year current profile dataset the extreme vertical current profile was firstly determined based on response analysis of the actual umbilical rov system under the current loading for all recorded data it was a very time consuming process with thousands of simulations and the obtained results were used for determining the actual extreme responses of the system and its corresponding characteristics this approach also provided an insight into the general characteristic of the extreme vertical current profile for deep water rov operation the results were secondly used as the benchmark data for the assessment of multi round clustering analysis in this study two rov models free end and fixed end models were simulated for all the hourly current profiles as independent static loading i e one current profile for each time interval in the l6 data 11 359 current profiles were extracted from the l6 data and then both rov models were simulated independently under each of these current profiles in the free end model effect of the vertical current profile on rov vertical and lateral displacement was more pronounced as a result the extreme vertical current profile was determined by considering either the largest lateral or vertical displacement of the rov in the fixed end model the maximum tension in the umbilical was the main criteria to determine the extreme vertical current profile 5 1 rov displacement and maximum umbilical tension fig 5 a and fig 5b show the static time series results for the rov lateral and vertical displacement of the free end model respectively under multidirectional vertical current profiles fig 5c shows the time series result for maximum tension on the umbilical of the fixed end model in fig 5 all vertical and lateral displacement results were normalized by the umbilical length of 3 km and the line tension results were also normalized by the line safe working load of 70 kn the variation of line tension in free end model is negligible hence was not included in fig 5 from fig 5 the overall pattern of the maximum tension in the umbilical from the fixed end model is similar to that one for the rov lateral displacement from the free end model moreover both models have the same extreme vertical current profile i e as shown in fig 5 maximum line tension and maximum lateral or vertical displacements are occurring in the same time interval at t 2728 h fig 6 shows the scatter plot of the rov normalized lateral displacement from free end model versus the normalized maximum tension in the umbilical from the fixed end model the blue dot shows the result from 11 359 static simulations of the umbilical rov system under multidirectional vertical current profile fig 6 indicates that there is an almost overall linear relationship between rov normalized lateral displacements from free end model and normalized maximum tension from the fixed end model a linear function was fitted into the data and it showed a good agreement linear regression r2 95 therefore it can be concluded that the increase of maximum tension in the umbilical due to activation of rov thrusters to keep it in its initial position is linearly proportional to the increase of lateral displacement of the rov when the thrusters are not activated this means that by only observing the rov displacement in the free end model the extreme current profile for both free and fixed end models can be established fig 7a and b show the east west and north south components of the extreme vertical current profiles from the multidirectional analyses the mean and maximum current speeds in four main directions are also presented in fig 7 for the sake of comparison in the extreme vertical current profile none of the surface current components hits its maximum value while the bottom current components especially the north south ones are the same as the maximum values this indicates that the bottom current strongly affects the extreme vertical current profile for deep water rov operation to confirm this a comparison between rov lateral offset and bottom current was carried out through rose plots fig 8 a and fig 8b show the rose plots of the rov lateral displacement in the free end model and the required thrust load in the fixed end model respectively fig 9 shows the rose plot of current speed at four different depths 40 m 568 m 1 005 m and 2 995 m in l6 data the radius for each direction sector provides information about the percentage of occurrence while the colour shows the magnitude interval of the presented entity by visual comparison the rose plot of rov displacement in fig 8a is similar to the rose plot of the current speed at deep elevation i e at elevation 2 995 m as shown in fig 9d furthermore the direction of the largest current speed at elevation 2 995 m west south west is the same as the direction of the largest rov lateral displacement west south west confirming that the extreme lateral displacement of the rov is strongly affected by the current speed in the vicinity of the rov the difference between the rov lateral displacement rose plot and the rose plots of current speed in different elevations can be quantified by summing up the differences in the number of occurrences for all direction sectors which is formulated into eq 8 8 d i f f e r e n c e 100 g g 1 g e g l g where e g number of current occurrences in the g direction sector l g number of rov lateral displacement occurrences in the g direction sector g number of direction sectors was set to 16 in this study fig 10 shows the difference quantification between the rose plot of rov lateral displacement and the rose plot of current speed for all elevations from the l6 dataset it can be seen that the difference percentage has an overall decreasing trend when going to deeper location and it becomes notably less significant for elevations deeper than 1 5 km this indicates that the rov in free end configuration is more susceptible to the bottom current speed than the surface current speed 5 2 multidirectional current on umbilical offset besides rov displacement another observation was made on the effect of the multidirectional vertical current profile on the umbilical offset in the free end model fig 11 shows the envelope of maximum umbilical offset for all arc lengths from 5 different operating depths in l6 location namely 1 km 1 5 km 2 km 2 5 km and 3 km depth in each case the graph was normalized with the corresponding maximum rov offset in the free end model as noted at the right end of each graph all 5 cases were simulated using the same dataset of vertical current profile time series from all 5 cases it can be concluded that there are two distinguishable types of extreme current profiles for umbilical offset i e part of the graph before and then after the kink point highlighted with a dot in each graph while the presented dots only show that there is a change in the trend of maximum umbilical offset first type the current profile that produces significant offset in top part of the umbilical i e part of the graph from 0m arc length to kink point in each graph but less offset in the bottom part of the umbilical this may come from vertical current profiles where the surface current speed is the dominant factor in the static structural analyses or it may come from a vertical current profile where the surface current speed goes toward the opposite direction of the bottom current speed second type the current profile that produces significant offset in the bottom part of the umbilical i e part of the graph from the kink point in each graph to its largest arc length but less offset at the top part of the umbilical in this case the bottom current is significant and dominating the static structural analyses of the umbilical rov system as the rov operation goes deeper the static tension in the upper parts of the umbilical increases linearly in this case the upper part of the umbilical is not easily drifted by the current load consequently the first type of extreme current profile becomes supressed and the second type governs the shape of the envelope besides producing the largest offset in the bottom part of the umbilical the second type of extreme current profile also produces the largest rov lateral and vertical displacement this implies that the current profile that gives the largest rov displacement will also give the largest umbilical offset therefore in deep water rov operation the extreme vertical current profile can be simply determined by observing the largest rov displacement in the free end model 6 multi round clustering analysis on l6 time history 6 1 extreme current profile for 3 km rov operation in this paper the conventional method is referred as the method in finding the extreme vertical current profile through static simulations of all current profiles in the dataset the conventional method is the most accurate method in indicating the extreme current profile from dataset though it is a very time consuming and computationally inefficient approach as it takes around 3 days to complete the method for free end model using the presented numerical model in a pc with i7 6700 cpu and 8 gb of ram total number of the required static simulations can be reduced significantly by performing the multi round clustering as proposed in this paper it was started by refining the current profile through linear interpolation on the current speed and direction using the recorded data for 90 different depths all current profiles were firstly refined with 10 m depth interval fig 12 schematically shows the multi round clustering approach in finding the extreme vertical current profile for 3 km rov operation from the recorded data with 5 number of classes in each round fig 12a shows the results of structural response in terms of maximum rov offset from the conventional method in fig 12b the vertical red line t 2 728 h indicates the time instance of actual extreme vertical current profile obtained from the conventional method each horizontal dashed line shows the winning class or the winning individual of each clustering round the colored dots show individual vertical current profiles in each class the horizontal axis shows the location of any individual in the time series while the vertical axis shows different classes of the multi round clustering and total number of classes as the mda process repeated for example the classes 6 to 10 were generated by performing the mda on the 1st winning class the number of individual profiles per class decreases as the mda process is repeated on the winning class indicating that the extreme vertical current profile was filtered from the database fig 12 illustrates that how the multi round clustering with 5 classes in the mda grouping process successfully captured the extreme vertical current profile for static response of the umbilical rov system with only 26 static simulations this shows a computational efficiency ratio of 437 11 357 26 where 11 357 and 26 are total number of required simulations in the conventional and multi round clustering methods respectively for the multi round clustering method the accuracy ratio i e the ratio between the maximum response from the multi round clustering to that one from the conventional method is an indication of overall accuracy of the proposed clustering method and for fig 12 it is 1 00 representing very good agreement between the conventional and multi round clustering methods during the application the calculation of the dissimilarity matrix is the most time consuming process and it approximately takes up to 2 5 h for the fine current profile database in this study though it is not as time consuming as performing the static simulation on all vertical current profiles in the recorded data the evolution of the winning class is presented in fig 13 and fig 14 for current speed and direction respectively for both figs 13 and 14 the blue color represents the members of each class while the orange color shows the representative vertical current profile in the first round the vertical current profiles with weak bottom current speed classes 1 2 3 and 4 are eliminated from the process as shown in fig 13 the surface current is not the main driving factor for the 3 km operation hence the vertical current profile with large surface current may be eliminated on the first round e g classes 2 and 4 the extreme vertical current profile tends to have the same direction especially for the bottom current this is shown in fig 14 where the vertical current profiles with dispersed direction are eliminated in the first round from the second to the final round the winning class is refined multiple times where the current profile with strong and unified direction of bottom current is preserved 6 2 effect of number of classes on cluster accuracy the predefined number of classes in each round plays an important role on the success of the multi round clustering if the number of classes is inadequate actual extreme vertical current profile can be easily mixed and represented by similar vertical current profiles with less overall response of the system increasing the number of classes also increases the chance of the multi round cluster method captures the actual extreme vertical current profile or a profile with a highly similar shape and response to the actual one to investigate the effect of total number of classes in each round to the accuracy of multi round clustering a sensitivity study was performed 100 different subsamples of l6 dataset with total number of profiles varying between 505 and 11 359 were generated by randomly selecting the time range on l6 dataset the number of classes were varied from 5 to 200 with interval of 5 three different interpolation interval were chosen 10m 50m and 100m the interpolation interval determines the total number of parameters compared in the mda procedure the accuracy of the multi round clustering result was measured by ε factor mathematically written as eq 9 9 ε l r c l u s t e r s r d a t a b a s e l r c o n v e n t i o n a l s r d a t a b a s e where lrcluster largest rov umbilical response from multi round cluster for the subsample lrconventional largest rov umbilical response from conventional method for the subsample srdatabase smallest rov umbilical response from the whole l6 dataset fig 15 shows the result of the sensitivity of multi round clustering method on the total number of classes figs 15a and b presents the mean and minimum of ε from the 100 analyzed subsamples respectively based on the mean of ε the multi round clustering can perform with high accuracy even with small number of classes per round however to ensure that the multi round clustering can achieve acceptable accuracy for any dataset the class number larger than 15 should be utilized in addition using small interpolation interval may not improve the accuracy of multi round clustering this is due to the increase on the number of parameters involved in the mda procedure which may induce some inaccuracy due to the curse of dimensionality bellman 1954 the sensitivity analysis shows that interpolation interval of 100m produces the best result for low number of class fig 15c shows the computational efficieny ratio and it is observed that by using smaller number of classes the computational efficieny can be improved more than 200 times overall increasing the number of classes increase the computational time however even with 100 200 classes the computational time still can be reduced by 20 30 times in addition increasing the number of classes also greatly reduces the maximum dissimilarity between members in all classes which is shown by fig 15d with smaller maximum dissimilarity a class is more homogen and the multi round cluster becomes the normal clustering procedure 6 3 multi round clustering for different depths simulating all 11 359 current profiles to get extreme vertical current profile for different operational depths as presented in section 5 2 is a time consuming process and computationally inefficient especially if a precise result is demanded the multi clustering method can be utilized to speed up the process the best practice for the multi round clustering is to calculate dissimilarity matrix for each operational depth before starting the mda procedure however recalculating the defined dissimilarity matrix using eq 3 can be inefficient in this study the dissimilarity matrix from the 3 km rov operation was reused to capture the extreme vertical current profiles for operational depth of 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 km to get more accurate results 20 number of classes were used in each round of clustering in addition the interval for speed and direction interpolation was set to 10m using a larger interpolation interval with 20 class per round produced less accurate results figs 16 19 shows the multi round clustering process for rov operation in 2 5 2 1 5 and 1 km respectively the red vertical line indicates the extreme current profile from conventional method while the grey vertical line indicates the extreme current profile from multi round clustering out of 4 analyzed operational depths in figs 16 19 the multi round clustering captures the exact extreme vertical current profile as in the conventional method for operational depths of 2 5 km 2 0 km and 1 0 km with accuracy ratio of 1 00 and only fails to determine the exact extreme profile for 1 5 km depth however with accuracy ratio of 0 99 the computational efficiency ratio for the clustering method in figs 16 19 varies between 160 and 203 in summary the results show that the multi round clustering can be utilized efficiently and accurately to capture the extreme current profile for different operational depths with utilization of only one dissimilarity matrix 7 conclusion in structural analysis of deep water offshore facilities the vertical current profile is usually assumed as a simplified profile such as uniform linear slab or power profile maximum response of some structural systems e g umbilical are quite sensitive to the utilized current profiles in the structural models and hence several methods have been proposed in the last few decades to acquire the extreme vertical current profile based on the actual recorded data structural responses of a typical deep water umbilical rov system under one year continuous current data measurements in a given deep water location in the gulf of mexico were studied in this paper thousands of conventional static structural analyses in free end and fixed end boundary conditions for all current profiles were carried out to identify the extreme current profile the results revealed that by observing the lateral displacement of rov in the free end model the general extreme vertical current profile can be extracted this extreme vertical current profile does not only lead to the extreme rov lateral displacement but also the extreme rov vertical displacement and maximum tension in free end and fixed end models respectively the current profile in bottom layers is more crucial than that in the surface layers hence the surface current does not necessarily need to be at its maximum speed for the extreme vertical current profile therefore the utilization of traditional uniform linear slab or power shape current profiles may be misleading for an umbilical rov system a new clustering approach namely multi round clustering with a modified dissimilarity matrix was introduced and successfully implemented to find the extreme current profile for deep water rov operation increasing the number of classes for mda process may improve the multi round clustering in finding the actual extreme vertical current profile the evolution of the winning class also confirms that the magnitude and the unidirectionality of the bottom current data play important role in the extreme current profile for deep water rov operation it was also shown that by refining the vertical current profile dataset and using number of classes up to 20 the dissimilarity matrix from a 3 km operation can be reutilized to determine the extreme vertical current profile for different operational depths up to 3 km it was shown that the proposed multi round clustering can be used accurately with accuracy ratio of greater than 0 99 and efficiently with computational efficiency ratio of greater than 160 by operators and designers in planning the rov operation under strong current load for

20658,rovs remotely operated vehicles are playing an important role in installation construction and maintenance of subsea systems during operation rovs are usually connected to surface facilities through umbilical lines where the entire umbilical rov system is affected by vessel motions wave and current induced loads during the design process it is commonly assumed that the current profile that leads to the extreme response of an offshore structural system has a typical profile with a uniform direction however in deep water the variation of current direction along water depth becomes more apparent hence the effect of direction variation cannot be neglected when establishing the extreme current profile for deep water rov operation the study focuses on how to efficiently acquire the multidirectional extreme current profiles through a new multi round clustering method firstly static analysis of a typical deep water umbilical rov system was performed under thousands of multidirectional current profiles extracted from a database of one year continuously recorded ocean current different responses of the system such as rov offset umbilical lateral displacement and maximum tension in the umbilical were investigated and set as a benchmark for further process then a multi round clustering procedure using a modified maximum dissimilarity algorithm for rov operation was introduced and applied to extract the extreme multidirectional current profile more efficiently it is shown that the proposed multi round clustering methodology can be implemented efficiently and accurately in capturing the extreme vertical current profiles from a current database for rov operation in different working depths the study also showed that the effect of bottom current on deep water rov operation is more significant than the surface current therefore for rov operation in deep waters more precautions shall be made on the bottom current profiles keywords deep water extreme current profile rov clustering process umbilical most dissimilar algorithm 1 introduction rov remotely operated vehicle is an underwater vehicle which is connected to a surface facility by an umbilical line in rov operations the umbilical plays an important role since the transmission of data power hydraulic and electric signals between the rov and surface facility are performed through the umbilical wernli sr and christ 2014 the hydrodynamic loads greatly affect the motion of the umbilical and may induce a significant disturbance on the rov during the operation after the loss of an ultra deep water rov kaiko in 2003 momma et al 2004 several developments on rov structural design aspects have been made either by improving the numerical model of the flexible umbilical buckham et al 2004 gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 quan et al 2016 wang and sun 2015 or by redesigning the rov configuration to minimize the hydrodynamic loads bowen et al 2009 however one key design challenge which has not been studied in sufficient detail is the effect of multidirectional current for rov operation in deep water in structural analysis of an umbilical rov system the magnitude and direction of ocean current between the surface facility and the target operation location needs to be defined in a vertical current profile the horizontal speed and direction are defined at different depths from sea surface to the seabed in normal offshore engineering practice due to the absence of measurement data the vertical current profile is usually assumed to be unidirectional and follow a uniform linear slab or power profile bsi 2005 nowadays measurement data of current speed and direction exist for several locations around the world the data shows that for areas with water depth more than 1 km a multidirectional current becomes more prevalent shaffer et al 1995 sheinbaum et al 2007 thereby suggesting that the assumption of unidirectional current profile may be too severe furthermore forristall and cooper 1997 showed that the error due to the simplification of current profile as unidirectional cannot be neglected for flexible systems such as umbilical rov system since flexible structures are sensitive to the shape of vertical current profile therefore finding the extreme current profile i e the current profile corresponding to extreme response of the umbilical rov system where the rov may have to operate in is a challenging task in structural design of offshore structures several attempts have been made through statistical methods to capture an extreme vertical current profile in traditional procedure to capture the extreme current profile it is assumed that there is no dependency between current speeds at different depth in this case by utilizing the time series of current speed from a measurement database the extreme current speed for each depth is defined independently as a current speed with a certain exceedance percentile combining the extreme current speeds from each depth produces the extreme vertical current profile for certain exceedance percentile furthermore the extreme vertical current profile is assumed as a unidirectional profile by analyzing the data of ocean current at faroe shetland channel west of shetland islands jeans et al 2003 showed that this procedure leads to a misleading and very severe extreme current profile since the extreme speeds on different depths are unlikely to occur at the same time therefore to develop a more accurate extreme current profile through statistical analysis the correlation between the current speeds from different depth shall be maintained winterstein et al 2009 developed the conditional current analysis cca an improved statistical approach for establishing the extreme vertical current profile in cca method the traditional statistical approach of establishing extreme vertical current profile was modified by introducing turkstra load combination rule liu et al 2018 utilized the average conditional exceedance rate acer method to predict the extreme current profile in south china sea acer is another improved statistical approach for establishing extreme vertical current profile by utilizing the average conditional exceedance rate for certain time window and threshold in oceanography the empirical orthogonal function eof is proven as a useful methodology to analyze different aspects of ocean current davis 1976 edwards and seim 2008 preisendorfer and mobley 1988 forristall and cooper 1997 introduced the application of eof to capture the extreme vertical current profile for offshore structures in general in this case instead of treating the vertical current profile time series as a combination of current speed time series from different depths it is represented as a combination of several different current mode shapes multiplied by their corresponding time series of amplitude since the analysis is based on the current mode shapes the correlation of current speed between different depths is preserved in addition not all modes are required to create a good remake of the original time series of vertical current profile allowing for input parameter reduction in further statistical analysis in eof the extreme current profile can be constructed by performing inverse first order reliability method iform on the time series of amplitude for several dominant current mode shapes forristall and cooper 1997 in the past decades the clustering approach has gained popularity in oceanography liu and weisberg 2005 used self organizing map som on vertical current profile to study the ocean current variability in west florida shelf then they used the same approach to estimate the ocean current and sea surface at the same location liu and weisberg 2007 fereday et al 2008 used the k mean algorithm kma to study the atmospheric circulation in north atlantic european hamilton 2010 used the clustering procedure to define a set of typical wave spectra in the north west shelf of australia camus et al 2011 compared the performance of som kma and most dissimilar algorithm mda on characterizing the wave climate based on significant wave height mean period and mean direction shchekinova and kumkar 2015 used the clustering approach to define the high drifter area based on wind and current data for search and rescue purposes recently sonnewald et al 2019 applied the kma algorithm to define the global ocean dynamical region in term of finding the extreme current profile for offshore structure the simplest clustering method was presented by jeans et al 2012 which they referred as current profile characterization cpc in this method thousands of current profiles from the measurement data were grouped into a number of classes based on their shapes each class was represented by a vertical current profile and its number of occurrences the class representation that produced the largest response on the structure was determined as the extreme vertical current profile jeans et al 2012 claimed that the cpc method was more appropriate than eof because the eof required a large number of modes to adequately represent the original current time series however for a more refined vertical current profiles cpc also does not perform well due to the inefficient grouping procedure in other works by prevosto et al 2012 and jeans et al 2015 the same principle of cpc method was used with more advanced clustering techniques such as som kma and mda by using the advanced grouping techniques the total number of classes of vertical current profile can be optimized even for a refined vertical current profile though several techniques exist to predict the extreme vertical current profile during the design phase of deep water rovs the current profile is still traditionally assumed to follow a slab linear or uniform profile in an old rov study by nomoto and hattori 1986 a slab linear current profile was utilized to simulate the operation of dolphin 3k rov up to 3 km depth which was similar to the one adopted by webster and bowen 2003 for the study of abismo in a relatively new rov study by quan et al 2016 unidirectional and linear current profiles were used to test the rov system up to 3 5 km depth lubis et al 2021 combined the multidirectional current with randomly generated waves and vessel motion to study the dynamic response of an rov umbilical system though only one current profile was used in the simulation the existing methods to capture the extreme current profile are still not commonly used for structural response analysis of deep water rov systems due to the lack of ocean current data during the design phase of rov most of the existing rov structural response studies are also focused on addressing the effect of wave on its umbilical buckham et al 2003 driscoll et al 2000a 2000b khojasteh and kamali 2017 lubis et al 2021 quan et al 2016 hence the presented study tries to incorporate a more accurate representation of multidirectional extreme current profile for rov operation in deep water using a real ocean current dataset a modified version of the clustering procedure to capture the extreme current profile for the rov operation in a more efficient way referenced as multi round clustering method is introduced in this study the main aim of the study is to simulate a simplified rov umbilical system during a deep water operation under existing deep water ocean current dataset and to investigate the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed multi round clustering procedure in this study a real one year continuously recorded current data in the gulf of mexico and its statistical parameters were evaluated first then independent static simulations of umbilical rov system under the one year measured current data were performed and the time series record of the responses was analyzed extreme responses of the umbilical rov system and their corresponding characteristics were investigated eventually the multi round clustering method was applied to the current data and the predicted extreme current profiles were compared with those ones from one year time history simulations it is shown that the proposed approach can accurately and efficiently determine the extreme vertical current profile from the recorded data 2 multi round clustering method to determine extreme current profile in the clustering method different vertical current profiles are grouped based on their similarity or dissimilarity using advanced grouping techniques such as som kohonen 2001 kma hastie et al 2009 and mda kennard and stone 1969 the number of classes can be optimized som kma and mda are well established unsupervised clustering algorithms where it assumes that there is no priori information about the data classes som is a type of artificial neural network which uses the neighborhood function to produce a discrete representation of the input space of the training samples kma is a clustering technique that tries to minimize the mean of every class for each iteration of the clustering process mda is also a clustering technique but it uses the most dissimilar individual sample in the data to establish a set of classes for som kma and mda the grouping process as implemented by prevosto et al 2012 and jeans et al 2015 is started by calculating the dissimilarity between different individual vertical current profiles in the measurement data the formulation of dissimilarity between two individual current profiles strongly dictates the result of the clustering process in the previous clustering analysis for extreme current profile jeans et al 2015 only considered the information about the current magnitude and neglected the information about the current direction in each depth in other words they assumed all vertical current profiles in the measurement data as unidirectional in this case the dissimilarity between two vertical current profiles of a and b namely d a b was calculated using eq 1 1 m 1 m c a m c b m 2 d a b where c a m current speed of vertical current profile a at elevation m c b m current speed of vertical current profile b at elevation m m elevation index m 1 2 3 m m total number of elevations in this study the clustering methodology was improved by considering the directional information from the current dataset one way to account for the information about current direction in each elevation is by decomposing the current speed into two orthogonal components east west and north south components improving the unidirectional current dissimilarity concept introduced by jeans et al 2015 as shown in eq 1 the dissimilarity between two multidirectional current profiles of a and b now can be calculated using the euclidean distance of current speed on all depth from their two components which is mathematically presented in eq 2 2 m 1 m u a m e w u b m e w 2 m 1 m u a m n s u b m n s 2 d a b where d a b dissimilarity between vertical current profiles a and b u a m e w east west component of vertical current profile a at elevation m u b m e w east west component of vertical current profile b at elevation m u a m n s north south component of vertical current profile a at elevation m u b m n s north south component of vertical current profile b at elevation m eq 2 is a good tool as far as the dissimilarity between two different current profiles is based on their shapes and the mean direction of each current profile is concerned however eq 2 leads to a misleading dissimilarity if the mean direction is not important for instance fig 1 a illustrates a simple vertical current profile with two current magnitudes c1 and c2 in two directions θ1 and θ2 at two different elevations z1 and z2 fig 1 b shows the same vertical current profile from fig 1 a but rotated by an angle of β resulting a different mean direction using eq 2 the dissimilarity between the current profiles in fig 1 a and b is a non zero value but it is evident that both current profiles produce the same maximum static line tension and the same offset absolute value of horizontal displacements of an umbilical rov system therefore the two current profiles in fig 1 a and b should be grouped in the same class for cases where the current mean direction is not important e g when analysing induced tension in the umbilical line or absolute displacement of the rov the overall orientation of two compared current profiles a and b should be aligned first before calculating the dissimilarity between them this can be done by restricting the vertical current profile a and rotating current profile b with an aligned angle of α the final aligned angle of α is the angle used to rotate the current profile b to get smallest directional dissimilarity to the vertical current profile a hence the dissimilarity between vertical current profiles a and b da b is mathematically calculated using eq 3 in this case it is better to represent the current profiles as a series of current speeds c and directions θ on every considered depth instead of working with east west ue w and north south un s components to avoid exhausting computational process to ensure that each current speed from the considered depth has an equal importance the difference in the current magnitude is normalized by mc m while the difference in direction is normalized by 2π by dividing the euclidian distance with the square root of 2m the value of d a b is set in the range of 0 and 1 3 d a b min d a b α where 4 m 1 m c a m c b m m c m 2 m 1 m min 2 π δ θ a b m α δ θ a b m α 2 π 2 d a b α 1 2 m 5 δ θ a b m α θ a m θ b m α f o r π α π 6 m c m max c 1 m c n m min c 1 m c n m and d a b α dissimilarity between vertical current profiles a and b for given α c current speed θ current direction α aligned angle n current profile index n 1 2 3 n n total number of current profiles the relation between da b α and α is nonlinear therefore finding α that gives the minimum da b α is not a simple process da b can be found by varying α in the range of π and π an optimization algorithm can be used to speed up the process for n number of vertical current profiles the size of dissimilarity matrix d is n x n in addition d is a symmetric matrix with all diagonal components equal to zero using mda the vertical current profile representation of a class is directly selected from the most dissimilar vertical current profile in the dataset on the opposite som and kma utilize the mean of the class to establish their representative vertical current profile however when the dissimilarity is defined by eq 3 finding the mean in the vertical current profile class is not a straightforward process since α differs for each pair of vertical current profile in the class therefore in this study only the mda grouping technique is modified to capture the multidirectional current profile besides modifying the dissimilarity matrix the clustering steps are also adjusted for structural analysis of rov umbilical system in the previous applications the extreme current profile is directly defined after the clustering process by performing structural response on each class representation in this case a large number of classes should be utilized to ensure the homogeneity of each class in this paper a modified clustering approach is proposed and referred as multi round clustering methodology the basic idea behind the multi round clustering is to repeat the clustering several times and search for the extreme vertical current profile only within the promising class in each round of clustering unnecessary classes in each step will be eliminated fig 2 shows the flowchart of the proposed multi round clustering method and its main steps are as follows 1 the dissimilarity between each current profile in the data set is calculated using eq 3 2 mda is utilized to group n number of vertical current profile into p number of classes where p n 3 the umbilical rov static analysis is performed only for the representative vertical current profiles in each class i e only p static analyses in total 4 the winning class is the class with the largest static umbilical rov response 5 steps 2 thru 4 are repeated on the winning class in step 4 for another clustering round to refine the winning class this will be repeated until the total number of the current profiles in the winning class is less than the predefined number of classes p in the multi round clustering method each clustering round is utilized to filter the dataset to find the extreme vertical current profile compared to the common clustering in finding extreme current profile the multi round clustering can start with smaller number of classes and has a higher possibility on catching the real extreme vertical current profile in the dataset 3 one year ocean current data two one year continuous current data measurement collected in the gulf of mexico were used in this study the data were acquired from two different locations namely as l4 and l6 with the deepest depth of 3 35 km and 3 62 km respectively in each location the measurements were performed using combination of two different types of devices current meter and acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the current speeds were measured at 49 and 90 different depths in l4 and l6 locations respectively more information about l4 and l6 data measurement can be found in the reports by donohue et al 2006 and sheinbaum et al 2007 respectively due to the finer vertical current profile and deeper depth the results presented in this paper were mainly focused on the l6 location the l6 database includes time history of recorded current speeds for 11 359 time intervals hourly averaged data for more than a year at 90 different depth elevations table 1 shows a brief summary of the measurement elevations at l6 location three of these depth ranges have finer intervals between the measurement points and therefore more detailed current profile is expected from these three depth ranges fig 3 shows the time history of vertical current profile in l6 location with 11 359 hourly readings from 90 different depths the current data was decomposed into east west and the north south components in fig 3 a and b respectively the x axis shows the time in hours the y axis indicates the water depth which was set to zero at the mean surface level and the color indicates the speed and direction of the current fig 3 indicates strong multidirectional and multilayer current profile for deep water in some particular time intervals for example around t 4 000 h the surface current strongly blows to the south west while around the bottom elevation the current moves toward north east in general the surface current speed is stronger than the bottom one the correlation of current speed between different elevations was determined utilizing the time history of east west and north south components the correlation coefficient of time history of speed at elevation i to time history of speed at elevation j was calculated using eq 7 7 ρ u i u j cov u i u j var u i var u j n 1 n u n i u i u n j u j n 1 n u n i u i 2 n 1 n u n j u j 2 where u i n current component east west or north south at elevation i and time interval n i j elevation index where i or j 1 2 m u i u j time average of current speed at elevation i and j fig 4 shows the contour plot of correlation coefficients between different elevations for east west fig 4a and north south fig 4b components both axes indicate the water depth from the surface elevation 0 0 m coordinate to the seabed 3 5 3 5 km coordinate in general the correlation coefficient of any location in the first depth range 40 m to 350 m to any location from the other depth range is less than 0 6 however the correlation between any location inside the first depth range is larger than 0 6 ρ u i u j 0 6 is also observed between locations in the depth range of 700 m to 3 340 m moreover ρ u i u j 0 9 is observed between elevations in the depth range of 1 400 m to 3 340 m based on the correlation coefficient plots in fig 4 it can be concluded that there is a multilayer pattern in the current profile at l6 location this implies that the maximum current speed at the surface layer may not occur in the same time instance and direction as the maximum current speed at the bottom layer therefore assuming a slab current profile that utilizes simultaneous maximum current speeds in all elevations can lead to very conservative response of the structure mainly for deep water locations 4 umbilical rov model in reality the rov will manoeuvre within a certain radius from its initial point while the current load may also push the rov away from its initial point in this study the initial point was defined as the position of rov with no environmental load the target location may be located far from the rov location after being displaced by the current load in this case the rov thrusters can be utilized to move it towards the desired location usually the most important umbilical rov responses for safe operation of the system in deep waters are the lateral and vertical movements of the rov namely rov horizontal and vertical offsets and the maximum tension in the umbilical line numerically the boundary condition of the rov end in an umbilical rov system under the current loads varies between free end with no thruster load and fixed end with maximum thruster load numerical simulation for all possible rov target locations and all thrust loading scenarios is prohibitive due to the large number of combinations therefore the umbilical rov study in this paper was simplified into two extreme conditions free end and fixed end models in both models the rov was directly connected to the ship using an umbilical which is commonly known as a free flying configuration wernli sr and christ 2014 the free end numerical model represents the rov operation close to the seabed with no activation of thrusters the bottom end of the umbilical where the rov is connected to was assumed to be displaced freely by the current load the displacement of the rov due to the current load was measured from the rov initial point in the fixed end model it was assumed that there is enough thrust load generated by the rov to stabilize and keep the rov in its initial location an example ultra deep water rov system was studied in this paper table 2 shows the specifications of the umbilical and rov for the numerical model both of the umbilical rov numerical models i e free end and fixed end models were created using orcaflex software orcina 2019 the umbilical in the orcaflex model was defined as a line discretized through a series of lumped masses and springs the axial stiffness of the spring was set equal to the axial stiffness of the umbilical in addition the bending stiffness was represented by rotational springs torsion and material damping were neglected more detail info about line element in orcaflex can be found in orcina 2019 in both models the top end of the umbilical was fixed at 8m above the mean sea level i e the vessel movements were ignored in the free end model the rov was simplistically represented as a 3d buoy with 3 translational dofs only in the fixed end model the bottom end of the umbilical i e rov location was fixed and hence did not contain any rov representation the effect of rov omission in the fixed end model on the tension along the umbilical was insignificant there were two sequential loading stages in all orcaflex simulations in the first loading stage the entire system was analyzed under its self weight only and then in the next stage the system was analyzed under the ocean current loading as per the l6 data set the changing rate of the current speed between hourly time intervals is low and hence there was no need for dynamic analysis of the system under current loading therefore the umbilical rov system was analyzed statically under each vertical current profile at a given time instance 5 rov operation in deep water under current loading in this paper the extreme vertical current profile is defined as the one leading to the largest response of the umbilical rov system among the one year current profile dataset the extreme vertical current profile was firstly determined based on response analysis of the actual umbilical rov system under the current loading for all recorded data it was a very time consuming process with thousands of simulations and the obtained results were used for determining the actual extreme responses of the system and its corresponding characteristics this approach also provided an insight into the general characteristic of the extreme vertical current profile for deep water rov operation the results were secondly used as the benchmark data for the assessment of multi round clustering analysis in this study two rov models free end and fixed end models were simulated for all the hourly current profiles as independent static loading i e one current profile for each time interval in the l6 data 11 359 current profiles were extracted from the l6 data and then both rov models were simulated independently under each of these current profiles in the free end model effect of the vertical current profile on rov vertical and lateral displacement was more pronounced as a result the extreme vertical current profile was determined by considering either the largest lateral or vertical displacement of the rov in the fixed end model the maximum tension in the umbilical was the main criteria to determine the extreme vertical current profile 5 1 rov displacement and maximum umbilical tension fig 5 a and fig 5b show the static time series results for the rov lateral and vertical displacement of the free end model respectively under multidirectional vertical current profiles fig 5c shows the time series result for maximum tension on the umbilical of the fixed end model in fig 5 all vertical and lateral displacement results were normalized by the umbilical length of 3 km and the line tension results were also normalized by the line safe working load of 70 kn the variation of line tension in free end model is negligible hence was not included in fig 5 from fig 5 the overall pattern of the maximum tension in the umbilical from the fixed end model is similar to that one for the rov lateral displacement from the free end model moreover both models have the same extreme vertical current profile i e as shown in fig 5 maximum line tension and maximum lateral or vertical displacements are occurring in the same time interval at t 2728 h fig 6 shows the scatter plot of the rov normalized lateral displacement from free end model versus the normalized maximum tension in the umbilical from the fixed end model the blue dot shows the result from 11 359 static simulations of the umbilical rov system under multidirectional vertical current profile fig 6 indicates that there is an almost overall linear relationship between rov normalized lateral displacements from free end model and normalized maximum tension from the fixed end model a linear function was fitted into the data and it showed a good agreement linear regression r2 95 therefore it can be concluded that the increase of maximum tension in the umbilical due to activation of rov thrusters to keep it in its initial position is linearly proportional to the increase of lateral displacement of the rov when the thrusters are not activated this means that by only observing the rov displacement in the free end model the extreme current profile for both free and fixed end models can be established fig 7a and b show the east west and north south components of the extreme vertical current profiles from the multidirectional analyses the mean and maximum current speeds in four main directions are also presented in fig 7 for the sake of comparison in the extreme vertical current profile none of the surface current components hits its maximum value while the bottom current components especially the north south ones are the same as the maximum values this indicates that the bottom current strongly affects the extreme vertical current profile for deep water rov operation to confirm this a comparison between rov lateral offset and bottom current was carried out through rose plots fig 8 a and fig 8b show the rose plots of the rov lateral displacement in the free end model and the required thrust load in the fixed end model respectively fig 9 shows the rose plot of current speed at four different depths 40 m 568 m 1 005 m and 2 995 m in l6 data the radius for each direction sector provides information about the percentage of occurrence while the colour shows the magnitude interval of the presented entity by visual comparison the rose plot of rov displacement in fig 8a is similar to the rose plot of the current speed at deep elevation i e at elevation 2 995 m as shown in fig 9d furthermore the direction of the largest current speed at elevation 2 995 m west south west is the same as the direction of the largest rov lateral displacement west south west confirming that the extreme lateral displacement of the rov is strongly affected by the current speed in the vicinity of the rov the difference between the rov lateral displacement rose plot and the rose plots of current speed in different elevations can be quantified by summing up the differences in the number of occurrences for all direction sectors which is formulated into eq 8 8 d i f f e r e n c e 100 g g 1 g e g l g where e g number of current occurrences in the g direction sector l g number of rov lateral displacement occurrences in the g direction sector g number of direction sectors was set to 16 in this study fig 10 shows the difference quantification between the rose plot of rov lateral displacement and the rose plot of current speed for all elevations from the l6 dataset it can be seen that the difference percentage has an overall decreasing trend when going to deeper location and it becomes notably less significant for elevations deeper than 1 5 km this indicates that the rov in free end configuration is more susceptible to the bottom current speed than the surface current speed 5 2 multidirectional current on umbilical offset besides rov displacement another observation was made on the effect of the multidirectional vertical current profile on the umbilical offset in the free end model fig 11 shows the envelope of maximum umbilical offset for all arc lengths from 5 different operating depths in l6 location namely 1 km 1 5 km 2 km 2 5 km and 3 km depth in each case the graph was normalized with the corresponding maximum rov offset in the free end model as noted at the right end of each graph all 5 cases were simulated using the same dataset of vertical current profile time series from all 5 cases it can be concluded that there are two distinguishable types of extreme current profiles for umbilical offset i e part of the graph before and then after the kink point highlighted with a dot in each graph while the presented dots only show that there is a change in the trend of maximum umbilical offset first type the current profile that produces significant offset in top part of the umbilical i e part of the graph from 0m arc length to kink point in each graph but less offset in the bottom part of the umbilical this may come from vertical current profiles where the surface current speed is the dominant factor in the static structural analyses or it may come from a vertical current profile where the surface current speed goes toward the opposite direction of the bottom current speed second type the current profile that produces significant offset in the bottom part of the umbilical i e part of the graph from the kink point in each graph to its largest arc length but less offset at the top part of the umbilical in this case the bottom current is significant and dominating the static structural analyses of the umbilical rov system as the rov operation goes deeper the static tension in the upper parts of the umbilical increases linearly in this case the upper part of the umbilical is not easily drifted by the current load consequently the first type of extreme current profile becomes supressed and the second type governs the shape of the envelope besides producing the largest offset in the bottom part of the umbilical the second type of extreme current profile also produces the largest rov lateral and vertical displacement this implies that the current profile that gives the largest rov displacement will also give the largest umbilical offset therefore in deep water rov operation the extreme vertical current profile can be simply determined by observing the largest rov displacement in the free end model 6 multi round clustering analysis on l6 time history 6 1 extreme current profile for 3 km rov operation in this paper the conventional method is referred as the method in finding the extreme vertical current profile through static simulations of all current profiles in the dataset the conventional method is the most accurate method in indicating the extreme current profile from dataset though it is a very time consuming and computationally inefficient approach as it takes around 3 days to complete the method for free end model using the presented numerical model in a pc with i7 6700 cpu and 8 gb of ram total number of the required static simulations can be reduced significantly by performing the multi round clustering as proposed in this paper it was started by refining the current profile through linear interpolation on the current speed and direction using the recorded data for 90 different depths all current profiles were firstly refined with 10 m depth interval fig 12 schematically shows the multi round clustering approach in finding the extreme vertical current profile for 3 km rov operation from the recorded data with 5 number of classes in each round fig 12a shows the results of structural response in terms of maximum rov offset from the conventional method in fig 12b the vertical red line t 2 728 h indicates the time instance of actual extreme vertical current profile obtained from the conventional method each horizontal dashed line shows the winning class or the winning individual of each clustering round the colored dots show individual vertical current profiles in each class the horizontal axis shows the location of any individual in the time series while the vertical axis shows different classes of the multi round clustering and total number of classes as the mda process repeated for example the classes 6 to 10 were generated by performing the mda on the 1st winning class the number of individual profiles per class decreases as the mda process is repeated on the winning class indicating that the extreme vertical current profile was filtered from the database fig 12 illustrates that how the multi round clustering with 5 classes in the mda grouping process successfully captured the extreme vertical current profile for static response of the umbilical rov system with only 26 static simulations this shows a computational efficiency ratio of 437 11 357 26 where 11 357 and 26 are total number of required simulations in the conventional and multi round clustering methods respectively for the multi round clustering method the accuracy ratio i e the ratio between the maximum response from the multi round clustering to that one from the conventional method is an indication of overall accuracy of the proposed clustering method and for fig 12 it is 1 00 representing very good agreement between the conventional and multi round clustering methods during the application the calculation of the dissimilarity matrix is the most time consuming process and it approximately takes up to 2 5 h for the fine current profile database in this study though it is not as time consuming as performing the static simulation on all vertical current profiles in the recorded data the evolution of the winning class is presented in fig 13 and fig 14 for current speed and direction respectively for both figs 13 and 14 the blue color represents the members of each class while the orange color shows the representative vertical current profile in the first round the vertical current profiles with weak bottom current speed classes 1 2 3 and 4 are eliminated from the process as shown in fig 13 the surface current is not the main driving factor for the 3 km operation hence the vertical current profile with large surface current may be eliminated on the first round e g classes 2 and 4 the extreme vertical current profile tends to have the same direction especially for the bottom current this is shown in fig 14 where the vertical current profiles with dispersed direction are eliminated in the first round from the second to the final round the winning class is refined multiple times where the current profile with strong and unified direction of bottom current is preserved 6 2 effect of number of classes on cluster accuracy the predefined number of classes in each round plays an important role on the success of the multi round clustering if the number of classes is inadequate actual extreme vertical current profile can be easily mixed and represented by similar vertical current profiles with less overall response of the system increasing the number of classes also increases the chance of the multi round cluster method captures the actual extreme vertical current profile or a profile with a highly similar shape and response to the actual one to investigate the effect of total number of classes in each round to the accuracy of multi round clustering a sensitivity study was performed 100 different subsamples of l6 dataset with total number of profiles varying between 505 and 11 359 were generated by randomly selecting the time range on l6 dataset the number of classes were varied from 5 to 200 with interval of 5 three different interpolation interval were chosen 10m 50m and 100m the interpolation interval determines the total number of parameters compared in the mda procedure the accuracy of the multi round clustering result was measured by ε factor mathematically written as eq 9 9 ε l r c l u s t e r s r d a t a b a s e l r c o n v e n t i o n a l s r d a t a b a s e where lrcluster largest rov umbilical response from multi round cluster for the subsample lrconventional largest rov umbilical response from conventional method for the subsample srdatabase smallest rov umbilical response from the whole l6 dataset fig 15 shows the result of the sensitivity of multi round clustering method on the total number of classes figs 15a and b presents the mean and minimum of ε from the 100 analyzed subsamples respectively based on the mean of ε the multi round clustering can perform with high accuracy even with small number of classes per round however to ensure that the multi round clustering can achieve acceptable accuracy for any dataset the class number larger than 15 should be utilized in addition using small interpolation interval may not improve the accuracy of multi round clustering this is due to the increase on the number of parameters involved in the mda procedure which may induce some inaccuracy due to the curse of dimensionality bellman 1954 the sensitivity analysis shows that interpolation interval of 100m produces the best result for low number of class fig 15c shows the computational efficieny ratio and it is observed that by using smaller number of classes the computational efficieny can be improved more than 200 times overall increasing the number of classes increase the computational time however even with 100 200 classes the computational time still can be reduced by 20 30 times in addition increasing the number of classes also greatly reduces the maximum dissimilarity between members in all classes which is shown by fig 15d with smaller maximum dissimilarity a class is more homogen and the multi round cluster becomes the normal clustering procedure 6 3 multi round clustering for different depths simulating all 11 359 current profiles to get extreme vertical current profile for different operational depths as presented in section 5 2 is a time consuming process and computationally inefficient especially if a precise result is demanded the multi clustering method can be utilized to speed up the process the best practice for the multi round clustering is to calculate dissimilarity matrix for each operational depth before starting the mda procedure however recalculating the defined dissimilarity matrix using eq 3 can be inefficient in this study the dissimilarity matrix from the 3 km rov operation was reused to capture the extreme vertical current profiles for operational depth of 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 km to get more accurate results 20 number of classes were used in each round of clustering in addition the interval for speed and direction interpolation was set to 10m using a larger interpolation interval with 20 class per round produced less accurate results figs 16 19 shows the multi round clustering process for rov operation in 2 5 2 1 5 and 1 km respectively the red vertical line indicates the extreme current profile from conventional method while the grey vertical line indicates the extreme current profile from multi round clustering out of 4 analyzed operational depths in figs 16 19 the multi round clustering captures the exact extreme vertical current profile as in the conventional method for operational depths of 2 5 km 2 0 km and 1 0 km with accuracy ratio of 1 00 and only fails to determine the exact extreme profile for 1 5 km depth however with accuracy ratio of 0 99 the computational efficiency ratio for the clustering method in figs 16 19 varies between 160 and 203 in summary the results show that the multi round clustering can be utilized efficiently and accurately to capture the extreme current profile for different operational depths with utilization of only one dissimilarity matrix 7 conclusion in structural analysis of deep water offshore facilities the vertical current profile is usually assumed as a simplified profile such as uniform linear slab or power profile maximum response of some structural systems e g umbilical are quite sensitive to the utilized current profiles in the structural models and hence several methods have been proposed in the last few decades to acquire the extreme vertical current profile based on the actual recorded data structural responses of a typical deep water umbilical rov system under one year continuous current data measurements in a given deep water location in the gulf of mexico were studied in this paper thousands of conventional static structural analyses in free end and fixed end boundary conditions for all current profiles were carried out to identify the extreme current profile the results revealed that by observing the lateral displacement of rov in the free end model the general extreme vertical current profile can be extracted this extreme vertical current profile does not only lead to the extreme rov lateral displacement but also the extreme rov vertical displacement and maximum tension in free end and fixed end models respectively the current profile in bottom layers is more crucial than that in the surface layers hence the surface current does not necessarily need to be at its maximum speed for the extreme vertical current profile therefore the utilization of traditional uniform linear slab or power shape current profiles may be misleading for an umbilical rov system a new clustering approach namely multi round clustering with a modified dissimilarity matrix was introduced and successfully implemented to find the extreme current profile for deep water rov operation increasing the number of classes for mda process may improve the multi round clustering in finding the actual extreme vertical current profile the evolution of the winning class also confirms that the magnitude and the unidirectionality of the bottom current data play important role in the extreme current profile for deep water rov operation it was also shown that by refining the vertical current profile dataset and using number of classes up to 20 the dissimilarity matrix from a 3 km operation can be reutilized to determine the extreme vertical current profile for different operational depths up to 3 km it was shown that the proposed multi round clustering can be used accurately with accuracy ratio of greater than 0 99 and efficiently with computational efficiency ratio of greater than 160 by operators and designers in planning the rov operation under strong current load for

frequency 1 introduction in most previous hull form optimization studies the hull forms were optimized for reduced resistance in calm water at one speed or several speeds campana et al 2006 cheng et al 2018 yang and huang 2016 according to the study of huang and yang 2016 the simulation based design sbd optimization tool consists of a hydrodynamic simulation module a hull surface representation and deformation module and an optimization algorithm module in addition a surrogate module is utilized to reduce optimization time consumption a sufficiently accurate and efficient method based on the neumann michell nm theory huang et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013 yang et al 2013 was utilized to optimize hull forms for reduced drag kim and yang 2010 2013 2013 huang and yang 2016 with the development of sbd optimization tools ship designers not only pursue the drag reduction but also pursue the improved seakeeping performance during the ship designing and optimizing the seakeeping ranking was determined as the objective function associated with seakeeping performance by kim et al 2010 where bales seakeeping ranking method was used the seakeeping ranking can be quickly calculated through the empirical formula but can only roughly characterize the seakeeping performance the ship s seakeeping performance includes the 6 dof motions of a ship sailing in rough sea and the slamming splashing etc caused by these motions there are some hull form optimizations considering the ship motion performance in waves as follows the peak values of unimodal response amplitude operator rao curves of the absolute vertical acceleration were determined as the objective functions associated with motion performance by grigoropoulos and chalkias 2010 and the strip theory was used for the motion performance evaluation similarly huang et al 2015 used the peaks of heave and pitch motion rao curves of the ship hull advancing in head seas as the objective functions associated with motion performance and a ship motion program smp based on the strip theory was employed to calculate the heave and pitch motion raos there are some other studies bagheri et al 2014 diez et al 2015 on the optimization tools for improved motion performance in waves where the strip theory is also employed the theoretical derivation of the strip theory is based on the assumptions of high frequency and low speed liu and miao 1986 thus the strip theory can only roughly predict the heave and pitch motion raos of a ship in addition the peak values of heave and pitch motion rao curves cannot fully represent the heave and pitch motion performance of a ship hull in irregular head waves in the present paper only the vertical i e heave and pitch motions of a ship in head waves are considered and a multi objective high efficiency potential flow based ship hydrodynamic optimization tool is presented to optimize a ship for reduced total resistance in calm water and improved vertical motion performance in irregular head waves in this optimization tool an in house computer program based on the nm theory for ship resistance in calm water is presented and utilized during the optimization cycles in order to optimize the vertical motion performance of a ship in irregular head waves the significant amplitudes of heave and pitch motion response spectra in irregular head waves are determined as objective functions moreover to obtain a high efficiency and more reliable result of ship motion in waves the three dimensional potential flow solver by using translating and pulsating line segment source 3dtp ls green s function liang et al 2016 is employed to solve ship radiation and diffraction problems and further to evaluate the heave and pitch motion raos of a ship hull in regular waves the hydrodynamic simulation module of present optimization tool requires two meshes and the grid numbers of these two meshes differ from each other greatly therefore before the hull form deformation the initial hull is represented as non uniform rational b spline nurbs surfaces and saved in iges file format then all the hull surface modification methods in the present optimization tool are based on nurbs surfaces there are two kinds of hull surface modification methods based on nurbs surfaces the first one called direct method is to directly move the control points of nurbs surfaces kim et al 2008 wang 2015 the other one called combined method is to move the control points of nurbs surfaces by combining with other deformation methods yang et al 2016 the combined method only requires fewer design variables to achieve hull form deformation compared with the direct method and is utilized in this optimization tool for the purpose of validation this optimization tool is applied to the optimization design of the prototype of dtmb 5512 for reduced total resistance in calm water and improved vertical motion performance under the sea state of level 4 two cases are used to study the effect of the determination of feasible region for an optimization design on the possibility of simultaneously obtaining reduced total resistance and improved vertical motion performance four optimal hulls are selected from the pareto optimal front in case 2 to verify this optimization tool the resistance and vertical motion response spectra of these four optimal hulls are investigated moreover the resistance and vertical motion raos are further verified by the rans cfd simulations the smooth body lines profiles and waterlines of four optimal hulls present that the deformed hull forms yielded by the present optimization tool own smooth surfaces moreover the optimal hull ship 4 owns reduced total resistance and improved vertical motion performance which presents the effectiveness of present optimization tool 2 problem statement the optimization tool proposed in this paper is essentially to solve a multi objective hull form optimization problem as follows 1 min f i x i 1 2 3 x x 1 d x 2 d x n d t s r n s t h x 0 where f i x denote the objective functions x represents the n dimensional design variables vector composed of the parameters controlling the hull form deformation s is a subset of n dimensional space composed of the value range of design variables and h x denotes the displacement constraint of this optimization problem in the present paper the displacement constraint is taken as the absolute value of relative change in ship s displacement which is smaller than 1 in order to demonstrate this hydrodynamic optimization tool the prototype of dtmb 5512 is selected as the optimization object the dtmb 5512 is a 1 46 6 scale model of a navy surface combatant and the principal dimensions of the full scale ship are shown in table 1 the geometry of dtmb 5512 is plotted in fig 1 3 methodology in the optimization algorithm module of this optimization tool the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 is employed to solve the multi objective hull form optimization problem the hydrodynamic simulation module will be introduced in sections 3 1 and 3 2 and the hull surface representation and deformation module will be introduced in section 3 3 3 1 wave drag evaluation based on the nm theory the wave drag generated by a ship advancing in calm water is an extremely important hydrodynamic factor for ship design and optimization the nm theory proposed by noblesse et al 2013 is employed in this paper to evaluate the wave drag the nm theory is developed based on the classical neumann kelvin nk theory and the great improvement is that the troublesome line integral around ship waterline that occurs in the nk flow representation has been eliminated in the nm theory as shown in fig 2 a right handed inertial coordinate system o xyz attached to the ship of length l is established where the x axis points toward ship bow the z axis is vertical upward the mean free surface taken as the plane z 0 and n denotes the unit normal vector of hull surface and points into water therefore it can be considered that the total flow velocity is the sum of the uniform stream u s 0 0 opposite to the speed of ship hull and the disturbance flow velocity u d u d x u d y u d z caused by the ship hull the time independent potential φ s due to the steady forward motion of a ship can be expressed as follows 2 φ s x y z u s x φ x y z where φ represents the disturbance potential due to the ship hull advancing at speed u s in calm water the in house computer program based on the nm theory where the mean wetted ship hull surface is discretized into a series of quadrilateral panels is presented in this paper and employed to obtain the disturbance potential then the dynamic pressure p can be obtained by the bernoulli relation as follows 3 p ρ u s φ x φ x 2 φ y 2 φ z 2 2 where ρ denotes the density of water the wave drag coefficient c w can be expressed as follows 4 c w r w 0 5 ρ u s 2 s w e t σ h p n x d a 0 5 ρ u s 2 s w e t where r w is wave drag σ h denotes the mean wetted ship hull surface and s wet is the area of the mean wetted ship hull surface the frictional drag coefficient can be evaluated using the ittc 1957 model ship correlation line as follows 5 c f r f 0 5 ρ u s 2 s w e t 0 0075 log 10 re 2 2 where re is reynolds number and r f denotes friction drag the total drag coefficient is expressed as follows 6 c t r t 0 5 ρ u s 2 s w e t c f c w where r t denotes total drag in this paper the total drag coefficient is approximately taken as the sum of wave drag coefficient and frictional drag coefficient in order to use the nm theory for wave drag evaluation during the optimization process a validation study on the drag evaluation of the dtmb 5512 needs to be performed firstly moreover the kriso container ship kcs is selected to further verify the applicability of the nm theory the quadrilateral meshes m1 and m2 for drag evaluation of the dtmb 5512 and kcs are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 the grid numbers of the half ship hull of dtmb 5512 and kcs are 3000 and 2560 respectively as for the drag coefficient of dtmb 5512 the experimental measurements conducted by iowa institute of hydraulic research iihr longo and stern 1998 and the numerical results are plotted in fig 5 where f n u s g l is froude number the experimental measurements van et al 2000 and the numerical results of wave drag coefficient for kcs are plotted in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 5 that both the wave drag coefficient and total drag coefficient of dtmb 5512 calculated by the in house computer program show good agreement with the experimental measurements especially when the froude number fn is greater than 0 25 fig 6 shows that the in house computer program can also be utilized to the wave drag simulation for kcs in addition the time consumption of the numerical calculation of the wave drag for dtmb 5512 is about 5 s per froude number on a server 2 3 ghz intel xeon gold 5218 with a 60 thread openmp acceleration strategy therefore the in house computer program based on the nm theory can perform efficient and accurate resistance simulation on dtmb 5512 and thus it can be used during the optimization cycles the objective function f 1 related to the total drag of the prototype of dtmb 5512 at fn 0 28 can be expressed as follows 7 f 1 r t f n 0 28 3 2 vertical motion performance evaluation via 3dtp ls in this paper only the vertical motions of a ship in head waves are considered when optimizing the ship motion performance the 3dtp ls green s function derived by our team liang et al 2016 is employed to solve ship radiation and diffraction problems and further to evaluate the heave and pitch motion raos of a ship advancing in regular head waves as shown in fig 7 a right handed moving coordinate system o xyz translating with the speed u s of the ship is considered the x axis points to the direction of the speed u s the z axis is vertical to the xoy plane and points upward and the origin is placed on the mean undisturbed free surface the incident wave angle β represents the angle between the wave propagation direction and the positive x axis and is set to be 180 in this paper 3 2 1 mathematical model of ship motion in regular waves within the framework of three dimensional frequency domain potential flow theory the total velocity potential φ x y z t used to describe the flow field around the ship advancing in regular waves can be decomposed as follows 8 φ x y z t φ s x y z re φ i x y z φ d x y z φ r x y z e i ω e t where φ s in eq 2 represents the time independent potential φ i φ d and φ r denote the spatial parts of incident wave potential diffraction potential and radiation potential respectively ω e is the encounter frequency of incident wave and can be formulated as follows 9 ω e ω k u s cos β here ω and k denote the incident wave natural frequency and wavenumber respectively the radiation potential φ r can be further decomposed as 10 φ r x y z i ω e j 1 6 x j φ j where φ j is the normalized radiation potential in the j th mode and x j represents the complex amplitude of the ship motion in the corresponding mode in order to obtain the potential φ d and φ j j 1 2 6 the constant panel method where the boundary integral equation bie is discretized by using a series of quadrilateral panels is used in this paper the translating pulsating source green s function g used in the discrete bie can be decomposed into rankine source g s and froude dependent component g f for the calculation of the panel integrals of rankine source over a quadrilateral panel the gauss quadrature is employed however to solve the numerical difficulty of the panel integrals of froude dependent component g f over a quadrilateral panel the different numerical integration strategy is used as follows ⅰ each panel is first discretized into a series of horizontal line segments along different z coordinates as shown in fig 8 and the integrals of g f and its partial derivatives along a horizontal line segment is derived by liang et al 2016 the integrals of g f along a horizontal line segment is called 3dtp ls green s function ⅱ as for the panel integrals along the vertical direction the gauss quadrature is used to accumulate the horizontal line segment integrals the reason is that froude dependent component g f is highly oscillated along the horizontal direction but smooth along the vertical direction near the free surface chen 2000 liang et al 2016 3 2 2 motion raos calculation in regular waves the unsteady force is decomposed into three parts the froude krylov force diffraction force and radiation force the wave exciting force represents the sum of froude krylov force and diffraction force and its complex amplitude in the k th direction can be expressed as follows 11 f k w ρ s b i ω e φ i φ d u s φ i φ d x n k d s meanwhile the radiation force due to 6 dof motions can be expressed as follows 12 f k r j 1 6 ρ ω e 2 x j s b φ j i u s ω e φ j x n k d s j 1 6 ω e 2 x j μ k j i ω e λ k j where μ kj and λ kj represent added mass and damping coefficients respectively then the wave induced motions of a ship in a regular wave can be obtained by solving the following equation 13 j 1 6 ω e 2 m k j μ k j i ω e λ k j c k j x j f k w k 1 2 6 where m kj are the generalized mass matrix and c kj represent the hydrostatic restoring coefficient matrix the experiments about the motion responses of dtmb 5512 in regular head waves are given in irvine et al 2008 then the validation study on the motion raos calculation can be performed for the dtmb 5512 to further verify the applicability of the present method 3dtp ls the kcs hull is selected the principal dimensions of these two hulls are shown in table 2 the quadrilateral meshes m3 and m4 of dtmb 5512 and kcs for motion simulation are illustrated in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively where the grid numbers of m1 and m2 are 600 and 682 the comparison between numerical results and experimental measurements of the heave and pitch motion raos of dtmb 5512 is shown in fig 11 where the dtmb 5512 advances in regular head waves with fn 0 19 0 28 and 0 41 the numerical results and experimental measurements simonsen et al 2013 of heave and pitch motion raos for kcs advancing in regular head waves with fn 0 26 are plotted in fig 12 it can be seen from figs 11 and 12 that the numerical results show good agreement with the experimental measurements of heave and pitch motion raos moreover the time consumption of the numerical calculation mentioned above is approximately 15 s per frequency on a server 2 3 ghz intel xeon gold 5218 with a 60 thread openmp acceleration strategy therefore the present method is accurate and efficient and can be utilized during the optimization cycles 3 2 3 motion response simulation in irregular head waves the 2 parameter wave spectrum recommended by the 12th ittc is selected in this paper as follows 14 s ζ ω 173 h 1 3 2 t 1 4 ω 5 exp 691 t 1 4 ω 4 where h 1 3 is the significant wave height and t 1 represents the characteristic wave period within the framework of linear potential theory the dtmb 5512 and its prototype have the same motion rao at the same λ l according to the dispersion relation of regular waves with infinite depth the wave frequency can be expressed as 15 ω g k 2 π g λ 2 π g l λ l where λ is wavelength so the motion raos of the prototype of dtmb 5512 advancing in regular head waves can be obtained at a series of frequencies finally the motion responses of the prototype of dtmb 5512 advancing in irregular head waves can be obtained by the following formula 16 s r ω r a o ω 2 s ζ ω where s r is the motion response spectrum and s ζ is the selected wave spectrum the significant wave height and characteristic period of the 2 parameter ittc spectrum are set as 1 88m and 8 8s respectively to characterize the sea state of level 4 the significant amplitude of motion response in the i th mode can be expressed as follows 17 m 0 x i 0 s r i ω d ω x i a 1 3 2 0 m 0 x i where m 0xi is the zeroth moment of motion response spectrum in the i th mode and x ia1 3 denotes the significant amplitude in the i th mode the vertical motion response spectra of the prototype of dtmb 5512 at fn 0 28 under the selected wave energy spectrum are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 it can be seen that the selected wave energy spectrum has an energy concentration frequency region and the vertical motion rao curves have resonance frequency regions which results in the vertical motion response spectrum curves generating the response concentration frequency regions in addition the resonance frequency regions of the vertical motion raos roughly coincide with the energy concentration frequency region of wave energy spectrum under the sea state of level 4 which is why the sea state of level 4 is selected in order to reduce the optimization time consumption several frequencies based on the vertical response spectra of the prototype of dtmb 5512 are selected to characterize the response concentration frequency regions these frequencies and the corresponding wave parameters are shown in table 3 and used to calculate eq 17 then the objective functions f 2 and f 3 related to vertical motion performance at fn 0 28 can be expressed as follows 18 f 2 x 3 a 1 3 2 0 m 0 x 3 2 0 ω 1 ω 5 s r 3 ω d ω f 3 x 5 a 1 3 2 0 m 0 x 5 2 0 ω 1 ω 5 s r 5 ω d ω where x 3a1 3 denotes the significant amplitude of heave motion and x 5a1 3 represents the significant amplitude of pitch motion 3 3 hull surface deformation based on nurbs surfaces the hull surface representation and deformation module is an important part of hull form optimization which directly determines the definition of design variables vector and the expression of final optimal hull it can be known that the grid number of m1 used for resistance evaluation is much larger than that of m3 used for motion simulation then these two meshes m1 and m3 are quite different in this case if hull form deformation is achieved by moving the nodes of quadrilateral mesh the final optimization results will be two meshes of an optimal hull which cannot be directly applied to the subsequent design process therefore the initial half hull surface has been represented as several non uniform rational b spline nurbs surfaces and saved in iges file format before hull form deformation which is completed by commercial cad software the relevant mathematical theory of a nurbs surface is given in the appendix a in order to simplify the mesh generation based on nurbs surfaces the positive half of mean wetted hull surface of initial hull is represented as a nurbs surface based on the quadrilateral mesh m1 the procedure of representing the positive half of wetted hull surface as a nurbs surface is shown in fig 15 which can be divided into two steps a modeling and normalization of initial hull surface through the commercial software catia b meshing of the positive half of wetted hull surface and exporting the mesh m1 as a nurbs surface through the commercial software pointwise the mesh m1 can be obtained by substituting u v from the vectors u d and v d into the nurbs surface s u v in turn and the mesh m3 can be obtained by vectors u m and v m these vectors u d v d u m and v m can be expressed as follows 19 u d a u 2 d u r 1 1 d b v d c v 2 d v s 1 1 d d u m a u 2 m u r 2 1 m b v m c v 2 m v s 2 1 m d for a hull with more complicated mean wetted hull surface it can be divided into several parts for mesh generation then these meshes can be export as several nubrs surfaces in this case the generation of the two different meshes m1 and m3 is slightly more complicated based on these nurbs surfaces the combined method which moves nurbs control points by using other deformation methods is applied to deform the hull surface in this paper it should be noted that the application object of all deformation methods described later is nurbs control points so no matter how many nurbs surfaces the initial hull surface is represented as the subsequent deformation methods are applicable note that the three dimensional coordinates of control point of the nurbs surfaces are nondimensionalized by the ship length l 3 3 1 global deformation of hull form the shifting method and modified affine transformation are adopted to implement the global deformation of hull form the shifting method was first proposed by lackenby 1950 then there are various forms have been proposed by other scholars e g kim and yang 2010 based on the form proposed by kim and yang 2010 with some modifications conducted the movement amount of a nurbs control point along the longitudinal direction is expressed as follows 20 g x β 1 0 5 1 cos 2 π x x 1 x 2 x 1 x 1 x x 2 β 2 0 5 1 cos 2 π x x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 x x 3 β 3 0 5 1 cos 2 π x x 4 x 5 x 4 x 5 x x 4 0 e l s e w h e r e here g x denotes the amount of longitudinal movement of a nurbs control point x 1 x 5 are the endpoint of the three intervals where x 1 0 1 x 3 0 48 x 4 0 1 x 5 0 48 and x 2 is determined during the optimization cycles β 1 β 2 and β 3 represent the amplitudes of g x in the three intervals and are determined during the optimization cycles since the nurbs surfaces is nondimensionalized by the ship length l the values of x 1 x 5 make the intervals x 1 x 3 and x 5 x 4 roughly cover the inflow and outflow sections of a hull respectively the modified affine transformation is adopted to modify the ship beam of initial ship hull in the present paper the transverse coordinate y m of each control point on the modified nurbs surfaces is expressed as follows 21 y m y 1 f p z w i t h f p z p c m 0 z p c m 0 5 1 cos π z t n d γ t n d z 0 0 z t n d where y represents the transverse coordinate of a nurbs control point f p z is a proportional coefficient function determined by the coordinate z of a nurbs control point p c m denotes the magnitude of proportional coefficient function and is determined during the optimization cycles t n d t l is the dimensionless draft γ denotes the degree of proportionality coefficient function and is determined during the optimization cycles the significance of this formulation is to reduce the variation of ship displacement when modifying the ship beam if the magnitude p c m and dimensionless draft t nd are set as 1 a series of proportional coefficient functions f p z can be plotted in fig 16 it can be seen that the proportional coefficient function is smooth at different degree γ 3 3 2 local deformation of hull form in the fore body the radial basis function rbf interpolation method is adopted to implement the local deformation of hull form in the fore body including bulbous bow the general form of the interpolation buhmann 2003 can be expressed as follows 22 s x j 1 n λ j r x c j where x x y z denote the three dimensional coordinates of a nurbs control point s x represents the displacement of a nurbs control point c j c j x c j y c j z is the control point of radial basis function n is the number of control points of rbf interpolation r is a given radial basis function usually a linear polynomial p x b 1 b 2 x b 3 y b 4 z is added to the right of eq 22 to cover the translation and rotation transformation rendall and allen 2008 which is omitted in this paper the radial basis function r in eq 22 is defined based on the beckert wendland c2 function as follows 23 r x c j 1 x c j 4 4 x c j 1 it should be noted that the value of support radius of the beckert wendland c2 function has a great influence on the deformation based on rbf interpolation especially when the hull surface has been nondimensionalized by the ship length l in the present paper then the norm biasing rendall and allen 2008 is used as follows 24 x c j k x x c j x 2 k y y c j y 2 k z z c j z 2 where coefficients k x k y and k z can be regarded as a measurement of the importance of corresponding axis direction there are two types of control points of the radial basis function one is fixed and the other is movable the displacements of fixed control points equal to zero to keep the nurbs surfaces near them undeformed and the displacements of movable control points are determined during the optimization cycles the parameters λ j in eq 22 are determined by the interpolation conditions 25 s c i d i i 1 2 n where d i denote the displacements of control points of the radial basis function the position distribution of movable control points in this paper is based on investigations of kim and yang 2010 with some modifications conducted the distribution of 7 movable control points and the bidirectional net formed by the nurbs control points are plotted in fig 17 where the movable control points are indicated by red squares and attached to the nurbs control net the distribution of fixed control points is plotted in fig 18 where the fixed control points are denoted by blue circles the differences from the investigations of kim and yang 2010 are that the point no 5 can move along three spatial directions x y z the point no 6 can move only along x direction the point no 7 is additional and can move along two spatial directions x z the specific movement of 7 movable control points is introduced as follows the points no 1 2 are approximately at x 0 2 and no 3 4 are approximately at x 0 35 which can move along y direction to modify the shape of fore body the point no 5 can move along y and z direction to modify the width and height of bulbous bow respectively the points no 5 6 can move along x direction to modify the length of the bulbous bow and the movement distance of point no 5 along x direction is half of that of point no 6 the point no 7 can move along x and z direction respectively to assist the modification of the length and height of bulbous bow the movement distance of point no 7 along x direction is half of that of point no 6 and the movement distance of point no 7 along z direction is half of that of point no 5 all movement distances mentioned above are determined during the optimization cycles 3 3 3 local deformation of hull form in the aft body the free form deformation ffd method is adopted to implement the local deformation of hull form in the aft body the relevant mathematical formula of ffd is given in sederberg and parry 1986 the key to using the ffd to deform the nurbs hull surfaces is the formed lattice and the movement of control points located in the formed lattice in this paper the distribution of the control points located in the formed lattice is plotted in fig 19 where the coordinates of the lower left corner and upper right corner of lattice are 0 5015 0 001 0 0645 and 0 5684 0 072 0 0704 the green octahedrons denote the fixed control points located in the lattice the red spheres represent the movable control points located in the lattice the blue cubes denote the transitional control points located in the lattice the movable control points and transitional control points can move along y direction to deform the aft body the movement distance of movable control points remains unchanged in the x direction and linearly decreases to zero along the negative direction of y axis the maximum movement distance of transitional control points is half of that of movable control point and the movement also linearly decreases to zero along the negative direction of y axis the maximum movement distance m ffd of the movable control point located in the lattice is determined during the optimization cycles according to all the deformation methods mentioned above there are 14 design variables need to be determined during the optimization cycles the definition and value range of these design variables are shown in table 4 the optimization algorithm nsga ii is employed to solve the present multi objective optimization problem and for each individual in the population of each generation the procedure of obtaining three objective functions according to the design variable vector x is shown in fig 20 it should be noted that the longitudinal and vertical positions of center of gravity and the pitch gyration radius are kept fixed during the optimization process the reason is that these three parameters are determined by the mass distribution of ship and little affected by the design variable vector x in addition the small changes caused by the design variable vector x can be balanced by stowage during construction 4 results and analysis in order to make the optimization results clearer the three objective functions can be further expressed as follows 26 f i o b j f i d e f f i i n i f i i n i i 1 2 3 where the superscript ini indicates the initial hull the superscript def indicates the deformed ship hull f 1 o b j f 2 o b j f 3 o b j represent the objective functions related to total resistance heave motion response and pitch motion response of the prototype of dtmb 5512 respectively 4 1 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis is conducted to judge whether the design variables determined by the above hull form deformation methods are effective during the optimization cycles when studying the effect of each design variable except variable 4 and variable 6 on the objective functions the variable being analyzed increases linearly within a given value range while other variables are equal to the middle values of corresponding value ranges the extra requirements for studying variable 4 are that variable 1 and variable 2 are equal to the corresponding maximum values and the extra requirement for studying variable 6 is that variable 5 is equal to the corresponding maximum value it should be mentioned that only the change in variable 5 variable 6 or variable 14 within the given value range will cause the absolute value of the relative change in ship s displacement to be greater than 1 the effects of design variables on the first objective function are plotted in fig 21 where the variables are nondimensionalized in terms of the corresponding maximum values it can be seen that the variables that have considerable effect on the first objective function are variable 11 and variable 12 used to modify the length and width of bulbous bow respectively the effects of design variables on the second and third objective functions are plotted in fig 22 and fig 23 respectively the variables playing considerable effects on the second and third objective functions are variable 2 and variable 5 controlling the global deformation and variable 11 controlling the length of the bulbous bow different from the total resistance which is mainly affected by the deformation of bulbous bow the vertical motion responses are simultaneously affected by the deformation of bulbous bow the deformation of fore body and the modification of ship beam which results in the requirements of 14 variables for the hull form deformation from the above sensitivity analysis we can find that most design variables have an effect on one or more of the three objective functions which means that the hull surface deformation methods in the present paper are effective moreover compared with other variables variable 5 controlling the modification of ship beam has a significant effect on vertical motion responses but has a weak effect on total drag in order to study the effect of changing the value range of variable 5 on the possibility of simultaneously obtaining reduced total resistance and improved vertical motion performance the feasible region of present optimization design is divided into two parts by dividing the value range of variable 5 into two parts 0 04 0 and 0 0 04 and the optimization designs in the two feasible regions are denoted as case 1 and case 2 4 2 optimization results the nsga ii is employed to the optimization design for the prototype of dtmb 5512 where the maximum number of iterations is set as 100 and the population size is set as 50 in both cases the stopping criterion adopted by the present optimization is that the number of iterations reaches the set maximum number of iterations the total time consumption in both cases is about 5 days which proves the effectiveness of the present hydrodynamic optimization tool it should be stated that all the following comparison and variations are conducted among the optimal hulls and initial hull the obtained pareto optimal sets for three objective functions in two cases are plotted in fig 24 it can be observed from fig 24 b and c that there is a negative correlation between the objective functions f 1 o b j and f 2 o b j f 1 o b j and f 3 o b j on the pareto optimal front for both cases the negative correlations indicate that an optimal hull with minimum vertical motions cannot have minimum total resistance and an optimal hull with increased total resistance usually have reduced vertical motions in addition it can be seen from fig 24 d that the second objective function is roughly positively correlated with the third objective function for both cases the roughly positive correlation means that the optimal hull with reduced heave motion owns high probability to present the reduced pitch motion feature while the optimal hull is unable to present minimum pitch motion feature when it owns minimum heave motion in case 2 it can be seen from fig 24 d that almost all ships on the pareto optimal front have reduced vertical motions the reason is that variable 5 has converged to the interval 0 03 0 04 which indicates that the ship beams of all ships on the pareto optimal front in case 2 have increased moreover compared with case 1 the pareto optimal front in case 2 moves along the negative directions of the second and third objective functions but changes slightly in the direction of the first objective function the above analysis shows that by reasonably determining the feasible region of optimization design the probability of obtaining an optimal hull with reduced total resistance and improved vertical motion performance will increase and the improvement in vertical motion performance of this optimal hull will increase according to the work of maruo 1957 and hong et al 2016 the added resistance of a ship advancing in waves could be divided into two parts 27 r a w t r a w r r a w d where r a w r and r a w d represent the added resistance caused by radiation wave and diffraction wave respectively therefore when the heave and pitch motions of the ship advancing in head waves are reduced or increased the added resistance of the ship in head waves is probably to be reduced or increased in this way when the total resistance of the ship advancing in head waves is used as the first objective function the negative correlation between the objective functions f 1 o b j and f 2 o b j f 1 o b j and f 3 o b j will be weakened and the probability of obtaining the optimal hull with reduced heave and pitch motions and reduced total resistance will further increase in order to examine the optimization results in case 2 there are four optimal hull forms ship 1 ship 4 selected from the pareto optimal front that have been shown in fig 24 on the pareto optimal front the three optimal hull forms ship 1 ship 2 and ship 3 present the minimum values on the objective functions f 1 o b j f 2 o b j f 3 o b j respectively and the optimal hull form ship 4 presents negative values on three objective functions the relative changes in the displacements of four optimal hulls are 0 81 0 37 0 52 and 0 42 in turn therefore all four optimal hulls meet the displacement constraint 4 2 1 resistance of four optimal hulls the solver based on potential flow is called low fidelity cfd solver later in this paper the comparison of wave drag coefficients and total resistance calculated by the low fidelity cfd solver between the four optimal hulls is plotted in fig 25 and fig 26 respectively it can be seen that ship 1 and ship 4 have appreciable reductions in the wave drag coefficients and total resistance over the entire range of froude numbers while the wave drag coefficients and total resistance of ship 2 and ship 3 are increased the relative changes in wetted surface area of four optimal hulls are 0 37 0 47 0 42 and 0 45 in turn the relative changes in wave drag coefficient and total resistance calculated by the low fidelity cfd solver are shown in table 5 where negative numbers indicate decrease and positive numbers indicate increase to further validate the resistance of four optimal hulls the high fidelity cfd solver that is based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations is used during rans cfd simulations the four optimal hulls are transformed into four models with a length equal to 3 048 m through affine transformation and the initial hull is taken as dtmb 5512 to perform rans cfd simulations the commercial software simcenter star ccm siemens 2017 is used standard k ε turbulence with all y wall treatment model of turbulence is chosen following many other studies such as tezdogan et al 2015 and kim et al 2017 free surface is captured by volume of fluid vof method the initial and four optimal hulls are allowed to move freely in the sinkage and trim directions with two degrees of freedom in the simulations dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model shivachev et al 2020 is applied to simulate the 2 dof ship motions it should be noted that the mass and moment of inertia of the four optimal hulls are equal to those of the initial hull the grid convergence study for the initial hull at fn 0 28 has been carried out the results of uncertainty analysis for friction resistance r f pressure resistance r p and total resistance r t are shown in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that grid uncertainty test results in a monotonic convergence for all three kinds of resistance in addition the relative errors between the total resistance obtained by the three meshes and the experimental measurement are all within 3 after the grid convergence study the medium mesh with 1 64 million control volumes is used in the simulation of initial hull at fn 0 28 the medium mesh for resistance simulation is presented in fig 27 the simulation results calculated by star ccm are presented in table 7 where rc denotes the relative change in resistance of four optimal hulls compared with that of initial hull by comparing tables 5 and 7 for four optimal hulls we can obtain that the change trend of total resistance obtained by high fidelity cfd solver is consistent with that obtained by low fidelity cfd solver while the relative change in total resistance obtained by high fidelity cfd solver is smaller than that obtained by low fidelity cfd solver the reason is that the low fidelity cfd solver is based on the potential flow and ignores the viscous pressure coupling effect and the nonlinear effect moreover at fn 0 28 ship 1 has achieved the greatest total resistance reduction and ship 2 has achieved the greatest total resistance increase which is consistent with the simulation results obtained by low fidelity cfd solver the comparison of wave profiles between the initial hull and optimal hulls ship 1 and ship 2 calculated by star ccm is plotted in fig 28 at fn 0 28 the wave profiles of ship 1 and ship 2 present a large rise and fall in the bow wave trough region and a small fall and rise in the bow wave crest region the changes in the profiles of ship 1 and ship 2 cause the pressure at the bow of two optimal hulls to decrease and increase respectively as a result the pressure resistance of ship 1 and ship 2 is reduced and increased respectively the comparison of wave patterns between the initial hull and optimal hulls ship 1 and ship 2 calculated by star ccm is presented in fig 29 where the wave patterns of ship 1 and ship 2 present obvious changes the simulation results based on star ccm have verified the applicability and effectiveness of low fidelity cfd solver to compute total resistance during the optimization process 4 2 2 vertical motion performance of four optimal hulls in order to examine the vertical motion performance of four optimal hulls in irregular head waves the heave and pitch motion raos of four optimal hulls in regular head waves are first calculated via 3dtp ls green s function over a wide frequency range the comparison of added mass and damping coefficients between the initial hull and four optimal hulls at fn 0 28 is plotted in fig 30 where the interval 3 2 3 7 of dimensionless encounter frequency ω e l g corresponds to the interval 0 535 0 595 of incident wave frequency ω it can be seen that the difference in added mass and damping coefficients between these hulls is slight the comparison of vertical motion raos between these hulls at fn 0 28 is plotted in fig 31 it can be observed that ship 2 and ship 3 present the maximum reduction in heave and pitch motion rao during the resonance frequency region respectively in addition the vertical motion rao curves of ship 2 and ship 3 are roughly the same the peak frequencies damped natural frequencies of heave motion rao curves of four optimal hulls are shifted compared with that of initial hull and these peak frequencies are different from each other the same peak frequency shift phenomenon has been found in the pitch motion rao curves of four optimal hulls according to the analysis of chakrabarti 1987 the peak frequency of heave or pitch motion rao curve is affected by the combined effect of generalized mass added mass damping coefficient and hydrostatic restoring coefficient therefore the cause of the peak frequency shift phenomenon is the combined effect of the changes in these quantities caused by hull surface deformation the relative changes in peak values of vertical motion rao curves calculated by potential flow solver are shown in table 8 to further validate the heave and pitch motion raos of four optimal hulls the rans cfd simulations are performed based on star ccm the initial hull and optimal hulls ship 2 and ship 4 are selected for vertical motion simulation and these hulls are transformed into models with a length equal to 3 048 m the reason for choosing ship 2 and ship 4 is that the vertical motion raos of ship 2 and ship 3 calculated by potential flow solver are similar and the vertical motion raos of ship 1 present the smallest changes compared with those of other three optimal hulls the incident waves are represented as fifth order stokes waves following the study of cakici et al 2018 and damping zone is set at the side and outlet boundary turbulence model free surface capture model and motion simulation model are consistent with the settings of calm water resistance simulation for the motion simulation in each regular wave the time step size is set to be 1 256 of wave encounter period t e following the study of cakici et al 2018 five incident waves with different wavelengths are selected for the rans cfd simulations of vertical motion the relevant information of these incident waves is shown in table 9 where ζ a k denote wave steepness the grid convergence study for motion simulation of initial hull with λ l 1 293 at fn 0 28 is first implemented the results of uncertainty analysis for vertical motion raos are show in table 10 where the grid uncertainty test results in a monotonic convergence for both heave and pitch motion raos then the medium mesh with 2 79 million control volumes is used in the motion simulations of three hulls with λ l 1 293 which is presented in fig 32 note that the grid generation settings of three hulls in each incident wave are exactly the same in addition the basic size of the grid generation at different wavelengths has been slightly adjusted the computed time series of heave and pitch motions of three hulls with different wavelengths calculated by star ccm are plotted in fig 33 and fig 34 after the fourier transform calculations of vertical motion time series the x 3 and x 5 of three hulls in different incident waves can be obtained then the vertical motion raos of three hulls can be calculated these vertical motion raos as well as the experimental measurements of dtmb 5512 are plotted in fig 35 it can be obtained from figs 31 and 35 that the change trends of vertical motion raos of ship 2 and ship 4 obtained by star ccm are consistent with those calculated by potential flow solver while the relative changes in vertical motion raos obtained by star ccm are smaller than those calculated by potential flow solver moreover ship 2 presents smaller heave motion raos compared to those of ship 4 which is consistent with the simulation results calculated by potential flow solver the vertical motion simulation results obtained by star ccm have verified the applicability of the potential flow solver based on 3dtp ls green s function to simulate vertical motion raos during the optimization process three sea states are selected to examine the vertical motion performance of four optimal hulls in irregular head waves the significant wave heights characteristic wave periods peak frequencies ω p and wave energy density spectra of these three sea states are plotted in fig 36 the vertical motion response spectra of four optimal hulls under three sea states at fn 0 28 are calculated which are plotted in fig 37 the relative changes in significant amplitudes of heave and pitch motion response spectra under three sea states are shown in table 11 it can be seen from fig 37 that there are obvious differences in the vertical motion response spectra of four optimal hulls between three sea states where the response concentration frequency regions move in the negative direction of axis with the increase of characteristic period of sea state under the sea state of level 6 the frequency region where the main difference of heave motion response spectrum curve between four optimal hulls lies is staggered from the response concentration frequency region in addition for optimal hulls ship 1 and ship 4 the decrease amplitudes of pitch motion response spectra curves vary greatly with the change of sea state which is also reflected by the relative changes in significant amplitudes of pitch motion response spectra in table 11 therefore if the heave and pitch motion raos at the peak frequency of initial hull are determined as the objective functions related to vertical motion performance the heave and pitch motion performance of optimal hull in irregular head waves will not be guaranteed the above analyses show the importance and necessity of considering sea state when optimizing the vertical motion performance of the ship advancing in irregular head waves the frequency region where the main difference between the vertical motion response spectra under the sea state of level 4 is located proves the feasibility and practicality of using several frequencies to characterize the response concentration frequency regions in this paper the comparison of hydrodynamic simulation results of ship 1 and ship 4 shows that a slight decrease in the magnitude of ship total resistance reduction can achieve the simultaneous reductions in its heave and pitch motion responses which shows the significance of this optimization tool the comparison of body plan profile plan of fore body and plan of waterlines between the four optimal hulls and initial hull is plotted in figs 38 39 and 40 it can be seen from figs 38 39 and 40 that all four optimal hulls have smooth body lines profiles and waterlines so that all four optimal hulls have smooth geometries 5 conclusions in the present paper a multi objective ship hydrodynamic optimization tool is presented and applied to the optimization design of the prototype of dtmb 5512 for reduced total resistance in calm water and improved vertical motion performance under the sea state of level 4 the total resistance and the significant amplitudes of vertical motion response spectra are determined as the optimization objective functions the total resistance in calm water is simulated based on the neumann michell theory and the motion response spectra in irregular head waves are calculated by the three dimensional potential flow solver based on translating and pulsating line segment source 3dtp ls green s function for dtmb 5512 the numerical calculation results of wave drag coefficients and vertical motion raos are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements which indicates that the two ship hydrodynamic simulation methods introduced in this paper can be employed during the optimization cycles moreover the results of calm water resistance simulations and vertical motion simulations based on star ccm show that the two low fidelity cfd solvers based on potential flow can catch the change trends of total resistance and vertical motion raos caused by hull form deformation which has further verified the applicability and effectiveness of the two low fidelity cfd solvers during the optimization process several nurbs based hull surface modification methods are presented in the present optimization tool to achieve the global and local deformation of hull form the essence of nurbs surfaces is to smooth the results obtained by other deformation methods thus the deformed hull forms have smoother geometries or the design variables determined by the hull form deformation can be varied in a larger variation range the smooth body lines profiles and waterlines of four optimal hulls have presented that the deformed hull forms generated by the present optimization tool own smooth surfaces for the two optimization designs case 1 is similar to the traditional optimization where the ship beam remains unchanged or decreases while the ship beam is only allowed to increase in case 2 to consider the vertical motion performance in waves the comparison of optimization results in case 1 and case 2 shows that a reasonable determination of feasible region for an optimization design can increase the possibility of obtaining the optimal ship with reduced total resistance and improved vertical motion performance which shows the practicality of the present optimization tool the obtained pareto optimal sets of both cases show that there is a negative correlation between the total resistance and vertical motion responses which is consistent with the engineering experience of ship designer and indicates the accuracy of the present optimization tool the comparison of hydrodynamic simulation results of ship 1 and ship 4 shows that a slight decrease in the magnitude of ship total resistance reduction can achieve the simultaneous reductions in its vertical motion responses which shows the significance and effectiveness of this optimization tool and is very meaningful to ship designers credit authorship contribution statement

frequency 1 introduction in most previous hull form optimization studies the hull forms were optimized for reduced resistance in calm water at one speed or several speeds campana et al 2006 cheng et al 2018 yang and huang 2016 according to the study of huang and yang 2016 the simulation based design sbd optimization tool consists of a hydrodynamic simulation module a hull surface representation and deformation module and an optimization algorithm module in addition a surrogate module is utilized to reduce optimization time consumption a sufficiently accurate and efficient method based on the neumann michell nm theory huang et al 2013 noblesse et al 2013 yang et al 2013 was utilized to optimize hull forms for reduced drag kim and yang 2010 2013 2013 huang and yang 2016 with the development of sbd optimization tools ship designers not only pursue the drag reduction but also pursue the improved seakeeping performance during the ship designing and optimizing the seakeeping ranking was determined as the objective function associated with seakeeping performance by kim et al 2010 where bales seakeeping ranking method was used the seakeeping ranking can be quickly calculated through the empirical formula but can only roughly characterize the seakeeping performance the ship s seakeeping performance includes the 6 dof motions of a ship sailing in rough sea and the slamming splashing etc caused by these motions there are some hull form optimizations considering the ship motion performance in waves as follows the peak values of unimodal response amplitude operator rao curves of the absolute vertical acceleration were determined as the objective functions associated with motion performance by grigoropoulos and chalkias 2010 and the strip theory was used for the motion performance evaluation similarly huang et al 2015 used the peaks of heave and pitch motion rao curves of the ship hull advancing in head seas as the objective functions associated with motion performance and a ship motion program smp based on the strip theory was employed to calculate the heave and pitch motion raos there are some other studies bagheri et al 2014 diez et al 2015 on the optimization tools for improved motion performance in waves where the strip theory is also employed the theoretical derivation of the strip theory is based on the assumptions of high frequency and low speed liu and miao 1986 thus the strip theory can only roughly predict the heave and pitch motion raos of a ship in addition the peak values of heave and pitch motion rao curves cannot fully represent the heave and pitch motion performance of a ship hull in irregular head waves in the present paper only the vertical i e heave and pitch motions of a ship in head waves are considered and a multi objective high efficiency potential flow based ship hydrodynamic optimization tool is presented to optimize a ship for reduced total resistance in calm water and improved vertical motion performance in irregular head waves in this optimization tool an in house computer program based on the nm theory for ship resistance in calm water is presented and utilized during the optimization cycles in order to optimize the vertical motion performance of a ship in irregular head waves the significant amplitudes of heave and pitch motion response spectra in irregular head waves are determined as objective functions moreover to obtain a high efficiency and more reliable result of ship motion in waves the three dimensional potential flow solver by using translating and pulsating line segment source 3dtp ls green s function liang et al 2016 is employed to solve ship radiation and diffraction problems and further to evaluate the heave and pitch motion raos of a ship hull in regular waves the hydrodynamic simulation module of present optimization tool requires two meshes and the grid numbers of these two meshes differ from each other greatly therefore before the hull form deformation the initial hull is represented as non uniform rational b spline nurbs surfaces and saved in iges file format then all the hull surface modification methods in the present optimization tool are based on nurbs surfaces there are two kinds of hull surface modification methods based on nurbs surfaces the first one called direct method is to directly move the control points of nurbs surfaces kim et al 2008 wang 2015 the other one called combined method is to move the control points of nurbs surfaces by combining with other deformation methods yang et al 2016 the combined method only requires fewer design variables to achieve hull form deformation compared with the direct method and is utilized in this optimization tool for the purpose of validation this optimization tool is applied to the optimization design of the prototype of dtmb 5512 for reduced total resistance in calm water and improved vertical motion performance under the sea state of level 4 two cases are used to study the effect of the determination of feasible region for an optimization design on the possibility of simultaneously obtaining reduced total resistance and improved vertical motion performance four optimal hulls are selected from the pareto optimal front in case 2 to verify this optimization tool the resistance and vertical motion response spectra of these four optimal hulls are investigated moreover the resistance and vertical motion raos are further verified by the rans cfd simulations the smooth body lines profiles and waterlines of four optimal hulls present that the deformed hull forms yielded by the present optimization tool own smooth surfaces moreover the optimal hull ship 4 owns reduced total resistance and improved vertical motion performance which presents the effectiveness of present optimization tool 2 problem statement the optimization tool proposed in this paper is essentially to solve a multi objective hull form optimization problem as follows 1 min f i x i 1 2 3 x x 1 d x 2 d x n d t s r n s t h x 0 where f i x denote the objective functions x represents the n dimensional design variables vector composed of the parameters controlling the hull form deformation s is a subset of n dimensional space composed of the value range of design variables and h x denotes the displacement constraint of this optimization problem in the present paper the displacement constraint is taken as the absolute value of relative change in ship s displacement which is smaller than 1 in order to demonstrate this hydrodynamic optimization tool the prototype of dtmb 5512 is selected as the optimization object the dtmb 5512 is a 1 46 6 scale model of a navy surface combatant and the principal dimensions of the full scale ship are shown in table 1 the geometry of dtmb 5512 is plotted in fig 1 3 methodology in the optimization algorithm module of this optimization tool the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 is employed to solve the multi objective hull form optimization problem the hydrodynamic simulation module will be introduced in sections 3 1 and 3 2 and the hull surface representation and deformation module will be introduced in section 3 3 3 1 wave drag evaluation based on the nm theory the wave drag generated by a ship advancing in calm water is an extremely important hydrodynamic factor for ship design and optimization the nm theory proposed by noblesse et al 2013 is employed in this paper to evaluate the wave drag the nm theory is developed based on the classical neumann kelvin nk theory and the great improvement is that the troublesome line integral around ship waterline that occurs in the nk flow representation has been eliminated in the nm theory as shown in fig 2 a right handed inertial coordinate system o xyz attached to the ship of length l is established where the x axis points toward ship bow the z axis is vertical upward the mean free surface taken as the plane z 0 and n denotes the unit normal vector of hull surface and points into water therefore it can be considered that the total flow velocity is the sum of the uniform stream u s 0 0 opposite to the speed of ship hull and the disturbance flow velocity u d u d x u d y u d z caused by the ship hull the time independent potential φ s due to the steady forward motion of a ship can be expressed as follows 2 φ s x y z u s x φ x y z where φ represents the disturbance potential due to the ship hull advancing at speed u s in calm water the in house computer program based on the nm theory where the mean wetted ship hull surface is discretized into a series of quadrilateral panels is presented in this paper and employed to obtain the disturbance potential then the dynamic pressure p can be obtained by the bernoulli relation as follows 3 p ρ u s φ x φ x 2 φ y 2 φ z 2 2 where ρ denotes the density of water the wave drag coefficient c w can be expressed as follows 4 c w r w 0 5 ρ u s 2 s w e t σ h p n x d a 0 5 ρ u s 2 s w e t where r w is wave drag σ h denotes the mean wetted ship hull surface and s wet is the area of the mean wetted ship hull surface the frictional drag coefficient can be evaluated using the ittc 1957 model ship correlation line as follows 5 c f r f 0 5 ρ u s 2 s w e t 0 0075 log 10 re 2 2 where re is reynolds number and r f denotes friction drag the total drag coefficient is expressed as follows 6 c t r t 0 5 ρ u s 2 s w e t c f c w where r t denotes total drag in this paper the total drag coefficient is approximately taken as the sum of wave drag coefficient and frictional drag coefficient in order to use the nm theory for wave drag evaluation during the optimization process a validation study on the drag evaluation of the dtmb 5512 needs to be performed firstly moreover the kriso container ship kcs is selected to further verify the applicability of the nm theory the quadrilateral meshes m1 and m2 for drag evaluation of the dtmb 5512 and kcs are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 the grid numbers of the half ship hull of dtmb 5512 and kcs are 3000 and 2560 respectively as for the drag coefficient of dtmb 5512 the experimental measurements conducted by iowa institute of hydraulic research iihr longo and stern 1998 and the numerical results are plotted in fig 5 where f n u s g l is froude number the experimental measurements van et al 2000 and the numerical results of wave drag coefficient for kcs are plotted in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 5 that both the wave drag coefficient and total drag coefficient of dtmb 5512 calculated by the in house computer program show good agreement with the experimental measurements especially when the froude number fn is greater than 0 25 fig 6 shows that the in house computer program can also be utilized to the wave drag simulation for kcs in addition the time consumption of the numerical calculation of the wave drag for dtmb 5512 is about 5 s per froude number on a server 2 3 ghz intel xeon gold 5218 with a 60 thread openmp acceleration strategy therefore the in house computer program based on the nm theory can perform efficient and accurate resistance simulation on dtmb 5512 and thus it can be used during the optimization cycles the objective function f 1 related to the total drag of the prototype of dtmb 5512 at fn 0 28 can be expressed as follows 7 f 1 r t f n 0 28 3 2 vertical motion performance evaluation via 3dtp ls in this paper only the vertical motions of a ship in head waves are considered when optimizing the ship motion performance the 3dtp ls green s function derived by our team liang et al 2016 is employed to solve ship radiation and diffraction problems and further to evaluate the heave and pitch motion raos of a ship advancing in regular head waves as shown in fig 7 a right handed moving coordinate system o xyz translating with the speed u s of the ship is considered the x axis points to the direction of the speed u s the z axis is vertical to the xoy plane and points upward and the origin is placed on the mean undisturbed free surface the incident wave angle β represents the angle between the wave propagation direction and the positive x axis and is set to be 180 in this paper 3 2 1 mathematical model of ship motion in regular waves within the framework of three dimensional frequency domain potential flow theory the total velocity potential φ x y z t used to describe the flow field around the ship advancing in regular waves can be decomposed as follows 8 φ x y z t φ s x y z re φ i x y z φ d x y z φ r x y z e i ω e t where φ s in eq 2 represents the time independent potential φ i φ d and φ r denote the spatial parts of incident wave potential diffraction potential and radiation potential respectively ω e is the encounter frequency of incident wave and can be formulated as follows 9 ω e ω k u s cos β here ω and k denote the incident wave natural frequency and wavenumber respectively the radiation potential φ r can be further decomposed as 10 φ r x y z i ω e j 1 6 x j φ j where φ j is the normalized radiation potential in the j th mode and x j represents the complex amplitude of the ship motion in the corresponding mode in order to obtain the potential φ d and φ j j 1 2 6 the constant panel method where the boundary integral equation bie is discretized by using a series of quadrilateral panels is used in this paper the translating pulsating source green s function g used in the discrete bie can be decomposed into rankine source g s and froude dependent component g f for the calculation of the panel integrals of rankine source over a quadrilateral panel the gauss quadrature is employed however to solve the numerical difficulty of the panel integrals of froude dependent component g f over a quadrilateral panel the different numerical integration strategy is used as follows ⅰ each panel is first discretized into a series of horizontal line segments along different z coordinates as shown in fig 8 and the integrals of g f and its partial derivatives along a horizontal line segment is derived by liang et al 2016 the integrals of g f along a horizontal line segment is called 3dtp ls green s function ⅱ as for the panel integrals along the vertical direction the gauss quadrature is used to accumulate the horizontal line segment integrals the reason is that froude dependent component g f is highly oscillated along the horizontal direction but smooth along the vertical direction near the free surface chen 2000 liang et al 2016 3 2 2 motion raos calculation in regular waves the unsteady force is decomposed into three parts the froude krylov force diffraction force and radiation force the wave exciting force represents the sum of froude krylov force and diffraction force and its complex amplitude in the k th direction can be expressed as follows 11 f k w ρ s b i ω e φ i φ d u s φ i φ d x n k d s meanwhile the radiation force due to 6 dof motions can be expressed as follows 12 f k r j 1 6 ρ ω e 2 x j s b φ j i u s ω e φ j x n k d s j 1 6 ω e 2 x j μ k j i ω e λ k j where μ kj and λ kj represent added mass and damping coefficients respectively then the wave induced motions of a ship in a regular wave can be obtained by solving the following equation 13 j 1 6 ω e 2 m k j μ k j i ω e λ k j c k j x j f k w k 1 2 6 where m kj are the generalized mass matrix and c kj represent the hydrostatic restoring coefficient matrix the experiments about the motion responses of dtmb 5512 in regular head waves are given in irvine et al 2008 then the validation study on the motion raos calculation can be performed for the dtmb 5512 to further verify the applicability of the present method 3dtp ls the kcs hull is selected the principal dimensions of these two hulls are shown in table 2 the quadrilateral meshes m3 and m4 of dtmb 5512 and kcs for motion simulation are illustrated in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively where the grid numbers of m1 and m2 are 600 and 682 the comparison between numerical results and experimental measurements of the heave and pitch motion raos of dtmb 5512 is shown in fig 11 where the dtmb 5512 advances in regular head waves with fn 0 19 0 28 and 0 41 the numerical results and experimental measurements simonsen et al 2013 of heave and pitch motion raos for kcs advancing in regular head waves with fn 0 26 are plotted in fig 12 it can be seen from figs 11 and 12 that the numerical results show good agreement with the experimental measurements of heave and pitch motion raos moreover the time consumption of the numerical calculation mentioned above is approximately 15 s per frequency on a server 2 3 ghz intel xeon gold 5218 with a 60 thread openmp acceleration strategy therefore the present method is accurate and efficient and can be utilized during the optimization cycles 3 2 3 motion response simulation in irregular head waves the 2 parameter wave spectrum recommended by the 12th ittc is selected in this paper as follows 14 s ζ ω 173 h 1 3 2 t 1 4 ω 5 exp 691 t 1 4 ω 4 where h 1 3 is the significant wave height and t 1 represents the characteristic wave period within the framework of linear potential theory the dtmb 5512 and its prototype have the same motion rao at the same λ l according to the dispersion relation of regular waves with infinite depth the wave frequency can be expressed as 15 ω g k 2 π g λ 2 π g l λ l where λ is wavelength so the motion raos of the prototype of dtmb 5512 advancing in regular head waves can be obtained at a series of frequencies finally the motion responses of the prototype of dtmb 5512 advancing in irregular head waves can be obtained by the following formula 16 s r ω r a o ω 2 s ζ ω where s r is the motion response spectrum and s ζ is the selected wave spectrum the significant wave height and characteristic period of the 2 parameter ittc spectrum are set as 1 88m and 8 8s respectively to characterize the sea state of level 4 the significant amplitude of motion response in the i th mode can be expressed as follows 17 m 0 x i 0 s r i ω d ω x i a 1 3 2 0 m 0 x i where m 0xi is the zeroth moment of motion response spectrum in the i th mode and x ia1 3 denotes the significant amplitude in the i th mode the vertical motion response spectra of the prototype of dtmb 5512 at fn 0 28 under the selected wave energy spectrum are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 it can be seen that the selected wave energy spectrum has an energy concentration frequency region and the vertical motion rao curves have resonance frequency regions which results in the vertical motion response spectrum curves generating the response concentration frequency regions in addition the resonance frequency regions of the vertical motion raos roughly coincide with the energy concentration frequency region of wave energy spectrum under the sea state of level 4 which is why the sea state of level 4 is selected in order to reduce the optimization time consumption several frequencies based on the vertical response spectra of the prototype of dtmb 5512 are selected to characterize the response concentration frequency regions these frequencies and the corresponding wave parameters are shown in table 3 and used to calculate eq 17 then the objective functions f 2 and f 3 related to vertical motion performance at fn 0 28 can be expressed as follows 18 f 2 x 3 a 1 3 2 0 m 0 x 3 2 0 ω 1 ω 5 s r 3 ω d ω f 3 x 5 a 1 3 2 0 m 0 x 5 2 0 ω 1 ω 5 s r 5 ω d ω where x 3a1 3 denotes the significant amplitude of heave motion and x 5a1 3 represents the significant amplitude of pitch motion 3 3 hull surface deformation based on nurbs surfaces the hull surface representation and deformation module is an important part of hull form optimization which directly determines the definition of design variables vector and the expression of final optimal hull it can be known that the grid number of m1 used for resistance evaluation is much larger than that of m3 used for motion simulation then these two meshes m1 and m3 are quite different in this case if hull form deformation is achieved by moving the nodes of quadrilateral mesh the final optimization results will be two meshes of an optimal hull which cannot be directly applied to the subsequent design process therefore the initial half hull surface has been represented as several non uniform rational b spline nurbs surfaces and saved in iges file format before hull form deformation which is completed by commercial cad software the relevant mathematical theory of a nurbs surface is given in the appendix a in order to simplify the mesh generation based on nurbs surfaces the positive half of mean wetted hull surface of initial hull is represented as a nurbs surface based on the quadrilateral mesh m1 the procedure of representing the positive half of wetted hull surface as a nurbs surface is shown in fig 15 which can be divided into two steps a modeling and normalization of initial hull surface through the commercial software catia b meshing of the positive half of wetted hull surface and exporting the mesh m1 as a nurbs surface through the commercial software pointwise the mesh m1 can be obtained by substituting u v from the vectors u d and v d into the nurbs surface s u v in turn and the mesh m3 can be obtained by vectors u m and v m these vectors u d v d u m and v m can be expressed as follows 19 u d a u 2 d u r 1 1 d b v d c v 2 d v s 1 1 d d u m a u 2 m u r 2 1 m b v m c v 2 m v s 2 1 m d for a hull with more complicated mean wetted hull surface it can be divided into several parts for mesh generation then these meshes can be export as several nubrs surfaces in this case the generation of the two different meshes m1 and m3 is slightly more complicated based on these nurbs surfaces the combined method which moves nurbs control points by using other deformation methods is applied to deform the hull surface in this paper it should be noted that the application object of all deformation methods described later is nurbs control points so no matter how many nurbs surfaces the initial hull surface is represented as the subsequent deformation methods are applicable note that the three dimensional coordinates of control point of the nurbs surfaces are nondimensionalized by the ship length l 3 3 1 global deformation of hull form the shifting method and modified affine transformation are adopted to implement the global deformation of hull form the shifting method was first proposed by lackenby 1950 then there are various forms have been proposed by other scholars e g kim and yang 2010 based on the form proposed by kim and yang 2010 with some modifications conducted the movement amount of a nurbs control point along the longitudinal direction is expressed as follows 20 g x β 1 0 5 1 cos 2 π x x 1 x 2 x 1 x 1 x x 2 β 2 0 5 1 cos 2 π x x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 x x 3 β 3 0 5 1 cos 2 π x x 4 x 5 x 4 x 5 x x 4 0 e l s e w h e r e here g x denotes the amount of longitudinal movement of a nurbs control point x 1 x 5 are the endpoint of the three intervals where x 1 0 1 x 3 0 48 x 4 0 1 x 5 0 48 and x 2 is determined during the optimization cycles β 1 β 2 and β 3 represent the amplitudes of g x in the three intervals and are determined during the optimization cycles since the nurbs surfaces is nondimensionalized by the ship length l the values of x 1 x 5 make the intervals x 1 x 3 and x 5 x 4 roughly cover the inflow and outflow sections of a hull respectively the modified affine transformation is adopted to modify the ship beam of initial ship hull in the present paper the transverse coordinate y m of each control point on the modified nurbs surfaces is expressed as follows 21 y m y 1 f p z w i t h f p z p c m 0 z p c m 0 5 1 cos π z t n d γ t n d z 0 0 z t n d where y represents the transverse coordinate of a nurbs control point f p z is a proportional coefficient function determined by the coordinate z of a nurbs control point p c m denotes the magnitude of proportional coefficient function and is determined during the optimization cycles t n d t l is the dimensionless draft γ denotes the degree of proportionality coefficient function and is determined during the optimization cycles the significance of this formulation is to reduce the variation of ship displacement when modifying the ship beam if the magnitude p c m and dimensionless draft t nd are set as 1 a series of proportional coefficient functions f p z can be plotted in fig 16 it can be seen that the proportional coefficient function is smooth at different degree γ 3 3 2 local deformation of hull form in the fore body the radial basis function rbf interpolation method is adopted to implement the local deformation of hull form in the fore body including bulbous bow the general form of the interpolation buhmann 2003 can be expressed as follows 22 s x j 1 n λ j r x c j where x x y z denote the three dimensional coordinates of a nurbs control point s x represents the displacement of a nurbs control point c j c j x c j y c j z is the control point of radial basis function n is the number of control points of rbf interpolation r is a given radial basis function usually a linear polynomial p x b 1 b 2 x b 3 y b 4 z is added to the right of eq 22 to cover the translation and rotation transformation rendall and allen 2008 which is omitted in this paper the radial basis function r in eq 22 is defined based on the beckert wendland c2 function as follows 23 r x c j 1 x c j 4 4 x c j 1 it should be noted that the value of support radius of the beckert wendland c2 function has a great influence on the deformation based on rbf interpolation especially when the hull surface has been nondimensionalized by the ship length l in the present paper then the norm biasing rendall and allen 2008 is used as follows 24 x c j k x x c j x 2 k y y c j y 2 k z z c j z 2 where coefficients k x k y and k z can be regarded as a measurement of the importance of corresponding axis direction there are two types of control points of the radial basis function one is fixed and the other is movable the displacements of fixed control points equal to zero to keep the nurbs surfaces near them undeformed and the displacements of movable control points are determined during the optimization cycles the parameters λ j in eq 22 are determined by the interpolation conditions 25 s c i d i i 1 2 n where d i denote the displacements of control points of the radial basis function the position distribution of movable control points in this paper is based on investigations of kim and yang 2010 with some modifications conducted the distribution of 7 movable control points and the bidirectional net formed by the nurbs control points are plotted in fig 17 where the movable control points are indicated by red squares and attached to the nurbs control net the distribution of fixed control points is plotted in fig 18 where the fixed control points are denoted by blue circles the differences from the investigations of kim and yang 2010 are that the point no 5 can move along three spatial directions x y z the point no 6 can move only along x direction the point no 7 is additional and can move along two spatial directions x z the specific movement of 7 movable control points is introduced as follows the points no 1 2 are approximately at x 0 2 and no 3 4 are approximately at x 0 35 which can move along y direction to modify the shape of fore body the point no 5 can move along y and z direction to modify the width and height of bulbous bow respectively the points no 5 6 can move along x direction to modify the length of the bulbous bow and the movement distance of point no 5 along x direction is half of that of point no 6 the point no 7 can move along x and z direction respectively to assist the modification of the length and height of bulbous bow the movement distance of point no 7 along x direction is half of that of point no 6 and the movement distance of point no 7 along z direction is half of that of point no 5 all movement distances mentioned above are determined during the optimization cycles 3 3 3 local deformation of hull form in the aft body the free form deformation ffd method is adopted to implement the local deformation of hull form in the aft body the relevant mathematical formula of ffd is given in sederberg and parry 1986 the key to using the ffd to deform the nurbs hull surfaces is the formed lattice and the movement of control points located in the formed lattice in this paper the distribution of the control points located in the formed lattice is plotted in fig 19 where the coordinates of the lower left corner and upper right corner of lattice are 0 5015 0 001 0 0645 and 0 5684 0 072 0 0704 the green octahedrons denote the fixed control points located in the lattice the red spheres represent the movable control points located in the lattice the blue cubes denote the transitional control points located in the lattice the movable control points and transitional control points can move along y direction to deform the aft body the movement distance of movable control points remains unchanged in the x direction and linearly decreases to zero along the negative direction of y axis the maximum movement distance of transitional control points is half of that of movable control point and the movement also linearly decreases to zero along the negative direction of y axis the maximum movement distance m ffd of the movable control point located in the lattice is determined during the optimization cycles according to all the deformation methods mentioned above there are 14 design variables need to be determined during the optimization cycles the definition and value range of these design variables are shown in table 4 the optimization algorithm nsga ii is employed to solve the present multi objective optimization problem and for each individual in the population of each generation the procedure of obtaining three objective functions according to the design variable vector x is shown in fig 20 it should be noted that the longitudinal and vertical positions of center of gravity and the pitch gyration radius are kept fixed during the optimization process the reason is that these three parameters are determined by the mass distribution of ship and little affected by the design variable vector x in addition the small changes caused by the design variable vector x can be balanced by stowage during construction 4 results and analysis in order to make the optimization results clearer the three objective functions can be further expressed as follows 26 f i o b j f i d e f f i i n i f i i n i i 1 2 3 where the superscript ini indicates the initial hull the superscript def indicates the deformed ship hull f 1 o b j f 2 o b j f 3 o b j represent the objective functions related to total resistance heave motion response and pitch motion response of the prototype of dtmb 5512 respectively 4 1 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis is conducted to judge whether the design variables determined by the above hull form deformation methods are effective during the optimization cycles when studying the effect of each design variable except variable 4 and variable 6 on the objective functions the variable being analyzed increases linearly within a given value range while other variables are equal to the middle values of corresponding value ranges the extra requirements for studying variable 4 are that variable 1 and variable 2 are equal to the corresponding maximum values and the extra requirement for studying variable 6 is that variable 5 is equal to the corresponding maximum value it should be mentioned that only the change in variable 5 variable 6 or variable 14 within the given value range will cause the absolute value of the relative change in ship s displacement to be greater than 1 the effects of design variables on the first objective function are plotted in fig 21 where the variables are nondimensionalized in terms of the corresponding maximum values it can be seen that the variables that have considerable effect on the first objective function are variable 11 and variable 12 used to modify the length and width of bulbous bow respectively the effects of design variables on the second and third objective functions are plotted in fig 22 and fig 23 respectively the variables playing considerable effects on the second and third objective functions are variable 2 and variable 5 controlling the global deformation and variable 11 controlling the length of the bulbous bow different from the total resistance which is mainly affected by the deformation of bulbous bow the vertical motion responses are simultaneously affected by the deformation of bulbous bow the deformation of fore body and the modification of ship beam which results in the requirements of 14 variables for the hull form deformation from the above sensitivity analysis we can find that most design variables have an effect on one or more of the three objective functions which means that the hull surface deformation methods in the present paper are effective moreover compared with other variables variable 5 controlling the modification of ship beam has a significant effect on vertical motion responses but has a weak effect on total drag in order to study the effect of changing the value range of variable 5 on the possibility of simultaneously obtaining reduced total resistance and improved vertical motion performance the feasible region of present optimization design is divided into two parts by dividing the value range of variable 5 into two parts 0 04 0 and 0 0 04 and the optimization designs in the two feasible regions are denoted as case 1 and case 2 4 2 optimization results the nsga ii is employed to the optimization design for the prototype of dtmb 5512 where the maximum number of iterations is set as 100 and the population size is set as 50 in both cases the stopping criterion adopted by the present optimization is that the number of iterations reaches the set maximum number of iterations the total time consumption in both cases is about 5 days which proves the effectiveness of the present hydrodynamic optimization tool it should be stated that all the following comparison and variations are conducted among the optimal hulls and initial hull the obtained pareto optimal sets for three objective functions in two cases are plotted in fig 24 it can be observed from fig 24 b and c that there is a negative correlation between the objective functions f 1 o b j and f 2 o b j f 1 o b j and f 3 o b j on the pareto optimal front for both cases the negative correlations indicate that an optimal hull with minimum vertical motions cannot have minimum total resistance and an optimal hull with increased total resistance usually have reduced vertical motions in addition it can be seen from fig 24 d that the second objective function is roughly positively correlated with the third objective function for both cases the roughly positive correlation means that the optimal hull with reduced heave motion owns high probability to present the reduced pitch motion feature while the optimal hull is unable to present minimum pitch motion feature when it owns minimum heave motion in case 2 it can be seen from fig 24 d that almost all ships on the pareto optimal front have reduced vertical motions the reason is that variable 5 has converged to the interval 0 03 0 04 which indicates that the ship beams of all ships on the pareto optimal front in case 2 have increased moreover compared with case 1 the pareto optimal front in case 2 moves along the negative directions of the second and third objective functions but changes slightly in the direction of the first objective function the above analysis shows that by reasonably determining the feasible region of optimization design the probability of obtaining an optimal hull with reduced total resistance and improved vertical motion performance will increase and the improvement in vertical motion performance of this optimal hull will increase according to the work of maruo 1957 and hong et al 2016 the added resistance of a ship advancing in waves could be divided into two parts 27 r a w t r a w r r a w d where r a w r and r a w d represent the added resistance caused by radiation wave and diffraction wave respectively therefore when the heave and pitch motions of the ship advancing in head waves are reduced or increased the added resistance of the ship in head waves is probably to be reduced or increased in this way when the total resistance of the ship advancing in head waves is used as the first objective function the negative correlation between the objective functions f 1 o b j and f 2 o b j f 1 o b j and f 3 o b j will be weakened and the probability of obtaining the optimal hull with reduced heave and pitch motions and reduced total resistance will further increase in order to examine the optimization results in case 2 there are four optimal hull forms ship 1 ship 4 selected from the pareto optimal front that have been shown in fig 24 on the pareto optimal front the three optimal hull forms ship 1 ship 2 and ship 3 present the minimum values on the objective functions f 1 o b j f 2 o b j f 3 o b j respectively and the optimal hull form ship 4 presents negative values on three objective functions the relative changes in the displacements of four optimal hulls are 0 81 0 37 0 52 and 0 42 in turn therefore all four optimal hulls meet the displacement constraint 4 2 1 resistance of four optimal hulls the solver based on potential flow is called low fidelity cfd solver later in this paper the comparison of wave drag coefficients and total resistance calculated by the low fidelity cfd solver between the four optimal hulls is plotted in fig 25 and fig 26 respectively it can be seen that ship 1 and ship 4 have appreciable reductions in the wave drag coefficients and total resistance over the entire range of froude numbers while the wave drag coefficients and total resistance of ship 2 and ship 3 are increased the relative changes in wetted surface area of four optimal hulls are 0 37 0 47 0 42 and 0 45 in turn the relative changes in wave drag coefficient and total resistance calculated by the low fidelity cfd solver are shown in table 5 where negative numbers indicate decrease and positive numbers indicate increase to further validate the resistance of four optimal hulls the high fidelity cfd solver that is based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations is used during rans cfd simulations the four optimal hulls are transformed into four models with a length equal to 3 048 m through affine transformation and the initial hull is taken as dtmb 5512 to perform rans cfd simulations the commercial software simcenter star ccm siemens 2017 is used standard k ε turbulence with all y wall treatment model of turbulence is chosen following many other studies such as tezdogan et al 2015 and kim et al 2017 free surface is captured by volume of fluid vof method the initial and four optimal hulls are allowed to move freely in the sinkage and trim directions with two degrees of freedom in the simulations dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model shivachev et al 2020 is applied to simulate the 2 dof ship motions it should be noted that the mass and moment of inertia of the four optimal hulls are equal to those of the initial hull the grid convergence study for the initial hull at fn 0 28 has been carried out the results of uncertainty analysis for friction resistance r f pressure resistance r p and total resistance r t are shown in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that grid uncertainty test results in a monotonic convergence for all three kinds of resistance in addition the relative errors between the total resistance obtained by the three meshes and the experimental measurement are all within 3 after the grid convergence study the medium mesh with 1 64 million control volumes is used in the simulation of initial hull at fn 0 28 the medium mesh for resistance simulation is presented in fig 27 the simulation results calculated by star ccm are presented in table 7 where rc denotes the relative change in resistance of four optimal hulls compared with that of initial hull by comparing tables 5 and 7 for four optimal hulls we can obtain that the change trend of total resistance obtained by high fidelity cfd solver is consistent with that obtained by low fidelity cfd solver while the relative change in total resistance obtained by high fidelity cfd solver is smaller than that obtained by low fidelity cfd solver the reason is that the low fidelity cfd solver is based on the potential flow and ignores the viscous pressure coupling effect and the nonlinear effect moreover at fn 0 28 ship 1 has achieved the greatest total resistance reduction and ship 2 has achieved the greatest total resistance increase which is consistent with the simulation results obtained by low fidelity cfd solver the comparison of wave profiles between the initial hull and optimal hulls ship 1 and ship 2 calculated by star ccm is plotted in fig 28 at fn 0 28 the wave profiles of ship 1 and ship 2 present a large rise and fall in the bow wave trough region and a small fall and rise in the bow wave crest region the changes in the profiles of ship 1 and ship 2 cause the pressure at the bow of two optimal hulls to decrease and increase respectively as a result the pressure resistance of ship 1 and ship 2 is reduced and increased respectively the comparison of wave patterns between the initial hull and optimal hulls ship 1 and ship 2 calculated by star ccm is presented in fig 29 where the wave patterns of ship 1 and ship 2 present obvious changes the simulation results based on star ccm have verified the applicability and effectiveness of low fidelity cfd solver to compute total resistance during the optimization process 4 2 2 vertical motion performance of four optimal hulls in order to examine the vertical motion performance of four optimal hulls in irregular head waves the heave and pitch motion raos of four optimal hulls in regular head waves are first calculated via 3dtp ls green s function over a wide frequency range the comparison of added mass and damping coefficients between the initial hull and four optimal hulls at fn 0 28 is plotted in fig 30 where the interval 3 2 3 7 of dimensionless encounter frequency ω e l g corresponds to the interval 0 535 0 595 of incident wave frequency ω it can be seen that the difference in added mass and damping coefficients between these hulls is slight the comparison of vertical motion raos between these hulls at fn 0 28 is plotted in fig 31 it can be observed that ship 2 and ship 3 present the maximum reduction in heave and pitch motion rao during the resonance frequency region respectively in addition the vertical motion rao curves of ship 2 and ship 3 are roughly the same the peak frequencies damped natural frequencies of heave motion rao curves of four optimal hulls are shifted compared with that of initial hull and these peak frequencies are different from each other the same peak frequency shift phenomenon has been found in the pitch motion rao curves of four optimal hulls according to the analysis of chakrabarti 1987 the peak frequency of heave or pitch motion rao curve is affected by the combined effect of generalized mass added mass damping coefficient and hydrostatic restoring coefficient therefore the cause of the peak frequency shift phenomenon is the combined effect of the changes in these quantities caused by hull surface deformation the relative changes in peak values of vertical motion rao curves calculated by potential flow solver are shown in table 8 to further validate the heave and pitch motion raos of four optimal hulls the rans cfd simulations are performed based on star ccm the initial hull and optimal hulls ship 2 and ship 4 are selected for vertical motion simulation and these hulls are transformed into models with a length equal to 3 048 m the reason for choosing ship 2 and ship 4 is that the vertical motion raos of ship 2 and ship 3 calculated by potential flow solver are similar and the vertical motion raos of ship 1 present the smallest changes compared with those of other three optimal hulls the incident waves are represented as fifth order stokes waves following the study of cakici et al 2018 and damping zone is set at the side and outlet boundary turbulence model free surface capture model and motion simulation model are consistent with the settings of calm water resistance simulation for the motion simulation in each regular wave the time step size is set to be 1 256 of wave encounter period t e following the study of cakici et al 2018 five incident waves with different wavelengths are selected for the rans cfd simulations of vertical motion the relevant information of these incident waves is shown in table 9 where ζ a k denote wave steepness the grid convergence study for motion simulation of initial hull with λ l 1 293 at fn 0 28 is first implemented the results of uncertainty analysis for vertical motion raos are show in table 10 where the grid uncertainty test results in a monotonic convergence for both heave and pitch motion raos then the medium mesh with 2 79 million control volumes is used in the motion simulations of three hulls with λ l 1 293 which is presented in fig 32 note that the grid generation settings of three hulls in each incident wave are exactly the same in addition the basic size of the grid generation at different wavelengths has been slightly adjusted the computed time series of heave and pitch motions of three hulls with different wavelengths calculated by star ccm are plotted in fig 33 and fig 34 after the fourier transform calculations of vertical motion time series the x 3 and x 5 of three hulls in different incident waves can be obtained then the vertical motion raos of three hulls can be calculated these vertical motion raos as well as the experimental measurements of dtmb 5512 are plotted in fig 35 it can be obtained from figs 31 and 35 that the change trends of vertical motion raos of ship 2 and ship 4 obtained by star ccm are consistent with those calculated by potential flow solver while the relative changes in vertical motion raos obtained by star ccm are smaller than those calculated by potential flow solver moreover ship 2 presents smaller heave motion raos compared to those of ship 4 which is consistent with the simulation results calculated by potential flow solver the vertical motion simulation results obtained by star ccm have verified the applicability of the potential flow solver based on 3dtp ls green s function to simulate vertical motion raos during the optimization process three sea states are selected to examine the vertical motion performance of four optimal hulls in irregular head waves the significant wave heights characteristic wave periods peak frequencies ω p and wave energy density spectra of these three sea states are plotted in fig 36 the vertical motion response spectra of four optimal hulls under three sea states at fn 0 28 are calculated which are plotted in fig 37 the relative changes in significant amplitudes of heave and pitch motion response spectra under three sea states are shown in table 11 it can be seen from fig 37 that there are obvious differences in the vertical motion response spectra of four optimal hulls between three sea states where the response concentration frequency regions move in the negative direction of axis with the increase of characteristic period of sea state under the sea state of level 6 the frequency region where the main difference of heave motion response spectrum curve between four optimal hulls lies is staggered from the response concentration frequency region in addition for optimal hulls ship 1 and ship 4 the decrease amplitudes of pitch motion response spectra curves vary greatly with the change of sea state which is also reflected by the relative changes in significant amplitudes of pitch motion response spectra in table 11 therefore if the heave and pitch motion raos at the peak frequency of initial hull are determined as the objective functions related to vertical motion performance the heave and pitch motion performance of optimal hull in irregular head waves will not be guaranteed the above analyses show the importance and necessity of considering sea state when optimizing the vertical motion performance of the ship advancing in irregular head waves the frequency region where the main difference between the vertical motion response spectra under the sea state of level 4 is located proves the feasibility and practicality of using several frequencies to characterize the response concentration frequency regions in this paper the comparison of hydrodynamic simulation results of ship 1 and ship 4 shows that a slight decrease in the magnitude of ship total resistance reduction can achieve the simultaneous reductions in its heave and pitch motion responses which shows the significance of this optimization tool the comparison of body plan profile plan of fore body and plan of waterlines between the four optimal hulls and initial hull is plotted in figs 38 39 and 40 it can be seen from figs 38 39 and 40 that all four optimal hulls have smooth body lines profiles and waterlines so that all four optimal hulls have smooth geometries 5 conclusions in the present paper a multi objective ship hydrodynamic optimization tool is presented and applied to the optimization design of the prototype of dtmb 5512 for reduced total resistance in calm water and improved vertical motion performance under the sea state of level 4 the total resistance and the significant amplitudes of vertical motion response spectra are determined as the optimization objective functions the total resistance in calm water is simulated based on the neumann michell theory and the motion response spectra in irregular head waves are calculated by the three dimensional potential flow solver based on translating and pulsating line segment source 3dtp ls green s function for dtmb 5512 the numerical calculation results of wave drag coefficients and vertical motion raos are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements which indicates that the two ship hydrodynamic simulation methods introduced in this paper can be employed during the optimization cycles moreover the results of calm water resistance simulations and vertical motion simulations based on star ccm show that the two low fidelity cfd solvers based on potential flow can catch the change trends of total resistance and vertical motion raos caused by hull form deformation which has further verified the applicability and effectiveness of the two low fidelity cfd solvers during the optimization process several nurbs based hull surface modification methods are presented in the present optimization tool to achieve the global and local deformation of hull form the essence of nurbs surfaces is to smooth the results obtained by other deformation methods thus the deformed hull forms have smoother geometries or the design variables determined by the hull form deformation can be varied in a larger variation range the smooth body lines profiles and waterlines of four optimal hulls have presented that the deformed hull forms generated by the present optimization tool own smooth surfaces for the two optimization designs case 1 is similar to the traditional optimization where the ship beam remains unchanged or decreases while the ship beam is only allowed to increase in case 2 to consider the vertical motion performance in waves the comparison of optimization results in case 1 and case 2 shows that a reasonable determination of feasible region for an optimization design can increase the possibility of obtaining the optimal ship with reduced total resistance and improved vertical motion performance which shows the practicality of the present optimization tool the obtained pareto optimal sets of both cases show that there is a negative correlation between the total resistance and vertical motion responses which is consistent with the engineering experience of ship designer and indicates the accuracy of the present optimization tool the comparison of hydrodynamic simulation results of ship 1 and ship 4 shows that a slight decrease in the magnitude of ship total resistance reduction can achieve the simultaneous reductions in its vertical motion responses which shows the significance and effectiveness of this optimization tool and is very meaningful to ship designers credit authorship contribution statement
