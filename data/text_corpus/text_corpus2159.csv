10795,warming and increasing extreme climate events are expected to reduce crop yields including rice production in china threatening the chinese food security shifting sowing date has been considered as a key adaptation strategy to sustain rice production in china however the extent to which it can mitigate the adverse climate change impact on yield and whether more irrigation is required remains unclear here by driving oryza v3 with four climate models gcms we analyzed the impacts of climate change on china rice yield and net irrigation water requirement nir at 21 sites under a wide range of sowing date we found that without altering sowing date weighted average rice yield for all sites will decline 5 1 7 3 and 15 1 in periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively yields losses in temperate zones are linked to increased crop development rates with higher temperatures but in subtropical regions the reduction is more related to the damage of heat stress during rice heading or flowering periods nir increases notably in all regions up to 71 except northeastern china where the shortened growth duration resulted in less time to consume water when the optimized sowing date is applied average yield losses will be effectively compensated to achieve these rice sowing date will be shifted by up to 54 days and on average 17 8 23 4 more fresh water in future periods are needed to meet the water requirement of rice growth we also found that due to increasing the frequency of heat events farmers in chinese rice production regions e g yangtze river basin will have narrow sowing windows at the end of this century this study suggests that adequate irrigation and adjusting sowing dates could mitigate the negative climate impacts on rice production in china keywords climate change adaptation sowing window food security irrigation water requirement rice 1 introduction rice is the most important cereal crop grown in china nearly one billion people depend on it as their staple food tao et al 2013 however its sustainable production is being faced with many challenges including labor shortage shen et al 2011 the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as ch4 zhang et al 2016 and the competition for paddy land and water resources from non agricultural sectors challinor et al 2014 furthermore climate change mainly characterized by increased temperature shifted rainfall patterns and more frequent extreme climate events piao et al 2010 has not only dramatically altered the climate condition godfray et al 2010 shen et al 2011 wang et al 2014 but also threatened the stable supply of irrigation water resources sun and yang 2012 zhang and zhou 2015 cao et al 2017 therefore it is imperative to project the future impacts of climate change on chinses paddy rice production and water consumption and further explore potential adaptation strategies climate change without adaptation is projected to influence crop growth and water use in a number of ways the elevated temperatures have been known to accelerate the growth process of most crops resulting in less time for biomass accumulation tao et al 2008 hawkins et al 2013 zheng et al 2012 on the other hand short periods of extreme high temperature during key crop growing stages such as flowering and grain filling are associated with dramatic yield loss by reducing the potential grain number or increasing the proportion of shrunken grains ciais et al 2005 fuller et al 2007 butler and huybers 2013 apart from affecting crop yield warming also has many influences on crop water use including the acceleration of crop evapotranspiration rate at a higher temperature as well as the shortened crop growing duration for water consumption wang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 ding et al 2017 owing to the adequate irrigation rice production in china is not easily threatened by drought but in recent years climate change has dramatically shifted the precipitation pattern in south china the main rice planting region causing severe shortages of available irrigation water resources tan et al 2017 hu et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 unlike the adverse impacts of temperature increase and precipitation variation the increasing co2 concentration is known to have positive effects on crop production elevated co2 is anticipated to improve crop yield through expressing higher thermotolerance of photosynthesis which is especially the case for c3 crops such as rice and soybean taub et al 2000 chapin et al 2011 jin et al 2017 moreover by increasing crop stomatal closure elevated co2 leads to decreased crop transpiration rate thus benefiting the reduction in irrigation water requirement tao et al 2008 elliott et al 2014 deryng et al 2016 wang et al 2017a expanding cropping area shifting sowing date switching to new varieties further optimizing the using of water and fertilizer are strategies to cope with climate change for sustaining crop production lobell et al 2008 2015 rurinda et al 2015 however the current situation of rice production system in china may limit the application of the most aforementioned adaptive strategies since the han dynasty 202ce 220ce to feed the growing population chinese people have exploited most of the arable land to maximize food production with intensive labor water and fertilizer inputs which is known as intensive and meticulous farming today with the help of modern irrigation systems widely distributed fertilizer plants and high yield hybrid varieties this intensive farming system has helped to close the yield gap between realized and potential peng et al 2009 statistical data showed that china provides 27 8 of global rice production within only 18 57 of its planting area faostat 2018 in other words under a changing climate and rising food demand most of the common adaptation strategies lost their brilliance with this farming system as yield cannot be easily increased by reducing water deficit and more fertilizer use or expanding arable land like africa and southeast asia did where the shortages of water and nutrients are the main limitations in their rice production lobell 2008 shifting sowing date a low cost and easy implement strategy waongo et al 2015 rurinda et al 2015 is thus the key adaptation strategy which can allow crop growth to occur in the periods with more suitable climate conditions zheng et al 2012 irrigation the most paramount factor to maintain the high rice yield in china and by far the largest component ab 54 of national total anthropogenic fresh water consumption wang et al 2017b is expected to change significantly under the combined effects of climate change and shifted sowing date raising concerns regarding whether water resources shortage will be a limiting factor for rice production under future optimized sowing date elliott et al 2014 ye et al 2015 ding et al 2017 for instance although earlier sowing date in northeast china may be beneficial to rice yield the critical water consumption period such as heading may miss the rainy season resulting in a sharp increase in the amount of water needed for irrigation it also should be noticed that future available irrigation water resources could be limited by the increasing water consumption from non food uses challinor et al 2016 wang et al 2013 samani et al 2018 statistical evidence has been showed that due to the shortage of irrigation water resources rice cultivation area in the north china plain has decreased dramatically in the past 30 years national bureau statistics of china 2014 gao and luo 2008 therefore the projection of rice irrigation water requirement under the shifted sowing date is of significant implications for both food security and water security process based crop models that can simulate the interactions between multiple environmental factors and management practices are useful tools to assess the impacts of climate change on crop growth and explore potential adaptation strategies boote et al 1996 keating et al 2003 van oijen and lefelaar 2008 chenu et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 liu et al 2016 by using the crop models extensive studies have attempted to evaluate the potential impacts of future climate change on rice yield i e yao et al 2007 xiong et al 2009 tao et al 2008 shen et al 2011 wang et al 2014 2017a xu et al 2015 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however to our knowledge existing modeling studies have neither given an explicit answer to the extent to which shifting sowing date can offset the impacts of climate change on rice production nor given how the corresponding irrigation water requirement would change more efforts are thus needed to explore the potential adaptation and its impacts on water consumption in order to inform future rice breeding and water resources utilization in this study the oryza v3 crop model bouman et al 2001 li et al 2017 driven by four bias corrected global climate datasets at 21 agricultural experimental sites spanning the main rice production regions in china was used to investigate the comprehensive impacts of climate change and shifting sowing date on rice yield and water consumption in china the following four questions were addressed 1 how does climate change affect the yield and nir on chinses paddy rice under current field management practices and cultivar choices 2 how will the sowing date be adjusted to optimize rice yield 3 to what extent can changing planting date mitigate the negative effects of climate change on rice yield and 4 how will the corresponding nir change under the altered sowing date 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental data twenty one agro meteorology experimental sites aes spanning the main china rice growing regions from temperate zone to south subtropical zone were studied fig 1 these sites were maintained by china meteorological administration cma and purposefully selected to represent different rice types single early and late rice and different rice planting regions classified by mei et al 1988 generally single rice is cultivated in southwestern china and the north of the yangtze river where rice is sown between march 10th and june 15th while double rice rotation between early and late rice is the typical cropping system in the south of the yangtze river with early rice and late rice sown around march 20th and july 5th respectively however due to the short of labor force or rotation with other crops such as sugarcane shen et al 2011 farmers in the double rice cultivation regions might only breed early or late rice in one year thus early and late rice sites in guangxi and fujian provinces are not at the same location fig 1 historical data of rice phenology i e sowing transplanting flowering maturity dates yields and management practices from 2002 to 2012 were extracted from the aess these experiment data were collected based on a uniform cma observation standards and guidelines liu et al 2012 2 2 current and future climate data to quantify future climate and its uncertainty impacts a number of climate projections from general circulation models gcms were used xing et al 2014 rurinda et al 2015 lobell et al 2015 specifically future climate data from 2011 to 2100 were obtained from four gcms including hadgem2 es bcc csm1 1 m miroc esm chem and gfdl esm2m see table s1 participating in the coupled model intercomparsion project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 we considered these four gcms because they fully meet the data required to simulate rice yield and paddy water balance at the same time and were widely used in climate change studies in china e g yin et al 2015 guo et al 2015 wang et al 2017a four representative concentration pathways rcp2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 were released by cmip5 taylor et al 2012 but we only focus on the high concentration pathway rcp 8 5 for which radiative forcing rise to 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 historical daily climate data including minimum and maximum temperatures sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed and precipitation from 1976 to 2013 at each site were obtained from national meteorological information centre of china nmic of cma to meet the data requirement to force crop model sunshine duration and relative humidity were converted to solar radiation and actual vapour pressure using the method provided by prescott 1940 and allen et al 1998 respectively the climate data were bias corrected against the baseline observed data the minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation wind speed and vapour pressure data were corrected by quantile mapping li et al 2010 wang and chen 2013 the precipitation data were corrected with the method of piani et al 2010 that can reproduce extreme events and eliminate excessive number of occurrences of drizzle it should be specially noticed that although the ensemble of multiple gcms improves the projection of climate data aggregating of many climate models directly could shift climate patterns for instance bringing more wet days and less extreme precipitation therefore in this study we drive the crop model with the individual gcm outputs and then average the simulation results across the four gcms 2 3 crop model description rice yield and irrigation water requirement in response to future climate change and shifting planting date were simulated using oryza v3 https sites google com a irri org oryza2000 oryza is an advanced dynamic eco physiological model jointly developed by international rice research institute irri and wageningen university karim et al 2012 driving by weather soil crop and management data the model simulates rice yield growth stage dry matter distribution and water balance under water stress nitrogen stress and n w stress conditions on a daily basis oryza v3 has a detailed water balance module which allows the users to set up complexed irrigation schemes in modeling experiments bouman et al 2001 the model is also more suitable to simulate nir of lowland rice than other models such as ceres rice and wofost meanwhile the performance of oryza has been widely validated against the experimental data in a wide range of climate regions in asia e g karim et al 2012 shen et al 2011 li et al 2013 yuan et al 2017 in recent years oryza has been successfully applied in china to evaluate the options to grow rice with less water bouman et al 2007 investigate the impacts of climate change on rice production wang et al 2014 and irrigation luo et al 2015 and monitor large scale rice growth and development by combining remote sensing data setiyono et al 2012 pazhanivelan et al 2015 the accurate simulation of rice growth period duration gpd is crucial for this study since warming over rice growing season causes yield change primarily through its effects on the length of life cycle furthermore nir is also highly related to crop life cycle zhao et al 2015 in oryza v3 the development stage dvs indicating rice physiological age is calculated based on hourly increments in heat units huh cd h 1 the response of temperature to huh is simplified as a linear function fig 2 a for temperature below the base temperature tbd or higher than the maximum temperature tmd rice development will stop while temperature equals the optimum temperature tod rice grows fastest in this study the values of these three cardinal temperatures tbd tod and tmd are 8 30 and 42 c respectively gao et al 1992 apart from the length of rice life cycle spikelet sterile the key factors related to rice yield losses are also sensitive to extreme high or low temperatures horie et al 1992 the cooling degree days coldtt cd during rice panicle stage 0 75 dvs 1 2 is used to evaluate the impacts of cold temperature on sterility while the average daily maximum temperature tfert c over flowering period 0 96 dvs 1 22 is adopted to describe the relationship between high temperature and rice fertility bouman et al 2001 according to horie et al 1992 when daily mean temperature is less than 22 c or average daily maximum temperature during flowering period is higher than 35 c the percentage of rice spikelet fertility will be dramatically reduced fig 2b and c unlike the upland crops such as wheat and maize rice cultivation in china is dominated by paddy field farming the most water intensive type of crop planting in oryza v3 rice irrigation water requirement was determined by soil water balance which can be briefly described as 1 d w i r r c e t s p d where d w is the change of field water stored i r is irrigation water requirement r c e t s p and d represent precipitation capillary rise evaporation transpiration seepage percolation and evapotranspiration respectively the irrigation scheduling irrigation time and amount is determined by the subroutine irrig which provides five optional manners in which irrigation is applied and computes the daily amount of irrigation as a function of user specified criteria the five irrigation criteria are rained irrigation supplied as input data irrigation at critical ponded soil water depth irrigation at critical soil water tension irrigation at critical soil water content and irrigation at x days after disappearance of ponded water 2 4 crop model simulation to assess the impacts of climate change on rice production and water consumption and explore the potential adaptability we first conducted the simulation for baseline 1981 2010 and three future periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 under current sowing date subsequently from 2011 to 2100 the simulation was carried out for planting dates at one day intervals across a wide range of windows the detailed information about current sowing date and growth duration for each site can be found in figure s1 the sowing window for late rice was set to start from 150 julian days of the year because late rice is widely recognized as sowing after may huang et al 2017 to consider the effects of co2 fertilization the co2 concentration for future three stages were set as 449 541 and 850 ppm respectively besides as nearly 95 of china rice production area is fully irrigated and fertilized all of the simulations in this study were performed without any limitation on water and nitrogen when computing region wide aggregate statistics the rice sites were weighted based on the rice production in the region these weights are shown in figure s2 soil data is highly related to deep percolation a key element in water balance processes however for the following three reasons soil data for all rice sites were set as default and daily soil percolation for each site was set as fixed value provided by a national scale investigation chen et al 1995 firstly unlike upland crops soil percolation in paddy field is also highly related to non soil type factors such as groundwater level spacing of drainage ditches and drainage depth as a result it is almost impossible to output an accurate percolation value by point based crop model secondly considering the great differences in soil properties in different regions the large scale investigation percolation values are more representative than point scale simulation thirdly as paddy field is always maintained with a certain depth of water the percolation is almost constant during rice growing period the fixed percolation value for each site can be found in figure s3 due to the large differences in climate conditions rice varieties vary obviously in different cultivation regions for example to adapt to the short growing window in northeastern china rice life cycle in this region is usually less than 155 days while in the warm southwestern china rice life cycle can be longer than 170 days figure s1 thus in order to simulate the impacts of climate change on china rice production more accurately we use site specific cultivars and not one for all sites for a specific site observed phenological and yield data from 2002 to 2012 were divided into two groups the data from odd years were used for calibration the cultivar parameters while the rest experiment data were used for validation given the limitation of collected experimental data we only adjust the most sensitive parameters to rice yield and water consumption such as phenology and dry matter distribution parameters luo et al 2015 the other parameters were set the same as the experiment we carried out in our previous study wang et al 2017a this setting might bring a certain degree of uncertainty to the simulation results nevertheless a recent study on crop model uncertainty showed that the uncertainty resulted from crop parameters is small when investigating changes in predictions and averaging over multiple years decreases the prediction bias by a wide margin wallach et al 2016 with the help of two calibration programs drates and param that are built in the oryza we calibrated rice genetic parameters at each site then the calibrated model was driven with observed meteorology data from the even years to simulate crop yields and gpds for validation fig 3 showed the validation results of rice growth duration and yield at 21 sites simulated yield and growth duration for three types of rice are mostly in agreement with observational data from china meteorological administration deviations exist at some sites because experimental data are obtained with assumptions of no weeds pests or other limiting factors 3 results 3 1 projected climate change warming is roughly equal across the sites during rice growing season although the mean temperature of the baselined period 1981 2010 varied largely among different regions the average daily minimum temperatures tmax over growing season for all sites were projected to increase by 0 8 c in 2011 2040 2 3 c in 2041 2070 and 4 6 c in 2071 2100 fig 4 a by contrast the directions of changes in projected growing season precipitation were less clear but there was no significant change in the mean annual precipitation fig 4b the change of radiation was similar to that of tmax but with more distinct spatial variability for example in southern china net radiation would increase on average of 7 during 2071 2100 while in northeastern china 15 increment for the same period was found killing degree days kdd the sum of rice growing season maximum temperatures in excess of 35 c indicates the cumulative of heat events that might have adverse impacts on rice development in the baseline period apart from several sites i e wx and jh in the middle subtropical regions most sites suffer less heat damages kdd 20 c d which is especially true for sites in northeastern china in line with our study sun and huang 2011 showed that global warming in the past 50 years did not enhance high temperature stress in heading flowering stage for most china rice cultivation regions however analysis of future climate scenarios predicted large variations in the occurrence of heat events across the entire china rice cultivation region ranging from locations still with negligible heat events e g northeastern china to locations with severe extreme hot days e g north subtropical climate region fig 4d 3 2 impacts on rice yields and nir under current sowing date with the consideration of co2 fertilization weighted average yields the weight of each site can be found in figure s2 will decrease 5 1 7 3 and 15 1 in 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively fig 5 a among the single rice sites the largest yield decreases 30 was found at wx in sichuan basin which could be explained by the most severe heat damage it would experience fig 4d compared to single rice the mean yield losses for early rice were small with the largest yield reduction of 14 occurring at jh during 2071 2100 noticeably slight yield increases were observed at three late rice sites i e gy gp and zz and one single rice site i e zh in 2011 2040 and 2041 2070 projected nir for most sites would continue to increase in three future stages but dramatically decreased nir was also found fig 5c for single rice in northeastern china and yunnan guizhou plateau nir would decrease by up to 31 with the dramatically shortened rice growth duration but at the rest single rice sites nir would increase by up to 49 for early rice although the growth duration was shortened nir showed an obviously increasing trend with the value ranging from 21 to 71 in 2070 2100 period similar to that of early rice sites increased nir was observed across all late rice sites while the increasing magnitude was relatively small less than 19 3 3 changes in yield and nir under optimized sowing date when the sowing date was shifted from current to the optimized date yields increased notably for all sites in both near and long term climates periods fig 5a especially for single rice in subtropical regions i e jz gs my wx where the yield increase was even higher than 40 while the yield increases in northeastern china i e hl th was small less than 10 resulting in that the optimized yield in this region was still lower than that over the baseline period similar to most single rice sites early rice sites also showed dramatically yield increase under the optimized sowing date up to 31 however the increase of yield for late rice was much smaller across most sites among which the largest increase 11 was observed at zhangzhou zz in 2011 2040 in general apart from northeastern china shifting sowing date could effectively mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on china rice yield under optimized sowing date the increase to average nir will be raised from 7 8 6 3 and 10 9 to 17 8 20 6 and 23 4 in 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively fig 5c for most sites shifted sowing date prolonged crop water consumption time reduced the synchronization of the key rice water consumption stage and precipitation period resulting in a large increase in nir fig 5b and c nevertheless for several late rice sites e g zz and gy the nir will be reduced to a certain degree because of the shortened rice growth durations 3 4 the optimized sowing dates and sowing time windows the optimal sowing date refers to the breeding date that rice yield could be maximized considering that rice breeding could be influenced by non meteorological factors such as rotation with other crops or short of irrigation water resources we also analyzed the potential sowing time windows to allow farmers sowing with more flexibilities the possible sowing windows were defined as a group of planting dates that the corresponding yields are high than 90 of the maximum yield see the examples in figure s4 the optimal sowing date would continue to advance up to 13 32 and 37 days for 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively at the four northeastern sites where an early sowing date would provide relatively cold environment to slow down rice development rate to help dry matter accumulation fig 6 while for the remaining single rice sites to avoid the heat stress during key rice growing periods sowing earlier or later was feasible fig 6a in case of early rice the optimal sowing dates would be on average 15 days earlier in 2011 2040 23 days in 2041 2070 and 28 days in 2071 2100 fig 6b however the shift directions for late rice sites were not uniform and the shift days were much shorter than the other two types of rice especially at gy site where the optimal sowing date would only be 5 days earlier in both 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods fig 6c the start date of the potential sowing windows would be earlier at all single and early rice sites but the lengths of these windows were much more complicated in general with temperature increasing more dates are warm enough for rice growth this is true for single rice in northeastern china but it is too hot for rice flowering and heading in southern china in summer rice sowing windows in this region are thus divided into two separate narrow periods fig 6a for early rice both the start and end days of the possible sowing windows are earlier resulting in wider sowing windows for farmers fig 6b for late rice the possible sowing windows started from julian day of 150 but ended later with temperature increasing fig 6c 4 discussion climate change will inevitably challenge the future production and water resource utilization of rice ipcc 2007 piao et al 2010 wang et al 2017a given the special rice production situation in china shifting sowing date is anticipated to have an important role in mitigating the challenges of climate change on crop production lobell et al 2015 waongo et al 2015 by using bias corrected climate projections from multiple gcms and the well tested oryza v3 crop model we explicitly assessed the impacts of climate change on growth duration yield and net irrigation water requirement nir of rice across china this study for the first time evaluated the extent to which shifting sowing date could mitigate the negative effects of climate change on rice yield we also investigated how nir would change along with the shifted sowing date 4 1 climate change is predicted to affect china rice production and water utilization differently depending on the region in temperate regions e g northeastern china in spite of the extended crop growth windows under the increasing temperature tao et al 2008 wang et al 2012 rice growth duration was anticipated to decease for more than 30 days at the end of this century fig 5 along with the shortened growth duration rice yields in these regions were reduced by up to 19 as shortened rice life cycle dramatically reduced the available time for rice to acquire radiation co2 and nutrients for biomass accumulation dennett 1999 springate and kover 2014 other modelling studies also predicated the similar shortened growth duration for crops shen et al 2011 wang et al 2014 for instance a recent study showed that australia wheat life cycle would anticipated to shorten by up to 42 days at 2050 zheng et al 2012 generally this is a typical form of crop yield loss most climate change related yield loss around the world could be explained by the shortened growth duration tao et al 2008 shen et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 however it should be noticed that although the magnitude of rice yield loss in subtropical regions was like that in temperate regions rice growth duration was almost unchanged or even prolonged by up to 12 days at some sites fig 5 this seems to be inconsistent with most previous modeling studies in this region e g shen et al 2011 wang et al 2014 in fact crop development rate would not accelerate continuously with temperature increase lu et al 2008 zhao et al 2007 which is especially true for rice in subtropical regions as the growing season temperature is close to or even exceeds the optimal development temperature during the baseline period fig 4 thus yield loss for single rice in subtropical regions could be largely attributed to the dramatically increased heat events that occurred in the key rice growth stages fig 4 and fig 7 it also needs to be noticed that although the average growing season temperature of late rice sites in south subtropical regions i e zhangzhou gaoyao and guiping was obviously higher than in other regions fig 4 the yield of late rice in this region would increase by up to 10 fig 5 a reasonable explanation is that the high temperature here slowed the rice development rate resulting in a longer growth duration for biomass accumulation meanwhile the late sowing date made the key rice growing period avoid the extreme heat damage fig 7 the projected changes in net irrigation water requirement nir differed notably across the different climate regions fig 5 especially between temperate regions and subtropical regions which was due to the large variations in the changes of growth duration warming shortened single rice growth duration more than 30 days in temperate regions but much less so for rice in other regions the shortened growth duration results in less time for rice to consume water by evapotranspiration therefore although the elevated temperature and solar radiation could increase crop evapotranspiration rate the notably shortened growth duration well explained the slightly reduced nir for rice in temperate regions fig 5 by contrast under combined effects of prolonged rice life cycle increased temperature and solar radiation nir in subtropical regions e g sichuan basin and middle lower yangtze river basin showed a prominent increase in line with our study other nir projection studies also anticipated the increased water consumption in subtropical regions ye et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 however as they assumed the fixed rice growth duration the projected nir in those studies was different from the results presents here thus the vital effect of rice growth length on irrigation water requirement implies that phenology simulation is essential in investigating crop water consumption wriedt et al 2009 zhao et al 2015 4 2 adaptation of china rice production to climate change warming shortens rice growth duration in northeastern china and increases heat stress in other regions figs 4 and 5 altering sowing date is considered as a useful strategy to slow down development rate and avoid heat damage zheng et al 2012 in this study under the optimized sowing date rice yield was projected to increase fig 5a however rice nir would also increase dramatically under the optimized sowing date especially for single rice sites in northeastern china fig 5c this should be attributed to the following two reasons first rice growth duration was prolonged at most sites which resulted in more time for rice to consume water by evapotranspiration second shifted sowing date also reduced the synchronization of the rice key water consumption stage and precipitation period at most sites leading to a large increase in nir see examples in fig 7 however it should be noticed that shifting sowing date could only partly compensate the negative effects on rice yield in northeastern china more adaptation strategies are thus necessary to employ fortunately the response mechanism of rice yield to warming allows using new rice variety to adapt to climate change liu et al 2012 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 for single rice in northeastern china and yunnan guizhou plateau although the earlier sowing date slowed down the development rate rice growth duration would still be shorter on average of 12 days than that in the baseline period thus given the negligible heat stress fig 7a longer maturity variety should be adopted in line with our study a recent study showed that in the past 30 years rice growth duration in northeastern china has increased for more than 5 days with the rising temperature meaning that famers have begun to use longer maturity variety in the practice to compensate the negative impacts of climate change on rice yield tao et al 2013 for rice in other regions using heat tolerant or shorter maturity variety is imperative as the severe heat stress in booting and heading stages cannot be totally avoided by shifting sowing date fig 7b and c 4 3 uncertainty and limitation the projected impacts of heat stress on rice yield highly depend on the parameterization of rice spikelet fertility response to temperature however as limited by experiment data our study and almost all previous studies i e shen et al 2011 wang et al 2014 2017a tao et al 2008 2013 zhao et al 2016 assumed that the heat tolerance parameter did not vary across the whole study regions and was set as default fig 2 thus losses of rice yield from heat stress are almost certainly overestimated which is especially true for single rice in subtropical regions where some varieties have been found to have stronger heat resistance cao et al 2008 fu et al 2012 similarly a statistical study showed that american maize yield in regions with higher temperature are less sensitive to heat stress butler and huybers 2013 indicating that famers have begun to adapt to heat damage in practice but to what extent do crops adapt to the heat stress is still not clear which is beyond the scope of this study thus it is necessary to obtain more robust results of climate change impacts based on the accurate parameterization of rice spikelet fertility response to temperature in future study however only few previous experiments have focused on the heat resistance of different rice varieties although some studies have begun to test the response of the heat resistance of local rice varieties to high temperatures e g li et al 2014 cheabu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 most of them only tested regional varieties this suggests that more comprehensive temperature control experiments should be conducted to estimate the current heat resistance range of rice in china apart from the uncertainty of heat tolerance parameter an experimental study suggested that rice development rate does not reduce as quickly at higher temperature as we expected previously van oort et al 2011 this might underestimate the yield loss for all three types of rice in subtropical regions as growth duration would not increase that much compared with our results it also should be noticed that although oryza v3 is the most widely used rice model the effects of co2 concentration on crop transpiration was not considered bouman et al 2001 nir would thus undoubtedly be overestimated since rice leaf transpiration rate would be reduced under elevated co2 bunce 2014 environment control experiments showed that the reduction of rice evaporation rate under high co2 concentration 640 ppm varied largely among different varieties ranging from 4 to 25 lin et al 1996 although some crop models i e ceres rice have already taken the effects of co2 concentration on rice evaporation into consideration these environment experiments are necessary to improve the model simulation of the variety specific response of crop transpiration rate to elevated co2 concentration several other limitations and uncertainties of our study are worth pointing out here first rice irrigation was simulated under the scenario of full irrigation in reality water saving technologies i e control irrigation wetting and drying and continuous soil saturation have been developed and applied to replace full irrigation tabbal et al 2002 these technologies not only dramatically increased water productivity but also reduced irrigation frequency belder et al 2004 thus promoting water saving irrigation patterns should be a feasible adaption strategy to meet the shortage of irrigation water resources second the impacts of altering sowing date on crop the rotation system was ignored in china apart from northeastern plain rice wheat and rice oilseed rape rotation system dominated agricultural production in single rice regions cheng et al 2013 bai et al 2016 altering rice sowing date may thus occupy the normal growth windows of wheat or oilseed rape thereby going against the total output of the agricultural production system finally this study only applied one crop model in the projection of rice yield and nir while the simulation results varied largely across models asseng et al 2013 wallach et al 2018 recently several studies carried out by agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip have suggested that using model ensembles for simulating the impact of climate change on crop yields offers the opportunity to acquire more reliable results asseng et al 2013 bassu et al 2014 li et al 2015 more robust multiple models analysis through international collaborations should be conducted in the future 5 conclusion shifting sowing date is considered as a useful strategy in dealing with the impacts of climate change on chinese paddy rice production in this study we explored if shifting sowing dates will compensate the reduction of rice yield during 2011 2100 and if more irrigation will be needed to meet the water requirement for rice growth we found that under the effects of global warming and elevated consideration of co2 effects future rice yield would continue to decrease while irrigation water requirement nir would increase dramatically yield losses for rice in temperate regions northeastern china and yunan guizhou plateau were mainly caused by the sharply shortened growth duration while the losses in the other regions were mostly derived from the substantial heat stress to maximize rice yield the sowing date of single and early rice at most sites should be earlier than the current dates however in regions with sever heat stress such as yangtze river basin postponed sowing date was a more appropriate choice to avoid flowering period occurring in the extreme hot days apart from northeastern china the suitable sowing date could improve rice yield dramatically and completely compensate the yield losses due to the severe heat events meanwhile nir would further increase under the optimized sowing date without exception to better compensate the negative effects of climate change on rice yield and improve the utilization of precipitation breeding longer season varieties in northeastern china and heat tolerant varieties in subtropical regions would be the best adaptation strategies the results are of great importance not only for food security but also for

10795,warming and increasing extreme climate events are expected to reduce crop yields including rice production in china threatening the chinese food security shifting sowing date has been considered as a key adaptation strategy to sustain rice production in china however the extent to which it can mitigate the adverse climate change impact on yield and whether more irrigation is required remains unclear here by driving oryza v3 with four climate models gcms we analyzed the impacts of climate change on china rice yield and net irrigation water requirement nir at 21 sites under a wide range of sowing date we found that without altering sowing date weighted average rice yield for all sites will decline 5 1 7 3 and 15 1 in periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively yields losses in temperate zones are linked to increased crop development rates with higher temperatures but in subtropical regions the reduction is more related to the damage of heat stress during rice heading or flowering periods nir increases notably in all regions up to 71 except northeastern china where the shortened growth duration resulted in less time to consume water when the optimized sowing date is applied average yield losses will be effectively compensated to achieve these rice sowing date will be shifted by up to 54 days and on average 17 8 23 4 more fresh water in future periods are needed to meet the water requirement of rice growth we also found that due to increasing the frequency of heat events farmers in chinese rice production regions e g yangtze river basin will have narrow sowing windows at the end of this century this study suggests that adequate irrigation and adjusting sowing dates could mitigate the negative climate impacts on rice production in china keywords climate change adaptation sowing window food security irrigation water requirement rice 1 introduction rice is the most important cereal crop grown in china nearly one billion people depend on it as their staple food tao et al 2013 however its sustainable production is being faced with many challenges including labor shortage shen et al 2011 the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as ch4 zhang et al 2016 and the competition for paddy land and water resources from non agricultural sectors challinor et al 2014 furthermore climate change mainly characterized by increased temperature shifted rainfall patterns and more frequent extreme climate events piao et al 2010 has not only dramatically altered the climate condition godfray et al 2010 shen et al 2011 wang et al 2014 but also threatened the stable supply of irrigation water resources sun and yang 2012 zhang and zhou 2015 cao et al 2017 therefore it is imperative to project the future impacts of climate change on chinses paddy rice production and water consumption and further explore potential adaptation strategies climate change without adaptation is projected to influence crop growth and water use in a number of ways the elevated temperatures have been known to accelerate the growth process of most crops resulting in less time for biomass accumulation tao et al 2008 hawkins et al 2013 zheng et al 2012 on the other hand short periods of extreme high temperature during key crop growing stages such as flowering and grain filling are associated with dramatic yield loss by reducing the potential grain number or increasing the proportion of shrunken grains ciais et al 2005 fuller et al 2007 butler and huybers 2013 apart from affecting crop yield warming also has many influences on crop water use including the acceleration of crop evapotranspiration rate at a higher temperature as well as the shortened crop growing duration for water consumption wang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 ding et al 2017 owing to the adequate irrigation rice production in china is not easily threatened by drought but in recent years climate change has dramatically shifted the precipitation pattern in south china the main rice planting region causing severe shortages of available irrigation water resources tan et al 2017 hu et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 unlike the adverse impacts of temperature increase and precipitation variation the increasing co2 concentration is known to have positive effects on crop production elevated co2 is anticipated to improve crop yield through expressing higher thermotolerance of photosynthesis which is especially the case for c3 crops such as rice and soybean taub et al 2000 chapin et al 2011 jin et al 2017 moreover by increasing crop stomatal closure elevated co2 leads to decreased crop transpiration rate thus benefiting the reduction in irrigation water requirement tao et al 2008 elliott et al 2014 deryng et al 2016 wang et al 2017a expanding cropping area shifting sowing date switching to new varieties further optimizing the using of water and fertilizer are strategies to cope with climate change for sustaining crop production lobell et al 2008 2015 rurinda et al 2015 however the current situation of rice production system in china may limit the application of the most aforementioned adaptive strategies since the han dynasty 202ce 220ce to feed the growing population chinese people have exploited most of the arable land to maximize food production with intensive labor water and fertilizer inputs which is known as intensive and meticulous farming today with the help of modern irrigation systems widely distributed fertilizer plants and high yield hybrid varieties this intensive farming system has helped to close the yield gap between realized and potential peng et al 2009 statistical data showed that china provides 27 8 of global rice production within only 18 57 of its planting area faostat 2018 in other words under a changing climate and rising food demand most of the common adaptation strategies lost their brilliance with this farming system as yield cannot be easily increased by reducing water deficit and more fertilizer use or expanding arable land like africa and southeast asia did where the shortages of water and nutrients are the main limitations in their rice production lobell 2008 shifting sowing date a low cost and easy implement strategy waongo et al 2015 rurinda et al 2015 is thus the key adaptation strategy which can allow crop growth to occur in the periods with more suitable climate conditions zheng et al 2012 irrigation the most paramount factor to maintain the high rice yield in china and by far the largest component ab 54 of national total anthropogenic fresh water consumption wang et al 2017b is expected to change significantly under the combined effects of climate change and shifted sowing date raising concerns regarding whether water resources shortage will be a limiting factor for rice production under future optimized sowing date elliott et al 2014 ye et al 2015 ding et al 2017 for instance although earlier sowing date in northeast china may be beneficial to rice yield the critical water consumption period such as heading may miss the rainy season resulting in a sharp increase in the amount of water needed for irrigation it also should be noticed that future available irrigation water resources could be limited by the increasing water consumption from non food uses challinor et al 2016 wang et al 2013 samani et al 2018 statistical evidence has been showed that due to the shortage of irrigation water resources rice cultivation area in the north china plain has decreased dramatically in the past 30 years national bureau statistics of china 2014 gao and luo 2008 therefore the projection of rice irrigation water requirement under the shifted sowing date is of significant implications for both food security and water security process based crop models that can simulate the interactions between multiple environmental factors and management practices are useful tools to assess the impacts of climate change on crop growth and explore potential adaptation strategies boote et al 1996 keating et al 2003 van oijen and lefelaar 2008 chenu et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 liu et al 2016 by using the crop models extensive studies have attempted to evaluate the potential impacts of future climate change on rice yield i e yao et al 2007 xiong et al 2009 tao et al 2008 shen et al 2011 wang et al 2014 2017a xu et al 2015 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however to our knowledge existing modeling studies have neither given an explicit answer to the extent to which shifting sowing date can offset the impacts of climate change on rice production nor given how the corresponding irrigation water requirement would change more efforts are thus needed to explore the potential adaptation and its impacts on water consumption in order to inform future rice breeding and water resources utilization in this study the oryza v3 crop model bouman et al 2001 li et al 2017 driven by four bias corrected global climate datasets at 21 agricultural experimental sites spanning the main rice production regions in china was used to investigate the comprehensive impacts of climate change and shifting sowing date on rice yield and water consumption in china the following four questions were addressed 1 how does climate change affect the yield and nir on chinses paddy rice under current field management practices and cultivar choices 2 how will the sowing date be adjusted to optimize rice yield 3 to what extent can changing planting date mitigate the negative effects of climate change on rice yield and 4 how will the corresponding nir change under the altered sowing date 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental data twenty one agro meteorology experimental sites aes spanning the main china rice growing regions from temperate zone to south subtropical zone were studied fig 1 these sites were maintained by china meteorological administration cma and purposefully selected to represent different rice types single early and late rice and different rice planting regions classified by mei et al 1988 generally single rice is cultivated in southwestern china and the north of the yangtze river where rice is sown between march 10th and june 15th while double rice rotation between early and late rice is the typical cropping system in the south of the yangtze river with early rice and late rice sown around march 20th and july 5th respectively however due to the short of labor force or rotation with other crops such as sugarcane shen et al 2011 farmers in the double rice cultivation regions might only breed early or late rice in one year thus early and late rice sites in guangxi and fujian provinces are not at the same location fig 1 historical data of rice phenology i e sowing transplanting flowering maturity dates yields and management practices from 2002 to 2012 were extracted from the aess these experiment data were collected based on a uniform cma observation standards and guidelines liu et al 2012 2 2 current and future climate data to quantify future climate and its uncertainty impacts a number of climate projections from general circulation models gcms were used xing et al 2014 rurinda et al 2015 lobell et al 2015 specifically future climate data from 2011 to 2100 were obtained from four gcms including hadgem2 es bcc csm1 1 m miroc esm chem and gfdl esm2m see table s1 participating in the coupled model intercomparsion project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 we considered these four gcms because they fully meet the data required to simulate rice yield and paddy water balance at the same time and were widely used in climate change studies in china e g yin et al 2015 guo et al 2015 wang et al 2017a four representative concentration pathways rcp2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 were released by cmip5 taylor et al 2012 but we only focus on the high concentration pathway rcp 8 5 for which radiative forcing rise to 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 historical daily climate data including minimum and maximum temperatures sunshine duration relative humidity wind speed and precipitation from 1976 to 2013 at each site were obtained from national meteorological information centre of china nmic of cma to meet the data requirement to force crop model sunshine duration and relative humidity were converted to solar radiation and actual vapour pressure using the method provided by prescott 1940 and allen et al 1998 respectively the climate data were bias corrected against the baseline observed data the minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation wind speed and vapour pressure data were corrected by quantile mapping li et al 2010 wang and chen 2013 the precipitation data were corrected with the method of piani et al 2010 that can reproduce extreme events and eliminate excessive number of occurrences of drizzle it should be specially noticed that although the ensemble of multiple gcms improves the projection of climate data aggregating of many climate models directly could shift climate patterns for instance bringing more wet days and less extreme precipitation therefore in this study we drive the crop model with the individual gcm outputs and then average the simulation results across the four gcms 2 3 crop model description rice yield and irrigation water requirement in response to future climate change and shifting planting date were simulated using oryza v3 https sites google com a irri org oryza2000 oryza is an advanced dynamic eco physiological model jointly developed by international rice research institute irri and wageningen university karim et al 2012 driving by weather soil crop and management data the model simulates rice yield growth stage dry matter distribution and water balance under water stress nitrogen stress and n w stress conditions on a daily basis oryza v3 has a detailed water balance module which allows the users to set up complexed irrigation schemes in modeling experiments bouman et al 2001 the model is also more suitable to simulate nir of lowland rice than other models such as ceres rice and wofost meanwhile the performance of oryza has been widely validated against the experimental data in a wide range of climate regions in asia e g karim et al 2012 shen et al 2011 li et al 2013 yuan et al 2017 in recent years oryza has been successfully applied in china to evaluate the options to grow rice with less water bouman et al 2007 investigate the impacts of climate change on rice production wang et al 2014 and irrigation luo et al 2015 and monitor large scale rice growth and development by combining remote sensing data setiyono et al 2012 pazhanivelan et al 2015 the accurate simulation of rice growth period duration gpd is crucial for this study since warming over rice growing season causes yield change primarily through its effects on the length of life cycle furthermore nir is also highly related to crop life cycle zhao et al 2015 in oryza v3 the development stage dvs indicating rice physiological age is calculated based on hourly increments in heat units huh cd h 1 the response of temperature to huh is simplified as a linear function fig 2 a for temperature below the base temperature tbd or higher than the maximum temperature tmd rice development will stop while temperature equals the optimum temperature tod rice grows fastest in this study the values of these three cardinal temperatures tbd tod and tmd are 8 30 and 42 c respectively gao et al 1992 apart from the length of rice life cycle spikelet sterile the key factors related to rice yield losses are also sensitive to extreme high or low temperatures horie et al 1992 the cooling degree days coldtt cd during rice panicle stage 0 75 dvs 1 2 is used to evaluate the impacts of cold temperature on sterility while the average daily maximum temperature tfert c over flowering period 0 96 dvs 1 22 is adopted to describe the relationship between high temperature and rice fertility bouman et al 2001 according to horie et al 1992 when daily mean temperature is less than 22 c or average daily maximum temperature during flowering period is higher than 35 c the percentage of rice spikelet fertility will be dramatically reduced fig 2b and c unlike the upland crops such as wheat and maize rice cultivation in china is dominated by paddy field farming the most water intensive type of crop planting in oryza v3 rice irrigation water requirement was determined by soil water balance which can be briefly described as 1 d w i r r c e t s p d where d w is the change of field water stored i r is irrigation water requirement r c e t s p and d represent precipitation capillary rise evaporation transpiration seepage percolation and evapotranspiration respectively the irrigation scheduling irrigation time and amount is determined by the subroutine irrig which provides five optional manners in which irrigation is applied and computes the daily amount of irrigation as a function of user specified criteria the five irrigation criteria are rained irrigation supplied as input data irrigation at critical ponded soil water depth irrigation at critical soil water tension irrigation at critical soil water content and irrigation at x days after disappearance of ponded water 2 4 crop model simulation to assess the impacts of climate change on rice production and water consumption and explore the potential adaptability we first conducted the simulation for baseline 1981 2010 and three future periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 under current sowing date subsequently from 2011 to 2100 the simulation was carried out for planting dates at one day intervals across a wide range of windows the detailed information about current sowing date and growth duration for each site can be found in figure s1 the sowing window for late rice was set to start from 150 julian days of the year because late rice is widely recognized as sowing after may huang et al 2017 to consider the effects of co2 fertilization the co2 concentration for future three stages were set as 449 541 and 850 ppm respectively besides as nearly 95 of china rice production area is fully irrigated and fertilized all of the simulations in this study were performed without any limitation on water and nitrogen when computing region wide aggregate statistics the rice sites were weighted based on the rice production in the region these weights are shown in figure s2 soil data is highly related to deep percolation a key element in water balance processes however for the following three reasons soil data for all rice sites were set as default and daily soil percolation for each site was set as fixed value provided by a national scale investigation chen et al 1995 firstly unlike upland crops soil percolation in paddy field is also highly related to non soil type factors such as groundwater level spacing of drainage ditches and drainage depth as a result it is almost impossible to output an accurate percolation value by point based crop model secondly considering the great differences in soil properties in different regions the large scale investigation percolation values are more representative than point scale simulation thirdly as paddy field is always maintained with a certain depth of water the percolation is almost constant during rice growing period the fixed percolation value for each site can be found in figure s3 due to the large differences in climate conditions rice varieties vary obviously in different cultivation regions for example to adapt to the short growing window in northeastern china rice life cycle in this region is usually less than 155 days while in the warm southwestern china rice life cycle can be longer than 170 days figure s1 thus in order to simulate the impacts of climate change on china rice production more accurately we use site specific cultivars and not one for all sites for a specific site observed phenological and yield data from 2002 to 2012 were divided into two groups the data from odd years were used for calibration the cultivar parameters while the rest experiment data were used for validation given the limitation of collected experimental data we only adjust the most sensitive parameters to rice yield and water consumption such as phenology and dry matter distribution parameters luo et al 2015 the other parameters were set the same as the experiment we carried out in our previous study wang et al 2017a this setting might bring a certain degree of uncertainty to the simulation results nevertheless a recent study on crop model uncertainty showed that the uncertainty resulted from crop parameters is small when investigating changes in predictions and averaging over multiple years decreases the prediction bias by a wide margin wallach et al 2016 with the help of two calibration programs drates and param that are built in the oryza we calibrated rice genetic parameters at each site then the calibrated model was driven with observed meteorology data from the even years to simulate crop yields and gpds for validation fig 3 showed the validation results of rice growth duration and yield at 21 sites simulated yield and growth duration for three types of rice are mostly in agreement with observational data from china meteorological administration deviations exist at some sites because experimental data are obtained with assumptions of no weeds pests or other limiting factors 3 results 3 1 projected climate change warming is roughly equal across the sites during rice growing season although the mean temperature of the baselined period 1981 2010 varied largely among different regions the average daily minimum temperatures tmax over growing season for all sites were projected to increase by 0 8 c in 2011 2040 2 3 c in 2041 2070 and 4 6 c in 2071 2100 fig 4 a by contrast the directions of changes in projected growing season precipitation were less clear but there was no significant change in the mean annual precipitation fig 4b the change of radiation was similar to that of tmax but with more distinct spatial variability for example in southern china net radiation would increase on average of 7 during 2071 2100 while in northeastern china 15 increment for the same period was found killing degree days kdd the sum of rice growing season maximum temperatures in excess of 35 c indicates the cumulative of heat events that might have adverse impacts on rice development in the baseline period apart from several sites i e wx and jh in the middle subtropical regions most sites suffer less heat damages kdd 20 c d which is especially true for sites in northeastern china in line with our study sun and huang 2011 showed that global warming in the past 50 years did not enhance high temperature stress in heading flowering stage for most china rice cultivation regions however analysis of future climate scenarios predicted large variations in the occurrence of heat events across the entire china rice cultivation region ranging from locations still with negligible heat events e g northeastern china to locations with severe extreme hot days e g north subtropical climate region fig 4d 3 2 impacts on rice yields and nir under current sowing date with the consideration of co2 fertilization weighted average yields the weight of each site can be found in figure s2 will decrease 5 1 7 3 and 15 1 in 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively fig 5 a among the single rice sites the largest yield decreases 30 was found at wx in sichuan basin which could be explained by the most severe heat damage it would experience fig 4d compared to single rice the mean yield losses for early rice were small with the largest yield reduction of 14 occurring at jh during 2071 2100 noticeably slight yield increases were observed at three late rice sites i e gy gp and zz and one single rice site i e zh in 2011 2040 and 2041 2070 projected nir for most sites would continue to increase in three future stages but dramatically decreased nir was also found fig 5c for single rice in northeastern china and yunnan guizhou plateau nir would decrease by up to 31 with the dramatically shortened rice growth duration but at the rest single rice sites nir would increase by up to 49 for early rice although the growth duration was shortened nir showed an obviously increasing trend with the value ranging from 21 to 71 in 2070 2100 period similar to that of early rice sites increased nir was observed across all late rice sites while the increasing magnitude was relatively small less than 19 3 3 changes in yield and nir under optimized sowing date when the sowing date was shifted from current to the optimized date yields increased notably for all sites in both near and long term climates periods fig 5a especially for single rice in subtropical regions i e jz gs my wx where the yield increase was even higher than 40 while the yield increases in northeastern china i e hl th was small less than 10 resulting in that the optimized yield in this region was still lower than that over the baseline period similar to most single rice sites early rice sites also showed dramatically yield increase under the optimized sowing date up to 31 however the increase of yield for late rice was much smaller across most sites among which the largest increase 11 was observed at zhangzhou zz in 2011 2040 in general apart from northeastern china shifting sowing date could effectively mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on china rice yield under optimized sowing date the increase to average nir will be raised from 7 8 6 3 and 10 9 to 17 8 20 6 and 23 4 in 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively fig 5c for most sites shifted sowing date prolonged crop water consumption time reduced the synchronization of the key rice water consumption stage and precipitation period resulting in a large increase in nir fig 5b and c nevertheless for several late rice sites e g zz and gy the nir will be reduced to a certain degree because of the shortened rice growth durations 3 4 the optimized sowing dates and sowing time windows the optimal sowing date refers to the breeding date that rice yield could be maximized considering that rice breeding could be influenced by non meteorological factors such as rotation with other crops or short of irrigation water resources we also analyzed the potential sowing time windows to allow farmers sowing with more flexibilities the possible sowing windows were defined as a group of planting dates that the corresponding yields are high than 90 of the maximum yield see the examples in figure s4 the optimal sowing date would continue to advance up to 13 32 and 37 days for 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively at the four northeastern sites where an early sowing date would provide relatively cold environment to slow down rice development rate to help dry matter accumulation fig 6 while for the remaining single rice sites to avoid the heat stress during key rice growing periods sowing earlier or later was feasible fig 6a in case of early rice the optimal sowing dates would be on average 15 days earlier in 2011 2040 23 days in 2041 2070 and 28 days in 2071 2100 fig 6b however the shift directions for late rice sites were not uniform and the shift days were much shorter than the other two types of rice especially at gy site where the optimal sowing date would only be 5 days earlier in both 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods fig 6c the start date of the potential sowing windows would be earlier at all single and early rice sites but the lengths of these windows were much more complicated in general with temperature increasing more dates are warm enough for rice growth this is true for single rice in northeastern china but it is too hot for rice flowering and heading in southern china in summer rice sowing windows in this region are thus divided into two separate narrow periods fig 6a for early rice both the start and end days of the possible sowing windows are earlier resulting in wider sowing windows for farmers fig 6b for late rice the possible sowing windows started from julian day of 150 but ended later with temperature increasing fig 6c 4 discussion climate change will inevitably challenge the future production and water resource utilization of rice ipcc 2007 piao et al 2010 wang et al 2017a given the special rice production situation in china shifting sowing date is anticipated to have an important role in mitigating the challenges of climate change on crop production lobell et al 2015 waongo et al 2015 by using bias corrected climate projections from multiple gcms and the well tested oryza v3 crop model we explicitly assessed the impacts of climate change on growth duration yield and net irrigation water requirement nir of rice across china this study for the first time evaluated the extent to which shifting sowing date could mitigate the negative effects of climate change on rice yield we also investigated how nir would change along with the shifted sowing date 4 1 climate change is predicted to affect china rice production and water utilization differently depending on the region in temperate regions e g northeastern china in spite of the extended crop growth windows under the increasing temperature tao et al 2008 wang et al 2012 rice growth duration was anticipated to decease for more than 30 days at the end of this century fig 5 along with the shortened growth duration rice yields in these regions were reduced by up to 19 as shortened rice life cycle dramatically reduced the available time for rice to acquire radiation co2 and nutrients for biomass accumulation dennett 1999 springate and kover 2014 other modelling studies also predicated the similar shortened growth duration for crops shen et al 2011 wang et al 2014 for instance a recent study showed that australia wheat life cycle would anticipated to shorten by up to 42 days at 2050 zheng et al 2012 generally this is a typical form of crop yield loss most climate change related yield loss around the world could be explained by the shortened growth duration tao et al 2008 shen et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 however it should be noticed that although the magnitude of rice yield loss in subtropical regions was like that in temperate regions rice growth duration was almost unchanged or even prolonged by up to 12 days at some sites fig 5 this seems to be inconsistent with most previous modeling studies in this region e g shen et al 2011 wang et al 2014 in fact crop development rate would not accelerate continuously with temperature increase lu et al 2008 zhao et al 2007 which is especially true for rice in subtropical regions as the growing season temperature is close to or even exceeds the optimal development temperature during the baseline period fig 4 thus yield loss for single rice in subtropical regions could be largely attributed to the dramatically increased heat events that occurred in the key rice growth stages fig 4 and fig 7 it also needs to be noticed that although the average growing season temperature of late rice sites in south subtropical regions i e zhangzhou gaoyao and guiping was obviously higher than in other regions fig 4 the yield of late rice in this region would increase by up to 10 fig 5 a reasonable explanation is that the high temperature here slowed the rice development rate resulting in a longer growth duration for biomass accumulation meanwhile the late sowing date made the key rice growing period avoid the extreme heat damage fig 7 the projected changes in net irrigation water requirement nir differed notably across the different climate regions fig 5 especially between temperate regions and subtropical regions which was due to the large variations in the changes of growth duration warming shortened single rice growth duration more than 30 days in temperate regions but much less so for rice in other regions the shortened growth duration results in less time for rice to consume water by evapotranspiration therefore although the elevated temperature and solar radiation could increase crop evapotranspiration rate the notably shortened growth duration well explained the slightly reduced nir for rice in temperate regions fig 5 by contrast under combined effects of prolonged rice life cycle increased temperature and solar radiation nir in subtropical regions e g sichuan basin and middle lower yangtze river basin showed a prominent increase in line with our study other nir projection studies also anticipated the increased water consumption in subtropical regions ye et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 however as they assumed the fixed rice growth duration the projected nir in those studies was different from the results presents here thus the vital effect of rice growth length on irrigation water requirement implies that phenology simulation is essential in investigating crop water consumption wriedt et al 2009 zhao et al 2015 4 2 adaptation of china rice production to climate change warming shortens rice growth duration in northeastern china and increases heat stress in other regions figs 4 and 5 altering sowing date is considered as a useful strategy to slow down development rate and avoid heat damage zheng et al 2012 in this study under the optimized sowing date rice yield was projected to increase fig 5a however rice nir would also increase dramatically under the optimized sowing date especially for single rice sites in northeastern china fig 5c this should be attributed to the following two reasons first rice growth duration was prolonged at most sites which resulted in more time for rice to consume water by evapotranspiration second shifted sowing date also reduced the synchronization of the rice key water consumption stage and precipitation period at most sites leading to a large increase in nir see examples in fig 7 however it should be noticed that shifting sowing date could only partly compensate the negative effects on rice yield in northeastern china more adaptation strategies are thus necessary to employ fortunately the response mechanism of rice yield to warming allows using new rice variety to adapt to climate change liu et al 2012 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 for single rice in northeastern china and yunnan guizhou plateau although the earlier sowing date slowed down the development rate rice growth duration would still be shorter on average of 12 days than that in the baseline period thus given the negligible heat stress fig 7a longer maturity variety should be adopted in line with our study a recent study showed that in the past 30 years rice growth duration in northeastern china has increased for more than 5 days with the rising temperature meaning that famers have begun to use longer maturity variety in the practice to compensate the negative impacts of climate change on rice yield tao et al 2013 for rice in other regions using heat tolerant or shorter maturity variety is imperative as the severe heat stress in booting and heading stages cannot be totally avoided by shifting sowing date fig 7b and c 4 3 uncertainty and limitation the projected impacts of heat stress on rice yield highly depend on the parameterization of rice spikelet fertility response to temperature however as limited by experiment data our study and almost all previous studies i e shen et al 2011 wang et al 2014 2017a tao et al 2008 2013 zhao et al 2016 assumed that the heat tolerance parameter did not vary across the whole study regions and was set as default fig 2 thus losses of rice yield from heat stress are almost certainly overestimated which is especially true for single rice in subtropical regions where some varieties have been found to have stronger heat resistance cao et al 2008 fu et al 2012 similarly a statistical study showed that american maize yield in regions with higher temperature are less sensitive to heat stress butler and huybers 2013 indicating that famers have begun to adapt to heat damage in practice but to what extent do crops adapt to the heat stress is still not clear which is beyond the scope of this study thus it is necessary to obtain more robust results of climate change impacts based on the accurate parameterization of rice spikelet fertility response to temperature in future study however only few previous experiments have focused on the heat resistance of different rice varieties although some studies have begun to test the response of the heat resistance of local rice varieties to high temperatures e g li et al 2014 cheabu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 most of them only tested regional varieties this suggests that more comprehensive temperature control experiments should be conducted to estimate the current heat resistance range of rice in china apart from the uncertainty of heat tolerance parameter an experimental study suggested that rice development rate does not reduce as quickly at higher temperature as we expected previously van oort et al 2011 this might underestimate the yield loss for all three types of rice in subtropical regions as growth duration would not increase that much compared with our results it also should be noticed that although oryza v3 is the most widely used rice model the effects of co2 concentration on crop transpiration was not considered bouman et al 2001 nir would thus undoubtedly be overestimated since rice leaf transpiration rate would be reduced under elevated co2 bunce 2014 environment control experiments showed that the reduction of rice evaporation rate under high co2 concentration 640 ppm varied largely among different varieties ranging from 4 to 25 lin et al 1996 although some crop models i e ceres rice have already taken the effects of co2 concentration on rice evaporation into consideration these environment experiments are necessary to improve the model simulation of the variety specific response of crop transpiration rate to elevated co2 concentration several other limitations and uncertainties of our study are worth pointing out here first rice irrigation was simulated under the scenario of full irrigation in reality water saving technologies i e control irrigation wetting and drying and continuous soil saturation have been developed and applied to replace full irrigation tabbal et al 2002 these technologies not only dramatically increased water productivity but also reduced irrigation frequency belder et al 2004 thus promoting water saving irrigation patterns should be a feasible adaption strategy to meet the shortage of irrigation water resources second the impacts of altering sowing date on crop the rotation system was ignored in china apart from northeastern plain rice wheat and rice oilseed rape rotation system dominated agricultural production in single rice regions cheng et al 2013 bai et al 2016 altering rice sowing date may thus occupy the normal growth windows of wheat or oilseed rape thereby going against the total output of the agricultural production system finally this study only applied one crop model in the projection of rice yield and nir while the simulation results varied largely across models asseng et al 2013 wallach et al 2018 recently several studies carried out by agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip have suggested that using model ensembles for simulating the impact of climate change on crop yields offers the opportunity to acquire more reliable results asseng et al 2013 bassu et al 2014 li et al 2015 more robust multiple models analysis through international collaborations should be conducted in the future 5 conclusion shifting sowing date is considered as a useful strategy in dealing with the impacts of climate change on chinese paddy rice production in this study we explored if shifting sowing dates will compensate the reduction of rice yield during 2011 2100 and if more irrigation will be needed to meet the water requirement for rice growth we found that under the effects of global warming and elevated consideration of co2 effects future rice yield would continue to decrease while irrigation water requirement nir would increase dramatically yield losses for rice in temperate regions northeastern china and yunan guizhou plateau were mainly caused by the sharply shortened growth duration while the losses in the other regions were mostly derived from the substantial heat stress to maximize rice yield the sowing date of single and early rice at most sites should be earlier than the current dates however in regions with sever heat stress such as yangtze river basin postponed sowing date was a more appropriate choice to avoid flowering period occurring in the extreme hot days apart from northeastern china the suitable sowing date could improve rice yield dramatically and completely compensate the yield losses due to the severe heat events meanwhile nir would further increase under the optimized sowing date without exception to better compensate the negative effects of climate change on rice yield and improve the utilization of precipitation breeding longer season varieties in northeastern china and heat tolerant varieties in subtropical regions would be the best adaptation strategies the results are of great importance not only for food security but also for

10796,the field experiment was conducted to develop a drip irrigation management method using treated wastewater effluent for chinese rose rosa chinensis cultivation in coastal saline soil during 2015 2016 five irrigation treatments were evaluated consisting of treated effluent electrical conductivity 4 2 6 9 ds m blended with fresh water effluent proportions of 0 25 50 75 and 100 chinese rose was planted in ridges above a gravel sand layer at the depth of 100 cm irrigation was based on soil matric potential smp and managed in three stages including enhanced salt leaching stage continuous irrigation water salt regulation stage smp 5 kpa and normal irrigation stage smp 10 kpa the study showed drip irrigation with different proportions of treated effluent could enhance salt leaching after the first two stages about 3 5 months soil salinity above the gravel sand layer was reduced from 37 4 ds m to 2 16 3 86 ds m throughout one year of the normal irrigation stage salinity increases that exceeded 1 ds m in the root zone soil were observed in the treatments of 75 and 100 treated effluent and mainly during a dry season in bohai region the survival rate of chinese rose decreased by 0 5 in the first two stages of irrigation depending on treatments but a notable reduction in plant survival rate was found in the first month of a new growing period under normal irrigation therefore in saline soil typical of sea reclamation land drip irrigation with different levels of treated effluent can be used for chinese rose cultivation in the enhanced salt leaching and water salt regulation stages of irrigation irrigation water containing 50 treated effluent is feasible in the normal irrigation stage except for the first month of the new growing period for which water containing 25 treated effluent should be used keywords chinese rose irrigation management salt leaching sandy loam soil soil salinity 1 introduction the bohai region of china bordering the pacific ocean has a long coastline and the land area expands out to sea wang et al 1993 wang et al 2014 the region has a semi humid monsoon climate with a ratio of evaporation capacity to rainfall amount of 3 4 the soil salt content 0 5 2 0 and the shallow groundwater salt content 10 30 g l are usually severely saline and the main salt ions are chloride and sodium wang et al 1993 therefore there are great limitations on plant cultivation in the coastal saline soil especially for perennial plants the key to salinity control is leaching a net downward movement of soil water and salt through the root zone soil asano and pettygrove 1987 oster 1994 some studies conducted on coastal saline land have found that trickle irrigation with suitable irrigation management was feasible for the reclamation of severely saline soil chen et al 2015 li et al 2015b 2016 li et al 2019 in their studies continuous irrigation was used in the first several days to reduce the surface soil salinity and create a suitable environment for the establishment of plants afterwards the irrigation was based on a soil matric potential smp of 5 kpa to leach salt out of soil above a gravel sand layer which existed below the root zone and prevented shallow saline groundwater flowing upward into the root zone soil through capillary pores sun et al 2013 the per capita freshwater supply of the bohai region is approximately 660 m3 per year in the research area the over exploitation of deep groundwater has lowered the groundwater table with a declining rate between 0 65 and 1 39 m per year sun 2007 as an alternative water supply treated effluent has been recognized as a resource having a large exploration potential in the coastal cities of the bohai region the estimated amount of treated effluent was 3 9 billion m3 in 2015 li 2016 liu 2016 wei 2016 wu and peng 2016 while the reuse rate is pretty low about 8 3 li 2016 unfortunately as an irrigation source treated effluent is rich in salts and some specific ions that may increase the natural soil salt content affect soil permeability and plant growth asano and pettygrove 1987 drip irrigation gives advantage over these problems to some degree when poor quality water is used kang et al 2010 shalhevet 1994 drip irrigation can maintain high smp that compensates for low osmotic potential because it applies water at a low discharge rate and a high frequency goldberg et al 1976 kang 1998 for many plants the sensitivity to salinity varies from one stage of growth to the next maas 1990 maas and poss 1989 maas et al 1986 but the main temporal effect of salinity on a plant is the duration of exposure shalhevet 1994 irrigating with treated effluent in saline soil must maintain salinity at non toxic levels to plants on the same experiment site as used in the present research micro sprinkler irrigation with different proportions of treated effluent was shown to be feasible for tall fescue a moderately salt tolerant plant li et al 2019 previously using chinese rose rosa chinensis a salt sensitive plant li et al 2015a found that there was an average survival rate of 98 7 when the plant was established using fresh water and then irrigated with saline water having an electrical conductivity ec of 0 8 7 8 ds m for 4 months at the smp of 5 kpa however the survival rate decreased to 8 9 96 7 in the next year on account of different irrigation water quality chinese rose is a plant widely used in landscape design and construction the objectives of the present study were 1 to evaluate changes in soil salinity when different levels of treated effluent were used 2 to determine the survival rate of chinese rose at different levels of soil salinity in different growth stages and irrigation management stages and 3 to develop a drip irrigation method for applying treated effluent to chinese rose in severely saline sea reclamation land 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this study was conducted between 2015 and 2016 on land reclaimed from the sea in the industrial zone of caofeidian district china 39 03 n 118 48 e located in the north of the bohai region bordering the pacific ocean this region belongs to typical semi humid monsoon climate it is dry and windy in winter and spring but rainy and hot in summer with a mean annual precipitation of 555 mm in the research area the soil at the experimental site is classified as sandy loam the average ec of saturated soil extracts ece was 37 4 ds m chloride and sodium are the main ions soil ph and sodium adsorption ratio sar were 7 6 and 57 0 mmol l 0 5 respectively the water table was 0 8 1 2 m below the soil surface as described in li et al 2019 2 2 experimental design five irrigation water treatments were investigated consisting of treated wastewater effluent blended with fresh water in which treated effluent comprised 0 gr1 25 gr2 50 gr3 75 gr4 and 100 gr5 each treatment was replicated three times and arranged in a complete randomized block design each plot was 5 5 3 8 m and contained six ridges chinese roses were planted in the middle of the ridges on 7 june 2015 at a spacing of 0 5 m 0 6 m to prevent soil salinity damage to plant roots during the early stage of salt leaching non saline sandy soil was placed around the root ball fig 1 the irrigation water was applied by gravity drip irrigation from a feed tank 1 8 m3 and 1 7 m high located 0 8 m above the ground with an average emitter discharge of 0 56 l h driplines were placed on the soil surface of the ridges with one line per ridge before planting the saline soil was removed to about 100 cm depth and at the downslope edge of the land a drain was dug to remove leaching water then a gravel layer 10 cm overlain by a sand layer 5 cm was placed in the excavated area to prevent capillary action from drawing shallow groundwater into the upper soil and plant root zone finally the previously removed saline soil was replaced in the plot and leveled achieving an average soil bulk density of 1 55 g cm3 the treated effluent was transported from the caofeidian district sewage treatment plant the fresh water used in the blended irrigation water was deep layer groundwater the quality of treated effluent fresh water and their blended irrigation water is described in li et al 2019 the salt content of the treated effluent ec 4 2 6 9 ds m was several times that of the fresh water ec 1 0 ds m moreover based on the criteria described by ayers and westcot 1985 the blended irrigation water quality of the gr1 gr2 and gr3 treatments posed a severe a slight to moderate and a slight permeability risk respectively while water used in gr4 and gr5 treatments posed no risk the irrigation application started at the same time the roses were planted as the irrigation was applied soil salt distribution changed and the soil salinity decreased therefore the irrigation was managed into enhanced salt leaching stage l1 water salt regulation stage l2 and normal irrigation stage n3 l1 stage served to leach the surface soil salts in a short time to prevent the salts from the bulk soil flowing into the root ball during heavy rainfall during l1 irrigation started when there was no water visible on the soil surface and was terminated when large area ponding was visible l2 stage served to leach salts out of the whole soil above the gravel sand layer the smp at a depth of 0 2 m was controlled at 5 kpa chen et al 2015 li et al 2015a and the depth of irrigation water was 10 mm each time l2 ended when the average ece in the 0 100 cm soil profile decreased to 4 ds m n3 stage served to keep soil salinity in ranges that provided a suitable environment for plant growth during n3 irrigation was applied to maintain the smp at 10 kpa 2 3 observations and measurements the smp 0 2 m depth was measured by a tensiometer included in a ridge of each treatment fig 1 the measurements began from the l2 stage and were observed daily at 8 00 and 16 00 soil samples were collected from each plot in the mid or the end of each irrigation management stages the soil sampling sites were at distances of 0 10 20 30 cm from the drip emitter all sample depths measured from tops of the ridges were divided into 10 cm or 20 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm i e 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil ece was determined from the extracts of saturated soil and it was measured using a conductivity meter dds 307 rex shanghai china the average ece within the soil profile was calculated using eq 1 1 e c e t j k n m e c e t j k s j k j k n m s j k in which t is the sampling time j is the horizontal distance n from the sampling drip emitter k is the sampling depth m and s j k is the depth interval of the soil layer 2 4 statistical procedures the statistical analysis was conducted using ibm spss statistical software ver 19 0 ibm co armonk ny usa the differences in survival rates of chinese rose among different

usa and surfer 13 0 golden software inc golden co usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation irrigation and soil matric potential 3 1 1 precipitation and irrigation the total precipitation from april to november in 2015 and 2016 amounted at 565 mm and 539 mm respectively fig 2 the l1 stage lasted about 10 d and there was no rain however the total irrigation amount was 180 mm table 1 during the l2 stage 2015 7 2015 11 the precipitation was 395 mm there were 10 rainfall events of less than 5 mm one event of 5 10 mm seven events of 10 25 mm and five events of more than 25 mm the irrigation amount was between 400 and 570 mm for gr1 gr5 treatments with no obvious patterns observed among treatments during the n3 stage in 2016 the irrigation amount for gr1 gr5 treatments was in the range 330 480 mm and there was no significant linear correlation between the irrigation amount and the survival rate of chinese rose while the total precipitation was 539 mm the rainfall events mainly occurred in mid june to late june 2016 22 6 and in late july to early september 2016 58 1 during the n3 stage there were 18 events of less than 5 mm six events of 5 10 mm 12 events of 10 25 mm and seven events of more than 25 mm the winter dormancy period extended from november to march 3 1 2 soil matric potential the smp at a depth of 20 cm was monitored during the l2 and n3 stages once the observed value reached the target value the irrigation was applied as fig 3 shows during the l2 stage most observed smp values were above i e less negative or near 5 kpa during the n3 stage the smp threshold was controlled mostly at 10 kpa except during a rainless period from late april to mid may when the smp threshold was adjusted to 5 kpa to reduce salt stress on plants some smp values exceeded the control threshold especially on hot days which was likely because the monitoring data from the tensiometers lagged the actual smp 3 2 effect of drip irrigation using treated effluent on soil salinity 3 2 1 soil salt leaching because the experimental site was located on land reclaimed from the sea soil salinity as measured by ece was naturally high during the l1 stage 10 d ece of the surface soil was significantly reduced fig 4 a the average ece in the ridge for the gr1 gr5 treatments from 37 4 ds m dropped to 2 11 2 50 2 75 4 24 and 4 46 ds m respectively a fall of 94 36 93 32 92 64 88 67 and 88 06 respectively fig 5 a significantly lower salinity occurred in gr1 gr2 and gr3 treatments compared to gr4 and gr5 treatments this result agreed with reports of oster 1994 and li et al 2019 who showed that fresh water could speed up the desalting process of saline surface soil moreover the average ece above the gravel sand layer for gr1 gr5 treatments was 9 97 9 03 10 92 10 68 and 11 09 ds m respectively fig 5c although there were no statistically significant differences between different treatments the greatest salt leaching efficiency was observed when using 25 treated effluent gr2 this result was different from that in an experiment conducted at the same site using micro sprinkler irrigation and treated effluent on tall fescue li et al 2019 in that study 50 treated effluent best enhanced the desalting process these differences were likely attributed to the surface soil permeability and irrigation intensity although the study soil is sandy loam the tall fescue turf sod consisted of about 2 cm of loam soil that was less permeable than the in situ soil moreover the irrigation intensity of the micro sprinkler irrigation 13 3 mm h was significantly higher than that of the drip irrigation an average of 3 1 mm h therefore drip irrigation using 25 treated effluent was more effective in leaching soil salts than 50 treated effluent in the present study because of its lower salinity and because the soil water infiltration rate was less affected by the irrigation water quality the l2 stage lasted for 3 months in which the salts in soil above the gravel sand layer were significantly reduced fig 4b at the end of the stage the average ece in the 0 40 cm soil layer for the gr1 gr5 treatments decreased to 0 89 1 33 2 09 2 26 and 1 86 ds m respectively fig 5b meanwhile the ece in the entire 0 100 cm profile for the gr1 gr5 treatments was 2 16 2 68 3 12 3 86 and 3 25 ds m respectively representing ece reductions of 94 23 92 83 91 65 89 67 and 91 24 respectively based on the initial soil ece fig 5c november march was a dormancy period and 30 mm irrigation water was applied in early november comparatively the average precipitation in this same period over the previous 30 years was 32 mm in march 2016 the average ece of the 0 40 cm soil layer for gr1 gr5 treatments was 0 90 1 28 1 75 2 27 and 2 58 ds m respectively fig 5b likewise the average ece of the 0 100 cm soil profile was 2 46 3 15 2 83 3 57 and 4 04 ds m for the gr1 gr5 treatments respectively representing an increase of 0 29 to 0 77 ds m compared to the ece in november 2015 fig 5c this result indicates that the soil salinity above the gravel sand layer was in an almost constant level during the dry winter after march 2016 the irrigation was applied and the management entered the normal irrigation stage n3 3 2 2 soil salinity in the normal irrigation stage in the n3 stage the smp was mainly controlled at 10 kpa except during a short period at 5 kpa in november 2016 after the year of water management the average ece in the 0 40 cm soil profile for gr1 gr5 treatments was 0 82 1 50 2 56 3 87 and 4 19 ds m respectively figs 4d and 5 b thus ece at 0 40 cm increased by 0 08 0 22 0 81 1 59 and 1 61 ds m for gr1 gr5 treatments respectively when compared with the average ece in march of 2016 meanwhile for the entire 0 100 cm soil depth the ece increased by 0 25 0 29 1 74 2 32 and 2 15 ds m in the gr1 gr5 treatments respectively fig 5b these results suggested that the ece increased with the increasing proportion of treated effluent in the irrigation water and the two were significantly and positively linearly correlated at 0 20 cm p 0 01 0 40 cm p 0 05 and 0 100 cm p 0 01 fig 6 increases in ece that exceeded 1 ds m in the root zone were found in the gr4 and gr5 treatments while for the whole soil profile obvious ece increases were found in the gr3 gr5 treatments in contrast over the same experimental time and at the same location irrigation with different levels of treated effluent on tall fescue turf did not increase soil salinity on the scale of a year li et al 2019 the different effects may have been related to a difference in the soil surface in the two studies in the rainy season the fescue sod tended to reduce surface runoff and accumulate water for subsequent leaching whereas the ridges in the current study failed to do so in early july 2016 the average ece in layers at depths 0 to 40 cm were 0 90 1 39 1 96 3 88 and 4 46 ds m for gr1 gr5 treatments respectively fig 5b these values were 0 0 11 0 21 1 61 and 1 88 ds m higher respectively than the values in march 2016 but were 0 08 0 11 0 60 0 02 and 0 26 ds m lower respectively than values observed in november 2016 because the rainfall amounts during the periods of march june and july november were respectively 182 mm and 358 mm these changes in ece suggested that the obvious salinity increases in the root zone of gr4 and gr5 treatments 75 and 100 treated effluent respectively mainly occurred in the period march june and may further indicate that irrigation with high salinity treated effluent during the dry season significantly increases soil salinity on the contrary sufficient rainfall can leach a great amount of salts from the root zone soil grattan 1990 3 3 survival rate of chinese rose table 2 shows the survival rate of chinese rose for each treatment during the study period in general the survival rate decreased as the proportion of treated effluent in irrigation water increased from early july to mid october 2015 the l1 and l2 stages irrigation water was applied frequently the survival rate of the plants decreased by 5 in all treatments even though the cultivated rose was grafted and the vulnerable scion could be easily killed according to other reports of hughes and hanan 1978 li et al 2015a maas 1990 zeroni and gale 1989 that rose has salinity tolerance of 1 3 ds m the high survival rate during the stage may be related to the frequent irrigation and the sufficient rainfall this finding may suggest that in the research region treated effluent can be used to cultivate chinese rose in the sandy loam saline soil when the soil salinity is leached by frequent irrigation however as the irrigation ended in late october the survival rate of chinese rose decreased to 87 100 in november 2015 and a significant decrease in the survival rate was found in the gr4 and gr5 treatments the decreased survival rate may be related to the increased salinity of the soil solution because of the decreased water content and because the soil ece increased with the increasing percentage of treated effluent therefore for treatments of high levels of treated effluent using several sources of irrigation water to further leach soil salinity before the end of the l2 stage may be a suitable option for chinese rose the period november to march was a period of dormancy for chinese rose in late march 2016 the survival rate of chinese rose in all irrigation treatments was 79 95 these decreased survival rates may be related to the extreme cold temperature 18 5 in winter during 2016 the irrigation management was mainly based on maintaining a target smp of 10 kpa in late april 2016 the survival rate of chinese rose was 89 84 66 49 and 27 in the gr1 gr5 treatments respectively which decreased by 6 3 7 1 20 8 41 2 and 65 7 respectively relative to the survival rates in late march 2016 that most plants are sensitive during emergence is likely because the juvenile roots of emerging plants are more sensitive to salinity stress than older roots maas 1990 the period of late march to april was the main period of root growth of rose in the north china plain sun 2011 therefore these decreased survival rates may be partly attributed to the growth stage moreover the total precipitation from march to april was only 1 2 mm which was insufficient to dilute the salinity of the soil solution the survival rates of chinese rose indicated that during the first month of the new growing period of chinese rose only irrigation water containing 25 treated wastewater effluent was feasible for use in the research region to alleviate the rapid reduction in the survival rate of chinese rose the target smp was adjusted from 10 kpa to 5 kpa in late april and remained at that value until mid may after which the smp was controlled at 10 kpa again in october 2016 the survival rate of chinese rose was 86 22 in the five irrigation treatments corresponding to decreases in survival rates of 3 4 3 6 4 6 16 5 and 20 4 for gr1 gr5 treatments respectively relative to those observed in late april 2016 these results indicated that during the n3 stage of irrigation management except the first month of a new growing period of chinese rose irrigation water containing 75 treated wastewater effluent was not feasible for use in the cultivation of chinese rose in the research region 4 conclusions drip irrigation using water containing different proportions of treated effluent can successfully leach salt from highly saline soil typical of land reclaimed from the sea in this study three successive irrigation management regimes enhanced salt leaching stage water salt regulation stage and normal irrigation stage were used in which the first two stages provided the most salt leaching achieving an average ece of 2 16 2 68 3 12 3 86 and 3 25 ds m in the 0 100 cm soil layer using irrigation water that contained respectively 0 25 50 75 and 100 of treated effluent throughout a one year growing season of the subsequent normal irrigation stage salinity increase in the root zone soil layer exceeded 1 ds m ece as observed in the treatments that contained 75 and 100 treated effluent and mainly occurred in the dry season in combination with the irrigation regimes treated wastewater effluent can be used to cultivate chinese rose on saline soil in bohai region the survival rate of chinese rose decreases as the proportion of treated wastewater effluent in irrigation water increases during the first two stages of the irrigation regime it is feasible to use irrigation water containing different proportions of treated effluent to cultivate chinese rose in sandy loam saline soil most of the time during normal irrigation water containing 50 treated effluent can be used to irrigate chinese rose in the bohai gulf region however in the first month of a new growing period of these plants only irrigation water containing a maximum of 25 treated effluent should be used declaration of competing interest the

10796,the field experiment was conducted to develop a drip irrigation management method using treated wastewater effluent for chinese rose rosa chinensis cultivation in coastal saline soil during 2015 2016 five irrigation treatments were evaluated consisting of treated effluent electrical conductivity 4 2 6 9 ds m blended with fresh water effluent proportions of 0 25 50 75 and 100 chinese rose was planted in ridges above a gravel sand layer at the depth of 100 cm irrigation was based on soil matric potential smp and managed in three stages including enhanced salt leaching stage continuous irrigation water salt regulation stage smp 5 kpa and normal irrigation stage smp 10 kpa the study showed drip irrigation with different proportions of treated effluent could enhance salt leaching after the first two stages about 3 5 months soil salinity above the gravel sand layer was reduced from 37 4 ds m to 2 16 3 86 ds m throughout one year of the normal irrigation stage salinity increases that exceeded 1 ds m in the root zone soil were observed in the treatments of 75 and 100 treated effluent and mainly during a dry season in bohai region the survival rate of chinese rose decreased by 0 5 in the first two stages of irrigation depending on treatments but a notable reduction in plant survival rate was found in the first month of a new growing period under normal irrigation therefore in saline soil typical of sea reclamation land drip irrigation with different levels of treated effluent can be used for chinese rose cultivation in the enhanced salt leaching and water salt regulation stages of irrigation irrigation water containing 50 treated effluent is feasible in the normal irrigation stage except for the first month of the new growing period for which water containing 25 treated effluent should be used keywords chinese rose irrigation management salt leaching sandy loam soil soil salinity 1 introduction the bohai region of china bordering the pacific ocean has a long coastline and the land area expands out to sea wang et al 1993 wang et al 2014 the region has a semi humid monsoon climate with a ratio of evaporation capacity to rainfall amount of 3 4 the soil salt content 0 5 2 0 and the shallow groundwater salt content 10 30 g l are usually severely saline and the main salt ions are chloride and sodium wang et al 1993 therefore there are great limitations on plant cultivation in the coastal saline soil especially for perennial plants the key to salinity control is leaching a net downward movement of soil water and salt through the root zone soil asano and pettygrove 1987 oster 1994 some studies conducted on coastal saline land have found that trickle irrigation with suitable irrigation management was feasible for the reclamation of severely saline soil chen et al 2015 li et al 2015b 2016 li et al 2019 in their studies continuous irrigation was used in the first several days to reduce the surface soil salinity and create a suitable environment for the establishment of plants afterwards the irrigation was based on a soil matric potential smp of 5 kpa to leach salt out of soil above a gravel sand layer which existed below the root zone and prevented shallow saline groundwater flowing upward into the root zone soil through capillary pores sun et al 2013 the per capita freshwater supply of the bohai region is approximately 660 m3 per year in the research area the over exploitation of deep groundwater has lowered the groundwater table with a declining rate between 0 65 and 1 39 m per year sun 2007 as an alternative water supply treated effluent has been recognized as a resource having a large exploration potential in the coastal cities of the bohai region the estimated amount of treated effluent was 3 9 billion m3 in 2015 li 2016 liu 2016 wei 2016 wu and peng 2016 while the reuse rate is pretty low about 8 3 li 2016 unfortunately as an irrigation source treated effluent is rich in salts and some specific ions that may increase the natural soil salt content affect soil permeability and plant growth asano and pettygrove 1987 drip irrigation gives advantage over these problems to some degree when poor quality water is used kang et al 2010 shalhevet 1994 drip irrigation can maintain high smp that compensates for low osmotic potential because it applies water at a low discharge rate and a high frequency goldberg et al 1976 kang 1998 for many plants the sensitivity to salinity varies from one stage of growth to the next maas 1990 maas and poss 1989 maas et al 1986 but the main temporal effect of salinity on a plant is the duration of exposure shalhevet 1994 irrigating with treated effluent in saline soil must maintain salinity at non toxic levels to plants on the same experiment site as used in the present research micro sprinkler irrigation with different proportions of treated effluent was shown to be feasible for tall fescue a moderately salt tolerant plant li et al 2019 previously using chinese rose rosa chinensis a salt sensitive plant li et al 2015a found that there was an average survival rate of 98 7 when the plant was established using fresh water and then irrigated with saline water having an electrical conductivity ec of 0 8 7 8 ds m for 4 months at the smp of 5 kpa however the survival rate decreased to 8 9 96 7 in the next year on account of different irrigation water quality chinese rose is a plant widely used in landscape design and construction the objectives of the present study were 1 to evaluate changes in soil salinity when different levels of treated effluent were used 2 to determine the survival rate of chinese rose at different levels of soil salinity in different growth stages and irrigation management stages and 3 to develop a drip irrigation method for applying treated effluent to chinese rose in severely saline sea reclamation land 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this study was conducted between 2015 and 2016 on land reclaimed from the sea in the industrial zone of caofeidian district china 39 03 n 118 48 e located in the north of the bohai region bordering the pacific ocean this region belongs to typical semi humid monsoon climate it is dry and windy in winter and spring but rainy and hot in summer with a mean annual precipitation of 555 mm in the research area the soil at the experimental site is classified as sandy loam the average ec of saturated soil extracts ece was 37 4 ds m chloride and sodium are the main ions soil ph and sodium adsorption ratio sar were 7 6 and 57 0 mmol l 0 5 respectively the water table was 0 8 1 2 m below the soil surface as described in li et al 2019 2 2 experimental design five irrigation water treatments were investigated consisting of treated wastewater effluent blended with fresh water in which treated effluent comprised 0 gr1 25 gr2 50 gr3 75 gr4 and 100 gr5 each treatment was replicated three times and arranged in a complete randomized block design each plot was 5 5 3 8 m and contained six ridges chinese roses were planted in the middle of the ridges on 7 june 2015 at a spacing of 0 5 m 0 6 m to prevent soil salinity damage to plant roots during the early stage of salt leaching non saline sandy soil was placed around the root ball fig 1 the irrigation water was applied by gravity drip irrigation from a feed tank 1 8 m3 and 1 7 m high located 0 8 m above the ground with an average emitter discharge of 0 56 l h driplines were placed on the soil surface of the ridges with one line per ridge before planting the saline soil was removed to about 100 cm depth and at the downslope edge of the land a drain was dug to remove leaching water then a gravel layer 10 cm overlain by a sand layer 5 cm was placed in the excavated area to prevent capillary action from drawing shallow groundwater into the upper soil and plant root zone finally the previously removed saline soil was replaced in the plot and leveled achieving an average soil bulk density of 1 55 g cm3 the treated effluent was transported from the caofeidian district sewage treatment plant the fresh water used in the blended irrigation water was deep layer groundwater the quality of treated effluent fresh water and their blended irrigation water is described in li et al 2019 the salt content of the treated effluent ec 4 2 6 9 ds m was several times that of the fresh water ec 1 0 ds m moreover based on the criteria described by ayers and westcot 1985 the blended irrigation water quality of the gr1 gr2 and gr3 treatments posed a severe a slight to moderate and a slight permeability risk respectively while water used in gr4 and gr5 treatments posed no risk the irrigation application started at the same time the roses were planted as the irrigation was applied soil salt distribution changed and the soil salinity decreased therefore the irrigation was managed into enhanced salt leaching stage l1 water salt regulation stage l2 and normal irrigation stage n3 l1 stage served to leach the surface soil salts in a short time to prevent the salts from the bulk soil flowing into the root ball during heavy rainfall during l1 irrigation started when there was no water visible on the soil surface and was terminated when large area ponding was visible l2 stage served to leach salts out of the whole soil above the gravel sand layer the smp at a depth of 0 2 m was controlled at 5 kpa chen et al 2015 li et al 2015a and the depth of irrigation water was 10 mm each time l2 ended when the average ece in the 0 100 cm soil profile decreased to 4 ds m n3 stage served to keep soil salinity in ranges that provided a suitable environment for plant growth during n3 irrigation was applied to maintain the smp at 10 kpa 2 3 observations and measurements the smp 0 2 m depth was measured by a tensiometer included in a ridge of each treatment fig 1 the measurements began from the l2 stage and were observed daily at 8 00 and 16 00 soil samples were collected from each plot in the mid or the end of each irrigation management stages the soil sampling sites were at distances of 0 10 20 30 cm from the drip emitter all sample depths measured from tops of the ridges were divided into 10 cm or 20 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm i e 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil ece was determined from the extracts of saturated soil and it was measured using a conductivity meter dds 307 rex shanghai china the average ece within the soil profile was calculated using eq 1 1 e c e t j k n m e c e t j k s j k j k n m s j k in which t is the sampling time j is the horizontal distance n from the sampling drip emitter k is the sampling depth m and s j k is the depth interval of the soil layer 2 4 statistical procedures the statistical analysis was conducted using ibm spss statistical software ver 19 0 ibm co armonk ny usa the differences in survival rates of chinese rose among different treatments were compared using one way analyses of variance anova with the least significant difference test at p 0 05 the figures were prepared using sigma plot 10 0 systat software inc chicago il

april to november in 2015 and 2016 amounted at 565 mm and 539 mm respectively fig 2 the l1 stage lasted about 10 d and there was no rain however the total irrigation amount was 180 mm table 1 during the l2 stage 2015 7 2015 11 the precipitation was 395 mm there were 10 rainfall events of less than 5 mm one event of 5 10 mm seven events of 10 25 mm and five events of more than 25 mm the irrigation amount was between 400 and 570 mm for gr1 gr5 treatments with no obvious patterns observed among treatments during the n3 stage in 2016 the irrigation amount for gr1 gr5 treatments was in the range 330 480 mm and there was no significant linear correlation between the irrigation amount and the survival rate of chinese rose while the total precipitation was 539 mm the rainfall events mainly occurred in mid june to late june 2016 22 6 and in late july to early september 2016 58 1 during the n3 stage there were 18 events of less than 5 mm six events of 5 10 mm 12 events of 10 25 mm and seven events of more than 25 mm the winter dormancy period extended from november to march 3 1 2 soil matric potential the smp at a depth of 20 cm was monitored during the l2 and n3 stages once the observed value reached the target value the irrigation was applied as fig 3 shows during the l2 stage most observed smp values were above i e less negative or near 5 kpa during the n3 stage the smp threshold was controlled mostly at 10 kpa except during a rainless period from late april to mid may when the smp threshold was adjusted to 5 kpa to reduce salt stress on plants some smp values exceeded the control threshold especially on hot days which was likely because the monitoring data from the tensiometers lagged the actual smp 3 2 effect of drip irrigation using treated effluent on soil salinity 3 2 1 soil salt leaching because the experimental site was located on land reclaimed from the sea soil salinity as measured by ece was naturally high during the l1 stage 10 d ece of the surface soil was significantly reduced fig 4 a the average ece in the ridge for the gr1 gr5 treatments from 37 4 ds m dropped to 2 11 2 50 2 75 4 24 and 4 46 ds m respectively a fall of 94 36 93 32 92 64 88 67 and 88 06 respectively fig 5 a significantly lower salinity occurred in gr1 gr2 and gr3 treatments compared to gr4 and gr5 treatments this result agreed with reports of oster 1994 and li et al 2019 who showed that fresh water could speed up the desalting process of saline surface soil moreover the average ece above the gravel sand layer for gr1 gr5 treatments was 9 97 9 03 10 92 10 68 and 11 09 ds m respectively fig 5c although there were no statistically significant differences between different treatments the greatest salt leaching efficiency was observed when using 25 treated effluent gr2 this result was different from that in an experiment conducted at the same site using micro sprinkler irrigation and treated effluent on tall fescue li et al 2019 in that study 50 treated effluent best enhanced the desalting process these differences were likely attributed to the surface soil permeability and irrigation intensity although the study soil is sandy loam the tall fescue turf sod consisted of about 2 cm of loam soil that was less permeable than the in situ soil moreover the irrigation intensity of the micro sprinkler irrigation 13 3 mm h was significantly higher than that of the drip irrigation an average of 3 1 mm h therefore drip irrigation using 25 treated effluent was more effective in leaching soil salts than 50 treated effluent in the present study because of its lower salinity and because the soil water infiltration rate was less affected by the irrigation water quality the l2 stage lasted for 3 months in which the salts in soil above the gravel sand layer were significantly reduced fig 4b at the end of the stage the average ece in the 0 40 cm soil layer for the gr1 gr5 treatments decreased to 0 89 1 33 2 09 2 26 and 1 86 ds m respectively fig 5b meanwhile the ece in the entire 0 100 cm profile for the gr1 gr5 treatments was 2 16 2 68 3 12 3 86 and 3 25 ds m respectively representing ece reductions of 94 23 92 83 91 65 89 67 and 91 24 respectively based on the initial soil ece fig 5c november march was a dormancy period and 30 mm irrigation water was applied in early november comparatively the average precipitation in this same period over the previous 30 years was 32 mm in march 2016 the average ece of the 0 40 cm soil layer for gr1 gr5 treatments was 0 90 1 28 1 75 2 27 and 2 58 ds m respectively fig 5b likewise the average ece of the 0 100 cm soil profile was 2 46 3 15 2 83 3 57 and 4 04 ds m for the gr1 gr5 treatments respectively representing an increase of 0 29 to 0 77 ds m compared to the ece in november 2015 fig 5c this result indicates that the soil salinity above the gravel sand layer was in an almost constant level during the dry winter after march 2016 the irrigation was applied and the management entered the normal irrigation stage n3 3 2 2 soil salinity in the normal irrigation stage in the n3 stage the smp was mainly controlled at 10 kpa except during a short period at 5 kpa in november 2016 after the year of water management the average ece in the 0 40 cm soil profile for gr1 gr5 treatments was 0 82 1 50 2 56 3 87 and 4 19 ds m respectively figs 4d and 5 b thus ece at 0 40 cm increased by 0 08 0 22 0 81 1 59 and 1 61 ds m for gr1 gr5 treatments respectively when compared with the average ece in march of 2016 meanwhile for the entire 0 100 cm soil depth the ece increased by 0 25 0 29 1 74 2 32 and 2 15 ds m in the gr1 gr5 treatments respectively fig 5b these results suggested that the ece increased with the increasing proportion of treated effluent in the irrigation water and the two were significantly and positively linearly correlated at 0 20 cm p 0 01 0 40 cm p 0 05 and 0 100 cm p 0 01 fig 6 increases in ece that exceeded 1 ds m in the root zone were found in the gr4 and gr5 treatments while for the whole soil profile obvious ece increases were found in the gr3 gr5 treatments in contrast over the same experimental time and at the same location irrigation with different levels of treated effluent on tall fescue turf did not increase soil salinity on the scale of a year li et al 2019 the different effects may have been related to a difference in the soil surface in the two studies in the rainy season the fescue sod tended to reduce surface runoff and accumulate water for subsequent leaching whereas the ridges in the current study failed to do so in early july 2016 the average ece in layers at depths 0 to 40 cm were 0 90 1 39 1 96 3 88 and 4 46 ds m for gr1 gr5 treatments respectively fig 5b these values were 0 0 11 0 21 1 61 and 1 88 ds m higher respectively than the values in march 2016 but were 0 08 0 11 0 60 0 02 and 0 26 ds m lower respectively than values observed in november 2016 because the rainfall amounts during the periods of march june and july november were respectively 182 mm and 358 mm these changes in ece suggested that the obvious salinity increases in the root zone of gr4 and gr5 treatments 75 and 100 treated effluent respectively mainly occurred in the period march june and may further indicate that irrigation with high salinity treated effluent during the dry season significantly increases soil salinity on the contrary sufficient rainfall can leach a great amount of salts from the root zone soil grattan 1990 3 3 survival rate of chinese rose table 2 shows the survival rate of chinese rose for each treatment during the study period in general the survival rate decreased as the proportion of treated effluent in irrigation water increased from early july to mid october 2015 the l1 and l2 stages irrigation water was applied frequently the survival rate of the plants decreased by 5 in all treatments even though the cultivated rose was grafted and the vulnerable scion could be easily killed according to other reports of hughes and hanan 1978 li et al 2015a maas 1990 zeroni and gale 1989 that rose has salinity tolerance of 1 3 ds m the high survival rate during the stage may be related to the frequent irrigation and the sufficient rainfall this finding may suggest that in the research region treated effluent can be used to cultivate chinese rose in the sandy loam saline soil when the soil salinity is leached by frequent irrigation however as the irrigation ended in late october the survival rate of chinese rose decreased to 87 100 in november 2015 and a significant decrease in the survival rate was found in the gr4 and gr5 treatments the decreased survival rate may be related to the increased salinity of the soil solution because of the decreased water content and because the soil ece increased with the increasing percentage of treated effluent therefore for treatments of high levels of treated effluent using several sources of irrigation water to further leach soil salinity before the end of the l2 stage may be a suitable option for chinese rose the period november to march was a period of dormancy for chinese rose in late march 2016 the survival rate of chinese rose in all irrigation treatments was 79 95 these decreased survival rates may be related to the extreme cold temperature 18 5 in winter during 2016 the irrigation management was mainly based on maintaining a target smp of 10 kpa in late april 2016 the survival rate of chinese rose was 89 84 66 49 and 27 in the gr1 gr5 treatments respectively which decreased by 6 3 7 1 20 8 41 2 and 65 7 respectively relative to the survival rates in late march 2016 that most plants are sensitive during emergence is likely because the juvenile roots of emerging plants are more sensitive to salinity stress than older roots maas 1990 the period of late march to april was the main period of root growth of rose in the north china plain sun 2011 therefore these decreased survival rates may be partly attributed to the growth stage moreover the total precipitation from march to april was only 1 2 mm which was insufficient to dilute the salinity of the soil solution the survival rates of chinese rose indicated that during the first month of the new growing period of chinese rose only irrigation water containing 25 treated wastewater effluent was feasible for use in the research region to alleviate the rapid reduction in the survival rate of chinese rose the target smp was adjusted from 10 kpa to 5 kpa in late april and remained at that value until mid may after which the smp was controlled at 10 kpa again in october 2016 the survival rate of chinese rose was 86 22 in the five irrigation treatments corresponding to decreases in survival rates of 3 4 3 6 4 6 16 5 and 20 4 for gr1 gr5 treatments respectively relative to those observed in late april 2016 these results indicated that during the n3 stage of irrigation management except the first month of a new growing period of chinese rose irrigation water containing 75 treated wastewater effluent was not feasible for use in the cultivation of chinese rose in the research region 4 conclusions drip irrigation using water containing different proportions of treated effluent can successfully leach salt from highly saline soil typical of land reclaimed from the sea in this study three successive irrigation management regimes enhanced salt leaching stage water salt regulation stage and normal irrigation stage were used in which the first two stages provided the most salt leaching achieving an average ece of 2 16 2 68 3 12 3 86 and 3 25 ds m in the 0 100 cm soil layer using irrigation water that contained respectively 0 25 50 75 and 100 of treated effluent throughout a one year growing season of the subsequent normal irrigation stage salinity increase in the root zone soil layer exceeded 1 ds m ece as observed in the treatments that contained 75 and 100 treated effluent and mainly occurred in the dry season in combination with the irrigation regimes treated wastewater effluent can be used to cultivate chinese rose on saline soil in bohai region the survival rate of chinese rose decreases as the proportion of treated wastewater effluent in irrigation water increases during the first two stages of the irrigation regime it is feasible to use irrigation water containing different proportions of treated effluent to cultivate chinese rose in sandy loam saline soil most of the time during normal irrigation water containing 50 treated effluent can be used to irrigate chinese rose in the bohai gulf region however in the first month of a new growing period of these plants only irrigation water containing a maximum of 25 treated effluent should be used declaration of competing interest the

10797,nutrients and water are major factors that affect corn production and resource use efficiency as well as the soil water storage and wue in dryland cultivation regions the development of water saving cultivation practices is essential instead of relying on irrigation resources however the interactive effects of cultivation practices and nitrogen application for maize crop in semi arid regions have not yet been clear therefore in 2015 and 2016 we studied the interactive effect of three cultivation practices plastic mulching ridges with furrow planting rf furrow planting with soil crust ridges sc traditional cultivation ck under three different nitrogen rates 300 200 and 100 kg ha 1 the results indicated that the rf system enhanced seeding emergence prolonged the seed filling duration and improved biomass and n accumulation than the ck treatment under the 200 kg n ha 1 with rf system can increase soil water storage and enhance plant development reduce et rate 14 1 as a result increased grain yield 30 4 thereby achieving a higher wue 52 0 rue 30 7 and agronomic efficiency 11 9 than the ck treatment with 200 kg n ha 1 as well rf system significantly improved n uptake efficiency nupe 58 5 n fertilizer productivity nfp 33 1 n use efficiency nue 28 6 and n harvest index nhi 6 1 in comparison with ck treatment a high 300 kg n ha 1 under different cultivation practices considerably reduced nupe nfp and nue and the optimum n rate for the corn must be less than 300 kg ha 1 to enhance the nupe nfp and nue therefore in dryland cultivation areas the rf system with 200 kg n ha 1 should be a proper water saving strategy for achieving higher corn productivity in the dryland cultivation regions keywords ridge furrow rainfall harvesting water saving sustainable development resource use efficiency agronomic efficiency soil water storage 1 introduction corn is one of the important food crops in the semi arid regions of china mueller et al 2012 the two main aspects that limited corn productivity are water and nutrients elliott et al 2014 several semi arid researchers have given more attention to wue than that of nutrient use efficiency which restricts crop production barbieri et al 2012 maximum maize production with limited rainwater supplies is essential for the future sustainability of a dry land cultivation system deng et al 2006 chen et al 2012 this area is strongly depending on monsoon rainfall and more than 59 of the annual rainfall occurs between july and september chen et al 2012 therefore the development of efficient cultivation practices with different fertilizer rates is a crucial requirement in order to maximize the limited rainwater resources in this region limited irrigation water with erratic rainfall could threaten the production of maize in these regions wu and ma 2015 gan et al 2013 to develop water saving technology for efficient use of light rainfall is the crucial requirement hu et al 2014 due to water deficiency in dryland cultivation system it is hard to increase nutrients uptake and maize production nagaz et al 2012 li et al 2009 the rf system has been generally developed in dry land cultivation areas which efficiently improves the consumption of light rainfall and increases the nutrient use efficiency piao et al 2010 the rf planting models consists of ridges precipitation harvesting zone and furrows planting zone the ridges covers with plastic film to improve precipitation use efficiency ding et al 2007 liu et al 2014a the rf method can increase crop productivity and moisture conditions by harvesting water from limit rain tian et al 2003 furthermore rf method can prevent evaporation and give sufficient water at key growth stages jia et al 2006 plastic mulching enhances soil moisture by preventing evaporation thereby enhancing the soil water storage li and gong 2002 therefore the plastic film mulching is the effective cultivation pattern for highly efficient consumption of limit rainfall and increasing crops yields li et al 2013 the plastic film mulching had significantly increased crop production in normal average and drought years by 10 30 and 50 respectively than that of flat cultivation wang et al 2015 in addition to rainwater nutrients are the key factors that limit the maize yield due to its significant effects on improving the biomass accumulation and nitrogen use efficiency wang et al 2015 2016 however unnecessary fertilizer application non significantly increased maize yield which may be led to excessive rainwater utilization and a waste of fertilizers kim et al 2008 therefore excessive fertilizer does not increase the efficiently use of fertilizers and it increases the risk of ecological pollution such as nitrogen leaching n2o emissions and microbial de nitrification tiquia et al 2002 li et al 2004 in current years teixeira et al 2014 found that low 110 kg n ha 1 for corn under the rf system with plastic mulching achieved 82 of the higher yield and improved nue however ren et al 2010 study that reducing the n rate can reduce the soil organic carbon thereby significantly affected the soil fertility status and crops yield singh et al 2010 also recommended the middle n rate 210 kg ha 1 which could enhance the nitrogen uptake and decrease n leaching under the plastic film mulching excessive nitrogen use may lead to excess water utilization and decrease nue nitrogen and wue zhou et al 2009 the insufficient supply of fertilizers and excessive losses of erratic rainwater lead to decrease the maize production therefore the interactive effects of cultivation practices with fertilizer strategies in semi arid areas are readily attracting attention wu et al 2015 soil moisture and nutrient contents have synergistic effects on crop growth and their synergistic relations can increase the production wue and n fertilizer productivity ren et al 2010 thus we hypothesize that improving wue and nue through rf system for the highly efficiently use of rainfall instead of depend on irrigation water which will play a key role to improve sws in a dryland cultivation system the aims of present research work were as follows 1 to elucidate the feasibility of different cultivation practices in semi arid area 2 to elucidate the interactive effects of cultivation practices on nitrogen uptake by maize under different n rates and 3 to find out a highly sustainable cultivation practices under different fertilization strategy to improved maize yields in the dry land cultivation areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 location

fertilizer levels during the various growth stages of corn fig 3 in two years soil water storage at 20 dap showed no significant differences among different treatments in the current research the sws changed under different cultivation practices and n fertilizer rates due to diverse precipitation events and its distribution the corn water utilization rate improved with plant development but the rf

variations in the sws with the depth of 0 200 cm among the various treatments the fig 3 indicated that as the nitrogen amount enhanced under various planting models sws decreased during the entire growing period the mean of two year data indicated that maize seeds germinated 2 days earlier under the rf system compared with ck treatment while the jointing and silking date of ck treatment was 9

ck treatment than that of rf system and sc cultivation practices at 200 kg n ha 1 3 2 nitrogen and biomass accumulation the biomass yield was considerably affected by cultivation practices combined with three n rates during the 2015 2016 years are revealed in fig 4 aboveground biomass yield t ha 1 increasing slowly at 20 50 dap in the early growth stage and quickly in the middle 50 90 dap and at

application improved biomass production but this increase was non significant at early growth stages the rf system with 200 or 300 kg n ha 1 significantly improved the biomass while there were non significant variations between 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 under different cultivation practices the dynamic changes in n accumulation were significantly affected by different cultivation practices combined

that of ck with 200 kg n ha 1 usually high n rates with cultivation practices significantly increased grain yield which was usually accompanied by a maximum thousand kernels weight the highest wue and rue were regarded under rf system as compared with sc and ck treatments due to its maximum grain yield and efficient rainwater utilization regardless of n fertilizer rates averaged across two study years under the rf system were significantly increased the wue by 13 5 and 55 5 and rue 5 0 and 34 0 when compared with sc and ck cultivation practices regardless of n rates the average data revealed that the plastic film with 200 kg n ha 1 considerably improved wue and rue by 9 9 and 7 9 kg mm 1 ha 1 than that of ck while under sc cultivation pattern with 200 kg n ha 1 significantly increased wue

less et as compared with ck treatment under the plastic film mulching and sc treatment with different n rates led to lower et than that of ck planting due to high soil water evaporation averaged across both study years the seasonal et rate under rf system was significantly decreased by 13 9 compared with ck while the sc cultivation pattern significantly decreased 6 8 than that of ck regardless of n rate the rf system with 200 kg n ha 1 considerably reduced seasonal et rate by 57 4 mm than that of ck treatment and 200 kg n ha 1 while under sc cultivation with 200 kg n ha 1 significantly decreased by 32 1 mm than that of ck treatment respectively 3 4 resource use efficiency for n fertilizer agronomic efficiency refers to the grain yield per unit of nutrient application rate the aef results in table 5 that increasing n rate significantly increased the trend of aef regardless of cultivation practices while aef was better in 2015 than that of 2016 study year the maximum 2 5 kg kg 1 aef was obtained under rf system with 300 kg n ha 1 whereas the minimum 1 5 kg kg 1 with ck treatment and 200 kg n ha 1 the rf system and sc cultivation significantly improve the

the mean data revealed that the plastic film mulching the nupe and nfp were significantly increased by 58 5 and 33 1 then that of ck treatment respectively in addition the nue and nhi were significantly increased under the rf system by 28 6 and 6 1 then that of ck cultivation pattern in both study years the nupe and nfp under a 300 kg n ha 1 were always significantly lower compared with middle and low n rates regardless of cultivation practices 4 discussion precipitation is essential to successful maize crop development in the arid areas plastic film is the effective cultivation model for effective use of light precipitation and increasing soil water contents wang et al 2015 our results indicated that corn water utilization rate improved with plant development but the rf system with 200 kg n ha 1 have early root growth in the season which ensure successful crop development of corn the rf system could increase the availability of moisture content to crops zhang et al 2007 and therefore prolongs the growth duration and decrease evaporation which would be greatly promoted transpiration and enhanced the soil water utilization due to larger opening of stomata liu et al 2010 in our study under the 100 kg n ha 1 with rf system the sws were considerably higher except 20 dap for all treatments this result was agreed with zhang et al 2011 at different cultivation practices with 100 kg n ha 1 treatment had little higher sws than that of 200 kg n ha 1 during the entire growth stage of corn crop but the variation was non significant several studies have reported that the application of nitrogen can improve the uptake of soil water and n contents li and gong 2002 liu et al 2014 similar results indicated in our study that n amount enhanced under different planting models the soil water storage decreased during the entire growing period the second explanation is that the plastic film mulching is better at utilizing light and heavy rain by harvesting the rainwater wasson et al 2012 several studies recommend that increased precipitation during the growing season can considerably improve n and biomass accumulation and increase crop yield ren et al 2008 liu et al 2009 we observed that the rf system the biomass accumulation was significantly maximum compared with sc and ck cultivation practices generally the nitrogen fertilizer improved biomass production but this increase was non significant at early growth stages the rf system with 200 or 300 kg n ha 1 considerably improved the biomass accumulation while there were non significant variations between 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 under different cultivation practices the plastic film increased the nutrients and rainwater amount in the furrow zone which increased biomass and n accumulation hartmann et al 2014 in addition under drought condition a high nitrogen amount can enhance drought stress gheysari et al 2009 similar to biomass yield n accumulation under the rf system was significantly increasing compared too sc and ck cultivation practices n accumulation was significantly maximum under a high nitrogen level than that of low n level but had non significant difference was recording between high and middle n rate similar results have been shown by qiu et al 2008 that high aboveground n accumulation of summer maize under high n application with 300 mm irrigation which may similar with our results ma and dwyer 1999 showed that n accumulation in maize plants could significantly improve of supply less than 100 kg n ha 1 the rf system is effective for accelerating crop development due to the improved soil thermal conditions in the early growth stages barbieri et al 2012 gan et al 2013 plastic film can stabilize the sws during key growth stages in potato thus increasing the et rate and potato production chen et al 2012 the rf system reduces evaporation as well as reducing the total moisture utilization as a result improves the wue qin et al 2014 under the 200 kg n ha 1 with rf system with considerably increased by 2 3 t ha 1 grain yield compared with ck adequate supply of nitrogen is vital for fully exploiting the summer rainfall and the wue also improved significantly than that of control plots which correlated with the grain yield zhang et al 1999 the highest wue and rue were found under rf system as compared with sc and ck treatments due to its maximum grain yield and efficient rainwater utilization the high n amount significantly improved the wue and rue but their variations between the high middle and low n application rates were significant fertilization could significantly improve maize production but the et did not increase which can be elucidated by nitrogen raising the transpiration and increase wue sadras et al 2012 plastic film and sc treatment with high n rates led to lower et than that of ck planting due to high evaporation the seasonal et rate under rf system was significantly decreased by 13 9 compared with ck under the 200 kg n ha 1 with rf system considerably reduced seasonal et rate by 57 4 mm than that of ck ogola et al 2002 studied that the corn yields is positively associated with the et rate a considerable improve in et under flat planting due to the high nitrogen amount and evaporation lenka et al 2009 the rf system requires more investment but this can be offset by increased crop yields and greater economic returns feng et al 2016 agronomic efficiency refers to the production per unit of n application the fertilizer use in dryland cultivation regions can increase the crop development and enhance the wue ali et al 2016 but the aef is influenced by the soil nutrition status low nutrition statuses tend to get a maximum aef while a maximum nutrition status lead to a minimum aef the aef results showed that increasing n rate significantly increasing the trend of aef regardless of cultivation practices the rf system and sc treatment significantly improve the availability of rainwater as a result increased aef than that of ck treatment the high 225 kg n ha 1 considerably reduced nupe and nfp as compared with 75 kg n ha 1 li et al 2016 our result showed that the nupe and nfp under the high 300 kg n ha 1 were considerably minimum than that of middle and low n rates synergic interaction between moisture contents and nitrogen has been suggested by gheysari et al 2009 abdelkhalek et al 2015 plastic film increased considerably the nupe and nfp by 58 5 and 33 1 then that of ck treatment respectively in addition the nue and nhi were significantly increased under the rf system by 28 6 and 6 1 then that of ck cultivation pattern in the dry land farming system to attain a higher maize production has been the only target to prevent water and fertilizer resources wastage 5 conclusions we evaluated the interactive effect of planting practices with n rates on corn yields and resource use efficiency as well as the soil water storage wue et and aef the rf system enhanced seedling emergence prolonged the seed filling duration and increased n as well as biomass accumulation as compared with ck under the 200 kg n ha 1 with rf system can improve sws reduce et and achieve maximum yields therefore obtained a maximum wue rue and nue a high 300 kg n ha 1 under different cultivation practices significantly reduced nupe nfp and nue and the optimum n for the corn must be less than 300 kg ha 1 to enhance the nupe nfp and nue under the 200 kg n ha 1 with rf system considerably improved wue n as well as biomass accumulation than that of both sc and ck treatments therefore in semi arid regions the rf system combined with 200 kg n ha 1 should be a proper water saving strategy for improving maize productivity and resource use efficiency

10797,nutrients and water are major factors that affect corn production and resource use efficiency as well as the soil water storage and wue in dryland cultivation regions the development of water saving cultivation practices is essential instead of relying on irrigation resources however the interactive effects of cultivation practices and nitrogen application for maize crop in semi arid regions have not yet been clear therefore in 2015 and 2016 we studied the interactive effect of three cultivation practices plastic mulching ridges with furrow planting rf furrow planting with soil crust ridges sc traditional cultivation ck under three different nitrogen rates 300 200 and 100 kg ha 1 the results indicated that the rf system enhanced seeding emergence prolonged the seed filling duration and improved biomass and n accumulation than the ck treatment under the 200 kg n ha 1 with rf system can increase soil water storage and enhance plant development reduce et rate 14 1 as a result increased grain yield 30 4 thereby achieving a higher wue 52 0 rue 30 7 and agronomic efficiency 11 9 than the ck treatment with 200 kg n ha 1 as well rf system significantly improved n uptake

considerably reduced nupe nfp and nue and the optimum n rate for the corn must be less than 300 kg ha 1 to enhance the nupe nfp and nue therefore in dryland cultivation areas the rf system with 200 kg n ha 1 should be a proper water saving strategy for achieving higher corn productivity in the dryland cultivation regions keywords ridge furrow rainfall harvesting water saving sustainable development resource use efficiency agronomic efficiency soil water storage 1 introduction corn is one of the important food crops in the semi arid regions of china mueller et al 2012 the two main aspects that limited corn productivity are water and nutrients elliott et al 2014 several semi arid researchers have given more attention to wue than that of nutrient use efficiency which restricts crop production barbieri et al 2012 maximum maize production with limited rainwater supplies is essential for the future sustainability of a dry land cultivation system deng et al 2006 chen et al 2012 this area is strongly depending on monsoon rainfall and more than 59 of the annual rainfall occurs between july and september chen et al 2012 therefore the development of efficient cultivation practices with different fertilizer rates is a crucial requirement in order to maximize the limited rainwater resources in this region limited irrigation water with erratic rainfall could threaten the production of maize in these regions wu and ma 2015 gan et al 2013 to develop water saving technology for efficient use of light rainfall is the crucial requirement hu et al 2014 due to water deficiency in dryland cultivation system it is hard to increase nutrients uptake and maize production nagaz et al 2012 li et al 2009 the rf system has been generally developed in dry land cultivation areas which efficiently improves the consumption of light rainfall and increases the nutrient use efficiency piao et al 2010 the rf planting models consists of ridges precipitation harvesting zone and furrows planting zone the ridges covers with plastic film to improve precipitation use efficiency ding et al 2007 liu et al 2014a the rf method can increase crop productivity and moisture conditions by harvesting water from limit rain tian et al 2003 furthermore rf method can prevent evaporation and give sufficient water at key growth stages jia et al 2006 plastic mulching enhances soil moisture by preventing evaporation thereby enhancing the soil water storage li and gong 2002 therefore the plastic film mulching is the effective cultivation pattern for highly efficient consumption of limit rainfall and increasing crops yields li et al 2013 the plastic film mulching had significantly increased crop production in normal average and drought years by 10 30 and 50 respectively than that of flat cultivation wang et al 2015 in addition to rainwater nutrients are the key factors that limit the maize yield due to its significant effects on improving the biomass accumulation and nitrogen use efficiency wang et al 2015 2016 however unnecessary fertilizer application non significantly increased maize yield which may be led to excessive rainwater utilization and a waste of fertilizers kim et al 2008 therefore excessive fertilizer does not increase the efficiently use of fertilizers and it increases the risk of ecological pollution such as nitrogen leaching n2o emissions and microbial de nitrification tiquia et al 2002 li et al 2004 in current years teixeira et al 2014 found that low 110 kg n ha 1 for corn under the rf system with plastic mulching achieved 82 of the higher yield and improved nue however ren et al 2010 study that reducing the n rate can reduce the soil organic carbon thereby significantly affected the soil fertility status and crops yield singh et al 2010 also recommended the middle n rate 210 kg ha 1 which could enhance the nitrogen uptake and decrease n leaching under the plastic film mulching excessive nitrogen use may lead to excess water utilization and decrease nue nitrogen and wue zhou et al 2009 the insufficient supply of fertilizers and excessive losses of erratic rainwater lead to decrease the maize production therefore the interactive effects of cultivation practices with fertilizer strategies in semi arid areas are readily attracting attention wu et al 2015 soil moisture and nutrient contents have synergistic effects on crop growth and their synergistic relations can increase the production wue and n fertilizer productivity ren et al 2010 thus we hypothesize that improving wue and nue through rf system for the highly efficiently use of rainfall instead of depend on irrigation water which will play a key role to improve sws in a dryland cultivation system the aims of present research work were as follows 1 to elucidate the feasibility of different cultivation practices in semi arid area 2 to elucidate the interactive effects of cultivation practices on nitrogen uptake by maize under different n rates and 3 to find out a highly sustainable cultivation practices under different fertilization strategy to improved maize yields in the dry land cultivation areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 location

significantly increased under the rf system by 28 6 and 6 1 then that of ck cultivation pattern in both study years the nupe and nfp under a 300 kg n ha 1 were always significantly lower compared with middle and low n rates regardless of cultivation practices 4 discussion precipitation is essential to successful maize crop development in the arid areas plastic film is the effective cultivation model for effective use of light precipitation and increasing soil water contents wang et al 2015 our results indicated that corn water utilization rate improved with plant development but the rf system with 200 kg n ha 1 have early root growth in the season which ensure successful crop development of corn the rf system could increase the availability of moisture content to crops zhang et al 2007 and therefore prolongs the growth duration and decrease evaporation which would be greatly promoted transpiration and enhanced the soil water utilization due to larger opening of stomata liu et al 2010 in our study under the 100 kg n ha 1 with rf system the sws were considerably higher except 20 dap for all treatments this result was agreed with zhang et al 2011 at different cultivation practices with 100 kg n ha 1 treatment had little higher sws than that of 200 kg n ha 1 during the entire growth stage of corn crop but the variation was non significant several studies have reported that the application of nitrogen can improve the uptake of soil water and n contents li and gong 2002 liu et al 2014 similar results indicated in our study that n amount enhanced under different planting models the soil water storage decreased during the entire growing period the second explanation is that the plastic film mulching is better at utilizing light and heavy rain by harvesting the rainwater wasson et al 2012 several studies recommend that increased precipitation during the growing season can considerably improve n and biomass accumulation and increase crop yield ren et al 2008 liu et al 2009 we observed that the rf system the biomass accumulation was significantly maximum compared with sc and ck cultivation practices generally the nitrogen fertilizer improved biomass production but this increase was non significant at early growth stages the rf system with 200 or 300 kg n ha 1 considerably improved the biomass accumulation while there were non significant variations between 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 under different cultivation practices the plastic film increased the nutrients and rainwater amount in the furrow zone which increased biomass and n accumulation hartmann et al 2014 in addition under drought condition a high nitrogen amount can enhance drought stress gheysari et al 2009 similar to biomass yield n accumulation under the rf system was significantly increasing compared too sc and ck cultivation practices n accumulation was significantly maximum under a high nitrogen level than that of low n level but had non significant difference was recording between high and middle n rate similar results have been shown by qiu et al 2008 that high aboveground n accumulation of summer maize under high n application with 300 mm irrigation which may similar with our results ma and dwyer 1999 showed that n accumulation in maize plants could significantly improve of supply less than 100 kg n ha 1 the rf system is effective for accelerating crop development due to the improved soil thermal conditions in the early growth stages barbieri et al 2012 gan et al 2013 plastic film can stabilize the sws during key growth stages in potato thus increasing the et rate and potato production chen et al 2012 the rf system reduces evaporation as well as reducing the total moisture utilization as a result improves the wue qin et al 2014 under the 200 kg n ha 1 with rf system with considerably increased by 2 3 t ha 1 grain yield compared with ck adequate supply of nitrogen is vital for fully exploiting the summer rainfall and the wue also improved significantly than that of control plots which correlated with the grain yield zhang et al 1999 the highest wue and rue were found under rf system as compared with sc and ck treatments due to its maximum grain yield and efficient rainwater utilization the high n amount significantly improved the wue and rue but their variations between the high middle and low n application rates were significant fertilization could significantly improve maize production but the et did not increase which can be elucidated by nitrogen raising the transpiration and increase wue sadras et al 2012 plastic film and sc treatment with high n rates led to lower et than that of ck planting due to high evaporation the seasonal et rate under rf system was significantly decreased by 13 9 compared with ck under the 200 kg n ha 1 with rf system considerably reduced seasonal et rate by 57 4 mm than that of ck ogola et al 2002 studied that the corn yields is positively associated with the et rate a considerable improve in et under flat planting due to the high nitrogen amount and evaporation lenka et al 2009 the rf system requires more investment but this can be offset by increased crop yields and greater economic returns feng et al 2016 agronomic efficiency refers to the production per unit of n application the fertilizer use in dryland cultivation regions can increase the crop development and enhance the wue ali et al 2016 but the aef is influenced by the soil nutrition status low nutrition statuses tend to get a maximum aef while a maximum nutrition status lead to a minimum aef the aef results showed that increasing n rate significantly increasing the trend of aef regardless of cultivation practices the rf system and sc treatment significantly improve the availability of rainwater as a result increased aef than that of ck treatment the high 225 kg n ha 1 considerably reduced nupe and nfp as compared with 75 kg n ha 1 li et al 2016 our result showed that the nupe and nfp under the high 300 kg n ha 1 were considerably minimum than that of middle and low n rates synergic interaction between moisture contents and nitrogen has been suggested by gheysari et al 2009 abdelkhalek et al 2015 plastic film increased considerably the nupe and nfp by 58 5 and 33 1 then that of ck treatment respectively in addition the nue and nhi were significantly increased under the rf system by 28 6 and 6 1 then that of ck cultivation pattern in the dry land farming system to attain a higher maize production has been the only target to prevent water and fertilizer resources wastage 5 conclusions we evaluated the interactive effect of planting practices with n rates on corn yields and resource use efficiency as well as the soil water storage wue et and aef the rf system enhanced seedling emergence prolonged the seed filling duration and increased n as well as biomass accumulation as compared with ck under the 200 kg n ha 1 with rf system can improve sws reduce et and achieve maximum yields therefore obtained a maximum wue rue and nue a high 300 kg n ha 1 under different cultivation practices significantly reduced nupe nfp and nue and the optimum n for the corn must be less than 300 kg ha 1 to enhance the nupe nfp and nue under the 200 kg n ha 1 with rf system considerably improved wue n as well as biomass accumulation than that of both sc and ck treatments therefore in semi arid regions the rf system combined with 200 kg n ha 1 should be a proper water saving strategy for improving maize productivity and resource use efficiency

10798,partitioning of evapotranspiration etc into soil evaporation eg and plants transpiration tr is of great importance to assess biomass production and improve water use efficiency under greenhouse conditions the shuttleworth wallace sw model which is used to separately predict eg and tr has been validated by many studies in open field however the model s parameters for the low wind speed and heterogeneous underlying surface in greenhouses are quite different from the open field therefore an experiment was conducted in a venlo type greenhouse in south east china during two planting seasons of cucumber plants in 2018 where the etc and tr were directly measured by lysimeters and sap flow sensors the soil surface and canopy resistances were parameterized based on the soil water content at 5 10 cm depth and solar radiation inside the greenhouse respectively the sw model simulated etc and tr at hourly interval with root mean square error rmse and index of agreement d of 42 10 w m 2 and 0 93 40 50 w m 2 and 0 91 for the spring season while for the autumn season the values were 26 60 w m 2 and 0 93 15 63 w m 2 and 0 93 respectively the average eg etc were 7 75 and 21 87 for spring and autumn planting seasons respectively indicating that the tr was the dominant component of etc of cucumber grown in greenhouse over the full crop season our research shows the parameterized sw model would be a relatively accurate way to separately simulate the dynamic variations of the tr and eg and for future use to improve irrigation scheduling for cucumber plants under greenhouse conditions keywords evapotranspiration parametrization shuttleworth wallace model venlo type greenhouse 1 introduction venlo type greenhouses equipped with automatic environmental control systems have widely been distributed all over the world yan et al 2018 at present china has the largest protected cultivation area in the world more than 2 million ha therefore more information is urgently needed to improve greenhouse crops irrigation schedules xu et al 2013 zhao et al 2018a 2018b accurate determination of evapotranspiration etc is very important for improving greenhouse crops irrigation schedules and water use efficiency wue kang et al 2004 yan et al 2015 2017 ma et al 2018 the etc can be divided into plant transpiration tr and soil evaporation eg however the tr is associated with plant productivity while eg is regarded as invalid water consumption not directly contributing to plant productivity zhang et al 2013 kool et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 therefore accurate determination of tr and eg will be a good indicator of the productive use of water through crop uptake making partitioning of etc necessary kool et al 2014 the pan evaporation method liu et al 2013 penman monteith pm method stanghellini 1987 qiu et al 2013 takakura method villarreal guerrero et al 2012 and priestley taylor method valdés gómez et al 2009 are often used to determine etc in greenhouses qiu et al 2015 however these methods cannot be used to separately estimate tr and eg there are two widely used and primary methods to partitioning etc in open field condition the fao 56 dual crop coefficient method which calculates tr and eg separately through a basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ke where kcb is determined by the crop type and the crop growing stage allen et al 1998 lagos et al 2013 however the straightforward adoption of generalized kcb recommended by fao 56 can lead to errors since the kcb is closely related to local climate and crop conditions katerji and rana 2006 zhao et al 2015 in addition it is difficult to accurately divide the crop growth stages for many crops allen et al 2007 lagos et al 2013 shuttleworth and wallace sw model is the other widely used method this method extends the pm single layer model to two layer model one for the tr and the other for eg shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the sw model divided etc into plant and soil components through using surface resistances to regulate the heat and mass transfer from plant and soil surfaces as well as aerodynamic resistance to regulate fluxes to the atmosphere lagos et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 compared to the fao 56 dual crop coefficient model the sw model is the first analytical model combining eg and tr by formulating the different media through which evaporative flux travels as resistances kool et al 2014 the sw model is generally considered accurate but hard to parameterize the large number of parameters odhiambo and irmak 2011 kool et al 2014 up till now many researches have been done based on the application of sw model to estimate the eg and tr in orchards ortega farias et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 spring maize field zhu et al 2014 and grassland hu et al 2009 to the best of our knowledge limited studies have been conducted to partition etc using sw model for cucumber plants grown in greenhouses because the wind speed and heterogeneous underlying surface in greenhouses are quite different from the open fields the determined resistance parameters of sw model in open fields may not be used in greenhouses qiu et al 2015 therefore the purpose of this study was 1 to parameterize the sw model based on conventional meteorological data in combination with plant physiological data observed in a venlo type greenhouse 2 to verify the performance of the sw model for simulating etc and tr over a drip irrigated cucumber grown in the venlo type greenhouse 3 to separately estimate etc components tr and eg and the ratios of tr and eg to etc for different growing stages and planting seasons spring and autumn planting seasons of cucumber crop 2 materials and methods 2 1 filed observation the experiment was conducted during the spring and autumn 2018 planting seasons at a venlo type greenhouse located in the jiangsu province china 32 11 n 119 25 e 23 m a s l the greenhouse structure has an area of 32 m in length 20 m in width 3 8 m in height with

the climate in the study area is a humid subtropical monsoon climatic zone with an average annual air temperature of 15 5 c and a mean annual precipitation rainfall of 1058 8 mm y 1 yan et al 2018 the planting medium used in the greenhouse was a soil biochar mixture with mean bulk density of 1 27 g cm 3 field capacity of 0 41 cm3 cm 3 and wilting point water content of 0 16 cm3 cm 3 in the depth of 0 60 cm acquah et al 2018 the irrigation was provided with an automatic drip irrigation system the drip irrigation method was used with dripping wings along the row and distributors giving 100 ml min

pan 20 cm in diameter evaporation ep method the ep was determined by accumulating the values measured by counting cup at eight o clock every morning when ep reached 20 mm the crop was irrigated to 18 mm liu et al 2013 demonstrated that 0 9 ep represented sufficient irrigation when ep reached 20 mm based on several years experimental research in a solar greenhouse for autumn planting season water was irrigated with 10 mm every morning and axial fans were opened every afternoon during the seedling stage from 25 september to 7 october from 8 to 20 days after transplanting dat to make cucumber seedlings healthier and more defensive against diseases and insect pests cucumbers f1 hybrid were transplanted into the troughs 0 65 m in width 16 7 m in length on 23 march and harvested on 23 june 2018 defined as spring planting season and again on 18 september and were harvested on 17 december 2018 defined as autumn planting season with plant density equal to 6 63 per m2 the cucumber growth was divided into three stages seedling stage flowering stage and fruiting stage based on the many years observations in venlo type greenhouses in southern china table1 chen et al 2016 three representative cucumber plants were transplanted into 3 lysimeters 30 cm in diameter 50 cm in depth the lysimeters were placed in the greenhouse with the same density as plants in the troughs yan et al 2018 the etc was measured by three accurate balances accuracy 1 g mettler toledo switzerland by weighing the decrease of the weight of the lysimeters with cucumbers four sap flow sensors flow 32 1 k dynamax inc usa were used to measure tr of four representative cucumber plants hourly data of the balance and sap flow sensors were directly recorded on a data logger cr1000 nb campbell usa in this study hourly data were used for the calculations and analyses the net radiation inside the greenhouse was measured by two nr lite 2 kipp zonen the netherlands mounted at 0 5 m and 2 m above the ground

logger system cr1000 campbell usa nine of the newest fully developed mature leaves from sun exposed terminal branches of three representative cucumber plants were selected to measure leaf stomatal conductance gs the average data were taken from three different leaves on the same plant the gs were measured every half an hour by gfs 3000 walz germany from 7 00 to 18 00 on sunny days on 17 april 23 may and 22 june during spring planting season 27 october 4 november and 12 december during autumn planting season in 2018 the leaf area and plant height of cucumber plants were measured at an interval of 5 7 days the leaf length l and the highest leaf width w were measured with a measuring tape and the conversion coefficient of 0 674 for the leaf area was derived from fitting the measured results to the one drawn using cad software 2 2 theory 2 2 1 energy balance description a schematic representation of the energy balance at a seedling stage and b flowering and fruiting stages of cucumber plants are shown in fig 1 the energy balance equation during cucumber plants growing stages could be expressed as 1 r n le h g δ w where rn is the net radiation w m 2 le is latent heat flux w m 2 h is sensible heat flux w m 2 g is soil heat flux w m 2 δw is heat flux stored in the brick corridors and plants canopy w m 2 in this study we assumed δw equals to zero in order to decrease the influence of energy absorption by brick corridors on the energy balance closure the measurement of rn at 0 5 m above the ground was used at seedling stage of cucumber plants plant canopy does not cover brick corridors fully while rn measured at 2 m above the ground was used during the flowering and fruiting stages of cucumber plants plant canopy covered brick corridors 2 2 2 shuttleworth

autumn planting seasons in 2018 are shown in fig 2 the air temperature ta and relative humidity rh during spring planting season from 24 march to 23 june ranged from 11 0 to 32 9 and 36 to 92 with average values equaled to 24 0 and 66 while during autumn planting season from 18 september to 17 december ta and rh ranged from 4 7 to 28 8 and 48 to 92 with average values equaled to 17 8 and 72 respectively it is important to note that ta gradually decreased whiles the rh showed an upward trend in the autumn planting season similar phenomenon was reported by yan et al 2019 in the same greenhouse in the autumn planting season of 2017 the soil water content θs at 5 10 cm depth for sufficient irrigation varied from 0 17 to 0 48 cm3 cm 3 with mean values of 0 32 and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 for spring and autumn planting seasons respectively the hourly wind speed u varied from 0 02 to 0 49 m s 1 with the highest value of 0 49 m s 1 in the autumn season the sharp increase in u was mainly caused by two axial fans during the seedling stage from 25 sep to 7 oct 8 to 20 dat in the autumn planting season to test the accuracy of the tr measured by sap flow sensors lysimeter was also employed to measure the tr by transplanting cucumber plants with the same leaf number into the lysimeter and was covered with clear 0 005 mm thick polyethylene film to prevent soil evaporation as shown in fig 3 the average relative difference between the tr measured by sap flow sensors and lysimeter was 2 32 according to observations reported by villarreal guerrero et al 2012 the difference between the data measured from sap flow sensors and lysimeter was less than 5 and the accuracy of the sap flow sensors was found satisfactory 3 2 parametrization of the sw model 3 2 1 variations of plant heights h and leaf area index lai the variations of lai and plant height are shown in fig 4 the lai reached a maximum of 4 67 in mid may around dat 50 and plant height reached a maximum of 1 86 m for spring planting season while lai and plant height reached maximum of 3 56 and 1 87 m in early november around dat 47 for autumn planting season during the fruiting stage the plant height was kept at about 1 8 m by pruning cucumber plants 3 2 2 variations of aerodynamic resistances r a a and r a s shuttleworth and wallace 1985 assumed r a a and r a s vary linearly with lai between the values associated with their extreme limits namely bare substrate lai 0 and a complete canopy cover lai 4 the r a a and r a s during spring planting season oscillated between 50 to 2110s m 1 and 400 to 6920 s m 1 while the r a a and r a s oscillated between 100 to 2796s m 1 and 270 to 5760 s m 1 during autumn planting season respectively values of r a a and r a s were quite higher than the result of shuttleworth and wallace 1985 which oscillated between 34 to 42 s m 1 and 49 to 128 s m 1 the result showed that values of aerodynamic resistances in the greenhouse were quite higher than the result in the open field the difference of the values of r a a and r a s among the open field and greenhouse mainly due to the wind speed u was quite lower in the greenhouse yan et al 2018 the average value of u was around 0 05 m s 1 in the greenhouse while shuttleworth and wallace 1985 assumed u in the open field equaled to 2 m s 1 as shown in fig 5 the amplitude of r a a decreased while the r a s increased along with dat therefore it can be explained that lai increased with dat shuttleworth and wallace 1985 3 2 3 modeling stomatal resistance rs stomatal resistance rs can be expressed in numerous ways and also related to a number of environmental variables such as vapor pressure deficit vpd ta and sr allen et al 1998 qiu et al 2013 in this study best fit exponential equations for sr and r s of the cucumber plants in different planting seasons were obtained as follows 17 autumn season r s 224 4 1485 9 exp 0 0185 s r r 2 0 79 18 spring season r s 144 3 1440 4 exp 0 0124 s r r 2 0 74 the rmse and relative error between measured and simulated value were 158 24 s m 1 and 4 11 160 41 s m 1 and 12 67 for the autumn and spring planting seasons respectively yang et al 1990 proved that no significant correlations between rs and other climatic variables were found except solar radiation sr for cucumber plants grown in a greenhouse as shown in fig 6 the exponential function between rs and sr obtained in this study was similar to the results of yang et al 1990 obtained for cucumber plants grown in an intelligent greenhouse but the coefficients of the regression formulas were different due to the difference in cucumber s variety geographical area and meteorological conditions 3 2 4 modeling soil surface resistance r s s based on the soil water content θs soil surface resistance r s s is the resistance to water vapor movement from the interior to the soil surface ortega farias et al 2010 its presence reflects the fact that the layer of air adjacent to the soil surface is not necessarily saturated unless the soil surface is wet shuttleworth and wallace 1985 previous studies ortega farias et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 were conducted to investigate the relationship between r s s with the ratio of saturated soil water content and actual soil water content θsat θs as a power function in vineyard fields but due to the differences in the soil texture and the depth of θs measurement among the studies it resulted in uncertainty of the model s parameters zhao et al 2015 so in this study the measured hourly eg from 1 to 10 september 2018 was used to calculate r s s by solving eq 13 and then plotted r s s against measured θs to parameterize the r s s sub model a regression analysis was found between r s s and θsat θs as follows 19 r s s 70 1 θ s a t θ s 2 3 r 2 0 62 where θsat is the saturated volumetric soil water content at the soil surface layer 0 60 m3 m 3 θs is the volumetric soil water content at the 5 10 cm depth as shown in fig 7 the parameters obtained in previous studies were quite different from the present study due to the differences in soil texture and other meteorological conditions open field and greenhouse conditions 3 2 5 determination of extinction coefficient c to determine the extinction coefficient c of light attenuation the measured daily net radiation above the canopy rn and the soil surface rns excluding the values on the rainy days at 2 0 m and 0 5 m above the ground were used to plot by solving eq 12 fig 8 a regression analysis was obtained between lai and rns rn as follows 20 r ns r n exp 0 22 lai r 2 0 71 c 0 22 obtained in this study was similar to the result of brisson et al 1998 c 0 25 0 01 and quite lower than the result of ortega farias et al 2010 c 0 38 0 05 who used two rn sensors mounted at 4 7 m and 0 5 m above the ground in a vineyard under open field conditions according to brisson et al 1998 the radiative budget of the soil is influenced by its surface water status through its albedo and temperature which explains why experimental results may vary 3 3 the performance of the sw model in predicting eg and tr based on the parameterized sw model described above the hourly etc tr and eg could be simulated the measured hourly etc and tr by lysimeters and sap flow sensors respectively were compared to the simulated values by the sw model for two planting seasons as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 results indicated that there were good agreements between the observed and simulated hourly etc in both planting seasons fig 9 and table 2 the rmse and d between observed and simulated hourly etc was 42 10 w m 2 and 0 93 26 60 w m 2 and 0 93 for spring and autumn planting seasons respectively the slope between observed and simulated hourly etc was 0 77 and 0 88 respectively with slight underestimation in spring and autumn planting seasons as shown in fig 10 and table 2 good agreements were found between the observed and simulated hourly tr in both planting seasons with rmse and d as 40 50 w m 2 and 0 91 15 63 w m 2 and 0 93 for spring and autumn planting seasons respectively the slopes between observed and simulated hourly tr were 1 11 and 1 19 with slight overestimation in spring and autumn planting seasons it can be proved that the sw model underestimated hourly eg since the model underestimated etc and overestimated tr similar results were reported by zhao et al 2015 that the sw model overestimated daily tr and underestimated daily eg for a vineyard in arid region of northwest china it is important to acknowledge that the parameterization of rn rs and r s s depend on the plants growing stages variety and soil water status ortega farias et al 2010 the plants growing stages affected energy absorption by brick corridors on the energy balance closure in the heterogeneous underlying surface under greenhouses condition therefore height of measured rn should be changed according to plants growing stages the overall analysis indicated that the parameterized sw model can be applied to simulate the tr and eg separately for the drip irrigated cucumbers grown in the venlo type greenhouse the accuracies of sw model for etc partitioning for different crops were also validated by other studies hu et al 2009 2013 ortega farias et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 in open field 3 4 the ratio of eg to etc at different growing stages of cucumber plants to further explore the eg etc ratio at different growing stages of cucumber tr and eg were simulated by the sw model separately table 3 showed that the tr was the dominant component of etc during the whole growing stage of cucumber plants with average values of 59 27 and 32 61 w m 2 while average etc values of 64 24 and 41 60 w m 2 were obtained for the spring and autumn planting seasons respectively the ratio of eg to etc was the highest at the seedling stage but the values were quite different between the two planting seasons 20 88 and 44 27 for spring and autumn planting seasons respectively it can be explained that θs was always kept at around 0 35 m3 m 3 and the wind speed u rose to 0 49 m s 1 fig 2 during seedling stage dat 8 to 20 for the autumn planting season raz yaseef et al 2012 reported that θs and u were the largest contributing variables to the eg during the drying season in the open field the average eg etc were 7 75 and 21 87 for the spring and autumn planting seasons respectively indicating that the tr was the dominant component of etc of cucumber plants in greenhouses over the full growing season similar result was reported by qiu et al 2015 that the average seasonal eg accounted for 6 1 of etc simulated by dual crop coefficient model over the entire growing season for hot pepper grown in a greenhouse hence based on the results of water consumption from cucumber plants and soil surface which were predicted by the constructed sw model in this study reducing a proper amount of irrigation water to decrease the soil evaporation at the seedling stage of greenhouse cucumber is an advisable way for improving water use efficiency and controlling the greenhouse environment especially in autumn planting seasons 4 conclusion in this study we partitioned etc into eg and tr over a drip irrigated cucumber grown in a venlo type greenhouse in south east china by parameterization of the shuttleworth wallace sw model the canopy resistance r s c was parameterized by stomatal resistance rs and a best fit exponential equations with solar radiation was obtained the soil surface resistance r s s was determined by the measured hourly eg and a power function between r s s and the ratio of saturated soil water content and actual soil water content θsat θs with r 2 0 62 was obtained by integrating the r s c and r s s sub models into sw model the etc and tr at hourly interval could be successfully simulated with rmse lower than 42 10 w m 2 and 40 50 w m 2 respectively during two planting seasons these results suggested that the parameterized sw model was very reliable in simulating the etc and tr in the greenhouse the ratio of eg to etc at the seedling stage were 20 88 and 44 27 for spring and autumn planting seasons while the average values of eg etc were 7 75 and 21 87 for the corresponding seasons respectively indicating that the tr was the dominant component of etc in most growing season of cucumber plants while the ratio of eg to etc at the seedling stage can t be neglected declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest and do not have any commercial or

10798,partitioning of evapotranspiration etc into soil evaporation eg and plants transpiration tr is of great importance to assess biomass production and improve water use efficiency under greenhouse conditions the shuttleworth wallace sw model which is used to separately predict eg and tr has been validated by many studies in open field however the model s parameters for the low wind speed and heterogeneous underlying surface in greenhouses are quite different from the open field therefore an experiment was conducted in a venlo type greenhouse in south east china during two planting seasons of cucumber plants in 2018 where the etc and tr were directly measured by lysimeters and sap flow sensors the soil surface and canopy resistances were parameterized based on the soil water content at 5 10 cm depth and solar radiation inside the greenhouse respectively the sw model simulated etc and tr at hourly interval with root mean square error rmse and index of agreement d of 42 10 w m 2 and 0 93 40 50 w m 2 and 0 91 for the spring season while for the autumn season the values were 26 60 w m 2 and 0 93 15 63 w m 2 and 0 93 respectively the average eg etc were 7 75 and 21 87 for spring and autumn planting seasons respectively indicating that the tr was the dominant component of etc of cucumber grown in greenhouse over the full crop season our research shows the parameterized sw model would be a relatively accurate way to separately simulate the dynamic variations of the tr and eg and for future use to improve irrigation scheduling for cucumber plants under greenhouse conditions keywords evapotranspiration parametrization shuttleworth wallace model venlo type greenhouse 1 introduction venlo type greenhouses equipped with automatic environmental control systems have widely been distributed all over the world yan et al 2018 at present china has the largest protected cultivation area in the world more than 2 million ha therefore more information is urgently needed to improve greenhouse crops irrigation schedules xu et al 2013 zhao et al 2018a 2018b accurate determination of evapotranspiration etc is very important for improving greenhouse crops irrigation schedules and water use efficiency wue kang et al 2004 yan et al 2015 2017 ma et al 2018 the etc can be divided into plant transpiration tr and soil evaporation eg however the tr is associated with plant productivity while eg is regarded as invalid water consumption not directly contributing to plant productivity zhang et al 2013 kool et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 therefore accurate determination of tr and eg will be a good indicator of the productive use of water through crop uptake making partitioning of etc necessary kool et al 2014 the pan evaporation method liu et al 2013 penman monteith pm method stanghellini 1987 qiu et al 2013 takakura method villarreal guerrero et al 2012 and priestley taylor method valdés gómez et al 2009 are often used to determine etc in greenhouses qiu et al 2015 however these methods cannot be used to separately estimate tr and eg there are two widely used and primary methods to partitioning etc in open field condition the fao 56 dual crop coefficient method which calculates tr and eg separately through a basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ke where kcb is determined by the crop type and the crop growing stage allen et al 1998 lagos et al 2013 however the straightforward adoption of generalized kcb recommended by fao 56 can lead to errors since the kcb is closely related to local climate and crop conditions katerji and rana 2006 zhao et al 2015 in addition it is difficult to accurately divide the crop growth stages for many crops allen et al 2007 lagos et al 2013 shuttleworth and wallace sw model is the other widely used method this method extends the pm single layer model to two layer model one for the tr and the other for eg shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the sw model divided etc into plant and soil components through using surface resistances to regulate the heat and mass transfer from plant and soil surfaces as well as aerodynamic resistance to regulate fluxes to the atmosphere lagos et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 compared to the fao 56 dual crop coefficient model the sw model is the first analytical model combining eg and tr by formulating the different media through which evaporative flux travels as resistances kool et al 2014 the sw model is generally considered accurate but hard to parameterize the large number of parameters odhiambo and irmak 2011 kool et al 2014 up till now many researches have been done based on the application of sw model to estimate the eg and tr in orchards ortega farias et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 spring maize field zhu et al 2014 and grassland hu et al 2009 to the best of our knowledge limited studies have been conducted to partition etc using sw model for cucumber plants grown in greenhouses because the wind speed and heterogeneous underlying surface in greenhouses are quite different from the open fields the determined resistance parameters of sw model in open fields may not be used in greenhouses qiu et al 2015 therefore the purpose of this study was 1 to parameterize the sw model based on conventional meteorological data in combination with plant physiological data observed in a venlo type greenhouse 2 to verify the performance of the sw model for simulating etc and tr over a drip irrigated cucumber grown in the venlo type greenhouse 3 to separately estimate etc components tr and eg and the ratios of tr and eg to etc for different growing stages and planting seasons spring and autumn planting seasons of cucumber crop 2 materials and methods 2 1 filed observation the experiment was conducted during the spring and autumn 2018 planting seasons at a venlo type greenhouse located in the jiangsu province china 32 11 n 119 25 e 23 m a s l the greenhouse structure has an area of 32 m in length 20 m in width 3 8 m in height with the longer side in an east west orientation covered with a 4 mm float glass with transmittance greater than 89 ni et al 2019 the greenhouse forced ventilation was performed by two axial fans 1 5 m in

the climate in the study area is a humid subtropical monsoon climatic zone with an average annual air temperature of 15 5 c and a mean annual precipitation rainfall of 1058 8 mm y 1 yan et al 2018 the planting medium used in the greenhouse was a soil biochar mixture with mean bulk density of 1 27 g cm 3 field capacity of 0 41 cm3 cm 3 and wilting point water content of 0 16 cm3 cm 3 in the depth of 0 60 cm acquah et al 2018 the irrigation was provided with an automatic drip irrigation system the drip irrigation method was used with dripping wings along the row and distributors giving 100 ml min

pan 20 cm in diameter evaporation ep method the ep was determined by accumulating the values measured by counting cup at eight o clock every morning when ep reached 20 mm the crop was irrigated to 18 mm liu et al 2013 demonstrated that 0 9 ep represented sufficient irrigation when ep reached 20 mm based on several years experimental research in a solar greenhouse for autumn planting season water was irrigated with 10 mm every morning and axial fans were opened every afternoon during the seedling stage from 25 september to 7 october from 8 to 20 days after transplanting dat to make cucumber seedlings healthier and more defensive against diseases and insect pests cucumbers f1 hybrid were transplanted into the troughs 0 65 m in width 16 7 m in length on 23 march and harvested on 23 june 2018 defined as spring planting season and again on 18 september and were harvested on 17 december 2018 defined as autumn planting season with plant density equal to 6 63 per m2 the cucumber growth was divided into three stages seedling stage flowering stage and fruiting stage based on the many years observations in venlo type greenhouses in southern china table1 chen et al 2016 three representative cucumber plants were transplanted into 3 lysimeters 30 cm in diameter 50 cm in depth the lysimeters were placed in the greenhouse with the same density as plants in the troughs yan et al 2018 the etc was measured by three accurate balances accuracy 1 g mettler toledo switzerland by weighing the decrease of the weight of the lysimeters with cucumbers four sap flow sensors flow 32 1 k dynamax inc usa were used to measure tr of four representative cucumber plants hourly data of the balance and sap flow sensors were directly recorded on a data logger cr1000 nb campbell usa in this study hourly data were used for the calculations and analyses the net radiation inside the greenhouse was measured by two nr lite 2 kipp zonen the netherlands mounted at 0 5 m and 2 m above the ground the soil heat flux was measured by a soil heat plate hfp01 l10 campbell usa placed at 0 05 m below the soil surface the air temperature and relative humidity were measured by a sensor onset computer

logger system cr1000 campbell usa nine of the newest fully developed mature leaves from sun exposed terminal branches of three representative cucumber plants were selected to measure leaf stomatal conductance gs the average data were taken from three different leaves on the same plant the gs were measured every half an hour by gfs 3000 walz germany from 7 00 to 18 00 on sunny days on 17 april 23 may and 22 june during spring planting season 27 october 4 november and 12 december during autumn planting season in 2018 the leaf area and plant height of cucumber plants were measured at an interval of 5 7 days the leaf length l and the highest leaf width w were measured with a measuring tape and the conversion coefficient of 0 674 for the leaf area was derived from fitting the measured results to the one drawn using cad software 2 2 theory 2 2 1 energy balance description a schematic representation of the energy balance at a seedling stage and b flowering and fruiting stages of cucumber plants are shown in fig 1 the energy balance equation during cucumber plants growing stages could be expressed as 1 r n le h g δ w where rn is the net radiation w m 2 le is latent heat flux w m 2 h is sensible heat flux w m 2 g is soil heat flux w m 2 δw is heat flux stored in the brick corridors and plants canopy w m 2 in this study we assumed δw equals to zero in order to decrease the influence of energy absorption by brick corridors on the energy balance closure the measurement of rn at 0 5 m above the ground was used at seedling stage of cucumber plants plant canopy does not cover brick corridors fully while rn measured at 2 m above the ground was used during the flowering and fruiting stages of cucumber plants plant canopy covered brick corridors 2 2 2 shuttleworth

autumn planting seasons in 2018 are shown in fig 2 the air temperature ta and relative humidity rh during spring planting season from 24 march to 23 june ranged from 11 0 to 32 9 and 36 to 92 with average values equaled to 24 0 and 66 while during autumn planting season from 18 september to 17 december ta and rh ranged from 4 7 to 28 8 and 48 to 92 with average values equaled to 17 8 and 72 respectively it is important to note that ta gradually decreased whiles the rh showed an upward trend in the autumn planting season similar phenomenon was reported by yan et al 2019 in the same greenhouse in the autumn planting season of 2017 the soil water content θs at 5 10 cm depth for sufficient irrigation varied from 0 17 to 0 48 cm3 cm 3 with mean values of 0 32 and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 for spring and autumn planting seasons respectively the hourly wind speed u varied from 0 02 to 0 49 m s 1 with the highest value of 0 49 m s 1 in the autumn season the sharp increase in u was mainly caused by two axial fans during the seedling stage from 25 sep to 7 oct 8 to 20 dat in the autumn planting season to test the accuracy of the tr measured by sap flow sensors lysimeter was also employed to measure the tr by transplanting cucumber plants with the same leaf number into the lysimeter and was covered with clear 0 005 mm thick polyethylene film to prevent soil evaporation as shown in fig 3 the average relative difference between the tr measured by sap flow sensors and lysimeter was 2 32 according to observations reported by villarreal guerrero et al 2012 the difference between the data measured from sap flow sensors and lysimeter was less than 5 and the accuracy of the sap flow sensors was found satisfactory 3 2 parametrization of the sw model 3 2 1 variations of plant heights h and leaf area index lai the variations of lai and plant height are shown in fig 4 the lai reached a maximum of 4 67 in mid may around dat 50 and plant height reached a maximum of 1 86 m for spring planting season while lai and plant height reached maximum of 3 56 and 1 87 m in early november around dat 47 for autumn planting season during the fruiting stage the plant height was kept at about 1 8 m by pruning cucumber plants 3 2 2 variations of aerodynamic resistances r a a and r a s shuttleworth and wallace 1985 assumed r a a and r a s vary linearly with lai between the values associated with their extreme limits namely bare substrate lai 0 and a complete canopy cover lai 4 the r a a and r a s during spring planting season oscillated between 50 to 2110s m 1 and 400 to 6920 s m 1 while the r a a and r a s oscillated between 100 to 2796s m 1 and 270 to 5760 s m 1 during autumn planting season respectively values of r a a and r a s were quite higher than the result of shuttleworth and wallace 1985 which oscillated between 34 to 42 s m 1 and 49 to 128 s m 1 the result showed that values of aerodynamic resistances in the greenhouse were quite higher than the result in the open field the difference of the values of r a a and r a s among the open field and greenhouse mainly due to the wind speed u was quite lower in the greenhouse yan et al 2018 the average value of u was around 0 05 m s 1 in the greenhouse while shuttleworth and wallace 1985 assumed u in the open field equaled to 2 m s 1 as shown in fig 5 the amplitude of r a a decreased while the r a s increased along with dat therefore it can be explained that lai increased with dat shuttleworth and wallace 1985 3 2 3 modeling stomatal resistance rs stomatal resistance rs can be expressed in numerous ways and also related to a number of environmental variables such as vapor pressure deficit vpd ta and sr allen et al 1998 qiu et al 2013 in this study best fit exponential equations for sr and r s of the cucumber plants in different planting seasons were obtained as follows 17 autumn season r s 224 4 1485 9 exp 0 0185 s r r 2 0 79 18 spring season r s 144 3 1440 4 exp 0 0124 s r r 2 0 74 the rmse and relative error between measured and simulated value were 158 24 s m 1 and 4 11 160 41 s m 1 and 12 67 for the autumn and spring planting seasons respectively yang et al 1990 proved that no significant correlations between rs and other climatic variables were found except solar radiation sr for cucumber plants grown in a greenhouse as shown in fig 6 the exponential function between rs and sr obtained in this study was similar to the results of yang et al 1990 obtained for cucumber plants grown in an intelligent greenhouse but the coefficients of the regression formulas were different due to the difference in cucumber s variety geographical area and meteorological conditions 3 2 4 modeling soil surface resistance r s s based on the soil water content θs soil surface resistance r s s is the resistance to water vapor movement from the interior to the soil surface ortega farias et al 2010 its presence reflects the fact that the layer of air adjacent to the soil surface is not necessarily saturated unless the soil surface is wet shuttleworth and wallace 1985 previous studies ortega farias et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 were conducted to investigate the relationship between r s s with the ratio of saturated soil water content and actual soil water content θsat θs as a power function in vineyard fields but due to the differences in the soil texture and the depth of θs measurement among the studies it resulted in uncertainty of the model s parameters zhao et al 2015 so in this study the measured hourly eg from 1 to 10 september 2018 was used to calculate r s s by solving eq 13 and then plotted r s s against measured θs to parameterize the r s s sub model a regression analysis was found between r s s and θsat θs as follows 19 r s s 70 1 θ s a t θ s 2 3 r 2 0 62 where θsat is the saturated volumetric soil water content at the soil surface layer 0 60 m3 m 3 θs is the volumetric soil water content at the 5 10 cm depth as shown in fig 7 the parameters obtained in previous studies were quite different from the present study due to the differences in soil texture and other meteorological conditions open field and greenhouse conditions 3 2 5 determination of extinction coefficient c to determine the extinction coefficient c of light attenuation the measured daily net radiation above the canopy rn and the soil surface rns excluding the values on the rainy days at 2 0 m and 0 5 m above the ground were used to plot by solving eq 12 fig 8 a regression analysis was obtained between lai and rns rn as follows 20 r ns r n exp 0 22 lai r 2 0 71 c 0 22 obtained in this study was similar to the result of brisson et al 1998 c 0 25 0 01 and quite lower than the result of ortega farias et al 2010 c 0 38 0 05 who used two rn sensors mounted at 4 7 m and 0 5 m above the ground in a vineyard under open field conditions according to brisson et al 1998 the radiative budget of the soil is influenced by its surface water status through its albedo and temperature which explains why experimental results may vary 3 3 the performance of the sw model in predicting eg and tr based on the parameterized sw model described above the hourly etc tr and eg could be simulated the measured hourly etc and tr by lysimeters and sap flow sensors respectively were compared to the simulated values by the sw model for two planting seasons as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 results indicated that there were good agreements between the observed and simulated hourly etc in both planting seasons fig 9 and table 2 the rmse and d between observed and simulated hourly etc was 42 10 w m 2 and 0 93 26 60 w m 2 and 0 93 for spring and autumn planting seasons respectively the slope between observed and simulated hourly etc was 0 77 and 0 88 respectively with slight underestimation in spring and autumn planting seasons as shown in fig 10 and table 2 good agreements were found between the observed and simulated hourly tr in both planting seasons with rmse and d as 40 50 w m 2 and 0 91 15 63 w m 2 and 0 93 for spring and autumn planting seasons respectively the slopes between observed and simulated hourly tr were 1 11 and 1 19 with slight overestimation in spring and autumn planting seasons it can be proved that the sw model underestimated hourly eg since the model underestimated etc and overestimated tr similar results were reported by zhao et al 2015 that the sw model overestimated daily tr and underestimated daily eg for a vineyard in arid region of northwest china it is important to acknowledge that the parameterization of rn rs and r s s depend on the plants growing stages variety and soil water status ortega farias et al 2010 the plants growing stages affected energy absorption by brick corridors on the energy balance closure in the heterogeneous underlying surface under greenhouses condition therefore height of measured rn should be changed according to plants growing stages the overall analysis indicated that the parameterized sw model can be applied to simulate the tr and eg separately for the drip irrigated cucumbers grown in the venlo type greenhouse the accuracies of sw model for etc partitioning for different crops were also validated by other studies hu et al 2009 2013 ortega farias et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 in open field 3 4 the ratio of eg to etc at different growing stages of cucumber plants to further explore the eg etc ratio at different growing stages of cucumber tr and eg were simulated by the sw model separately table 3 showed that the tr was the dominant component of etc during the whole growing stage of cucumber plants with average values of 59 27 and 32 61 w m 2 while average etc values of 64 24 and 41 60 w m 2 were obtained for the spring and autumn planting seasons respectively the ratio of eg to etc was the highest at the seedling stage but the values were quite different between the two planting seasons 20 88 and 44 27 for spring and autumn planting seasons respectively it can be explained that θs was always kept at around 0 35 m3 m 3 and the wind speed u rose to 0 49 m s 1 fig 2 during seedling stage dat 8 to 20 for the autumn planting season raz yaseef et al 2012 reported that θs and u were the largest contributing variables to the eg during the drying season in the open field the average eg etc were 7 75 and 21 87 for the spring and autumn planting seasons respectively indicating that the tr was the dominant component of etc of cucumber plants in greenhouses over the full growing season similar result was reported by qiu et al 2015 that the average seasonal eg accounted for 6 1 of etc simulated by dual crop coefficient model over the entire growing season for hot pepper grown in a greenhouse hence based on the results of water consumption from cucumber plants and soil surface which were predicted by the constructed sw model in this study reducing a proper amount of irrigation water to decrease the soil evaporation at the seedling stage of greenhouse cucumber is an advisable way for improving water use efficiency and controlling the greenhouse environment especially in autumn planting seasons 4 conclusion in this study we partitioned etc into eg and tr over a drip irrigated cucumber grown in a venlo type greenhouse in south east china by parameterization of the shuttleworth wallace sw model the canopy resistance r s c was parameterized by stomatal resistance rs and a best fit exponential equations with solar radiation was obtained the soil surface resistance r s s was determined by the measured hourly eg and a power function between r s s and the ratio of saturated soil water content and actual soil water content θsat θs with r 2 0 62 was obtained by integrating the r s c and r s s sub models into sw model the etc and tr at hourly interval could be successfully simulated with rmse lower than 42 10 w m 2 and 40 50 w m 2 respectively during two planting seasons these results suggested that the parameterized sw model was very reliable in simulating the etc and tr in the greenhouse the ratio of eg to etc at the seedling stage were 20 88 and 44 27 for spring and autumn planting seasons while the average values of eg etc were 7 75 and 21 87 for the corresponding seasons respectively indicating that the tr was the dominant component of etc in most growing season of cucumber plants while the ratio of eg to etc at the seedling stage can t be neglected declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest and do not have any commercial or

10799,catchment water quality models are essential for fresh water management however their value is dependent on their performance and level of uncertainty and for this information to be communicated in a transparent and understandable way to key stakeholders here we present the latest calibration of the catchment landuse for environmental sustainability model clues and examine the implications of the calibration for estimating in stream contaminant attenuation clues estimates catchment mean annual loads of total nitrogen total phosphorus and e coli and is widely used in new zealand for both catchment planning and policy development clues contains three freshwater model components derived from existing water quality models two are based on the new zealand overseer and spasmo models and have been pre calibrated for use in clues the third component is based on the usgs sparrow model and its parameters have been calibrated against annual loads estimated from monthly water quality data from catchments across the country we found that clues gives reasonable load estimates at the catchment scale nash sutcliff efficiencies 0 8 for all the contaminants however there was significant uncertainty in the sparrow parameterisation we conclude that while clues can be used to estimate catchment contaminant loads it cannot adequately estimate instream attenuation improved representation of lower order streams in the calibration data would allow us to evaluate the source yields from each of the model components to better estimate attenuation keywords overseer sparrow spasmo annual contaminant loads catchment scale uncertainty 1 introduction there has been ongoing deterioration of water quality in many of new zealand s rural catchments largely as a result of agricultural runoff mcdowell and wilcock 2008 mcdowell and laurenson 2014 in response the national policy statement for freshwater management nps fm new zealand government 2014 has established the national objective framework that requires annual load limits to be set for allowable contaminant discharges to fresh water bodies similar to total maximum daily loads in the united states united states environmental protection agency 1991 setting contaminant limits requires knowledge about the effect of different soils landscapes and flow pathways on the generation conveyance and attenuation of contaminants in agricultural runoff at a range of scales this knowledge is used to establish the magnitude of contaminant sources and losses and to identify the critical contaminant pathways at the enterprise and catchment scale where different land uses management practices and mitigation investments can be most cost effectively targeted predictive water quality models are essential for freshwater management and are available at a range of spatial and temporal scales and levels of complexity shoemaker et al 2005 fu et al 2019 the need for models to support the implementation load limits has been addressed in new zealand by the land and water forum 2012 among others e g voinov and bousquet 2010 the forum notes that community involvement is essential for effective and lasting water management strategies and public acceptance of models used to develop these strategies requires the model performance and level of uncertainty be communicated in an understandable way the fitness for purpose of water quality models used for freshwater management in new zealand was the subject of a recent inquiry by the parliamentary commissioner for the environment upton 2018 this inquiry noted that there is considerable disquiet among farmers who are at the coal face of implementing mitigation measures under the nps fm about the lack of transparency in the performance and uncertainty of these models moreover regional councils have been cautious about imposing limits when they cannot easily explain how these were set to stakeholders affected by them the concerns raised by the commissioner echoes wider calls for quantification of uncertainty in catchment models grayson et al 1992 harmel et al 2014 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 the primary ojective of this paper is to present the most recent calibration of the new zealand catchment land cover for environmental sustainability model clues elliott et al 2016 to address the need for greater model transparency since its initial release in 2006 clues has been applied in new zealand to support catchment planning and both national and regional policy making lilburne et al 2011 hughes et al 2013 parliamentary commissioner for the environment 2014 a secondary objective is to assess how the calibration affects the estimation of instream attenuation since the choice and location of water quality improvement measures will be guided by the amount and location of contaminant sources and losses birgand et al 2010 sheibly et al 2016 the paper illustrates the real world challenges involved in calibrating catchment models and evaluating their performance clues has been calibrated for general use at the national level against mean annual loads estimated from long term monthly sampled water quality data collected from around the country while clues is specific to new zealand the need for reliable water quality models to inform catchment planning and policy is universal moreover clues contains sub routines from the united states geological survey sparrow model spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes smith et al 1997 schwarz et al 2006 which is one of the most cited catchment scale water quality models in the international literature fu et al 2019 we believe that our method of integrating sparrow into clues alongside two local model components could be of interest to others wanting to apply sparrow outside the united states or to couple it to other models 2 clues model framework clues is a steady state catchment scale modelling framework that estimates the annual loads of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp e coli and sediment delivered to and transported by freshwater bodies clues calculation methods have been described in elliott et al 2016 and are summarised here the model is provided free of charge for non commercial use ftp ftp niwa co nz clues as a plugin for esri arcmap 10 6 the ethos behind clues was to provide an easy to apply nationally consistent tool with publicly available data as model inputs that can be used to assess the impacts of land use change and land management on catchment water quality the intended users are researchers and decision makers in research institutes and regional and central government agencies the spatial and temporal scales of clues were chosen to allow rapid model setup and scenario creation the low data requirements and resolution means that clues follows a conceptual empirical approach whereas dynamic physically based models with greater spatial resolution such as the soil water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2009 shetran ewen et al 2000 and the integrated catchment model inca whitehead et al 1998 that have been applied in new zealand cao et al 2006 elliott et al 2012 mallett 2015 require a greater number of model parameters and more intensive calibration clues is provided with a geo database containing all the spatial data required to run the model the surface drainage network is represented by the new zealand river environments classification rec snelder et al 2010 and clues provides model outputs for each of the approximately 600 000 reaches in this network the smallest spatial unit in clues is the rec reach sub catchment which has an average area of around 0 4 km2 diffuse sources are represented by the proportion of each sub catchment covered by each of 17 land cover classes table 1 the land covers are grouped into 14 functional groups for modelling they are provided separately in the geo database to facilitate scenario development there are five farm types represented in the land cover classes dairy sheep and beef lowland intensive hill country and high country and deer other catchment data are aggregated for each sub catchment as either the dominant value i e soil type and drainage or the spatially weighted average determined using the arcmap zonal statistics tool slope climate clues contains three freshwater modelling components based on existing water quality models each component calculates loads generated by a subset of the land cover functional groups as indicated in table 1 in addition to the aforementioned sparrow component the model components have been derived from the new zealand overseer wheeler et al 2006 shepherd and wheeler 2013 wheeler et al 2014 and soil plant atmosphere system model spasmo rosen et al 2004 models the three model components allow clues to take advantage of the strengths of each model and to incorporate physical and conceptual model elements into an empirical model structure the role of each model component is summarised below and the coupling between them is illustrated in fig 1 overseer is a proprietary farm scale nutrient balance model developed by agresearch ltd that is widely used in new zealand for farm management and policy development clues contains a modified version of the latest release of overseer v 6 3 march 2018 that has been upscaled by treating each farm type in a reach subcatchment as a single farm entity the clues overseer component is used to estimate sub catchment tn and tp loads from dairy and lowland intensive and hill country sheep and beef farming these farm types account for around 39 of the country s total area spasmo is a daily model of the plant soil system developed by plant and food ltd the model was run for different combinations soils and rainfalls to create a look up table of aggregated annual yields that is referenced by clues to estimate nitrogen losses from crops and horticulture these land uses account for around 2 of the country s area sparrow uses advanced regression analysis to relate in stream contaminant loads to upstream land cover and catchment characteristics prior to its inclusion in clues sparrow was applied in new zealand nationally and to the waikato river catchment to estimate nutrient sources and losses alexander et al 2002a elliott et al 2005 in the usa sparrow models have been developed for several major river catchments preston et al 2011b such as the mississippi atchafalaya river basin where sparrow was applied to identify the relative importance of nutrient sources and losses in the catchment robertson and saad 2013 robertson et al 2014 clues contains sub routines taken from the sparrow model to estimate tn and tp loads from diffuse sources not covered by the overseer or spasmo models with the exceptions of open water and urban land covers estimate sediment and e coli loads from all diffuse sources estimate surface losses between the diffuse sources modelled by sparrow and the stream network and route contaminant loads delivered to the drainage network downstream considering in stream attenuation and attenuation in lakes and reservoirs 2 1 load estimation the contaminant load generated by each diffuse source or land cover within a subcatchment is calculated as the product of the source area and associated source yield which is the amount per unit area of the contaminant released by the source per year for sources other than urban land covers and open water the source yields are either provided by the spasmo or overseer model components or have been calibrated as model parameters within sparrow the urban tn 0 8 t km2 y and tp 0 08 t km2 y source yields have been assigned literature values williamson 1993 the urban source yield for e coli is calibrated in sparrow atmospheric deposition of tn 0 31 t km2 y and tp 0 20 t km2 y onto water surfaces within a reach sub catchment is calculated as the product of the water surface area and an annual deposition rate derived from literature verberg et al 2018 this source is not simulated for e coli the diffuse loads calculated by sparrow for each subcatchment are multiplied by the catchment delivery factor prior to discharge into the stream network to simulate losses in the surface and soil flow pathways the delivery factor is calculated as an exponential function of soil drainage and the mean annual rainfall and temperature 1 d e l i v e r y f a c t o r e x p a r r 1 85 a d d 4 2 a t t 10 1 where r is the mean annual rainfall m y d is the drainage class and t is the mean annual air temperature c the coefficients 1 85 4 2 and 10 1 are the mean average values across all subcatchments of rainfall drainage class and temperature respectively determined directly from the clues input data the exponents ar ad and at relate to rainfall drainage or temperature respectively and are calibrated drainage class is a dimensionless indicator ranging between 1 poorly drained and 5 well drained and is taken from the land resources information fundamental soils layer newsome 1995 the mean annual temperature and rainfall data have been derived from the niwa virtual climate station network 30 year climate normals 1981 2010 tait et al 2006 the source yields provided by the spasmo and overseer model components vary by reach according to catchment characteristics and have catchment surface losses implicit within them for this reason the delivery factors for these sources are set to zero any loads from point sources located in a subcatchment are added to diffuse loads discharged to the stream network point sources include wastewater treatment plants abattoirs piggeries and pulp and paper mills the source locations and their locations and estimated annual loads have been provided by regional authorities for use in clues tp from sediments is approximated as the product of the clues base sediment loss for the reach and a sediment yield parameter this source is also subject to catchment delivery factors the sediment load used to derive the sediment p is a baseline value taken from the clues model inputs once delivered to the stream network the total loads for each contaminant are routed downstream such that the in stream load for a reach is the total of the upstream load and the reach load less stream and reservoir attenuation for tn and e coli in stream attenuation is modelled for each reach as a first order decay function of stream length with the decay coefficient varying as a power function of flow 2 d s t r e a m 1 e x p k s t r e a m l q k f l o w where k s t r e a m and k f l o w are calibrated parameters l is the length km of the portion of the reach that not in a lake and q is the estimated mean annual flow rate for the reach woods et al 2006 a different approach is used to model in stream attenuation of tp such that 3 d s t r e a m 1 e x p k s t r e a m l where k s t r e a m and l are as defined above the total load from each reach sub catchment discharged to the reach is multiplied by estimated reach attenuation factor while the load routed from upstream reaches is multiplied by the square root of the attenuation factor attenuation in lakes including hydro power reservoirs is applied only to the lake outlet and is a function of the lake area and depth of outflow and is calculated as 4 d r e s r r k r e s where d r e s is the decay factor for the outlet reach of the lake r is the lake or reservoir overflow depth m year for the outlet reach and is a function of the lake surface area and total inflow volumes and k r e s is a calibrated coefficient representing contaminant losses within the reservoir 3 calibration method and data 3 1 methodology clues calibration is undertaken within the usgs sparrow software package sparrow contains non linear regression functions based on catchment and network characteristics that are parameterised by users to represent the generation and transport of each contaminant these functions were calibrated using the same spatial data as held in the clues geo database the outputs of the spasmo and overseer model components of clues were used as inputs to sparrow the resulting sparrow routines and parameters were then copied into the clues model as the sparrow model component the sparrow calibrated parameters are the source yields including tp from sediment and delivery factors for the land covers simulated by sparrow table 1 and the in stream and reservoir decay coefficients for contaminant loads within the drainage network sparrow was last calibrated for e coli in 2014 the tn and tp models were recalibrated for this paper to coincide with the release of overseer version 6 3 which was a significant update to this model clues calibration for sediment was documented in elliott et al 2008 and is not presented here the sparrow calibration procedure is described in the sparrow user s manual schwarz et al 2006 and is summarised here an iterative approach was followed whereby the results of each calibration were evaluated to further optimise the model to obtain the most parsimonious representation e g by aggregating land cover types or removing the delivery and decay terms whilst maintaining the model fit sparrow calibration seeks to minimise the root mean square error rmse calculated for the residuals between the natural log transformed modelled and measured mean annual loads hitherto referred to as calibration loads the calibration loads are estimated from monitored water quality and flow data using the method presented in the next section the calibration uses natural log transformed loads as a means reducing the skew due to the variation in loads from catchments of varying size a local linear approximation to the optimal model and approximate gaussian parametric distribution of residuals are used to determine parameter uncertainty as detailed in schwarz et al 2006 a boot strapping sensitivity analysis is available as part of sparrow calibration that assigns the level of uncertainty for each model parameter however this was not applied for this study because previous studies have demonstrated that the parametric distribution provides a reasonable approximation to the bootstrap distribution e g alexander et al 2002a at lower computational cost the uncertainty analysis returns the standard error t statistic and probability for each parameter the p values relate to the null hypothesis that the respective coefficients are zero and therefore have no impact on the model a p value 0 05 indicates that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis variance inflation factors vif are calculated to determine whether there is collinearity between parameters model fit is also evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 between the natural logs of the measured and modelled loads and the r2 adjusted for the degrees of freedom in the model as well as the r2 between the log transformed modelled and measured yields i e as a means of normalising loads by the upstream catchment area although not automatically calculated by sparrow the nash sutclifffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 has been estimated here for each calibration the nse is commonly used to assess the fit of hydrological models moriasi et al 2007 and is a normalised statistic that indicates how well the plot of the observed against modelled fits the 1 1 line the value ranges from to one a nse of one indicates that the modelled and measured values are the same whereas a nse of zero indicates that the modelled values are only as accurate as the mean of the measured values a value 0 5 indicates that the model performance is satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 a negative nse means that the mean of the measured values is a better predictor than the model 3 2 calibration loads mean annual loads for calibration were estimated from tn tp and e coli monthly concentration data held in the national river water quality network nrwqn that contains state of environment soe water quality sampling undertaken by regional authorities around the country to miminise uncertainty associated with loads estimated from soe data snelder et al 2017 only data from water quality monitoring sites with concurrent continuous flow records and a sampling length of at least five years covering the period january 2006 and december 2010 were selected for calibration this period was chosen at it is considered representative of the clues default land cover reference year nominally 2008 and five years was used to avoid the possibility of trends in the water quality data nationally around 210 monitoring sites meet these minimum criteria however not all of these sites yielded estimated loads of sufficient quality for the calibration as discussed below the measured mean annual loads of each contaminant were estimated for the monitoring sites by fitting a rating curve to the natural log of the monthly concentrations against the natural log of the daily flow rate for the sampling dates fig 2 the estimation was made in the r programming language r core team 2018 using the generalised additive model regression analysis included in the mixed gam computation vehicle mgcv wood 2013a b library for r since the calculations were carried out in log space to account for retransformation bias the mean load was adjusted using the non parametric smearing factor of duan 1983 once fitted the derived curve relationship for each site was applied to the site s daily flow time series over the entire period of the flow record to derive a time series of mean daily concentrations the concentrations were multiplied by the corresponding daily flow volumes to give the estimated daily loads and summed to give the mean annual load the suitability of the rating curve derived loads for model calibration was assessed for each site by generating confidence intervals and standard deviations for the natural log transformed mean annual loads by repeating the rating curve procedure using a boot strapping approach this approach takes random samples of the original water quality data and estimates the natural log transformed mean annual load for each of these a standard deviation greater than 1 signal that the mean annual load calculated for the site is likely to be unrepresentative of actual loads and the site was removed from the calibration data set the proportion of the total annual load associated with flows greater that 95th percentile flow rate was also determined this was done along with a visual inspection of the rating curve to ensure that the sampling covered the range of flows recorded in the flow record the final number of sites for which the estimated mean annual loads were considered reliable for calibration was 141 for tp 183 for tn and 128 for e coli these sites are mapped in fig 3 and the number of monitoring sites selected in each region listed from north to south are given in table 2 along with the regional areas total stream length and stream density the sampling densities i e number of sites by area are provided in parentheses while each region is represented in the calibration data sets some regions have a greater number of monitoring sites or greater sampling density than others the waikato auckland and wellington regions for instance have the highest density by area and stream length of suitable monitoring sites in contrast marlborough west coast tasman nelson and canterbury have the lowest sampling density which is likely due to the lack of monitoring sites generally in mountainous areas upwards of 80 of the monitoring sites are located on streams with a strahler stream order of 5 or more there are none on headwaters or second order streams and only 4 of sites are on third order streams to keep the data record as representative as possible nationally given the general lack of water quality data in new zealand for different environmental characteristics all the available data suitable for load calculation were used for the calibration 4 calibration results the calibration results are given in tables 3 7 and plots of the natural log transformed calibration loads estimated from monitored data against the natural log transformed modelled loads are given in fig 4 the r2 and the nse for e coli are both 0 82 indicating that the linear regression line is close to the 1 1 line table 3 of concern is that the model has only three land cover classes and is insensitive to different farm types the variation inflation factors vifs for the pastoral land cover source yield and the in stream attenuation coefficients indicates that there is co linearity in the model examination of the correlation between the parameters found that there is strong negative correlation 0 8 between the pastoral source yield and the stream decay factor the confidence intervals for stream decay and the lake attenuation parameters as well as the urban and other land cover source yields include zero indicating that these parameters may have no impact on the model results the p values for these parameters are 0 05 indicating significant uncertainty at the 95 level the delivery factors indicate that the e coli load delivered to the stream network from each subcatchment decreases by 37 for every increase in drainage class and increases by 14 for every 100 mm increase in mean annual rainfall and 15 for every degree in mean annual temperature table 8 these factors seem reasonable given filtering in soil mcleod et al 2008 increased wash off with rainfall and survival in warmer temperatures there are two calibrations each for tn tables 4 and 5 and tp tables 6 and 7 with in stream attenuation terms included in the calibration and without the calibration with no in stream attenuation was done due to uncertainty around the attenuation parameters seen in tables 4 and 6 the r2 and nse for tn with in stream attenuation both 0 95 is only slightly greater than with no in stream attenuation both 0 94 for tp both the r2 and nse remain at 0 92 with and without in stream attenuation with instream attenuation included there appears to be collinearity between the stream attenuation parameters and the source yields for both tn forest and tp all land covers and p from sediment for both nutrients removing the stream attenuation term from the models results in a decrease in the source yields for the land covers simulated by sparrow for tn both with and without in stream attenuation it was necessary to add a crop land cover source yield over and beyond the tn loads provided by the spasmo model component to account for higher tn loads from market gardens i e shallow root systems and high fertiliser applications than modelled by spasmo table 8 shows that the rainfall delivery factors have a similar effect on both tn and tp with or without in stream attenuation for tn there is an increase of the subcatchment loads for the diffuse sources estimated by the sparrow model component of 3 per 100 mm increase in mean annual rainfall with in stream attenuation included and 4 without in stream attenuation for tp the corresponding increase with rainfall is 6 both with and without in stream rainfall the tn loads from the sparrow estimated diffuse sources decrease by 27 and 18 with and without in stream attenuation respectively for each increase in drainage class there are no drainage delivery factors calibrated for tp and no temperature delivery factors calibrated for either tn or tp an estimated 72 of the modelled e coli load delivered nationally to streams comes from agricultural sources the relative contributions of the sources modelled in clues to the nutrient loads delivered to the drainage network are given in table 9 for both tn calibrations agricultural sources modelled by the overseer model component contribute the greatest tn loads 68 with in stream attenuation included and 71 without in stream attenuation followed by forest 23 and 22 respectively simulated by the sparrow model component phosphorus from soil sediment i e associated with soil erosion accounted for 58 of the tp delivered loads with in stream attenuation and 56 without in stream attenuation the remaining tp generated loads were almost evenly divided between agricultural loads simulated by overseer and the other land uses land cover class simulated by sparrow the high contaminant yields calibrated for agricultural sources by sparrow are consistent with mcdowell et al 2013 who found that anthropogenic sources of e coli and nutrients far exceed natural sources in new zealand 5 discussion in this section we first identify potential sources of uncertainty within clues and then discuss the implications of the model calibration on the ability of clues to estimate contaminant attenuation at the national scale residual analyses were undertaken to ascertain whether there is any bias in the model with respect to location and catchment characteristics the results are reported in a separate paper semadeni davies et al 2019 while relationships were found these were weak and are unlikely to point to systematic error 5 1 model error and uncertainty modelling environmental systems is challenging and all models are subject to error and uncertainty to some degree grayson et al 1992 beven and alcock 2012 clark et al 2017 for predictive water quality models there can be large uncertainties in estimates of source yields and both modelled and monitored contaminant loads alexander et al 2002b johnes 2007 kronvang et al 2009 birgand et al 2010 bolster and vadas 2013 causse et al 2015 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 certainly the standard errors and probabilities calculated for the model parameters calibrated by sparrow shows that there is significant uncertainty in the model parameterisation particularly with regard to attenuation the potential sources of uncertainty and error are considered below 5 1 1 calibration loads the method used to derive loads for calibration assumes that the monthly grab sample concentrations taken for environmental reporting are representative of the full range of contaminant concentrations at the monitoring sites and cover the full range of flows as evidenced by others this may not be the case birgand et al 2010 moreover the sampling and analytical methods can vary by region meaning that the concentrations may not be comparable from region to region an evaluation of several methods used to derive nutrient loads that also utilized water quality data from the nrwqn snelder et al 2017 found that load estimates are themselves uncertain and that there is no preferred estimation method they note that the uncertainties in load estimates identified cannot be overcome using monthly concentration samples and recommended more frequent sampling uncertainty in the calculation of the calibration loads was mitigated here using a boot strapping technique to assign confidence intervals to the loads and rejecting monitoring sites deemed to have unreliable load estimates 5 1 2 overseer and spasmo components since the outputs of the overseer and spasmo model components were used as input to sparrow the sparrow calibration will incorporate any uncertainties present in those models and may compensate against these both model components have been pre calibrated by their respective developers for use in clues the overseer model estimates around 70 of the tn load and 20 of the tp load delivered to the stream network while sources of uncertainty within the overseer were discussed by shepherd and wheeler 2013 information on the model s calibration or performance has never been released publicly upton 2018 the developers of overseer note that the model s calibration is hampered by the difficulty in accurately measuring farm level nutrient losses which means that there are few data available for calibration and the impossibility of calibrating the model for all geographical settings and farm systems spasmo is a minor component of clues and the estimated contribution of tn from crops and horticulture is around 1 nationally however an extra source yield parameter was required in sparrow to increase the tn loads from the vegetable land cover class this increased the contribution from crops to around 3 nationally spasmo is largely undocumented and the spasmo look up table produced for clues has not been validated 5 1 3 sparrow calibration the high level of uncertainty evident in the calibration results for e coli reflects the difficulty in sampling microbes as the concentrations of microbes from diffuse and point sources are highly variable in time and space muirhead 2015 and die off and attenuation rates vary depending on the river environment an unexpected outcome of the e coli calibration was the aggregation of land cover classes into only three classes pastoral land cover i e stock urban and all other land covers since the upstream proportion of deer farming upstream of the calibration sites is low it is to be expected that the calibration would not be able to discern the signal from deer unless the yield is very different from other farm types it is surprising that the model does not separate dairy farming from sheep and beef farming we have found no published studies making direct farm type comparisons however some work is currently under way in new zealand although only one urban monitoring site was available in the calibration data and despite its high level of uncertainty the urban source yield for e coli was retained due to its special nature and to allow urban mitigation measures to be simulated urban land cover accounts for 2 of the total e coli estimated load delivered to the stream network nationally but urban sources can be a major contributor of microorganisms downstream of urban areas these sources are highly variable in time and space and concentrations can be modified by the type of waste water and stormwater networks concentrations of microorganisms and nutrients can be particularly high in urban waterways downstream of sewer outflow points jalliffier verne et al 2016 riechel et al 2016 for these reasons caution should be exercised when applying clues in catchments that are predominantly urbanised or interpreting model results for reaches immediately downstream of major towns or cities both tn and tp have high uncertainty in their stream attenuation parameters and the models for each nutrient have comparable performance with the stream attenuation terms removed removing the in stream attenuation terms from the nutrient models resulted in a reduction in the sparrow calibrated source yields to maintain the model fit the tn source yields for tussock high country sheep and beef and other land covers had a high degree of uncertainty for both calibrations however these land covers have low calibrated yields and the national coverage is low in comparison to the higher yield pastoral land uses hence their impact on the model outputs are low for tp with the exceptions of water i e atmospheric deposition and urban literature value the land covers simulated by sparrow were amalgamated into a single land cover class as for e coli this simplification was not expected and resulted in only a minimal loss of model performance with a reduction in the model fit r2 from 0 928 with multiple land covers to 0 924 the sparrow software does not currently enable cross validation such methods work by removing a small proportion of the sites and fitting the model with the remaining sites this would allow us to evaluate the error or residuals associated with the removed sites the process would be repeated to determine the residuals associated with all the sites this method has the potential to provide a more reliable estimate of the model residuals because the sites for which the residuals are evaluated do not influence the model fit this would be a suitable area for model extension in the future 5 1 4 model limitations clues is intended for catchment scale modelling and its simplicity means that some processes affect water quality and attenuation are not modelled or occur at spatial or temporal scales not represented by the model for example clues and does not include localised contaminant sources or small scale processes that can affect water quality some of the uncertainty surrounding the source yields could be due to local contaminant sources that are not included in the national application of clues for example nutrient and e coli modelling in waikato semadeni davies et al 2015b a identified several sources in that region that are not simulated by clues these include higher than expected tp loads in areas dominated by peaty soils forsmann and kjaergaard 2014 native microbial populations in water bodies and faecal waste from water fowl living along river banks moriarty et al 2011 release of nitrogen stored in groundwater and nitrogen from geothermal sources gibbs 1987 it is possible that these or similar localised sources are found in other regions the calibration does not consider existing mitigation practices that may reduce contaminant loads in agricultural runoff locally the type effectiveness and level of mitigations varies across the country due to for example regional policy slope and soil erodibility and the type of farming enterprise while we can make guesses as to where interventions have been implemented based on industry reporting and regional policy semadeni davies and elliott 2017 semadeni davies et al 2018 at the regional scale there are no national geospatial datasets to corroborate these other factors that could affect model performance include the following seasonal changes in contaminant delivery e g fertilizer application stock rotation or transport e g flow rates are not captured in the annual load calculations the effects of seasonal differences in sources yields and loads are somewhat mitigated by the rating curve method since in new zealand river low flows are associated with summer drying and high flows with winter rainfall error inherent in the clues model geo database including scaling up or down of input data to the subcatchment level contaminant storage and transport in groundwater are not simulated by the model this could lead to error in nitrogen estimates in particular point sources that are not accounted for or have incorrect load discharge estimates 5 2 attenuation the second objective of this paper was to assess whether clues can be used to estimate catchment losses or attenuation nationally attenuation is calculated as the difference between modelled estimates of contaminant loads delivered to the stream network and loads exported from the catchments the transport and attenuation of contaminants in freshwater bodies is complex and is driven by a suite of in stream physical chemical and biological processes that vary for each of the considered contaminants sheibly et al 2016 for example the amount of nitrogen delivered to the stream network which is largely in dissolved form is highly dependent on whether surface runoff flows via shallow or deep groundwater pathways and the biogeochemical conditions along these pathways and at the land water interface hill 1996 woodward et al 2013 nitrogen transported via groundwater may reflect historical rather than current land cover as the nitrogen is stored and slowly released chen et al 2014 morgenstern et al 2015 anoxic conditions promoting denitrification in groundwaters and or organic rich riparian zones and wetlands e g hill 1996 tanner and sukias 2011 can also affect nitrogen attenuation phosphorus generally has a higher particulate fraction than nitrogen and can be deposited and resuspended with sediment as it is transported downstream sharpley et al 2013 or trapped riparian buffers wetlands ponds and lakes stutter et al 2012 kronvang et al 2015 there is little information either in new zealand or internationally on the losses of e coli from terrestrial diffuse sources at either the farm or catchment scales and the assessment of attenuation or die off is complicated by native populations of e coli in streams muirhead 2015 cho et al 2016 5 2 1 modelled attenuation the estimated amount of attenuation as a proportion of the total annual generated load for the current clues calibration are 52 for e coli 9 for tp with stream attenuation included and 6 without i e lake attenuation only and 26 for tn with stream attenuation included and 5 without the nutrient attenuated losses with stream attenuation included are much less than previously estimated for new zealand 45 for tn and 44 for tp using sparrow elliott et al 2005 although it is equally possible that study overestimated nutrient attenuation for tn with in stream attenuation the percentage loss determined here is in the lower part of the range of 20 80 reported for nutrients internationally while tp attenuation is outside the range preston et al 2011a blicher mathiesen et al 2014 we were unable to find published estimates of e coli attenuation at the catchment scale the calibration results show that clues has reasonable model performance at the catchment scale however there is co linearity between the sparrow calibrated source yields and the stream attenuation parameters for each contaminant given the low attenuation estimates for nutrients this could point to the yields from overseer or spasmo being too low causing sparrow to overestimate its own source yields and to underestimate attenuation alternatively the catchment sparrow catchment delivery factors may not be correct the increase in e coli loads with increasing rainfall and temperature is reasonable increases in annual rainfall could increase the wash off in agricultural runoff of faecal material containing microbes to the stream network either as a result of more intense or more frequent rainfall and increasing temperature will encourage microbial growth both at source and in the drainage network the decrease in e coli loads with improving soil drainage is likely due to more surface runoff from areas with poorly drained soils and filtering in areas with better drained soils mcleod et al 2008 the delivery factors for tn and tp from diffuse sources simulated by sparrow show increasing subcatchment loads with increased rainfall like e coli this is in keeping with increased agricultural wash off the tn drainage delivery factors suggest that tn decreases with improving soil drainage suggesting storage and filtering in soils there is no calibrated drainage delivery factor for tp since this factor had a minimal effect on the model performance neither nutrient has a calibrated temperature delivery factor since temperature had a negligible effect on nutrient loads 5 2 2 input data needs grayson et al 1992 stated that performance of spatially distributed models should not be judged solely on catchment outputs and the validity of each model component should be demonstrated they further state that model development is often not carried out in conjunction with field programmes so that the link with reality is lost with this in mind we concur with recommendation by snelder et al 2016 for more frequent water quality monitoring at soe monitoring sites we also recommend flow monitoring at all soe monitoring sites and the establishment of new sites to increase the number of sites for which loads can be estimated this would reduce the risk of spatial bias in models such as clues by improving coverage across the country and better representing different environmental conditions the lack of monitoring sites in low order streams strahler order three or less is of concern here as the calculation of stream attenuation requires reliable estimates of both loads delivered to the stream network and downstream loads most of the calibration monitoring sites are in low relief areas such as floodplains with a strahler stream order of five or more lower order streams account for 88 of the river reaches in the rec stream network yet only seven tn monitoring sites with suitable data for load calculation are on a low order reach and there are only five low order sites each for tp and e coli there are no selected monitoring sites on headwater or second order streams without evaluating the performance of clues at or close to source and with a lack of information about the performance of the spasmo or overseer model components it is not possible to assess the reliability of the sparrow calibrated source yields and attenuation parameters nor is it possible with the available water quality data to determine the magnitude of actual stream attenuation by comparing measured loads at different monitoring sites sequentially down the drainage network this is an issue that cannot be resolved without improved representation of lower order streams covering the range of land cover types in the calibration such data would be a major undertaking at the national scale but would give confidence that the combination of the three water quality models in clues are giving realistic estimates of source yields and delivered loads we note that source yields used in the mississippi atchafalaya river basin sparrow model build robertson et al 2009 robertson and saad 2013 robertson et al 2014 were calibrated against measured source yields in addition to calibration of in stream loads at multiple sites compared with new zealand rivers that are much shorter and have comparatively fewer monitoring sites allowing a more robust approach to determine stream attenuation even so different iterations of the model resulted in different stream attenuation and catchment delivery parameters 6 conclusions the primary objective of this paper was to present the results of the most recent calibration of the clues model to address the need for transparency in the use of the model for freshwater management the secondary objective was to examine the implications of the calibration results on the estimation of contaminant attenuation in the drainage network the calibration results show that clues gives reasonable load estimates of tn tp and e coli at the catchment scale however there is significant uncertainty in the model parameterisation and the calibration results for all the contaminants point to compensating errors between the stream attenuation parameters and source yields estimated by the sparrow model component removing stream attenuation from the nutrient models resulted in almost the same model fit for tn and tp for this reason the clues calibrations with no instream attenuation have been adopted for the model release the calibration could be extended in the future to include cross validation of the calibration to better evaluate the residuals associated with each calibration site we found that clues cannot currently estimate attenuation increasing the frequency of water quality monitoring and the number of monitoring sites with concurrent flow monitoring could reduce the uncertainty associated with load estimation from water quality data improved representation of lower order streams in the calibration data would allow us to evaluate the source yields from each of the model components against measured loads at or close to source to get a better estimate of contaminant losses this issue has relevance to other water quality models used for catchment planning as they are likely to be similarly hampered by use of non purpose collected data for model calibration declaration of competing interest we have no conflicts of interest to

10799,catchment water quality models are essential for fresh water management however their value is dependent on their performance and level of uncertainty and for this information to be communicated in a transparent and understandable way to key stakeholders here we present the latest calibration of the catchment landuse for environmental sustainability model clues and examine the implications of the calibration for estimating in stream contaminant attenuation clues estimates catchment mean annual loads of total nitrogen total phosphorus and e coli and is widely used in new zealand for both catchment planning and policy development clues contains three freshwater model components derived from existing water quality models two are based on the new zealand overseer and spasmo models and have been pre calibrated for use in clues the third component is based on the usgs sparrow model and its parameters have been calibrated against annual loads estimated from monthly water quality data from catchments across the country we found that clues gives reasonable load estimates at the catchment scale nash sutcliff efficiencies 0 8 for all the contaminants however there was significant uncertainty in the sparrow parameterisation we conclude that while clues can be used to estimate catchment contaminant loads it cannot adequately estimate instream attenuation improved representation of lower order streams in the calibration data would allow us to evaluate the source yields from each of the model components to better estimate attenuation keywords overseer sparrow spasmo annual contaminant loads catchment scale uncertainty 1 introduction there has been ongoing deterioration of water quality in many of new zealand s rural catchments largely as a result of agricultural runoff mcdowell and wilcock 2008 mcdowell and laurenson 2014 in response the national policy statement for freshwater management nps fm new zealand government 2014 has established the national objective framework that requires annual load limits to be set for allowable contaminant discharges to fresh water bodies similar to total maximum daily loads in the united states united states environmental protection agency 1991 setting contaminant limits requires knowledge about the effect of different soils landscapes and flow pathways on the generation conveyance and attenuation of contaminants in agricultural runoff at a range of scales this knowledge is used to establish the magnitude of contaminant sources and losses and to identify the critical contaminant pathways at the enterprise and catchment scale where different land uses management practices and mitigation investments can be most cost effectively targeted predictive water quality models are essential for freshwater management and are available at a range of spatial and temporal scales and levels of complexity shoemaker et al 2005 fu et al 2019 the need for models to support the implementation load limits has been addressed in new zealand by the land and water forum 2012 among others e g voinov and bousquet 2010 the forum notes that community involvement is essential for effective and lasting water management strategies and public acceptance of models used to develop these strategies requires the model performance and level of uncertainty be communicated in an understandable way the fitness for purpose of water quality models used for freshwater management in new zealand was the subject of a recent inquiry by the parliamentary commissioner for the environment upton 2018 this inquiry noted that there is considerable disquiet among farmers who are at the coal face of implementing mitigation measures under the nps fm about the lack of transparency in the performance and uncertainty of these models moreover regional councils have been cautious about imposing limits when they cannot easily explain how these were set to stakeholders affected by them the concerns raised by the commissioner echoes wider calls for quantification of uncertainty in catchment models grayson et al 1992 harmel et al 2014 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 the primary ojective of this paper is to present the most recent calibration of the new zealand catchment land cover for environmental sustainability model clues elliott et al 2016 to address the need for greater model transparency since its initial release in 2006 clues has been applied in new zealand to support catchment planning and both national and regional policy making lilburne et al 2011 hughes et al 2013 parliamentary commissioner for the environment 2014 a secondary objective is to assess how the calibration affects the estimation of instream attenuation since the choice and location of water quality improvement measures will be guided by the amount and location of contaminant sources and losses birgand et al 2010 sheibly et al 2016 the paper illustrates the real world challenges involved in calibrating catchment models and evaluating their performance clues has been calibrated for general use at the national level against mean annual loads estimated from long term monthly sampled water quality data collected from around the country while clues is specific to new zealand the need for reliable water quality models to inform catchment planning and policy is universal moreover clues contains sub routines from the united states geological survey sparrow model spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes smith et al 1997 schwarz et al 2006 which is one of the most cited catchment scale water quality models in the international literature fu et al 2019 we believe that our method of integrating sparrow into clues alongside two local model components could be of interest to others wanting to apply sparrow outside the united states or to couple it to other models 2 clues model framework clues is a steady state catchment scale modelling framework that estimates the annual loads of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp e coli and sediment delivered to and transported by freshwater bodies clues calculation methods have been described in elliott et al 2016 and are summarised here the model is provided free of charge for non commercial use ftp ftp niwa co nz clues as a plugin for esri arcmap 10 6 the ethos behind clues was to provide an easy to apply nationally consistent tool with publicly available data as model inputs that can be used to assess the impacts of land use change and land management on catchment water quality the intended users are researchers and decision makers in research institutes and regional and central government agencies the spatial and temporal scales of clues were chosen to allow rapid model setup and scenario creation the low data requirements and resolution means that clues follows a conceptual empirical approach whereas dynamic physically based models with greater spatial resolution such as the soil water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2009 shetran ewen et al 2000 and the integrated catchment model inca whitehead et al 1998 that have been applied in new zealand cao et al 2006 elliott et al 2012 mallett 2015 require a greater number of model parameters and more intensive calibration clues is provided with a geo database containing all the spatial data required to run the model the surface drainage network is represented by the new zealand river environments classification rec snelder et al 2010 and clues provides model outputs for each of the approximately 600 000 reaches in this network the smallest spatial unit in clues is the rec reach sub catchment which has an average area of around 0 4 km2 diffuse sources are represented by the proportion of each sub catchment covered by each of 17 land cover classes table 1 the land covers are grouped into 14 functional groups for modelling they are provided separately in the geo database to facilitate scenario development there are five farm types represented in the land cover classes dairy sheep and beef lowland intensive hill country and high country and deer other catchment data are aggregated for each sub catchment as either the dominant value i e soil type and drainage or the spatially weighted average determined using the arcmap zonal statistics tool slope climate clues contains three freshwater modelling components based on existing water quality models each component calculates loads generated by a subset of the land cover functional groups as indicated in table 1 in addition to the aforementioned sparrow component the model components have been derived from the new zealand overseer wheeler et al 2006 shepherd and wheeler 2013 wheeler et al 2014 and soil plant atmosphere system model spasmo rosen et al 2004 models the three model components allow clues to take advantage of the strengths of each model and to incorporate physical and conceptual model elements into an empirical model structure the role of each model component is summarised below and the coupling between them is illustrated in fig 1 overseer is a proprietary farm scale nutrient balance model developed by agresearch ltd that is widely used in new zealand for farm management and policy development clues contains a modified version of the latest release of overseer v 6 3 march 2018 that has been upscaled by treating each farm type in a reach subcatchment as a single farm entity the clues overseer component is used to estimate sub catchment tn and tp loads from dairy and lowland intensive and hill country sheep and beef farming these farm types account for around 39 of the country s total area spasmo is a daily model of the plant soil system developed by plant and food ltd the model was run for different combinations soils and rainfalls to create a look up table of aggregated annual yields that is referenced by clues to estimate nitrogen losses from crops and horticulture these land uses account for around 2 of the country s area sparrow uses advanced regression analysis to relate in stream contaminant loads to upstream land cover and catchment characteristics prior to its inclusion in clues sparrow was applied in new zealand nationally and to the waikato river catchment to estimate nutrient sources and losses alexander et al 2002a elliott et al 2005 in the usa sparrow models have been developed for several major river catchments preston et al 2011b such as the mississippi atchafalaya river basin where sparrow was applied to identify the relative importance of nutrient sources and losses in the catchment robertson and saad 2013 robertson et al 2014 clues contains sub routines taken from the sparrow model to estimate tn and tp loads from diffuse sources not covered by the overseer or spasmo models with the exceptions of open water and urban land covers estimate sediment and e coli loads from all diffuse sources estimate surface losses between the diffuse sources modelled by sparrow and the stream network and route contaminant loads delivered to the drainage network downstream considering in stream attenuation and attenuation in lakes and reservoirs 2 1 load estimation the contaminant load generated by each diffuse source or land cover within a subcatchment is calculated as the product of the source area and associated source yield which is the amount per unit area of the contaminant released by the source per year for sources other than urban land covers and open water the source yields are either provided by the spasmo or overseer model components or have been calibrated as model parameters within sparrow the urban tn 0 8 t km2 y and tp 0 08 t km2 y source yields have been assigned literature values williamson 1993 the urban source yield for e coli is calibrated in sparrow atmospheric deposition of tn 0 31 t km2 y and tp 0 20 t km2 y onto water surfaces within a reach sub catchment is calculated as the product of the water surface area and an annual deposition rate derived from literature verberg et al 2018 this source is not simulated for e coli the diffuse loads calculated by sparrow for each subcatchment are multiplied by the catchment delivery factor prior to discharge into the stream network to simulate losses in the surface and soil flow pathways the delivery factor is calculated as an exponential function of soil drainage and the mean annual rainfall and temperature 1 d e l i v e r y f a c t o r e x p a r r 1 85 a d d 4 2 a t t 10 1 where r is the mean annual rainfall m y d is the drainage class and t is the mean annual air temperature c the coefficients 1 85 4 2 and 10 1 are the mean average values across all subcatchments of rainfall drainage class and temperature respectively determined directly from the clues input data the exponents ar ad and at relate to rainfall drainage or temperature respectively and are calibrated drainage class is a dimensionless indicator ranging between 1 poorly drained and 5 well drained and is taken from the land resources information fundamental soils layer newsome 1995 the mean annual temperature and rainfall data have been derived from the niwa virtual climate station network 30 year climate normals 1981 2010 tait et al 2006 the source yields provided by the spasmo and overseer model components vary by reach according to catchment characteristics and have catchment surface losses implicit within them for this reason the delivery factors for these sources are set to zero any loads from point sources located in a subcatchment are added to diffuse loads discharged to the stream network point sources include wastewater treatment plants abattoirs piggeries and pulp and paper mills the source locations and their locations and estimated annual loads have been provided by regional authorities for use in clues tp from sediments is approximated as the product of the clues base sediment loss for the reach and a sediment yield parameter this source is also subject to catchment delivery factors the sediment load used to derive the sediment p is a baseline value taken from the clues model inputs once delivered to the stream network the total loads for each contaminant are routed downstream such that the in stream load for a reach is the total of the upstream load and the reach load less stream and reservoir attenuation for tn and e coli in stream attenuation is modelled for each reach as a first order decay function of stream length with the decay coefficient varying as a power function of flow 2 d s t r e a m 1 e x p k s t r e a m l q k f l o w where k s t r e a m and k f l o w are calibrated parameters l is the length km of the portion of the reach that not in a lake and q is the estimated mean annual flow rate for the reach woods et al 2006 a different approach is used to model in stream attenuation of tp such that 3 d s t r e a m 1 e x p k s t r e a m l where k s t r e a m and l are as defined above the total load from each reach sub catchment discharged to the reach is multiplied by estimated reach attenuation factor while the load routed from upstream reaches is multiplied by the square root of the attenuation factor attenuation in lakes including hydro power reservoirs is applied only to the lake outlet and is a function of the lake area and depth of outflow and is calculated as 4 d r e s r r k r e s where d r e s is the decay factor for the outlet reach of the lake r is the lake or reservoir overflow depth m year for the outlet reach and is a function of the lake surface area and total inflow volumes and k r e s is a calibrated coefficient representing contaminant losses within the reservoir 3 calibration method and data 3 1 methodology clues calibration is undertaken within the usgs sparrow software package sparrow contains non linear regression functions based on catchment and network characteristics that are parameterised by users to represent the generation and transport of each contaminant these functions were calibrated using the same spatial data as held in the clues geo database the outputs of the spasmo and overseer model components of clues were used as inputs to sparrow the resulting sparrow routines and parameters were then copied into the clues model as the sparrow model component the sparrow calibrated parameters are the source yields including tp from sediment and delivery factors for the land covers simulated by sparrow table 1 and the in stream and reservoir decay coefficients for contaminant loads within the drainage network sparrow was last calibrated for e coli in 2014 the tn and tp models were recalibrated for this paper to coincide with the release of overseer version 6 3 which was a significant update to this model clues calibration for sediment was documented in elliott et al 2008 and is not presented here the sparrow calibration procedure is described in the sparrow user s manual schwarz et al 2006 and is summarised here an iterative approach was followed whereby the results of each calibration were evaluated to further optimise the model to obtain the most parsimonious representation e g by aggregating land cover types or removing the delivery and decay terms whilst maintaining the model fit sparrow calibration seeks to minimise the root mean square error rmse calculated for the residuals between the natural log transformed modelled and measured mean annual loads hitherto referred to as calibration loads the calibration loads are estimated from monitored water quality and flow data using the method presented in the next section the calibration uses natural log transformed loads as a means reducing the skew due to the variation in loads from catchments of varying size a local linear approximation to the optimal model and approximate gaussian parametric distribution of residuals are used to determine parameter uncertainty as detailed in schwarz et al 2006 a boot strapping sensitivity analysis is available as part of sparrow calibration that assigns the level of uncertainty for each model parameter however this was not applied for this study because previous studies have demonstrated that the parametric distribution provides a reasonable approximation to the bootstrap distribution e g alexander et al 2002a at lower computational cost the uncertainty analysis returns the standard error t statistic and probability for each parameter the p values relate to the null hypothesis that the respective coefficients are zero and therefore have no impact on the model a p value 0 05 indicates that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis variance inflation factors vif are calculated to determine whether there is collinearity between parameters model fit is also evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 between the natural logs of the measured and modelled loads and the r2 adjusted for the degrees of freedom in the model as well as the r2 between the log transformed modelled and measured yields i e as a means of normalising loads by the upstream catchment area although not automatically calculated by sparrow the nash sutclifffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 has been estimated here for each calibration the nse is commonly used to assess the fit of hydrological models moriasi et al 2007 and is a normalised statistic that indicates how well the plot of the observed against modelled fits the 1 1 line the value ranges from to one a nse of one indicates that the modelled and measured values are the same whereas a nse of zero indicates that the modelled values are only as accurate as the mean of the measured values a value 0 5 indicates that the model performance is satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 a negative nse means that the mean of the measured values is a better predictor than the model 3 2 calibration loads mean annual loads for calibration were estimated from tn tp and e coli monthly concentration data held in the national river water quality network nrwqn that contains state of environment soe water quality sampling undertaken by regional authorities around the country to miminise uncertainty associated with loads estimated from soe data snelder et al 2017 only data from water quality monitoring sites with concurrent continuous flow records and a sampling length of at least five years covering the period january 2006 and december 2010 were selected for calibration this period was chosen at it is considered representative of the clues default land cover reference year nominally 2008 and five years was used to avoid the possibility of trends in the water quality data nationally around 210 monitoring sites meet these minimum criteria however not all of these sites yielded estimated loads of sufficient quality for the calibration as discussed below the measured mean annual loads of each contaminant were estimated for the monitoring sites by fitting a rating curve to the natural log of the monthly concentrations against the natural log of the daily flow rate for the sampling dates fig 2 the estimation was made in the r programming language r core team 2018 using the generalised additive model regression analysis included in the mixed gam computation vehicle mgcv wood 2013a b library for r since the calculations were carried out in log space to account for retransformation bias the mean load was adjusted using the non parametric smearing factor of duan 1983 once fitted the derived curve relationship for each site was applied to the site s daily flow time series over the entire period of the flow record to derive a time series of mean daily concentrations the concentrations were multiplied by the corresponding daily flow volumes to give the estimated daily loads and summed to give the mean annual load the suitability of the rating curve derived loads for model calibration was assessed for each site by generating confidence intervals and standard deviations for the natural log transformed mean annual loads by repeating the rating curve procedure using a boot strapping approach this approach takes random samples of the original water quality data and estimates the natural log transformed mean annual load for each of these a standard deviation greater than 1 signal that the mean annual load calculated for the site is likely to be unrepresentative of actual loads and the site was removed from the calibration data set the proportion of the total annual load associated with flows greater that 95th percentile flow rate was also determined this was done along with a visual inspection of the rating curve to ensure that the sampling covered the range of flows recorded in the flow record the final number of sites for which the estimated mean annual loads were considered reliable for calibration was 141 for tp 183 for tn and 128 for e coli these sites are mapped in fig 3 and the number of monitoring sites selected in each region listed from north to south are given in table 2 along with the regional areas total stream length and stream density the sampling densities i e number of sites by area are provided in parentheses while each region is represented in the calibration data sets some regions have a greater number of monitoring sites or greater sampling density than others the waikato auckland and wellington regions for instance have the highest density by area and stream length of suitable monitoring sites in contrast marlborough west coast tasman nelson and canterbury have the lowest sampling density which is likely due to the lack of monitoring sites generally in mountainous areas upwards of 80 of the monitoring sites are located on streams with a strahler stream order of 5 or more there are none on headwaters or second order streams and only 4 of sites are on third order streams to keep the data record as representative as possible nationally given the general lack of water quality data in new zealand for different environmental characteristics all the available data suitable for load calculation were used for the calibration 4 calibration results the calibration results are given in tables 3 7 and plots of the natural log transformed calibration loads estimated from monitored data against the natural log transformed modelled loads are given in fig 4 the r2 and the nse for e coli are both 0 82 indicating that the linear regression line is close to the 1 1 line table 3 of concern is that the model has only three land cover classes and is insensitive to different farm types the variation inflation factors vifs for the pastoral land cover source yield and the in stream attenuation coefficients indicates that there is co linearity in the model examination of the correlation between the parameters found that there is strong negative correlation 0 8 between the pastoral source yield and the stream decay factor the confidence intervals for stream decay and the lake attenuation parameters as well as the urban and other land cover source yields include zero indicating that these parameters may have no impact on the model results the p values for these parameters are 0 05 indicating significant uncertainty at the 95 level the delivery factors indicate that the e coli load delivered to the stream network from each subcatchment decreases by 37 for every increase in drainage class and increases by 14 for every 100 mm increase in mean annual rainfall and 15 for every degree in mean annual temperature table 8 these factors seem reasonable given filtering in soil mcleod et al 2008 increased wash off with rainfall and survival in warmer temperatures there are two calibrations each for tn tables 4 and 5 and tp tables 6 and 7 with in stream attenuation terms included in the calibration and without the calibration with no in stream attenuation was done due to uncertainty around the attenuation parameters seen in tables 4 and 6 the r2 and nse for tn with in stream attenuation both 0 95 is only slightly greater than with no in stream attenuation both 0 94 for tp both the r2 and nse remain at 0 92 with and without in stream attenuation with instream attenuation included there appears to be collinearity between the stream attenuation parameters and the source yields for both tn forest and tp all land covers and p from sediment for both nutrients removing the stream attenuation term from the models results in a decrease in the source yields for the land covers simulated by sparrow for tn both with and without in stream attenuation it was necessary to add a crop land cover source yield over and beyond the tn loads provided by the spasmo model component to account for higher tn loads from market gardens i e shallow root systems and high fertiliser applications than modelled by spasmo table 8 shows that the rainfall delivery factors have a similar effect on both tn and tp with or without in stream attenuation for tn there is an increase of the subcatchment loads for the diffuse sources estimated by the sparrow model component of 3 per 100 mm increase in mean annual rainfall with in stream attenuation included and 4 without in stream attenuation for tp the corresponding increase with rainfall is 6 both with and without in stream rainfall the tn loads from the sparrow estimated diffuse sources decrease by 27 and 18 with and without in stream attenuation respectively for each increase in drainage class there are no drainage delivery factors calibrated for tp and no temperature delivery factors calibrated for either tn or tp an estimated 72 of the modelled e coli load delivered nationally to streams comes from agricultural sources the relative contributions of the sources modelled in clues to the nutrient loads delivered to the drainage network are given in table 9 for both tn calibrations agricultural sources modelled by the overseer model component contribute the greatest tn loads 68 with in stream attenuation included and 71 without in stream attenuation followed by forest 23 and 22 respectively simulated by the sparrow model component phosphorus from soil sediment i e associated with soil erosion accounted for 58 of the tp delivered loads with in stream attenuation and 56 without in stream attenuation the remaining tp generated loads were almost evenly divided between agricultural loads simulated by overseer and the other land uses land cover class simulated by sparrow the high contaminant yields calibrated for agricultural sources by sparrow are consistent with mcdowell et al 2013 who found that anthropogenic sources of e coli and nutrients far exceed natural sources in new zealand 5 discussion in this section we first identify potential sources of uncertainty within clues and then discuss the implications of the model calibration on the ability of clues to estimate contaminant attenuation at the national scale residual analyses were undertaken to ascertain whether there is any bias in the model with respect to location and catchment characteristics the results are reported in a separate paper semadeni davies et al 2019 while relationships were found these were weak and are unlikely to point to systematic error 5 1 model error and uncertainty modelling environmental systems is challenging and all models are subject to error and uncertainty to some degree grayson et al 1992 beven and alcock 2012 clark et al 2017 for predictive water quality models there can be large uncertainties in estimates of source yields and both modelled and monitored contaminant loads alexander et al 2002b johnes 2007 kronvang et al 2009 birgand et al 2010 bolster and vadas 2013 causse et al 2015 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 certainly the standard errors and probabilities calculated for the model parameters calibrated by sparrow shows that there is significant uncertainty in the model parameterisation particularly with regard to attenuation the potential sources of uncertainty and error are considered below 5 1 1 calibration loads the method used to derive loads for calibration assumes that the monthly grab sample concentrations taken for environmental reporting are representative of the full range of contaminant concentrations at the monitoring sites and cover the full range of flows as evidenced by others this may not be the case birgand et al 2010 moreover the sampling and analytical methods can vary by region meaning that the concentrations may not be comparable from region to region an evaluation of several methods used to derive nutrient loads that also utilized water quality data from the nrwqn snelder et al 2017 found that load estimates are themselves uncertain and that there is no preferred estimation method they note that the uncertainties in load estimates identified cannot be overcome using monthly concentration samples and recommended more frequent sampling uncertainty in the calculation of the calibration loads was mitigated here using a boot strapping technique to assign confidence intervals to the loads and rejecting monitoring sites deemed to have unreliable load estimates 5 1 2 overseer and spasmo components since the outputs of the overseer and spasmo model components were used as input to sparrow the sparrow calibration will incorporate any uncertainties present in those models and may compensate against these both model components have been pre calibrated by their respective developers for use in clues the overseer model estimates around 70 of the tn load and 20 of the tp load delivered to the stream network while sources of uncertainty within the overseer were discussed by shepherd and wheeler 2013 information on the model s calibration or performance has never been released publicly upton 2018 the developers of overseer note that the model s calibration is hampered by the difficulty in accurately measuring farm level nutrient losses which means that there are few data available for calibration and the impossibility of calibrating the model for all geographical settings and farm systems spasmo is a minor component of clues and the estimated contribution of tn from crops and horticulture is around 1 nationally however an extra source yield parameter was required in sparrow to increase the tn loads from the vegetable land cover class this increased the contribution from crops to around 3 nationally spasmo is largely undocumented and the spasmo look up table produced for clues has not been validated 5 1 3 sparrow calibration the high level of uncertainty evident in the calibration results for e coli reflects the difficulty in sampling microbes as the concentrations of microbes from diffuse and point sources are highly variable in time and space muirhead 2015 and die off and attenuation rates vary depending on the river environment an unexpected outcome of the e coli calibration was the aggregation of land cover classes into only three classes pastoral land cover i e stock urban and all other land covers since the upstream proportion of deer farming upstream of the calibration sites is low it is to be expected that the calibration would not be able to discern the signal from deer unless the yield is very different from other farm types it is surprising that the model does not separate dairy farming from sheep and beef farming we have found no published studies making direct farm type comparisons however some work is currently under way in new zealand although only one urban monitoring site was available in the calibration data and despite its high level of uncertainty the urban source yield for e coli was retained due to its special nature and to allow urban mitigation measures to be simulated urban land cover accounts for 2 of the total e coli estimated load delivered to the stream network nationally but urban sources can be a major contributor of microorganisms downstream of urban areas these sources are highly variable in time and space and concentrations can be modified by the type of waste water and stormwater networks concentrations of microorganisms and nutrients can be particularly high in urban waterways downstream of sewer outflow points jalliffier verne et al 2016 riechel et al 2016 for these reasons caution should be exercised when applying clues in catchments that are predominantly urbanised or interpreting model results for reaches immediately downstream of major towns or cities both tn and tp have high uncertainty in their stream attenuation parameters and the models for each nutrient have comparable performance with the stream attenuation terms removed removing the in stream attenuation terms from the nutrient models resulted in a reduction in the sparrow calibrated source yields to maintain the model fit the tn source yields for tussock high country sheep and beef and other land covers had a high degree of uncertainty for both calibrations however these land covers have low calibrated yields and the national coverage is low in comparison to the higher yield pastoral land uses hence their impact on the model outputs are low for tp with the exceptions of water i e atmospheric deposition and urban literature value the land covers simulated by sparrow were amalgamated into a single land cover class as for e coli this simplification was not expected and resulted in only a minimal loss of model performance with a reduction in the model fit r2 from 0 928 with multiple land covers to 0 924 the sparrow software does not currently enable cross validation such methods work by removing a small proportion of the sites and fitting the model with the remaining sites this would allow us to evaluate the error or residuals associated with the removed sites the process would be repeated to determine the residuals associated with all the sites this method has the potential to provide a more reliable estimate of the model residuals because the sites for which the residuals are evaluated do not influence the model fit this would be a suitable area for model extension in the future 5 1 4 model limitations clues is intended for catchment scale modelling and its simplicity means that some processes affect water quality and attenuation are not modelled or occur at spatial or temporal scales not represented by the model for example clues and does not include localised contaminant sources or small scale processes that can affect water quality some of the uncertainty surrounding the source yields could be due to local contaminant sources that are not included in the national application of clues for example nutrient and e coli modelling in waikato semadeni davies et al 2015b a identified several sources in that region that are not simulated by clues these include higher than expected tp loads in areas dominated by peaty soils forsmann and kjaergaard 2014 native microbial populations in water bodies and faecal waste from water fowl living along river banks moriarty et al 2011 release of nitrogen stored in groundwater and nitrogen from geothermal sources gibbs 1987 it is possible that these or similar localised sources are found in other regions the calibration does not consider existing mitigation practices that may reduce contaminant loads in agricultural runoff locally the type effectiveness and level of mitigations varies across the country due to for example regional policy slope and soil erodibility and the type of farming enterprise while we can make guesses as to where interventions have been implemented based on industry reporting and regional policy semadeni davies and elliott 2017 semadeni davies et al 2018 at the regional scale there are no national geospatial datasets to corroborate these other factors that could affect model performance include the following seasonal changes in contaminant delivery e g fertilizer application stock rotation or transport e g flow rates are not captured in the annual load calculations the effects of seasonal differences in sources yields and loads are somewhat mitigated by the rating curve method since in new zealand river low flows are associated with summer drying and high flows with winter rainfall error inherent in the clues model geo database including scaling up or down of input data to the subcatchment level contaminant storage and transport in groundwater are not simulated by the model this could lead to error in nitrogen estimates in particular point sources that are not accounted for or have incorrect load discharge estimates 5 2 attenuation the second objective of this paper was to assess whether clues can be used to estimate catchment losses or attenuation nationally attenuation is calculated as the difference between modelled estimates of contaminant loads delivered to the stream network and loads exported from the catchments the transport and attenuation of contaminants in freshwater bodies is complex and is driven by a suite of in stream physical chemical and biological processes that vary for each of the considered contaminants sheibly et al 2016 for example the amount of nitrogen delivered to the stream network which is largely in dissolved form is highly dependent on whether surface runoff flows via shallow or deep groundwater pathways and the biogeochemical conditions along these pathways and at the land water interface hill 1996 woodward et al 2013 nitrogen transported via groundwater may reflect historical rather than current land cover as the nitrogen is stored and slowly released chen et al 2014 morgenstern et al 2015 anoxic conditions promoting denitrification in groundwaters and or organic rich riparian zones and wetlands e g hill 1996 tanner and sukias 2011 can also affect nitrogen attenuation phosphorus generally has a higher particulate fraction than nitrogen and can be deposited and resuspended with sediment as it is transported downstream sharpley et al 2013 or trapped riparian buffers wetlands ponds and lakes stutter et al 2012 kronvang et al 2015 there is little information either in new zealand or internationally on the losses of e coli from terrestrial diffuse sources at either the farm or catchment scales and the assessment of attenuation or die off is complicated by native populations of e coli in streams muirhead 2015 cho et al 2016 5 2 1 modelled attenuation the estimated amount of attenuation as a proportion of the total annual generated load for the current clues calibration are 52 for e coli 9 for tp with stream attenuation included and 6 without i e lake attenuation only and 26 for tn with stream attenuation included and 5 without the nutrient attenuated losses with stream attenuation included are much less than previously estimated for new zealand 45 for tn and 44 for tp using sparrow elliott et al 2005 although it is equally possible that study overestimated nutrient attenuation for tn with in stream attenuation the percentage loss determined here is in the lower part of the range of 20 80 reported for nutrients internationally while tp attenuation is outside the range preston et al 2011a blicher mathiesen et al 2014 we were unable to find published estimates of e coli attenuation at the catchment scale the calibration results show that clues has reasonable model performance at the catchment scale however there is co linearity between the sparrow calibrated source yields and the stream attenuation parameters for each contaminant given the low attenuation estimates for nutrients this could point to the yields from overseer or spasmo being too low causing sparrow to overestimate its own source yields and to underestimate attenuation alternatively the catchment sparrow catchment delivery factors may not be correct the increase in e coli loads with increasing rainfall and temperature is reasonable increases in annual rainfall could increase the wash off in agricultural runoff of faecal material containing microbes to the stream network either as a result of more intense or more frequent rainfall and increasing temperature will encourage microbial growth both at source and in the drainage network the decrease in e coli loads with improving soil drainage is likely due to more surface runoff from areas with poorly drained soils and filtering in areas with better drained soils mcleod et al 2008 the delivery factors for tn and tp from diffuse sources simulated by sparrow show increasing subcatchment loads with increased rainfall like e coli this is in keeping with increased agricultural wash off the tn drainage delivery factors suggest that tn decreases with improving soil drainage suggesting storage and filtering in soils there is no calibrated drainage delivery factor for tp since this factor had a minimal effect on the model performance neither nutrient has a calibrated temperature delivery factor since temperature had a negligible effect on nutrient loads 5 2 2 input data needs grayson et al 1992 stated that performance of spatially distributed models should not be judged solely on catchment outputs and the validity of each model component should be demonstrated they further state that model development is often not carried out in conjunction with field programmes so that the link with reality is lost with this in mind we concur with recommendation by snelder et al 2016 for more frequent water quality monitoring at soe monitoring sites we also recommend flow monitoring at all soe monitoring sites and the establishment of new sites to increase the number of sites for which loads can be estimated this would reduce the risk of spatial bias in models such as clues by improving coverage across the country and better representing different environmental conditions the lack of monitoring sites in low order streams strahler order three or less is of concern here as the calculation of stream attenuation requires reliable estimates of both loads delivered to the stream network and downstream loads most of the calibration monitoring sites are in low relief areas such as floodplains with a strahler stream order of five or more lower order streams account for 88 of the river reaches in the rec stream network yet only seven tn monitoring sites with suitable data for load calculation are on a low order reach and there are only five low order sites each for tp and e coli there are no selected monitoring sites on headwater or second order streams without evaluating the performance of clues at or close to source and with a lack of information about the performance of the spasmo or overseer model components it is not possible to assess the reliability of the sparrow calibrated source yields and attenuation parameters nor is it possible with the available water quality data to determine the magnitude of actual stream attenuation by comparing measured loads at different monitoring sites sequentially down the drainage network this is an issue that cannot be resolved without improved representation of lower order streams covering the range of land cover types in the calibration such data would be a major undertaking at the national scale but would give confidence that the combination of the three water quality models in clues are giving realistic estimates of source yields and delivered loads we note that source yields used in the mississippi atchafalaya river basin sparrow model build robertson et al 2009 robertson and saad 2013 robertson et al 2014 were calibrated against measured source yields in addition to calibration of in stream loads at multiple sites compared with new zealand rivers that are much shorter and have comparatively fewer monitoring sites allowing a more robust approach to determine stream attenuation even so different iterations of the model resulted in different stream attenuation and catchment delivery parameters 6 conclusions the primary objective of this paper was to present the results of the most recent calibration of the clues model to address the need for transparency in the use of the model for freshwater management the secondary objective was to examine the implications of the calibration results on the estimation of contaminant attenuation in the drainage network the calibration results show that clues gives reasonable load estimates of tn tp and e coli at the catchment scale however there is significant uncertainty in the model parameterisation and the calibration results for all the contaminants point to compensating errors between the stream attenuation parameters and source yields estimated by the sparrow model component removing stream attenuation from the nutrient models resulted in almost the same model fit for tn and tp for this reason the clues calibrations with no instream attenuation have been adopted for the model release the calibration could be extended in the future to include cross validation of the calibration to better evaluate the residuals associated with each calibration site we found that clues cannot currently estimate attenuation increasing the frequency of water quality monitoring and the number of monitoring sites with concurrent flow monitoring could reduce the uncertainty associated with load estimation from water quality data improved representation of lower order streams in the calibration data would allow us to evaluate the source yields from each of the model components against measured loads at or close to source to get a better estimate of contaminant losses this issue has relevance to other water quality models used for catchment planning as they are likely to be similarly hampered by use of non purpose collected data for model calibration declaration of competing interest we have no conflicts of interest to
