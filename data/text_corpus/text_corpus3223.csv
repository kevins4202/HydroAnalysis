16115,the hierarchical three dimensional 3d micro nanostructures of diatoms make them a promising biomaterial for fabricating nanomaterials producing bioactive pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals and removing micropollutants for diatom production in a continuous flow system little is known how bioreactor operating parameters especially solids retention time srt affect the 3d structures of diatoms this study demonstrated that tunable diatom micro nanostructures could be produced by varying the srt of membrane bioreactors mbrs a diatom strain stephanodiscus hantzschii was cultivated in two identical mbrs with a fixed hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and staged srts from 5 to 10 and to 20 d as srts increased from 5 to 20 d important characteristics of diatom micro nanostructures showed linear decreases the diameters of foramina on the areola layer decreased from 170 10 to 130 12 nm the numbers of nanopores per cribrum layer decreased from 20 3 to 12 2 and the specific surface areas of the diatoms decreased from 36 01 1 27 to 12 67 2 45 m2 g 1 however the average diatom heights increased from 2 9 0 3 to 3 9 0 4 µm while diatom cell diameter 5 µm and nanopore size 20 nm remained unchanged the silicon content of diatoms also linearly increased with srt the decrease in diatom porosity and increase in silicon content were probably due to the reduced diatom growth rates likely resulting in less pores at increasing srts which also facilitated silica deposition as the overall diatom population stayed longer in the mbrs as the srts increased from 5 to 10 and to 20 d the nitrate no3 removal efficiency decreased from 75 to 70 and to 60 respectively whereas phosphorus p removal efficiency increased from 74 to 80 and to 90 respectively the opposite trends in efficiencies were because no3 n was removed by cellular uptake and biomass waste whereas p was mainly removed through diatom assisted chemical precipitation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

2015 de tommasi et al 2017 hopkinson et al 2011 muhamad et al 2019 wang et al 2019 we have demonstrated that diatoms can selectively and effectively remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps from water in the presence of natural organic matter li et al 2021 diatom cell wall is a highly ordered three dimensional 3d nano porous silica shell called frustule gordon et al 2009 kröger 2007 each diatom species forms a unique 3d frustule with a specific porous hierarchical architecture de tommasi et al 2017 escobar morales and hernández becerril 2015 kröger and poulsen 2008 losic et al 2006a therefore diatom frustules are ideal templates for fabricating novel nanomaterials and nanodevices gordon et al 2009 korsunsky et al 2020 kröger and poulsen 2008 although manipulating the micro nanostructures of frustules to render them specific features is necessary existing methods for controlling and tailoring diatom 3d micro nanostructures have limitations and disadvantages for instance genetic engineering is a powerful tool tailoring frustule structures de tommasi et al 2017 kröger 2007 lopez et al 2005 rogato and de tommasi 2020 however the genes that control frustule structures are not fully understood and genetic manipulation of diatoms is complex and could create side effects changing the chemical compositions of the culture media such as salinity nutrient level and ph is a simple approach altering diatom micro nanostructures hervé et al 2012 hildebrand et al 2006 leterme et al 2010 qin et al 2008 townley et al 2007 trobajo et al 2004 trobajo et al 2011 vrieling et al 1999 zhang et al 2012 a lower salinity decreases diatom pore size specific surface area and fractal dimensions but increases diatom biosilica density vrieling et al 2007 the denser diatom biosilica could be because of the aggregation of smaller coalescing silica particles inside the silica deposition vesicle at lower salinities however diatoms grow in a narrow salinity range and changing salinity to tailor their 3d structures has limited applications kröger 2007 light wavelength also alters the 3d micro nanostructures of diatoms hansen et al 2011 javaheri et al 2015 su et al 2017 2018 villareal and fryxell 1983 for instance the diameters of frustules and foramina for diatoms cultivated under green light 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 were significantly smaller than those cultivated under white light 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 su et al 2015 the lower frustule and foramen diameters were because colored light at the low light intensity significantly decreased the specific diatom growth rates however colored light is unavailable or costly for large scale outdoor cultivation systems therefore it is preferred to have an easy to handle and effective procedure for producing diatoms with defined micro nanostructures that can be applied to continuous cultivation systems cultivating algae including diatoms in wastewater treatment bioreactors not only produces frustules as valuable biomaterials but also removes and recovers nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus feng et al 2021 zamalloa et al 2012 algal membrane bioreactors mbrs also referred to as membrane photobioreactors are an ideal system to cultivate diatoms with improved microalgal biomass productivity compared to traditional continuous stirred tank and plug flow reactors feng et al 2021 li et al 2021 nguyen et al 2020 tang and hu 2016 xu et al 2015 while it is easy to control solids retention time srt is the most important operating parameter controlling the growth of diatoms in continuous flow systems grady et al 2011 iorhemen et al 2016 rittmann and mccarty 2020 which may affect the formation and structure of diatom frustules currently little is known how srt affects the 3d micro nanostructures of diatom frustules in continuous cultivation systems this study aimed to determine the effect of srt on the morphology and micro nanostructures of diatoms in a well controlled continuous growth system using mbr it was hypothesized that the diatoms become less porous with lower numbers of nanopores as srt increases because the increase in srt decreases the average specific cell growth rate grady et al 2011 rittmann and mccarty 2020 slowly growing diatom cells with a longer doubling time may slow down the process of pore formation and development kroger and poulsen 2008 martin jezequel et al 2000 we cultivated the diatoms in mbrs to assess how staged srts 5 to 10 and to 20 d would affect diatom 3d micro nanostructures frustule silicon content and nutrient removal from wastewater this study sheds light on how to produce desired diatom 3d micro nanostructures in continuous cultivation systems e g mbrs through srt control 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr set up and operation two identical pyrex glass mbrs were operated in parallel at staged srts as duplicates each mbr had a total volume of 2 1 l length width height 0 14 m 0 09 m 0 16 m and an effective working volume of 1 7 l each mbr had a hollow fiber membrane module polyvinylidene fluoride pore size 20 nm effective filtration area 0 062 m2 submerged in the center the membrane modules were fabricated in house via a phase inversion method yin et al 2013 a peristaltic pump cole parmer vernon hills illinois usa was used to feed the mbr the mixed liquor volume in each mbr was maintained constant by an effluent permeate peristaltic pump that was controlled by a sensor sensing upper and lower water levels cole parmer inside the mbr liang and hu 2012 zhang et al 2014a the permeate pump was operated intermittently with a target permeate flux of approximately 10 l m 2 h 1 the on and off durations of the permeate pump were both around 25 min transmembrane pressure tmp was recorded daily using a digital pressure gauge cole parmer for membrane fouling monitoring continuous aeration was provided at 1 5 l min 1 for membrane fouling control weekly physical cleaning was performed by rinsing the membrane module with tap water for 30 min monthly chemical cleaning was conducted to further alleviate membrane fouling by submerging the module in a 50 mg l 1 sodium hypochlorite solution for 12 h and subsequently rinsing the modules with tap water feng et al 2021 hu et al 2015 zhang et al 2014b each mbr was inoculated with a pure stephanodiscus hantzschii strain canadian phycological culture centre waterloo ontario canada at an initial concentration of 160 mg biomass cod l 1 the diatoms in the mbr were fed with a chu 10 culture medium containing mg l 1 in deionized water final concentrations na2sio3 9h2o 58 00

7 l d 1 to fix the hydraulic retention time hrt at 24 h diatoms were grown under cool white fluorescent light 12 h light 12 h dark cycles striking from the top of the mbrs surface area for each mbr exposed to the light 0 013 m2 distance from the fluorescent tubes to diatom culture surface approximately 30 cm the light intensity was approximately 30 μmol photons m 2 s 1 equivalent to 6 54 w m 2 as the optimal light intensity for diatom growth ranges from 20 to 50 μmol photons m 2 s 1 suggested by the canadian phycological culture centre li et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 the diatom culture in each mbr was continuously mixed using a magnetic bar at approximately 300 rpm daily maintenance of mbrs was conducted to ensure minimal diatom biomass attached on the glass at the fixed hrt of 24 h staged srts of 5 10 and 20 d were maintained in the mbrs for 28 d day 0 to day 28 50 d day 28 to day 78 and 80 d day 78 to day 158 respectively the target srt was controlled by wasting diatom biomass from each mbr daily according to the garrett wasting strategy grady et al 2011 a constant water temperature 19 1 c was maintained in the mbrs to improve diatom growth by circulating refrigerated tap water around the mbr diatom cultures were withdrawn for various analyses when the mbrs reached a steady state as evidenced by constant biomass concentration and effluent water quality after at least three srts of operation for each stage 2 2 determination of the diatom micro nanostructures and specific surface area aliquots 5 ml of diatom culture were taken from the mbrs operated at the srts of 5 10 and 20 d on days 20 65 and 146 respectively the samples were centrifuged at 4 000 g for 3 min at room temperature the cell pellet was rinsed three times with deionized water before microscopic characterization diatom 3d micro nanostructures e g morphology cell size and pore size were determined using fei scios dualbeam focused ion beam fib scanning electron microscopy sem fei company hillsboro oregon usa at the electron microscopy core facility of the university of missouri briefly the washed diatom cells were deposited onto silicon holders dried at room temperature and imaged at an accelerating electric potential difference of 5 kev and a beam current of 25 pa other than rinsing of the diatom cells with deionized water no further treatment was taken before the sem imaging to preserve their pristine 3d micro nanostructures for sem imaging three diatom culture samples were prepared for each srt one drop specimen of diatom culture from each sample was screened to determine the morphology and size of diatom cells twenty diatom cells were randomly selected from each specimen each selected cell was scanned for cell size cell morphology and pore size because a diatom cell contained more than 100 foramina on the top valve i e the areola layer approximately 40 foramina were randomly selected to determine foramen size because each foramen contained approximately 20 nanopores a total of 80 nanopores were randomly selected from each diatom cell to measure nanopore size the specific surface area and total pore volume of the diatom frustules were determined using an sa 3100 brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analyzer beckman coulter indianapolis indiana usa following an established protocol li et al 2021 briefly diatom culture from the mbrs was freeze dried at 50 c for 48 h the dry biomass was outgassed in a bet sample tube at 50 c for 10 h nitrogen gas adsorption and desorption were then conducted the specific surface area was calculated using the bet equation and the pore size distribution was determined by the bjh barrett joyner and halenda method bardestani et al 2019 hayati ashtiani 2011 li et al 2021 2 3 experimental and theoretical determination of diatom si content for diatom si content measurement biomass concentration was first measured in mixed liquor suspended solids mlss according to the standard methods apha 2017 the dry diatom biomass after the mlss measurement was dissolved in 0 2 m sodium hydroxide incubated at 100 c for 40 min and cooled naturally to room temperature the biomass suspension was neutralized with 1 m hcl and filtered with 0 45 μm pore size filters ragueneau et al 2005 the si concentration in the filtrate was measured with a model 210 vgp atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas buck scientific inc norwalk connecticut usa at a wavelength of 251 8 nm and a slit of 2 å the limit of detection of si in the neutralized solution was 10 μg si l 1 all measurements were triplicate the measured si

diatom biomass and wastewater quality analysis diatom biomass concentration was measured in mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss units according to the standard methods apha 2017

new york usa was used for repeated measures analysis of variance anova an extension of the dependent t test with a bonferroni post hoc test the repeated measures anova rather than a one way anova was used because the 3d micro nanostructures of the same diatom strain i e related not different or independent groups were measured more than once on the same dependent variable i e srt the significance level is 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 tunable diatom micro nanostructures with increasing srt tunable diatom micro nanostructures were observed when the srts increased consecutively from 5 to 10 and to 20 d fig 1 and table 1 specifically the foramen diameter and number of nanopores per foremen decreased significantly when srts increased from 5 to 10 d p 0 001 and from 10 to 20 d p 0 001 as srts increased from 5 to 10 d the foramen diameter specific surface area and total pore volume decreased by 5 9 14 5 and 7 7 respectively by simply comparing the results from srt of 5 d the foramen diameter specific surface area and total pore volume at the srt of 20 d decreased by 18 8 58 8 and 15 5 respectively strong correlations exist between foramen diameter and srt between specific surface area and srt and between total pore volume and srt fig s1 when the srt ratio i e srt10 srt5 and srt20 srt5 increased by a factor of 2 from 2 to 4 the proportional decreases in foramen diameter specific surface area and total pore volume increased by factors of 3 4 and 2 respectively the decrease in diatom porosity when srt increased was further supported by the diatom nanopore size distribution curves fig 2 taken together the diatom cells became less porous as srt increased the change in foramen diameter total pore volume and the specific surface of diatoms were approximately inversely proportional to srt meanwhile the nanopore size and diatom diameter were relatively stable regardless of srt change table 1 the sizes of nanopores which are formed by thin silica branches or cribella romann et al 2015 on the cribrum layer of diatom cells were comparable at different srts p 0 6 all at approximately 20 nm table 1 the diatom heights increased from 2 9 to 3 2 µm p 0 001 and from 3 2 to 3 9 µm p 0 001 when srts increased from 5 to 10 d and from 10 to 20 d respectively the decrease in diatom porosity number of nanopores per foremen and total pore volume per gram of diatom biomass with increasing srt was possibly a response of the diatoms to the decrease in the average specific growth rate as a result of the increase in srt grady et al 2011 rittmann and mccarty 2020 the hierarchical micro nanostructures and mechanical strength of diatom frustules are optimized throughout billions of years of evolution for photosynthesis particle sorting nutrition uptake and protection or defense against bacterial viral attacks predator grazing ultraviolet light exposure and other environmental stress aguirre et al 2018 de tommasi et al 2017 hamm et al 2003 lopez et al 2005 romann et al 2015 the maximum specific growth rates of diatoms range from 0 19 to 0 71 d 1 bleiker and schanz 1997 kim et al 2018 montagnes and franklin 2001 the average maximum specific growth rate of s hantzschii cultivated in the current study was approximately 0 31 d 1 shorter srts e g 5 d require faster diatom growth to adapt to a living environment with shorter srts diatoms need to have a higher nanopore density a greater specific surface area and a lower diffusive boundary layer thickness for improved nutrient uptake or flux marchetti and cassar 2009 therefore when srt increased the diatom porosity decreased furthermore such an effect on diatom porosity was more pronounced when srts increased from 10 to 20 d than from 5 to 10 d table 1 future studies need to explore the underlying mechanisms of diatom pore formation and porosity change with a broader range of srts the diatom diameter was not generally affected by srt because i during diatom cell division each parental valve becomes an epitheca of each of the two daughter cells and ii the parental valve size was fixed at approximately 5 μm throughout the mbr operation the cribrum layer where nanopores are located and the associated cribellum structures are responsible for nutrient uptake and preventing attacks from bacteria and viruses jantschke et al 2014 losic et al 2006b losic et al 2007 panwar and dutta 2019 since the diameter of virus range from 20 to 300 nm and that of bacteria is greater than 200 nm madigan et al 2014 sleytr 1981 the nanopores of diatoms are a natural barrier that blocks viruses and bacteria from accessing while allows nutrients as well as metabolic degradation products to freely pass through losic et al 2009 the barrier function of the nanopores could explain why diatoms maintained a constant nanopore size approximately 20 nm regardless of srt change the increase in diatom height with srt could also be explained well with the diatom cell growth pattern diatom cell division is unique because diatom cell wall consists of two parts i e two valves the epitheca and hypotheca during cell division each parental valve becomes an epitheca of each of the two daughter cells a new smaller hypothecal valve is formed within the parent cell to fit inside the epitheca each existing parent valve sumper and krger 2004 at short srts with high cell division rates diatom cells may have limited time to elongate before producing daughter cells bowler et al 2010 resulting in shorter daughter cells by contrast long srts result in slow cell division so that the cells have sufficient time to elongate generating longer daughter cells 3 2 frustule si content and effluent si concentration both increased with srt in a qualitative analysis the eds intensity of si in diatom frustules increased with srt fig 3 indeed elemental analysis confirmed that the si content in diatom cells had a significant positive linear correlation with srt fig 4 as was predicted from a si based mass balance analysis in the mbr using eq 1 text s1 the fact that measured si contents were lower than the predicted ones was presumably due to biomass loss e g in filtration during sample preparation at low biomass concentrations nevertheless the si content measurement results show consistency with predicted ones diatoms use si to silicify cell wall to form frustules previous studies also found that in non si limiting i e si rich environments diatom cell growth rate and cell wall silicification are negatively correlated martin jézéquel et al 2000 pančić et al 2019 in the current study the influent i e chu 10 medium of the mbrs had a high si level of 6 13 mg si l 1 fig 5 i e a si rich condition kang et al 2005 li et al 2021 as expected the diatom cells would be more porous with a lower si content at shorter srts because diatoms grow and divide faster at shorter srts resulting in the cells having less time to silicify their frustules interestingly because srts negatively affected foreman diameters table 1 the diatom si content and foreman diameter had a significant negative correlation fig 6 suggesting that the si content may be foreman size dependent as srts increased from 5 to 10 d and further to 20 d the effluent si concentration generally increased while the overall si removal efficiency by the mbrs decreased fig 5 this result was generally consistent with that of effluent nitrate profile as described below indicating that both si and nitrate are removed from the mbrs mainly through cellular uptake longer srts require less amount of diatom biomass wasting or diatom biomass production and thus are less efficient in si uptake resulting in higher effluent si concentrations 3 3 diatom biomass concentration mixed liquor ph and nutrient removal efficiency at increasing srt within each mbr operation stage i e srt of 5 10 or 20 d diatom biomass concentration became constant after three srts of operation fig 7 a indicating a steady state of the mbrs at the fixed hrt of 24 h diatom biomass concentration should increase proportionally with srt from biochemical process modeling grady et al 2011 rittmann and mccarty 2020 the measured average diatom concentrations at the srts of 5 10 and 20 d were 70 5 137 4 and 202 8 mg mlvss l 1 respectively generally consistent with the predicted results fig 7a such low diatom biomass concentrtaions were attributed to the low specific growth rate of diatoms at the light intensity around 30 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the specific growth rate of s hantzschii in the current study at 19 c 0 21 0 03 d 1 was much lower than those of green algae e g 0 79 0 14 d 1 tang et al 2014 the low diatom biomass concentration could be also related to cultivation temperature 19 1 c as the optimal growth temperature of s hantzschii is around 10 c jung et al 2011 the ph of the mixed liquor in the mbrs increased with srt fig 7b the increase was because more dissolved carbon dioxide was consumed at higher diatom biomass concentrations fig 7a tang et al 2018 consequently the effluent po4 3 p concentration decreased as srt increased fig 7c because algae facilitated chemical phosphorus precipitation along with the ph increase is diatom concentration dependent as we reported xu et al 2014 at the average influent p concentration of 2 mg l 1 the p removal efficiencies at the strs of 5 10 and 20 d were approximately 74 80 and 90 respectively for comparison at the average influent no3 n concentration of 7 mg l 1 the nitrogen removal efficiencies at the srts of 5 10 and 20 d were 75 70 and 60 respectively unlike phosphorus the effluent no3 n concentration increased with srt because nitrogen removal solely depends on diatom cellular uptake and biomass waste fig 7d while the cellular nitrogen content did not change significantly when srt increased from 5 to 20 d fig 3 with less biomass wasted at longer srts and lower biomass concentrations than predicted by mathematical modeling possibly due to light attenuation at higher biomass concentrations at the srt of 20 d no3 n removal efficiency decreased see more information in text s2 with explanation as to why the effluent no3 n concentration increased with srt 3 4 implications and applications of producing diatoms with tunable 3d micro nanostructures in continuous cultivation systems this work demonstrated that diatom nanopore size remained unchanged whereas the foramen diameter number of nanopore per foramen total pore volume and the porosity decreased in an ordered manner at increasing srt table 1 diatoms maintained a constant nanopore size for nutrient uptake and photosynthesis while preventing the attacks of viruses and bacteria overall controlling srt is an effective means in continuous cultivation systems e g mbrs to produce diatoms with tunable hierarchical 3d micro nanostructures tailoring the hierarchical micro nanostructures of diatoms through altering the srt of mbrs could be scaled up in large scale outdoor cultivation systems for commercial frustule production the generated frustules at different srts would have distinct 3d micro nanostructures for different applications for instance diatoms cultivated at a shorter srt would have a greater porosity and thus are a promising template for fabricating photocatalysts to selectively remove ppcps from water in the presence of natural organic matter li et al 2021 frustules with a lower porosity because of longer srts have improved mechanical strength and increased water damage resistance pavlíková et al 2021 in additional to srt hrt is an important parameter that may affect the micro nanostructures of diatoms decreasing the hrt of mbrs will increase nutrient flow rate in the bioreactors the turbulence of mixed liquor and possibly mass transfer via diffusion inside the foramina and valve pores of diatoms leading to an increase in nutrient and silicon uptake future studies along with biochemical process modeling are needed to explore how hrt and the ratio of srt to hrt affect the tunable micro nanostructures of diatoms other factors and operating parameters such as influent si concentration and light intensity may also control the 3d micro nanostructures of diatoms and should be investigated in future work this study used chu 10 medium to cultivate the diatoms future work is needed to explore the growth of diatoms in real wastewater in mbrs where other important wastewater constituents such as color turbidity coliforms can be monitored and evaluated 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that srt as the most important operating parameter of mbrs can control the tunable 3d micro nanostructures of a diatom strain s hantzschii when srts increased from 5 to 10 d and further to 20 d the diatom cells became less porous with linear decreases in foramen diameter number of nanopores per cribrum layer and specific surface area although the nanopore size remained unchanged at approximately 20 nm in addition the si content of the diatom cells linearly increased with srt both si and no3 n are important nutrients for diatom growth their removal in the mbrs were through cellular uptake and biomass waste si and no3 n removal efficiencies decreased as srt increased for comparison po4 3 p removal efficiency increased with srt because it was mainly removed through diatom assisted chemical

16115,the hierarchical three dimensional 3d micro nanostructures of diatoms make them a promising biomaterial for fabricating nanomaterials producing bioactive pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals and removing micropollutants for diatom production in a continuous flow system little is known how bioreactor operating parameters especially solids retention time srt affect the 3d structures of diatoms this study demonstrated that tunable diatom micro nanostructures could be produced by varying the srt of membrane bioreactors mbrs a diatom strain stephanodiscus hantzschii was cultivated in two identical mbrs with a fixed hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and staged srts from 5 to 10 and to 20 d as srts increased from 5 to 20 d important characteristics of diatom micro nanostructures showed linear decreases the diameters of foramina on the areola layer decreased from 170 10 to 130 12 nm the numbers of nanopores per cribrum layer decreased from 20 3 to 12 2 and the specific surface areas of the diatoms decreased from 36 01 1 27 to 12 67 2 45 m2 g 1 however the average diatom heights increased from 2 9 0 3 to 3 9 0 4 µm while diatom cell diameter 5 µm and nanopore size 20 nm remained unchanged the silicon content of diatoms also linearly increased with srt the decrease in diatom porosity and increase in silicon content were probably due to the reduced diatom growth rates likely resulting in less pores at increasing srts which also facilitated silica deposition as the overall diatom population stayed longer in the mbrs as the srts increased from 5 to 10 and to 20 d the nitrate no3 removal efficiency decreased from 75 to 70 and to 60 respectively whereas phosphorus p removal efficiency increased from 74 to 80 and to 90 respectively the opposite trends in efficiencies were because no3 n was removed by cellular uptake and biomass waste whereas p was mainly removed through diatom assisted chemical precipitation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

al 2006a therefore diatom frustules are ideal templates for fabricating novel nanomaterials and nanodevices gordon et al 2009 korsunsky et al 2020 kröger and poulsen 2008 although manipulating the micro nanostructures of frustules to render them specific features is necessary existing methods for controlling and tailoring diatom 3d micro nanostructures have limitations and disadvantages for instance genetic engineering is a powerful tool tailoring frustule structures de tommasi et al 2017 kröger 2007 lopez et al 2005 rogato and de tommasi 2020 however the genes that control frustule structures are not fully understood and genetic manipulation of diatoms is complex and could create side effects changing the chemical compositions of the culture media such as salinity nutrient level and ph is a simple approach altering diatom micro nanostructures hervé et al 2012 hildebrand et al 2006 leterme et al 2010 qin et al 2008 townley et al 2007 trobajo et al 2004 trobajo et al 2011 vrieling et al 1999 zhang et al 2012 a lower salinity decreases diatom pore size specific surface area and fractal dimensions but increases diatom biosilica density vrieling et al 2007 the denser diatom biosilica could be because of the aggregation of smaller coalescing silica particles inside the silica deposition vesicle at lower salinities however diatoms grow in a narrow salinity range and changing salinity to tailor their 3d structures has limited applications kröger 2007 light wavelength also alters the 3d micro nanostructures of diatoms hansen et al 2011 javaheri et al 2015 su et al 2017 2018 villareal and fryxell 1983 for instance the diameters of frustules and foramina for diatoms cultivated under green light 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 were significantly smaller than those cultivated under white light 100 μmol photons m 2 s 1 su et al 2015 the lower frustule and foramen diameters were because colored light at the low light intensity significantly decreased the specific diatom growth rates however colored light is unavailable or costly for large scale outdoor cultivation systems therefore it is preferred to have an easy to handle and effective procedure for producing diatoms with defined micro nanostructures that can be applied to continuous cultivation systems cultivating algae including diatoms in wastewater treatment bioreactors not only produces frustules as valuable biomaterials but also removes and recovers nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus feng et al 2021 zamalloa et al 2012 algal membrane bioreactors mbrs also referred to as membrane photobioreactors are an ideal system to cultivate diatoms with improved microalgal biomass productivity compared to traditional continuous stirred tank and plug flow reactors feng et al 2021 li et al 2021 nguyen et al 2020 tang and hu 2016 xu et al 2015 while it is easy to control solids retention time srt is the most important operating parameter controlling the growth of diatoms in continuous flow systems grady et al 2011 iorhemen et al 2016 rittmann and mccarty 2020 which may affect the formation and structure of diatom frustules currently little is known how srt affects the 3d micro nanostructures of diatom frustules in continuous cultivation systems this study aimed to determine the effect of srt on the morphology and micro nanostructures of diatoms in a well controlled continuous growth system using mbr it was hypothesized that the diatoms become less porous with lower numbers of nanopores as srt increases because the increase in srt decreases the average specific cell growth rate grady et al 2011 rittmann and mccarty 2020 slowly growing diatom cells with a longer doubling time may slow down the process of pore formation and development kroger and poulsen 2008 martin jezequel et al 2000 we cultivated the diatoms in mbrs to assess how staged srts 5 to 10 and to 20 d would affect diatom 3d micro nanostructures frustule silicon content and nutrient removal from wastewater this study sheds light on how to produce desired diatom 3d micro nanostructures in continuous cultivation systems e g mbrs through srt control 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr set up and operation two identical

had a hollow fiber membrane module polyvinylidene fluoride pore size 20 nm effective filtration area 0 062 m2 submerged in the center the membrane modules were fabricated in house via a phase inversion method yin et al 2013 a peristaltic pump cole parmer vernon hills illinois usa was used to feed the mbr the mixed liquor volume in each mbr was maintained constant by an effluent permeate peristaltic pump that was controlled by a sensor sensing upper and lower water levels cole parmer inside the mbr liang and hu 2012 zhang et al 2014a the permeate pump was operated intermittently with a target permeate flux of approximately 10 l m 2 h 1 the on and off durations of the permeate pump were both around 25 min transmembrane pressure tmp was recorded daily using a digital pressure gauge cole parmer for membrane fouling monitoring continuous aeration was provided at 1 5 l min 1 for membrane fouling control weekly physical cleaning was performed by rinsing the membrane module with tap water for 30 min monthly chemical cleaning was conducted to further alleviate membrane fouling by submerging the module in a 50 mg l 1 sodium hypochlorite solution for 12 h and subsequently rinsing the modules with tap water feng et al 2021 hu et al 2015 zhang et al 2014b each mbr was inoculated with a pure stephanodiscus hantzschii strain canadian phycological culture centre waterloo ontario

7 l d 1 to fix the hydraulic retention time hrt at 24 h diatoms were grown under cool white fluorescent light 12 h light 12 h dark cycles striking from the top of the mbrs surface area for each mbr exposed to the light 0 013 m2 distance from the fluorescent tubes to diatom culture surface approximately 30 cm the light intensity was approximately 30 μmol photons m 2 s 1 equivalent to 6 54 w m 2 as the optimal light intensity for diatom growth ranges from 20 to 50 μmol photons m 2 s 1 suggested by the canadian phycological culture centre li et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 the diatom culture in each mbr was continuously mixed using a magnetic bar at approximately 300 rpm daily maintenance of mbrs was conducted to ensure minimal diatom biomass attached on the glass at the fixed hrt of 24 h staged srts of 5 10 and 20 d were maintained in the mbrs for 28 d day 0 to day 28 50 d day 28 to day 78 and 80 d day 78 to day 158 respectively the target srt was controlled by wasting diatom biomass from each mbr daily according to the garrett wasting strategy grady et al 2011 a constant water temperature 19 1 c was maintained in the mbrs to improve diatom growth by circulating refrigerated tap water around the mbr diatom cultures were withdrawn for various analyses when the mbrs reached a steady state as evidenced by constant biomass concentration and effluent water quality after at least three srts of operation for each stage 2 2 determination of the diatom micro nanostructures and specific surface area aliquots 5 ml of diatom culture were taken from the mbrs operated at the srts of 5 10 and 20 d on days 20 65 and 146 respectively the samples were centrifuged at 4 000 g for 3 min at room temperature the cell pellet was rinsed three times with deionized water before microscopic characterization diatom 3d micro nanostructures e g morphology cell size and pore size were determined using fei scios dualbeam focused ion beam fib scanning electron microscopy sem fei company hillsboro oregon usa at the electron microscopy core facility of the university of missouri briefly the washed diatom cells were deposited onto silicon holders dried at room temperature and imaged at an accelerating electric potential difference of 5 kev and a beam current of 25 pa other than rinsing of the diatom cells with deionized water no further treatment was taken before the sem imaging to preserve their pristine 3d micro nanostructures for sem imaging three diatom culture samples were prepared for each srt one drop specimen of diatom culture from each sample was screened to determine the morphology and size of diatom cells twenty diatom cells were randomly selected from each specimen each selected cell was scanned for cell size cell morphology and pore size because a diatom cell contained more than 100 foramina on the top valve i e the areola layer approximately 40 foramina were randomly selected to determine foramen size because each foramen contained approximately 20 nanopores a total of 80 nanopores were randomly selected from each diatom cell to measure nanopore size the specific surface area and total pore volume of the diatom frustules were determined using an sa 3100 brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analyzer beckman coulter indianapolis indiana usa following an established protocol li et al 2021 briefly diatom culture from the mbrs was freeze dried at 50 c for 48 h the dry biomass was outgassed in a bet sample tube at 50 c for 10 h nitrogen gas adsorption and desorption were then conducted the specific surface area was calculated using the bet equation and the pore size distribution was determined by the bjh barrett joyner and halenda method bardestani et al 2019 hayati ashtiani 2011 li et al 2021 2 3 experimental and theoretical determination of diatom si content for diatom si content measurement biomass concentration was first measured in mixed liquor suspended solids mlss according to the standard methods apha 2017 the dry diatom biomass after the mlss measurement was dissolved in 0 2 m sodium hydroxide incubated at 100 c for 40 min and cooled naturally to room temperature the biomass suspension was neutralized with 1 m hcl and filtered with 0 45 μm pore size filters ragueneau et al 2005 the si concentration in the filtrate was measured with a model 210 vgp atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas buck scientific inc norwalk connecticut usa at a wavelength of 251 8 nm and a slit of 2 å the limit of detection of si in the neutralized solution was 10 μg si l 1 all measurements were triplicate the measured si

diatom biomass and wastewater quality analysis diatom biomass concentration was measured in mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss units according to the standard methods apha 2017

new york usa was used for repeated measures analysis of variance anova an extension of the dependent t test with a bonferroni post hoc test the repeated measures anova rather than a one way anova was used because the 3d micro nanostructures of the same diatom strain i e related not different or independent groups were measured more than once on the same dependent variable i e srt the significance level is 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 tunable diatom micro nanostructures with increasing srt tunable diatom micro nanostructures were observed when the srts increased consecutively from 5 to 10 and to 20 d fig 1 and table 1 specifically the foramen diameter and number of nanopores per foremen decreased significantly when srts increased from 5 to 10 d p 0 001 and from 10 to 20 d p 0 001 as srts increased from 5 to 10 d the foramen diameter specific surface area and total pore volume decreased by 5 9 14 5 and 7 7 respectively by simply comparing the results from srt of 5 d the foramen diameter specific surface area and total pore volume at the srt of 20 d decreased by 18 8 58 8 and 15 5 respectively strong correlations exist between foramen diameter and srt between specific surface area and srt and between total pore volume and srt fig s1 when the srt ratio i e srt10 srt5 and srt20 srt5 increased by a factor of 2 from 2 to 4 the proportional decreases in foramen diameter specific surface area and total pore volume increased by factors of 3 4 and 2 respectively the decrease in diatom porosity when srt increased was further supported by the diatom nanopore size distribution curves fig 2 taken together the diatom cells became less porous as srt increased the change in foramen diameter total pore volume and the specific surface of diatoms were approximately inversely proportional to srt meanwhile the nanopore size and diatom diameter were relatively stable regardless of srt change table 1 the sizes of nanopores which are formed by thin silica branches or cribella romann et al 2015 on the cribrum layer of diatom cells were comparable at different srts p 0 6 all at approximately 20 nm table 1 the diatom heights increased from 2 9 to 3 2 µm p 0 001 and from 3 2 to 3 9 µm p 0 001 when srts increased from 5 to 10 d and from 10 to 20 d respectively the decrease in diatom porosity number of nanopores per foremen and total pore volume per gram of diatom biomass with increasing srt was possibly a response of the diatoms to the decrease in the average specific growth rate as a result of the increase in srt grady et al 2011 rittmann and mccarty 2020 the hierarchical micro nanostructures and mechanical strength of diatom frustules are optimized throughout billions of years of evolution for photosynthesis particle sorting nutrition uptake and protection or defense against bacterial viral attacks predator grazing ultraviolet light exposure and other environmental stress aguirre et al 2018 de tommasi et al 2017 hamm et al 2003 lopez et al 2005 romann et al 2015 the maximum specific growth rates of diatoms range from 0 19 to 0 71 d 1 bleiker and schanz 1997 kim et al 2018 montagnes and franklin 2001 the average maximum specific growth rate of s hantzschii cultivated in the current study was approximately 0 31 d 1 shorter srts e g 5 d require faster diatom growth to adapt to a living environment with shorter srts diatoms need to have a higher nanopore density a greater specific surface area and a lower diffusive boundary layer thickness for improved nutrient uptake or flux marchetti and cassar 2009 therefore when srt increased the diatom porosity decreased furthermore such an effect on diatom porosity was more pronounced when srts increased from 10 to 20 d than from 5 to 10 d table 1 future studies need to explore the underlying mechanisms of diatom pore formation and porosity change with a broader range of srts the diatom diameter was not generally affected by srt because i during diatom cell division each parental valve becomes an epitheca of each of the two daughter cells and ii the parental valve size was fixed at approximately 5 μm throughout the mbr operation the cribrum layer where nanopores are located and the associated cribellum structures are responsible for nutrient uptake and preventing attacks from bacteria and viruses jantschke et al 2014 losic et al 2006b losic et al 2007 panwar and dutta 2019 since the diameter of virus range from 20 to 300 nm and that of bacteria is greater than 200 nm madigan et al 2014 sleytr 1981 the nanopores of diatoms are a natural barrier that blocks viruses and bacteria from accessing while allows nutrients as well as metabolic degradation products to freely pass through losic et al 2009 the barrier function of the nanopores could explain why diatoms maintained a constant nanopore size approximately 20 nm regardless of srt change the increase in diatom height with srt could also be explained well with the diatom cell growth pattern diatom cell division is unique because diatom cell wall consists of two parts i e two valves the epitheca and hypotheca during cell division each parental valve becomes an epitheca of each of the two daughter cells a new smaller hypothecal valve is formed within the parent cell to fit inside the epitheca each existing parent valve sumper and krger 2004 at short srts with high cell division rates diatom cells may have limited time to elongate before producing daughter cells bowler et al 2010 resulting in shorter daughter cells by contrast long srts result in slow cell division so that the cells have sufficient time to elongate generating longer daughter cells 3 2 frustule si content and effluent si concentration both increased with srt in a qualitative analysis the eds intensity of si in diatom frustules increased with srt fig 3 indeed elemental analysis confirmed that the si content in diatom cells had a significant positive linear correlation with srt fig 4 as was predicted from a si based mass balance analysis in the mbr using eq 1 text s1 the fact that measured si contents were lower than the predicted ones was presumably due to biomass loss e g in filtration during sample preparation at low biomass concentrations nevertheless the si content measurement results show consistency with predicted ones diatoms use si to silicify cell wall to form frustules previous studies also found that in non si limiting i e si rich environments diatom cell growth rate and cell wall silicification are negatively correlated martin jézéquel et al 2000 pančić et al 2019 in the current study the influent i e chu 10 medium of the mbrs had a high si level of 6 13 mg si l 1 fig 5 i e a si rich condition kang et al 2005 li et al 2021 as expected the diatom cells would be more porous with a lower si content at shorter srts because diatoms grow and divide faster at shorter srts resulting in the cells having less time to silicify their frustules interestingly because srts negatively affected foreman diameters table 1 the diatom si content and foreman diameter had a significant negative correlation fig 6 suggesting that the si content may be foreman size dependent as srts increased from 5 to 10 d and further to 20 d the effluent si concentration generally increased while the overall si removal efficiency by the mbrs decreased fig 5 this result was generally consistent with that of effluent nitrate profile as described below indicating that both si and nitrate are removed from the mbrs mainly through cellular uptake longer srts require less amount of diatom biomass wasting or diatom biomass production and thus are less efficient in si uptake resulting in higher effluent si concentrations 3 3 diatom biomass concentration mixed liquor ph and nutrient removal efficiency at increasing srt within each mbr operation stage i e srt of 5 10 or 20 d diatom biomass concentration became constant after three srts of operation fig 7 a indicating a steady state of the mbrs at the fixed hrt of 24 h diatom biomass concentration should increase proportionally with srt from biochemical process modeling grady et al 2011 rittmann and mccarty 2020 the measured average diatom concentrations at the srts of 5 10 and 20 d were 70 5 137 4 and 202 8 mg mlvss l 1 respectively generally consistent with the predicted results fig 7a such low diatom biomass concentrtaions were attributed to the low specific growth rate of diatoms at the light intensity around 30 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the specific growth rate of s hantzschii in the current study at 19 c 0 21 0 03 d 1 was much lower than those of green algae e g 0 79 0 14 d 1 tang et al 2014 the low diatom biomass concentration could be also related to cultivation temperature 19 1 c as the optimal growth temperature of s hantzschii is around 10 c jung et al 2011 the ph of the mixed liquor in the mbrs increased with srt fig 7b the increase was because more dissolved carbon dioxide was consumed at higher diatom biomass concentrations fig 7a tang et al 2018 consequently the effluent po4 3 p concentration decreased as srt increased fig 7c because algae facilitated chemical phosphorus precipitation along with the ph increase is diatom concentration dependent as we reported xu et al 2014 at the average influent p concentration of 2 mg l 1 the p removal efficiencies at the strs of 5 10 and 20 d were approximately 74 80 and 90 respectively for comparison at the average influent no3 n concentration of 7 mg l 1 the nitrogen removal efficiencies at the srts of 5 10 and 20 d were 75 70 and 60 respectively unlike phosphorus the effluent no3 n concentration increased with srt because nitrogen removal solely depends on diatom cellular uptake and biomass waste fig 7d while the cellular nitrogen content did not change significantly when srt increased from 5 to 20 d fig 3 with less biomass wasted at longer srts and lower biomass concentrations than predicted by mathematical modeling possibly due to light attenuation at higher biomass concentrations at the srt of 20 d no3 n removal efficiency decreased see more information in text s2 with explanation as to why the effluent no3 n concentration increased with srt 3 4 implications and applications of producing diatoms with tunable 3d micro nanostructures in continuous cultivation systems this work demonstrated that diatom nanopore size remained unchanged whereas the foramen diameter number of nanopore per foramen total pore volume and the porosity decreased in an ordered manner at increasing srt table 1 diatoms maintained a constant nanopore size for nutrient uptake and photosynthesis while preventing the attacks of viruses and bacteria overall controlling srt is an effective means in continuous cultivation systems e g mbrs to produce diatoms with tunable hierarchical 3d micro nanostructures tailoring the hierarchical micro nanostructures of diatoms through altering the srt of mbrs could be scaled up in large scale outdoor cultivation systems for commercial frustule production the generated frustules at different srts would have distinct 3d micro nanostructures for different applications for instance diatoms cultivated at a shorter srt would have a greater porosity and thus are a promising template for fabricating photocatalysts to selectively remove ppcps from water in the presence of natural organic matter li et al 2021 frustules with a lower porosity because of longer srts have improved mechanical strength and increased water damage resistance pavlíková et al 2021 in additional to srt hrt is an important parameter that may affect the micro nanostructures of diatoms decreasing the hrt of mbrs will increase nutrient flow rate in the bioreactors the turbulence of mixed liquor and possibly mass transfer via diffusion inside the foramina and valve pores of diatoms leading to an increase in nutrient and silicon uptake future studies along with biochemical process modeling are needed to explore how hrt and the ratio of srt to hrt affect the tunable micro nanostructures of diatoms other factors and operating parameters such as influent si concentration and light intensity may also control the 3d micro nanostructures of diatoms and should be investigated in future work this study used chu 10 medium to cultivate the diatoms future work is needed to explore the growth of diatoms in real wastewater in mbrs where other important wastewater constituents such as color turbidity coliforms can be monitored and evaluated 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that srt as the most important operating parameter of mbrs can control the tunable 3d micro nanostructures of a diatom strain s hantzschii when srts increased from 5 to 10 d and further to 20 d the diatom cells became less porous with linear decreases in foramen diameter number of nanopores per cribrum layer and specific surface area although the nanopore size remained unchanged at approximately 20 nm in addition the si content of the diatom cells linearly increased with srt both si and no3 n are important nutrients for diatom growth their removal in the mbrs were through cellular uptake and biomass waste si and no3 n removal efficiencies decreased as srt increased for comparison po4 3 p removal efficiency increased with srt because it was mainly removed through diatom assisted chemical

16116,carbon based materials activated peracetic acid paa to repair groundwater is an environmentally friendly and low cost technology to overcome secondary pollution problems in this study thermally modified activated carbon ac600 was applied to activate paa to degrade sulfamethoxazole smx and the effect of groundwater ph chloride ion cl bicarbonate hco3 sulfate ion so4 2 and natural organic

smx removal the excellent performance in smx removal was achieved at 50 mg l ac600 and 0 26 mm paa the removal of smx was well described by second order kinetic with the rate constant kobs of 10 79 m 1s 1 both much greater than the removal constants of paa alone 0 034 m 1s 1 and ac600 alone 1 774 m 1s 1 r o ch3c o oo ch3c o o and electron transfer process were proved to be responsible for the removal of smx while ho and 1o2 made little to no contribution to the novel paa ac600 system which differs from typical advanced oxidation processes the smx can be removed effectively over a wide ph range 3 9 exhibiting a remarkable ph tolerant performance sulfate ion so4 2 dissolved oxygen do nom displayed negligible influence on the smx removal bicarbonate hco3 exerted an inhibitory effect on smx abatement while chloride ion cl promoted the removal of smx this showed excellent anti interference capacity and satisfactory decontamination performance under actual groundwater conditions furthermore the degradation pathways of smx were proposed there was no obvious difference in the acute toxicity of the mixed products during the degradation process it will facilitate further research of metal free catalyst paa system as a new strategy for groundwater in situ remediation technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid thermally modified activated carbon antibiotics groundwater remediation mechanisms 1 introduction groundwater contamination is a global challenge due to rapid industrialization and population growth antibiotics as emerging pollutants in groundwater have been widely detected at the concentration level of ng l μg l at present and sulfa antibiotics have a higher concentration and are more common in groundwater huang et al 2020 zainab et al 2020 reported antibiotics concentrations in groundwater worldwide ranged from 0 01 to above 10 000 ng l groundwater is an essential source of drinking water accounting for 30 of the world s freshwater resources chloe 2018 currently practical approaches for groundwater antibiotics include persulfate ps systems which often cause secondary pollution problems such as the production of sulfate ions therefore it is imperative to develop environment friendly technologies to remediate antibiotic contaminated groundwater in situ paa as an emerging oxidant is widely used for disinfection in wastewater treatment plants luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 which indicates the potential of paa to degrade micropollutants paa can be activated by various methods such as ultraviolet uv light ao et al 2021b cai et al 2017 photocatalytic material like tio2 zhang et al 2021a transition metal ions kim et al 2019 li et al 2021 wang et al 2020b wang et al 2020c zhang et al 2022 thermal energy wang et al 2020a co ii doped g c3n4 liu et al 2021 and activated carbon fibers acfs zhou et al 2015a and generate reactive oxygen species such as free radicals and non radicals which will be beneficial for the elimination of emerging contaminants nevertheless uv irradiation and thermal activation of paa are considered energy intensive and are limited when applied in environmental restoration projects while transition metal ions may cause secondary pollution although the performance of carbon materials is excellent hu et al 2019 there is only one related study that has reported the degradation of dyes by activated fiber activation of paa so far zhou et al 2015a therefore an adaptable environmentally friendly economical and low energy paa activation method to remove organic micropollutants from groundwater urgently needs to be developed we developed a carbon material paa process system for removing antibiotics in low polluting groundwater based on previous research zhou et al 2015a in this study sulfamethoxazole smx a typical and prevalent antibiotic in groundwater was selected as the target compound and ac600 was prepared from commercial activated carbon ac through a thermally modified process to activate paa for oxidative degradation of smx this material was prepared for the first time in this study without atomic doping and metal loading and there is no report on activated carbon activating paa degrading emerging organic pollutants firstly the possible mechanism of paa activation by ac600 was studied secondly the main reactive species that cause smx destruction in paa ac600 system was identified including free radicals and non radical generation pathways then the impacts of groundwater ph do chloride ion cl bicarbonate hco3 sulfate ion so4 2 and natural organic matter nom on smx degradation via paa activated by ac600 was studied the removal of smx in spiked real groundwater samples was also explored finally the acute toxic effects of the degradation intermediates of smx in the system were evaluated smx was almost completely removed under the action of low dose paa 0 24 mm and the overall toxicity is significantly weakened during the degradation process in addition the system has strong resistance to groundwater matrix interference this research is novel because it provides an environmentally friendly economic and efficient catalyst for activating paa to remediate groundwater this study will provide new insights into the low impact groundwater pollution remediation with low concentration organic pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals paa 15 w w paa and 20w w h2o2 in acetic acid and water solution and smx 98 were obtained from aladdin co ltd shanghai china commercial ac was purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china other chemicals and reagents are shown in text s1 s designates text tables figures in the supplemental information here and thereafter the actual concentration of paa is 15 w w measured by titration before the experiment because paa is easy to decompose titration method for paa was described in text s2 2 2 real groundwater samples the groundwater samples were collected from a site in pudong shanghai samples were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters and then were further stored at 4 c and analyzed within 24 h the characteristics of the groundwater samples are provided in table s1 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 thermal modification and characterization of activated carbon the commercial ac was thermally modified to improve its activation ability due to the ac activating paa to degrade smx poorly in the pretest fig s1 the commercial ac was first pyrolyzed in a tube furnace for 1 h under an n2 flow at a temperature from 500 c to 900 c at an increase of 100 c and the thermally modified activated carbon was labeled as ac500 to ac900 the n2 adsorption performance of carbon materials can largely reflect the activation reaction performance of the material li et al 2014 sun et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 so the n2 adsorption isotherms of ac500 to ac900 were studied as shown in fig s3 and table s2 the ability of activated carbon to adsorb n2 gradually increased with the increase in temperature but there was no obvious improvement when the temperature was higher than 600 c thus comprehensively comparing material performance and energy consumption ac600 was used for the follow up research to further explore the source of the excellent performance of ac600 and infer its activation mechanism for paa a detailed characterization

and degradation experiments with 0 2 mm paa and 20 mg l ac600 to confirm that the paa ac600 system can effectively remove smx at low concentration to further confirm the existence and contribution of ch3c o oo and ch3c o o in the paa ac600 system naproxen nap was also used as another pollutant in this system to compare with the results of the degradation of smx all samples taken at predetermined time intervals in the experiment were filtered through a 0 22 μm millipore filter then the smx concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc in particular all samples for degradation experiments were quenched by excess na2s2o3 immediately after sampling the experiment on the effect of groundwater matrix and ph value on the removal is the same as that of the degradation experiment except for the addition of humic acid anion acid and alkali solutions to simulate the groundwater conditions 1 m naoh and 1 m hno3 were used to adjust solution ph and the changes in ph after the reaction were less than 1 in all experiments the same degradation experimental procedure was conducted to investigate the removal of smx by paa in the spiked real groundwater samples for the

calculation details can be found in text s3 the acute toxicity of smx and its degradation intermediates were also evaluated by ecosar 2 0 u s environmental protection agency details can be found in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ac600 the ac600 in this study was prepared by thermal modification 600 c which has a simple fabrication process and low cost and no secondary pollution compared with atomic doping and metal loading methods an and xiao 2020 xing et al 2020 the structure and morphology of ac600 indicated the microporous structure that has developed abundantly fig 1 a which was also confirmed by n2 sorption analysis both ac and ac600 n2 adsorption and desorption curves have hysteresis loops which belong to the iv adsorption isotherm indicating the existence of mesopores in activated carbon it also can be seen in fig s3 that micropores 0 2 nm also exist in ac600 in addition to mesopores the commercial ac and ac600 possess a surface area of 651 06 m² g and 704 98 m² g with a pore volume of 0 44 cm³ g and 0 47 cm³ g respectively the average pore size of commercial ac is 2 68 nm while ac600 is 2 69 nm the result of the bet experiment indicated that the modified activated carbon with 600 c increases the surface area significantly compared to commercial ac without significantly changing the pore size and volume fig 1 d which can enhance the capacity of pre adsorption to pollutants for ac600 fig 1 b illustrated the ac600 layered structure with a pitch of 0 28 nm which showed a good correlation with the graphite 0 25 nm duan et al 2018 sun et al 2020 yun et al 2018 zhou et al 2015a this strongly shows the increase in the orderliness of activated carbon material formed by the strong π π interaction of the stacked graphite layers in the aromatic clusters the strong π π interaction between the aromatic ring of smx and ac600 also contributes to the adsorption capacity of ac600 zhu et al 2018 moreover a typical d band of ac600 is detected at 1350 cm 1 denotes the disorder degree and defects meanwhile the g band detected at 1575 cm 1 corresponds well to the graphite layer sp2 hybridized which is derived from the stretching vibration of the in plane bond of the graphite crystal the integrated intensity ratio of the d band versus g band is used to evaluate the degree of graphitization and integrity of carbon materials the d band and g band of ac600 were located around 1341 cm 1 and 1593 cm 1 and the estimated id ig value is 2 351 fig 1 c this indicates the defect degree of the carbon material is high enhances the high catalytic capacity of ac600 cheng et al 2016 furthermore the g and d bands reveal an overlap without an obvious separation which is a typical characteristic of disordered activated carbon yang et al 2017 defects such as structural surface and vacancies are considered the reason for improving catalytic activity xiao et al 2020 the characterization results showed that the surface area of ac600 increased after thermal activation and the material is defective which is conducive to paa activation the oxygen functional groups are also considered the active sites on the carbon surface sun et al 2020 the presence of carbonyl groups c o on the surface of carbon materials acted as an important oxygen containing basic functional group that produces 1o2 and has a strong degradation ability on electron rich organic the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of ac600 before and after the reaction were semi quantitatively as described from xps analysis the composition and relative amounts of the oxygen containing functional groups on ac600 can be obtained through the deconvolution of the o1s spectra yumak 2021 fig 2 shows the deconvoluted peak of c o at the binding energy be of 531 4 ev and the carbon oxygen single bond c o with the be of 532 5 533 4 and 534 2 ev according to the previous studies c o was considered to be the active site for activating ps to produce 1o2 and the ratio of c o to c o was chosen as one of the indicators of the catalytic activity for paa activation shao et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 a the ratio of the c o to c o groups is 0 406 before the oxidation reaction while the ratio became 0 466 after the reaction fig 2 b these xps results showed that the surface of ac600 is rich in oxygen containing functional groups especially for the c o and the proportion of c o increased after the reaction this is mainly due to the c o and other surfaces oxygen containing functional groups which have different degrees of loss about half after the reaction as indicated in the deconvolution of the o1s spectra yumak 2021 this also indirectly proves that the carbon materials surface functional groups participate in the catalytic oxidation reaction 3 2 adsorption performance of ac600 to explore the adsorption performance of the heterogeneous material ac600 smx was selected as the target pollutant in the ac600 alone system the removal of smx is also apparent reaching 72 at 60 minutes fig 3 the experimental data of adsorption isotherm can be well fitted by the freundlich model r2 0 9939 table s4 and fig s4 this suggests that the adsorption of smx on ac600 is heterogeneous due to the coexistence of different adsorption sites or different adsorption mechanisms the surface of ac600 has a local adsorption phenomenon because the adsorption conforms to the freundlich model consistent with the sem results the zero point of charge phzpc of ac600 was determined to be 4 25 fig s5 where the surface potential of ac600 is negative under the conditions of the adsorption experiment ph 7 in addition as the ph value increased the adsorption of ac600 on smx was inhibited fig s6 when the ph value increased from 3 to 11 the adsorption capacity of ac600 for smx gradually weakened when the initial ph was 3 5 7 9 and 11 the kobs for smx adsorption by ac600 were 0 0397 0 0156 0 0148 0 00828 and 0 00365 min 1 respectively according to previous studies activated carbon is mainly reversible physical adsorption of organic pollutants and the force is van der waals force zhou et al 2009 the adsorption data in this experiment can be well fitted by the freundlich adsorption model confirming this conclusion due to the freundlich model describing reversible adsorption the zeta potential and the adsorption kinetics of ac600 affected by ph were studied to explore the effect of the esp on adsorption as shown in fig s5 when the ph increased the surface of ac600 became negatively charged and smx pka1 1 6 pka2 5 7 boreen et al 2004 also began to change from a protonated and neutral state to an anionic state the adsorption of ac600 to smx was gradually inhibited fig s6 as the ph increased the adsorption removal of smx at different ph had a strong correlation with the value of the zeta potential on the ac600 surface fig s7 which is further confirmed that organic pollutants attach to activated carbon mainly because of the physical adsorption in addition previous studies have shown that the π π electron acceptor structure formed by the functional groups of smx and the graphitized surface of carbon materials ji et al 2009 pan et al 2008 and the hydrogen bonding between smx and oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of carbon materials zhu et al 2005 are also possible adsorption mechanisms for smx by ac600 moreover large oxygen containing functional groups and graphitized structures of ac600 can contribute to the adsorption of smx by ac600 smx adsorption on ac600 plays a pre adsorption effect increasing pollutant removal efficiency 3 3 paa activation on ac600 it is widely known that there are two main compounds in paa solution which are paa and h2o2 both possess oxidation capabilities on organic contaminants to confirm the mechanism of smx removal in the paa ac600 system the main contributing factors of this system will be determined no buffer solution was added to avoid any possible reactions caused by buffer species 1 m naoh and 1 m hno3 were used to adjust the initial solution ph to 7 0 the changes in ph after the reaction were less than 1 in all experiments the effects of ac600 dose and paa dose on smx removal are shown in fig s8 and fig s9 the optimal dose of ac600 and paa in this system were 50 mg l and 0 26 mm respectively as shown in fig s8 the effect of ac600 on smx removal in the paa ac600 process was investigated the removal of smx was significantly improved with the ac600 increased the removal rate of smx increased significantly with the increase of ac600 which may be due to the increase of the activated sites for paa with the increase of ac600 when the ac600 dose was greater than 50 mg l the removal efficiency of smx obtained a negligible enhancement with the increase of the ac600 dose when the ac600 dose was increased from 50 mg l to 100 mg l the removal rate at 90 min increased by only 4 64 as shown in fig s9 the degradation of smx was promoted as the paa concentration increased from 0 065 to 0 026 mm a higher concentration of paa could generate more radical species for smx removal when the paa concentration further increased to 0 39 mm the degradation of smx was slightly inhibited which was likely attributed to the scavenging effect of the excess amount of paa on radical species zhang et al 2021b as can be seen from fig 3 99 4 of smx was removed in the paa ac600 smx system within 150 minutes however only marginally smx removal was observed in the paa alone system strongly indicates that the high removal of smx in the paa ac600 system is not due to the direct oxidation by paa or h2o2 kobs 0 034 m 1s 1 the removal of smx in the ac600 h2o2 smx system 53 6 is much lower than that of the paa ac600 smx system 99 4 this is because h2o2 is more stable than paa the bond energy of o o bond in h2o2 213 kj mol is higher than that in paa 159 kj mol ao et al 2021a the removal of smx in the ac600 h2o2 smx system is even lower than that of the ac600 smx system 80 02 probably because the h2o2 molecules combine with the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of ac600 through hydrogen bonding thereby it will compete with smx for the adsorption sites and inhibit the affinity of ac600 for adsorption it is well known that paa and h2o2 are present in the paa solution both of these substances contain o o bond to have oxidizing properties therefore by comparing the above different systems it can be preliminarily concluded that the high removal of pollutants in the paa ac600 system is due to paa activation by ac600 the concentration of paa overreaction time was also analyzed in this study in fig s10 as shown in fig s10 paa is rapidly decomposed under ac600 activation the trends of paa decomposition and smx removal were consistent in addition the paa was almost completely consumed in the late stage of the reaction in addition since the actual concentration of pollutants in real groundwater is low the removal of smx with a low initial smx concentration was also studied the results were shown in fig s11 when the initial smx concentration was 2 mg l 7 9 μm the removal rate increased kobs 63 81 m 1s 1 compared to that 10 79 m 1s 1 of higher initial smx concentration nearly 100 removal was achieved within 90 minutes therefore the paa ac600 system is feasible to remediate antibiotics contaminated groundwater 3 4 mechanism of activation of paa by ac600 based on the previous research the removal of pollutants by paa based advanced oxidation processes aops mainly rely on free radicals and non radical pathways the free radical pathways mainly include the generation of hydroxyl radicals ho and organic radicals ch3c o oo ch3c o o ch3 and ch3oo zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2022 and the non radical pathways mainly depend on the electron transfer process liu et al 2021 and singlet oxygenation wang et al 2020a to understand the reaction mechanism of the paa ac600 system the free radical pathways were comprehensively investigated first according to fig 4 a and fig 4 b almost no suppression was found in the removal of smx after adding 100 mm tba kobs 3 061 m 1s 1 which indicated that ho hardly contributes to smx degradation the epr spectra also proved this conclusion fig s13 due to the low oxidation capacity of ch3o2 and ch3 cai et al 2017 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2020 subsequent discussions on organic free radicals only involve ch3c o oo and ch3c o o to confirm the existence and contribution of r o ch3c o oo ch3c o o in the paa ac600 system nap was selected as the target pollutant of the paa ac600 system this is because nap can only be degraded selectively by r o and ho in paa based aops cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 the ho radicals are not the main active ingredient because the addition of tba k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 as a ho scavenger zhang et al 2021b has no obvious inhibition of the nap removal fig 4 c suggesting that the quantity of ho in the paa ac600 system was quite small in addition nap was effectively removed in paa ac600 system through the contrast of the gray curve and the red curve which means r o played an important role in the removal of smx 2 4 hd consists of a c c structure that is susceptible to attack by ch3c o oo and oh the apparent second order rate constants of 2 4 hd with ch3c o oo and oh are 9 2 108 m 1s 1 and 9 16 109 m 1s 1 kim et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 to further determine the role of the aforementioned radicals the addition of 2 4 hd was studied after the addition of 2 4 hd the removal rate constant kobs of smx decreased 0 196 m 1s 1 indicating that ch3c o oo are the main radicals contributing to removing smx fig 4 a in addition the paa ac600 smx 2 4hd system has a higher smx removal rate than the ac600 smx 2 4hd system fig s12 which proves the existence of non radical pathways within the paa ac600 smx system to further understand the reaction mechanism of the paa ac600 system non radical pathways electron transfer process and 1o2 were investigated secondly l histidine k 3 107 m 1 s 1 and furfuryl alcohol k 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 were chosen as a scavenger for 1o2 chen et al 2018 scavengers were added to the paa ac600 system respectively to distinguish their respective contribution and determine the dominant reactive species without adding any quencher the removal of smx reached 99 6 fig 4 a and the removal of smx was well described by second order kinetics with r2 close to 0 92 and kobs of 10 79 m 1s 1 fig 4 b meanwhile furfuryl alcohol and l histidine were chosen as a quencher to confirm the existence of 1o2 both furfuryl alcohol kobs is 0 4295 m 1s 1 and l histidine kobs is 0 5470 m 1s 1 had considerable suppression effect on the removal of smx with the removal of 36 36 and 32 26 respectively theoretically na2s2o3 kobs is 0 9008 m 1s 1 can be used as a quencher for all active substances in this system however the inhibitory effect was inferior to those of furfuryl alcohol and l histidine which may be due to the hydrophilia of na2s2o3 the na2s2o3 is more hydrophilic than furfuryl alcohol and l histidine and it is not easy to be adsorbed by ac600 that exists on the solid liquid interface therefore it does not easily compete with smx for adsorption sites and thus has inhibition on smx removal fig s12 the effect of quenching agents on the ac600 adsorption for smx were shown in fig s12 the results showed that the adsorption of smx on ac600 decreased with the addition of quenching agents which indicated that competitive adsorption between quenching agents and smx on ac600 existed but in our pre test we found the ac600 adsorption for smx had no obvious on the final removal of smx in the paa ac600 system data was not shown which indicated that competitive adsorption between quenching agents and smx on ac600 cannot affect the results of quenching experiments the above discussion evidences the generation of 1o2 however the generation and contribution of 1o2 have been controversial because of the lack of reliable characterization techniques ren et al 2022 the generation of 1o2 and the existence of the electron transfer process in the system was further confirmed with epr experiments using h2o and d2o tempo was used as a trapping agent for 1o2 to form a 1 1 1 intensity ratio triplet line signal fig 4 d shows the epr spectra using temp and as the spin trapping agent in different conditions paa smx ac600 h2o and paa smx ac600 d2o the appearance of three line signaling of tempo in paa smx ac600 h2o seems to indicate that ac600 can activate paa to generate 1o2 but the absence of increased three line signaling in the paa smx ac600 d2o system refuted this concept besides h2o is the physical quenching of 1o2 with a high rate constant of 2 5 105 s 1 wang et al 2020a thus the above results conclusively indicated that 1o2 was indeed generated but played an ignorable role in the removal of smx in the paa ac600 system liu et al 2021 while the electron transfer process was responsible for the non radical oxidative in the paa ac600 smx system r solís et al 2021 furthermore dmpo was used as a trapping agent to identify ho in the paa ac600 system as shown in fig 4 d dmpo oh adducts were observed in the paa ac600 system instead of the paa ac600 smx system however the tba quenching experiment and nap degradation experiments indicated that ho was formed with extremely low concentration and dmpo oh adducts in the paa ac600 smx system were too low to be detected dmpo oh adducts signal was observed in the paa ac600 system perhaps because organic radicals cannot be consumed in time without smx the r o further generates the ho in the system there is no obvious ho signal when smx exists which also proves that ho are produced by organic radicals wang et al 2020c ac600 has obvious defects and abundant functional groups according to raman characterization which is considered to have a high activity to activate the paa the xps results fig 2 a showed that there were abundant oxygen containing functional groups in ac600 materials according to the above study r o and electron transfer process have been proved to contribute to the removal of smx in the paa ac600 smx system where r o is produced through activation of the paa by ac600 doubtlessly therefore the activation mechanism of paa to produce r o would be ascribed according to the reaction of eqs 1 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ch3 o2 h3c o o the ch3c o o and ch3c o oo generated from the paa catalyzed by the activated carbon on oxygen containing functional groups and surface defects eqs 1 4 the ch3c o o was the initial radicals that were formed in the paa ac600 system the hydrogen atom from paa was abstracted by ch3c o o to form ch3c o oo and acetic acid adewuyi 2005 eq 5 ch3c o o can undergo unimolecular decay yielding ch3 and co2 also called decarboxylation eq 6 then the ch3 will be converted into a preoxy radical ch3coo with a weaker oxidizing ability eq 7 these radicals were also considered primary radicals in smx degradation when using other approaches such as uv light cai et al 2017 tio2 zhang et al 2021a transition metal ions kim et al 2019 wang et al 2020c thermal energy wang et al 2020a for paa activation surface modification is an effective strategy to induce more active sites and improve catalytic performances generally the conjugated π system of carbon materials played a primary role in nonradical oxidation ren et al 2022 ac600 has obvious defects and abundant functional groups according to raman characterization which is considered to have a high activity to activate the paa the xps results fig 2 a showed that there were abundant c o functional groups c o c o 0 41 in ac600 materials after heat treatment the acidic functional groups of ac600 decreased and the proportion of c o functional groups increased cheng et al 2019 proved that the c o functional group is the active site for direct electron transfer through functional group masking experiments which is also indicated by the increased c o ratio of ac600 after the reaction in this study fig 2 b in addition the increase in hydrophobicity after heat treatment can enhance the adsorption performance of ac600 thereby enhancing the electron transfer process 3 5 effect of water matrix parameters of groundwater 3 5 1 effects of ph as shown in fig 5 a the degradation of smx by the paa ac600 system was affected obviously by initial ph the sequence of smx degradation after 90 min reaction was ph 11 37 23 ph 3 82 30 ph 9 87 15 ph 5 92 21 ph 7 93 7 the results suggested that the worst performance of the paa ac600 system for smx removal was observed under strongly alkaline conditions ph 11 smx removal was found to be optimal under weakly acidic and neutral conditions because the protonated paa requires stronger activation energy the o o bonding length of ch3c o oo is 1 3922 å while ch3c o ooh is 1 5318 å calculated by gaussian 16w based on dft therefore the o o bonding energy of ch3c o ooh is higher than the o o bonding energy of ch3c o oo which means that paa in anionic form is easier to be activated therefore a particular increase in ph will promote paa activation and smx degradation however the result showed that alkaline condition was not conducive to the removal of smx in paa ac600 systems in which the smx removal was reduced and even lower than that by ac600 adsorption which is consistent with the previous studies sun et al 2020 under the alkaline condition smx is in deprotonated form and the surface of ac600 is negatively charged 29 97 mv ph 7 thus the electrostatic repulsion between the oxygen containing functional groups on smx and ac600 was enhanced xie et al 2014 at the same time the anionic paa will also react with the h2o2 in the system consuming the paa and generating products with weak smx degradation ability wang et al 2020c therefore controlling the reaction ph in the heterogeneous paa advanced oxidation system is of great importance 3 5 2 effect of anions many anions are ubiquitous in natural groundwater and they usually react with reactive species therefore the effects of chloride ions cl bicarbonate hco3 and sulfate ion so4 2 on smx degradation were investigated in this study the effect of cl and so4 2 in the paa ac600 smx system was investigated at different concentrations interestingly the inhibition of cl on smx removal was not observed as expected because when the cl was added in this system the removal of smx was improved as shown in fig 5 b the removal increased gradually from 93 52 to 98 59 with the increase of cl concentration from 0 mm to 50 mm the phenomenon can be explained from two aspects firstly paa can react directly with cl to produce secondary oxidant hocl eq 8 shah et al 2015 then hocl can react with h2o2 to form 1o2 eq 9 secondly cl can react with oh to produce various reactive chlorine containing species including cl cloh and cl2 chen et al 2019 shah et al 2015 wang et al 2020c eqs 10 11 8 9 hocl ho2 cl 1o2 h2o 10 11 cl cl cl2 although previous studies showed that the chlorine containing species is weaker than the primary reactive species produced by aops such as oh wang et al 2011 the effect of cl on the removal mainly depends on the properties of degradable substrates for example it was reported that the removal rate constant of nap in feii edds uv paa system chen et al 2021 and diclofenac in zero valent copper zvc paa system were higher zhang et al 2021c while cl has been reported to slightly inhibit the degradation of tetracycline tc in the zero valent iron nzvi paa system zhang et al 2022 and smx in ruo2 supported multi walled carbon nanotube paa systems qian et al 2022 kim et al 2019 found that cl with the added dose from 100 μm to1000 μm had a negligible contribution to the degradation of carbamazepine cbz in the co paa system wang et al 2021 reported that cl had an insignificant effect on the degradation of smx in cofe2o4 paa system similar results were also found by wang et al 2020b hco3 is the most common and primary anion in groundwater previous studies showed that hco3 could inhibit the degradation of pollutants in some advanced oxidation processes yang et al 2017 implying that hco3 at groundwater environmental levels positively affects the removal of smx in this study the addition of hco3 inhibited the removal of smx and the intensity of inhibition was not sensitive to changes in concentration as the hco3 concentration increased smx removal decreased when adding 50 100 150 and 300 mg l of hco3 the removal of smx was 67 70 70 43 66 60 and 64 27 respectively compared with the removal of 93 52 without hco3 there was a certain degree of inhibition fig 5 c this may be because ch3c o oo and hco3 react to produce hco3 and co3 eqs 12 13 but hco3 and co3 had worse removal performance for smx the addition of hco3 inhibited the removal of smx which is similar to the conclusions mentioned in the literature smx removal was inhibited by hco3 in uv h2o2 yang et al 2017 and ruo2 supported multi walled carbon nanotube paa systems qian et al 2022 and tc removal was inhibited hco3 in nzvi paa system zhang et al 2022 12 13 hco 3 h 2 o h 3 o co 3 so4 2 does not change the ph value of the reaction system nor does it react with the oxidants of the ps system and h2o2 system however the removal efficiency of smx was suppressed when the so4 2 was added shown in fig 5 d there is no report on the effect of catalytic ability and degradation ability caused by so4 2 in the paa system but previous research indicated that so4 2 can be adsorbed by positively charged materials on the surface thereby reducing the number of active sites on the materials therefore so4 2 may compete with paa for active sites and inhibit the removal of smx wang and wang 2021 3 5 3 effect of humic acid and dissolved oxygen natural organic matter nom ubiquitous material in natural water bodies is electronic rich because it contains abundant oxygen containing functional groups carboxyl carbonyl and hydroxyl they may inhibit or strengthen the catalytic oxidation of pollutants according to previous research long et al 2019 michael kordatou et al 2015 humic acid ha as an important element of nom had been adequately investigated on its effect in aops huang et al 2021 zhou et al 2015b generally the addition of ha in the paa ac600 sxx system has no obvious effect on the degradation system as shown in fig 5 e the performance of the removal of smx by adding ha mainly depended on the concentration of ha ha inhibited the removal of smx at high concentrations over 5 mg l and promoted the removal of smx at low concentrations when the concentration of ha was low 1 mg l the removal was optimal and the removal of smx reached 95 96 at 90 min more than 93 52 without ha when the ha were at concentrations of 5 mg l 10 mg l and 50 mg l the removal at 90 min reached 93 50 93 58 and 91 75 when ha was at a low concentration less than 5 mg l ha might participate in the catalytic activation reaction chain and generate reactive species to promote smx oxidation degradation huang et al 2021 similar results were reported by zhou et al 2015b that ha at an environmentally relevant concentration less than 4 0 mg l strengthened the degradation of smx due to the quinone carbonyl c o content in ha smx removal decreased when the concentration of ha was at a high level probably because of the competing reaction of ha for the reactive species since electron rich sites of ha can captivate electrophilic reactive species michael kordatou et al 2015 ha could be adsorbed by the surface of carbon materials and occupy reactive sites therefore inhibiting the catalytic process long et al 2019 moreover the paa ac600 system was further operated in spiked real groundwater samples to assess its practical performance for smx removal as shown in fig 5 f the removal of smx was slightly suppressed and decreased by 12 after 90 min was observed in real groundwater this is mainly because groundwater is rich in bicarbonate ions results indicated that the paa ac600 system was prospective to be applied in real groundwater treatment the dissolved oxygen content of groundwater is slightly lower than that of surface water while diving groundwater dissolved oxygen levels has almost no effect on the paa ac600 smx system of this experiment the dissolved oxygen was adjusted to 5 5 mg l by controlling the nitrogen flow rate the measured real groundwater dissolved oxygen value was used as the experimental background value as shown in fig s14 when the dissolved oxygen in the solution decreased from 8 5 to 5 5 the smx removal was not greatly affected which may be because the dissolved oxygen in this system did not participate in the reaction 3 6 oxidation feature of other antibiotics considering that this system contains both free radical and non radical pathways the degradation of various antibiotics including sulfonamides sas smx sulfamethazine smt sulfadiazine sdz and fluoroquinolones ofloxacin ofx was further investigated to demonstrate the selectivity of the paa ac600 process for all selected compounds the degradation process followed first order kinetics fig 6 a the experiment showed that only ofx had the lowest removal by activated paa and the removal rate was 0 01240 min 1 however sa compounds with different substituents also showed significant differences in removal rates overall the removal rate of sa with six membered heterocyclic groups was lower than that of sas with five membered heterocyclic moieties for example the observed removal rates of stz and smx with a five membered heterocycle were higher than that of sdz fig 6 b respectively this result demonstrates the substituent dependent removal feature of paa ac600 which may be related to the aggressive behavior of active species the degradation process is highly electrophilic in nature and a similar phenomenon occurs in co ii doped g c3n4 paa system liu et al 2021 3 7 degradation pathway of smx and the biological toxicity of its intermediate products according to the results of the dft calculation table s5 lu and chen 2012 and uplc q tof ms analysis of the intermediate products the possible smx degradation pathway for the paa ac600 system was proposed in fig 7 the structural formula and molecular number of smx are shown in fig s15 in pathway 1 the benzene ring c 2 and or c 4 atoms are attacked to form the products p 1 and p 2 in pathway 2 the cleavage of the s n bond produced intermediate products p 2 and p 3 li et al 2021 reported that r o reacted with smx to break the s n bond in ru iii paa system while the cleavage of the s n bond was also reported in a co ii doped g c3n4 paa system for smx removal by an electron transfer mechanism liu et al 2021 this may be because the sulfonamide group has one of the most negative surfaces electrostatic potential esp values in the smx molecule which can be seen from the esp mapping molecule vdw surface in smx fig s16 the esp values near the atoms on the smx surface were shown in fig s17 therefore it is easy for the sulfonamide group to be attacked by attracting the electrophilic reagent through electrostatic attraction at the initial stage of the chemical reaction which leads to the cleavage of the s n bond in the sulfonamide group in pathway 3 the reaction of the nh2 group on the benzene ring with electrophiles since the nitrogen atom 17 n on the amino group has the largest value of the f function in the entire molecule and is extremely vulnerable to attack by electrophiles during this process n centered radical would be produced and then coupled to form azosulfamethoxazole p 5 m z 503 widely reported as an intermediate product of oxidation of smx in ru iii paa system li et al 2021 and co paa system wang et al 2020c while the coupling reaction between the n center radicals can only exit in aops dominated by a free radical mechanism which also confirmed the conclusion that r o exists in paa ac600 system liu et al 2021 in pathway 4 zhang et al 2021b the olefinic double bond bond 14 c 15 c on the isoxazole ring is attacked by the electrophilic r o and oxidized to p 7 m z 288 then the s n bond cleavage of p 7 formed p 4 m z 133 according to the calculation of the fukui function table s5 it was known that the nh2 is the most vulnerable site to be attacked by electrophiles in pathway 5 nh2 was oxidized by r o and converted to no2 nitrobenzene compound was produced p 8 m z 283 ding et al 2021 a similar reaction is also observed in co paa system was observed and wang et al 2020c indicated that the nh2 group in smx is vulnerable to r o the results of the dft calculation are consistent with the results of mass spectrometry which better explains the degradation mechanism of smx degradation intermediate compounds that are more toxic than the parent compound may appear during pharmaceutical removal mirzaei et al 2018 yan et al 2019 therefore the toxicity of smx and its degradation intermediates is calculated using ecosar 2 0 the acute toxicity endpoint values for aquatic organisms were displayed in table s6 it can be found that the acute toxicity of most intermediates is close to or even lower than the parent compound fig 8 the biological toxicity of the product p 7 is much lower than that of the parent compound while the toxicity of p 4 and p 5 has increased table s6 however according to the previous literature data the overall toxicity of the smx degradation system that produced p 4 lai et al 2018 and p 5 mirzaei et al 2018 are reduced respectively therefore although smx is not fully mineralized the overall toxicity is considerably reduced luminescent bacteria toxicity tests were conducted by vibrio qinghaiensis q67 for the validation of the toxicity of the degradation products mixture the luminescence l l0 of q67 which had been quenched when exposed to the reaction solution for 0 25 h was studied to evaluate the change of acute toxicity during the degradation process text s6 as shown in fig s18 there was almost no inhibition of q67 luminescence during the degradation of smx which indicated that the change in the toxicity during the degradation process was not obvious the results suggested that the mixture toxicity of degradation products is not higher than that of smx this was consistent with the results of the ecosar simulation in addition it was reported that the inhibitory effect of smx degradation products after advanced oxidation on escherichia coli is significantly weakened wang et al 2016 hence it can effectively inhibit the development of antibiotic resistance and the production of resistance genes in bacteria in the environment in summary the low impact groundwater antibiotic degradation system provided by this study has good application potential and prospects 4 conclusion this study is the first to systematically study the removal of smx via paa activated by the thermally modified activated carbon ac600 in the groundwater the ac600 exhibited an excellent oxidant utility owing to abundant defects and oxygen containing functional groups based on the quenching experiments and epr results paa can be effectively activated by ac600 and electron transfer process and r o including ch3c o o and ch3c o oo were responsible for the degradation of smx different kinds of pharmaceuticals were also investigated and the nap removal experiments also fully proved the existence and contribution of r o the paa ac600 system worked well at ph 3 9 and the removal of smx dropped sharply when the alkalinity of the solution increases the presence of so4 2 do and nom had negligible effects on the removal of smx hco3 had an inhibitory effect and chloride ion cl promoted the removal of smx and the system achieved better removal of smx in real groundwater the paa ac600 system showed excellent anti interference ability and satisfactory decontamination performance and had a good potential for groundwater organic pollutant remediation low impact groundwater organic pollutants treatment ideas are proposed for the first time which is expected to reduce groundwater pollution or secondary pollution during the degradation process it will also provide new insights into the economic environmentally friendly and effective metal free paa activator for groundwater remediation declaration of

modified activated carbon ac600 was applied to activate paa to degrade sulfamethoxazole smx and the effect of groundwater ph chloride ion cl bicarbonate hco3 sulfate ion so4 2 and natural organic matter nom on smx removal by ac600 paa process was studied in detail paa could be effectively activated by ac600 increasing ac600 dose 10 100mg l or paa dosages 0 065 0 39 mm generally enhanced the smx removal the excellent performance in smx removal was achieved at 50 mg l ac600 and 0 26 mm paa the removal of smx was well described by second order kinetic with the rate constant kobs of 10 79 m 1s 1 both much greater than the removal constants of paa alone 0 034 m 1s 1 and ac600 alone 1 774 m 1s 1 r o ch3c o oo ch3c o o and electron transfer process were proved to be responsible for the removal of smx while ho and 1o2 made little to no contribution to the novel paa ac600 system which differs from typical advanced oxidation processes the smx can be removed effectively over a wide ph range 3 9 exhibiting a remarkable ph tolerant performance sulfate ion so4 2 dissolved oxygen do nom displayed negligible influence on the smx removal bicarbonate hco3 exerted an inhibitory effect on smx abatement while chloride ion cl promoted the removal of smx this showed excellent anti interference capacity and satisfactory decontamination performance under actual groundwater conditions furthermore the degradation pathways of smx were proposed there was no obvious difference in the acute toxicity of the mixed products during the degradation process it will facilitate further research of metal free catalyst paa system as a new strategy for groundwater in situ remediation technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid thermally modified activated carbon antibiotics groundwater remediation mechanisms 1 introduction groundwater contamination is a global challenge due to rapid industrialization and population growth antibiotics as emerging pollutants in groundwater have been widely detected at the concentration level of ng l μg l at present and sulfa antibiotics have a higher concentration and are more common in groundwater huang et al 2020 zainab et al 2020 reported antibiotics concentrations in groundwater worldwide ranged from 0 01 to above 10 000 ng l groundwater is an essential source of drinking water accounting for 30 of the world s freshwater resources chloe 2018 currently practical approaches for groundwater antibiotics include persulfate ps systems which often cause secondary pollution problems such as the production of sulfate ions therefore it is imperative to develop environment friendly technologies to remediate antibiotic contaminated groundwater in situ paa as an emerging oxidant is widely used for disinfection in wastewater treatment plants luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 which indicates the potential of paa to degrade micropollutants paa can be activated by various methods such as ultraviolet uv light ao et al 2021b cai et al 2017 photocatalytic material like tio2 zhang et al 2021a transition metal ions kim et al 2019 li et al 2021 wang et al 2020b wang et al 2020c zhang et al 2022 thermal energy wang et al 2020a co ii doped g c3n4 liu et al 2021 and activated carbon fibers acfs zhou et al 2015a and generate reactive oxygen species such as free radicals and non radicals which will be beneficial for the elimination of emerging contaminants nevertheless uv irradiation and thermal activation of paa are considered energy intensive and are limited when applied in environmental restoration projects while transition metal ions may cause secondary pollution although the performance of carbon materials is excellent hu et al 2019 there is only one related study that has reported the degradation of dyes by activated fiber activation of paa so far zhou et al 2015a therefore an adaptable environmentally friendly economical and low energy paa activation method to remove organic micropollutants from groundwater urgently needs to be developed we developed a carbon material paa process system for removing antibiotics in low polluting groundwater based on previous research zhou et al 2015a in this study sulfamethoxazole smx a typical and prevalent antibiotic in groundwater was selected as the target compound and ac600 was prepared from commercial activated carbon ac through a thermally modified process to activate paa for oxidative degradation of smx this material was prepared for the first time in this study without atomic doping and metal loading and there is no report on activated carbon activating paa degrading emerging organic pollutants firstly the possible mechanism of paa activation by ac600 was studied secondly the main reactive species that cause smx destruction in paa ac600 system was identified including free radicals and non radical generation pathways then the impacts of groundwater ph do chloride ion cl bicarbonate hco3 sulfate ion so4 2 and natural organic matter nom on smx degradation via paa activated by ac600 was studied the removal of smx in spiked real groundwater samples was also explored finally the acute toxic effects of the degradation intermediates of smx in the system were evaluated smx was almost completely removed under the action of low dose paa 0 24 mm and the overall toxicity is significantly weakened during the degradation process in addition the system has strong resistance to groundwater matrix interference this research is novel because it provides an environmentally friendly economic and efficient catalyst for activating paa to remediate groundwater this study will provide new insights into the low impact groundwater pollution remediation with low concentration organic pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals paa 15 w w paa and 20w w h2o2 in acetic acid and water solution and smx 98 were obtained from aladdin co ltd shanghai china commercial ac was purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china other chemicals and reagents are shown in text s1 s designates text tables figures in the supplemental information here and thereafter the actual concentration of paa is 15 w w measured by titration before the experiment because paa is easy to decompose titration method for paa was described in text s2 2 2 real groundwater samples the groundwater samples were collected from a site in pudong shanghai samples were filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters and then were further stored at 4 c and analyzed within 24 h the characteristics of the groundwater samples are provided in table s1 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 thermal modification and characterization of activated carbon the commercial ac was thermally modified to improve its activation ability due to the ac activating paa to degrade smx poorly in the pretest fig s1 the commercial ac was first pyrolyzed in a tube furnace for 1 h under an n2 flow at a temperature from 500 c to 900 c at an increase of 100 c and the thermally modified activated carbon was labeled as ac500 to ac900 the n2 adsorption performance of carbon materials can largely reflect the activation reaction performance of the material li et al 2014 sun et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 so the n2 adsorption isotherms of ac500 to ac900 were studied as shown in fig s3 and table s2 the ability of activated carbon to adsorb n2 gradually increased with the increase in temperature but there was no obvious improvement when the temperature was higher than 600 c thus comprehensively comparing material performance and energy consumption ac600 was used for the follow up research to further explore the source of the excellent performance of ac600 and infer its activation mechanism for paa a detailed characterization of ac600 was carried out the bet surface area bet total pore volume vtot and pore size distribution of the ac600 samples were measured by n2 adsorption at 77 k using a gemini vii 3 04 adsorption

degradation experiments were carried out in a 250 ml conical erlenmeyer flask at 20 c with constant stirring at 200 rpm the total volume of the reaction solution was 100 ml solutions were prepared with ultrapure water to determine whether paa can directly oxidize smx 0 26 mm paa and 0 079 mm smx were used in the experiment of paa alone the adsorption kinetics experiments were conducted with 50 mg l ac600 and 0 079 mm smx the degradation experiment system was conducted with 50 mg l ac600 0 26 mm paa and 0 079 mm smx a lower initial smx concentration of 7 9 μm was also used in the adsorption and degradation experiments with 0 2 mm paa and 20 mg l ac600 to confirm that the paa ac600 system can effectively remove smx at low concentration to further confirm the existence and contribution of ch3c o oo and ch3c o o in the paa ac600 system naproxen nap was also used as another pollutant in this system to compare with the results of the degradation of smx all samples taken at predetermined time intervals in the experiment were filtered through a 0 22 μm millipore filter then the smx concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc in particular all samples for degradation experiments were quenched by excess na2s2o3 immediately after sampling the experiment on the effect of groundwater matrix and ph value on the removal is the same as that of the degradation experiment except for the addition of humic acid anion acid and alkali solutions to simulate the groundwater conditions 1 m naoh and 1 m hno3 were used to adjust solution ph and the changes in ph after the reaction were less than 1 in all experiments the same degradation experimental procedure was conducted to investigate the removal of smx by paa in the spiked real groundwater samples for the degradation pathways investigation products and intermediates of smx were extracted and then analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer uplc q tof ms shimadzu japan to infer the degradation pathway the front line orbit of smx was calculated by gaussian 16w and multiwfn 3 7 lu and chen 2012 and the electrophilic reaction and nucleophilic reaction sites were inferred to assist in explaining the degradation mechanism 2 3 3 quenching experiments quenching experiments were conducted to determine the reactive species degradation reactions the

paa ac600 smx reaction systems before the reaction began 2 4 analytical method the concentrations of smx and nap were analyzed using an hplc 1260 infinity ii agilent usa coupled with an agilent hc c18 column the injection volume and flow rate of eluents were set at 20 μl and 1 ml min respectively details can be found in table s3 degradation products of smx were analyzed by uplc q tof ms shimadzu

bacteria toxicity tests were conducted by vibrio qinghaiensis q67 to determine the evolution of the toxicity in the reaction system the luminescence l l0 of q67 which had been quenched when exposed to

calculation details can be found in text s3 the acute toxicity of smx and its degradation intermediates were also evaluated by ecosar 2 0 u s environmental protection agency details can be found in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ac600 the ac600 in this study was prepared by thermal modification 600 c which has a simple fabrication process and low cost and no secondary pollution compared with atomic doping and metal loading methods an and xiao 2020 xing et al 2020 the structure and morphology of ac600 indicated the microporous structure that has developed abundantly fig 1 a which was also confirmed by n2 sorption analysis both ac and ac600 n2 adsorption and desorption curves have hysteresis loops which belong to the iv adsorption isotherm indicating the existence of mesopores in activated carbon it also can be seen in fig s3 that micropores 0 2 nm also exist in ac600 in addition to mesopores the commercial ac and ac600 possess a surface area of 651 06 m² g and 704 98 m² g with a pore volume of 0 44 cm³ g and 0 47 cm³ g respectively the average pore size of commercial ac is 2 68 nm while ac600 is 2 69 nm the result of the bet experiment indicated that the modified activated carbon with 600 c increases the surface area significantly compared to commercial ac without significantly changing the pore size and volume fig 1 d which can enhance the capacity of pre adsorption to pollutants for ac600 fig 1 b illustrated the ac600 layered structure with a pitch of 0 28 nm which showed a good correlation with the graphite 0 25 nm duan et al 2018 sun et al 2020 yun et al 2018 zhou et al 2015a this strongly shows the increase in the orderliness of activated carbon material formed by the strong π π interaction of the stacked graphite layers in the aromatic clusters the strong π π interaction between the aromatic ring of smx and ac600 also contributes to the adsorption capacity of ac600 zhu et al 2018 moreover a typical d band of ac600 is detected at 1350 cm 1 denotes the disorder degree and defects meanwhile the g band detected at 1575 cm 1 corresponds well to the graphite layer sp2 hybridized which is derived from the stretching vibration of the in plane bond of the graphite crystal the integrated intensity ratio of the d band versus g band is used to evaluate the degree of graphitization and integrity of carbon materials the d band and g band of ac600 were located around 1341 cm 1 and 1593 cm 1 and the estimated id ig value is 2 351 fig 1 c this indicates the defect degree of the carbon material is high enhances the high catalytic capacity of ac600 cheng et al 2016 furthermore the g and d bands reveal an overlap without an obvious separation which is a typical characteristic of disordered activated carbon yang et al 2017 defects such as structural surface and vacancies are considered the reason for improving catalytic activity xiao et al 2020 the characterization results showed that the surface area of ac600 increased after thermal activation and the material is defective which is conducive to paa activation the oxygen functional groups are also considered the active sites on the carbon surface sun et al 2020 the presence of carbonyl groups c o on the surface of carbon materials acted as an important oxygen containing basic functional group that produces 1o2 and has a strong degradation ability on electron rich organic the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of ac600 before and after the reaction were semi quantitatively as described from xps analysis the composition and relative amounts of the oxygen containing functional groups on ac600 can be obtained through the deconvolution of the o1s spectra yumak 2021 fig 2 shows the deconvoluted peak of c o at the binding energy be of 531 4 ev and the carbon oxygen single bond c o with the be of 532 5 533 4 and 534 2 ev according to the previous studies c o was considered to be the active site for activating ps to produce 1o2 and the ratio of c o to c o was chosen as one of the indicators of the catalytic activity for paa activation shao et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 a the ratio of the c o to c o groups is 0 406 before the oxidation reaction while the ratio became 0 466 after the reaction fig 2 b these xps results showed that the surface of ac600 is rich in oxygen containing functional groups especially for the c o and the proportion of c o increased after the reaction this is mainly due to the c o and other surfaces oxygen containing functional groups which have different degrees of loss about half after the reaction as indicated in the deconvolution of the o1s spectra yumak 2021 this also indirectly proves that the carbon materials surface functional groups participate in the catalytic oxidation reaction 3 2 adsorption performance of ac600 to explore the adsorption performance of the heterogeneous material ac600 smx was selected as the target pollutant in the ac600 alone system the removal of smx is also apparent reaching 72 at 60 minutes fig 3 the experimental data of adsorption isotherm can be well fitted by the freundlich model r2 0 9939 table s4 and fig s4 this suggests that the adsorption of smx on ac600 is heterogeneous due to the coexistence of different adsorption sites or different adsorption mechanisms the surface of ac600 has a local adsorption phenomenon because the adsorption conforms to the freundlich model consistent with the sem results the zero point of charge phzpc of ac600 was determined to be 4 25 fig s5 where the surface potential of ac600 is negative under the conditions of the adsorption experiment ph 7 in addition as the ph value increased the adsorption of ac600 on smx was inhibited fig s6 when the ph value increased from 3 to 11 the adsorption capacity of ac600 for smx gradually weakened when the initial ph was 3 5 7 9 and 11 the kobs for smx adsorption by ac600 were 0 0397 0 0156 0 0148 0 00828 and 0 00365 min 1 respectively according to previous studies activated carbon is mainly reversible physical adsorption of organic pollutants and the force is van der waals force zhou et al 2009 the adsorption data in this experiment can be well fitted by the freundlich adsorption model confirming this conclusion due to the freundlich model describing reversible adsorption the zeta potential and the adsorption kinetics of ac600 affected by ph were studied to explore the effect of the esp on adsorption as shown in fig s5 when the ph increased the surface of ac600 became negatively charged and smx pka1 1 6 pka2 5 7 boreen et al 2004 also began to change from a protonated and neutral state to an anionic state the adsorption of ac600 to smx was gradually inhibited fig s6 as the ph increased the adsorption removal of smx at different ph had a strong correlation with the value of the zeta potential on the ac600 surface fig s7 which is further confirmed that organic pollutants attach to activated carbon mainly because of the physical adsorption in addition previous studies have shown that the π π electron acceptor structure formed by the functional groups of smx and the graphitized surface of carbon materials ji et al 2009 pan et al 2008 and the hydrogen bonding between smx and oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of carbon materials zhu et al 2005 are also possible adsorption mechanisms for smx by ac600 moreover large oxygen containing functional groups and graphitized structures of ac600 can contribute to the adsorption of smx by ac600 smx adsorption on ac600 plays a pre adsorption effect increasing pollutant removal efficiency 3 3 paa activation on ac600 it is widely known that there are two main compounds in paa solution which are paa and h2o2 both possess oxidation capabilities on organic contaminants to confirm the mechanism of smx removal in the paa ac600 system the main contributing factors of this system will be determined no buffer solution was added to avoid any possible reactions caused by buffer species 1 m naoh and 1 m hno3 were used to adjust the initial solution ph to 7 0 the changes in ph after the reaction were less than 1 in all experiments the effects of ac600 dose and paa dose on smx removal are shown in fig s8 and fig s9 the optimal dose of ac600 and paa in this system were 50 mg l and 0 26 mm respectively as shown in fig s8 the effect of ac600 on smx removal in the paa ac600 process was investigated the removal of smx was significantly improved with the ac600 increased the removal rate of smx increased significantly with the increase of ac600 which may be due to the increase of the activated sites for paa with the increase of ac600 when the ac600 dose was greater than 50 mg l the removal efficiency of smx obtained a negligible enhancement with the increase of the ac600 dose when the ac600 dose was increased from 50 mg l to 100 mg l the removal rate at 90 min increased by only 4 64 as shown in fig s9 the degradation of smx was promoted as the paa concentration increased from 0 065 to 0 026 mm a higher concentration of paa could generate more radical species for smx removal when the paa concentration further increased to 0 39 mm the degradation of smx was slightly inhibited which was likely attributed to the scavenging effect of the excess amount of paa on radical species zhang et al 2021b as can be seen from fig 3 99 4 of smx was removed in the paa ac600 smx system within 150 minutes however only marginally smx removal was observed in the paa alone system strongly indicates that the high removal of smx in the paa ac600 system is not due to the direct oxidation by paa or h2o2 kobs 0 034 m 1s 1 the removal of smx in the ac600 h2o2 smx system 53 6 is much lower than that of the paa ac600 smx system 99 4 this is because h2o2 is more stable than paa the bond energy of o o bond in h2o2 213 kj mol is higher than that in paa 159 kj mol ao et al 2021a the removal of smx in the ac600 h2o2 smx system is even lower than that of the ac600 smx system 80 02 probably because the h2o2 molecules combine with the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of ac600 through hydrogen bonding thereby it will compete with smx for the adsorption sites and inhibit the affinity of ac600 for adsorption it is well known that paa and h2o2 are present in the paa solution both of these substances contain o o bond to have oxidizing properties therefore by comparing the above different systems it can be preliminarily concluded that the high removal of pollutants in the paa ac600 system is due to paa activation by ac600 the concentration of paa overreaction time was also analyzed in this study in fig s10 as shown in fig s10 paa is rapidly decomposed under ac600 activation the trends of paa decomposition and smx removal were consistent in addition the paa was almost completely consumed in the late stage of the reaction in addition since the actual concentration of pollutants in real groundwater is low the removal of smx with a low initial smx concentration was also studied the results were shown in fig s11 when the initial smx concentration was 2 mg l 7 9 μm the removal rate increased kobs 63 81 m 1s 1 compared to that 10 79 m 1s 1 of higher initial smx concentration nearly 100 removal was achieved within 90 minutes therefore the paa ac600 system is feasible to remediate antibiotics contaminated groundwater 3 4 mechanism of activation of paa by ac600 based on the previous research the removal of pollutants by paa based advanced oxidation processes aops mainly rely on free radicals and non radical pathways the free radical pathways mainly include the generation of hydroxyl radicals ho and organic radicals ch3c o oo ch3c o o ch3 and ch3oo zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2022 and the non radical pathways mainly depend on the electron transfer process liu et al 2021 and singlet oxygenation wang et al 2020a to understand the reaction mechanism of the paa ac600 system the free radical pathways were comprehensively investigated first according to fig 4 a and fig 4 b almost no suppression was found in the removal of smx after adding 100 mm tba kobs 3 061 m 1s 1 which indicated that ho hardly contributes to smx degradation the epr spectra also proved this conclusion fig s13 due to the low oxidation capacity of ch3o2 and ch3 cai et al 2017 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2020 subsequent discussions on organic free radicals only involve ch3c o oo and ch3c o o to confirm the existence and contribution of r o ch3c o oo ch3c o o in the paa ac600 system nap was selected as the target pollutant of the paa ac600 system this is because nap can only be degraded selectively by r o and ho in paa based aops cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 the ho radicals are not the main active ingredient because the addition of tba k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 as a ho scavenger zhang et al 2021b has no obvious inhibition of the nap removal fig 4 c suggesting that the quantity of ho in the paa ac600 system was quite small in addition nap was effectively removed in paa ac600 system through the contrast of the gray curve and the red curve which means r o played an important role in the removal of smx 2 4 hd consists of a c c structure that is susceptible to attack by ch3c o oo and oh the apparent second order rate constants of 2 4 hd with ch3c o oo and oh are 9 2 108 m 1s 1 and 9 16 109 m 1s 1 kim et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 to further determine the role of the aforementioned radicals the addition of 2 4 hd was studied after the addition of 2 4 hd the removal rate constant kobs of smx decreased 0 196 m 1s 1 indicating that ch3c o oo are the main radicals contributing to removing smx fig 4 a in addition the paa ac600 smx 2 4hd system has a higher smx removal rate than the ac600 smx 2 4hd system fig s12 which proves the existence of non radical pathways within the paa ac600 smx system to further understand the reaction mechanism of the paa ac600 system non radical pathways electron transfer process and 1o2 were investigated secondly l histidine k 3 107 m 1 s 1 and furfuryl alcohol k 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 were chosen as a scavenger for 1o2 chen et al 2018 scavengers were added to the paa ac600 system respectively to distinguish their respective contribution and determine the dominant reactive species without adding any quencher the removal of smx reached 99 6 fig 4 a and the removal of smx was well described by second order kinetics with r2 close to 0 92 and kobs of 10 79 m 1s 1 fig 4 b meanwhile furfuryl alcohol and l histidine were chosen as a quencher to confirm the existence of 1o2 both furfuryl alcohol kobs is 0 4295 m 1s 1 and l histidine kobs is 0 5470 m 1s 1 had considerable suppression effect on the removal of smx with the removal of 36 36 and 32 26 respectively theoretically na2s2o3 kobs is 0 9008 m 1s 1 can be used as a quencher for all active substances in this system however the inhibitory effect was inferior to those of furfuryl alcohol and l histidine which may be due to the hydrophilia of na2s2o3 the na2s2o3 is more hydrophilic than furfuryl alcohol and l histidine and it is not easy to be adsorbed by ac600 that exists on the solid liquid interface therefore it does not easily compete with smx for adsorption sites and thus has inhibition on smx removal fig s12 the effect of quenching agents on the ac600 adsorption for smx were shown in fig s12 the results showed that the adsorption of smx on ac600 decreased with the addition of quenching agents which indicated that competitive adsorption between quenching agents and smx on ac600 existed but in our pre test we found the ac600 adsorption for smx had no obvious on the final removal of smx in the paa ac600 system data was not shown which indicated that competitive adsorption between quenching agents and smx on ac600 cannot affect the results of quenching experiments the above discussion evidences the generation of 1o2 however the generation and contribution of 1o2 have been controversial because of the lack of reliable characterization techniques ren et al 2022 the generation of 1o2 and the existence of the electron transfer process in the system was further confirmed with epr experiments using h2o and d2o tempo was used as a trapping agent for 1o2 to form a 1 1 1 intensity ratio triplet line signal fig 4 d shows the epr spectra using temp and as the spin trapping agent in different conditions paa smx ac600 h2o and paa smx ac600 d2o the appearance of three line signaling of tempo in paa smx ac600 h2o seems to indicate that ac600 can activate paa to generate 1o2 but the absence of increased three line signaling in the paa smx ac600 d2o system refuted this concept besides h2o is the physical quenching of 1o2 with a high rate constant of 2 5 105 s 1 wang et al 2020a thus the above results conclusively indicated that 1o2 was indeed generated but played an ignorable role in the removal of smx in the paa ac600 system liu et al 2021 while the electron transfer process was responsible for the non radical oxidative in the paa ac600 smx system r solís et al 2021 furthermore dmpo was used as a trapping agent to identify ho in the paa ac600 system as shown in fig 4 d dmpo oh adducts were observed in the paa ac600 system instead of the paa ac600 smx system however the tba quenching experiment and nap degradation experiments indicated that ho was formed with extremely low concentration and dmpo oh adducts in the paa ac600 smx system were too low to be detected dmpo oh adducts signal was observed in the paa ac600 system perhaps because organic radicals cannot be consumed in time without smx the r o further generates the ho in the system there is no obvious ho signal when smx exists which also proves that ho are produced by organic radicals wang et al 2020c ac600 has obvious defects and abundant functional groups according to raman characterization which is considered to have a high activity to activate the paa the xps results fig 2 a showed that there were abundant oxygen containing functional groups in ac600 materials according to the above study r o and electron transfer process have been proved to contribute to the removal of smx in the paa ac600 smx system where r o is produced through activation of the paa by ac600 doubtlessly therefore the activation mechanism of paa to produce r o would be ascribed according to the reaction of eqs 1 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ch3 o2 h3c o o the ch3c o o and ch3c o oo generated from the paa catalyzed by the activated carbon on oxygen containing functional groups and surface defects eqs 1 4 the ch3c o o was the initial radicals that were formed in the paa ac600 system the hydrogen atom from paa was abstracted by ch3c o o to form ch3c o oo and acetic acid adewuyi 2005 eq 5 ch3c o o can undergo unimolecular decay yielding ch3 and co2 also called decarboxylation eq 6 then the ch3 will be converted into a preoxy radical ch3coo with a weaker oxidizing ability eq 7 these radicals were also considered primary radicals in smx degradation when using other approaches such as uv light cai et al 2017 tio2 zhang et al 2021a transition metal ions kim et al 2019 wang et al 2020c thermal energy wang et al 2020a for paa activation surface modification is an effective strategy to induce more active sites and improve catalytic performances generally the conjugated π system of carbon materials played a primary role in nonradical oxidation ren et al 2022 ac600 has obvious defects and abundant functional groups according to raman characterization which is considered to have a high activity to activate the paa the xps results fig 2 a showed that there were abundant c o functional groups c o c o 0 41 in ac600 materials after heat treatment the acidic functional groups of ac600 decreased and the proportion of c o functional groups increased cheng et al 2019 proved that the c o functional group is the active site for direct electron transfer through functional group masking experiments which is also indicated by the increased c o ratio of ac600 after the reaction in this study fig 2 b in addition the increase in hydrophobicity after heat treatment can enhance the adsorption performance of ac600 thereby enhancing the electron transfer process 3 5 effect of water matrix parameters of groundwater 3 5 1 effects of ph as shown in fig 5 a the degradation of smx by the paa ac600 system was affected obviously by initial ph the sequence of smx degradation after 90 min reaction was ph 11 37 23 ph 3 82 30 ph 9 87 15 ph 5 92 21 ph 7 93 7 the results suggested that the worst performance of the paa ac600 system for smx removal was observed under strongly alkaline conditions ph 11 smx removal was found to be optimal under weakly acidic and neutral conditions because the protonated paa requires stronger activation energy the o o bonding length of ch3c o oo is 1 3922 å while ch3c o ooh is 1 5318 å calculated by gaussian 16w based on dft therefore the o o bonding energy of ch3c o ooh is higher than the o o bonding energy of ch3c o oo which means that paa in anionic form is easier to be activated therefore a particular increase in ph will promote paa activation and smx degradation however the result showed that alkaline condition was not conducive to the removal of smx in paa ac600 systems in which the smx removal was reduced and even lower than that by ac600 adsorption which is consistent with the previous studies sun et al 2020 under the alkaline condition smx is in deprotonated form and the surface of ac600 is negatively charged 29 97 mv ph 7 thus the electrostatic repulsion between the oxygen containing functional groups on smx and ac600 was enhanced xie et al 2014 at the same time the anionic paa will also react with the h2o2 in the system consuming the paa and generating products with weak smx degradation ability wang et al 2020c therefore controlling the reaction ph in the heterogeneous paa advanced oxidation system is of great importance 3 5 2 effect of anions many anions are ubiquitous in natural groundwater and they usually react with reactive species therefore the effects of chloride ions cl bicarbonate hco3 and sulfate ion so4 2 on smx degradation were investigated in this study the effect of cl and so4 2 in the paa ac600 smx system was investigated at different concentrations interestingly the inhibition of cl on smx removal was not observed as expected because when the cl was added in this system the removal of smx was improved as shown in fig 5 b the removal increased gradually from 93 52 to 98 59 with the increase of cl concentration from 0 mm to 50 mm the phenomenon can be explained from two aspects firstly paa can react directly with cl to produce secondary oxidant hocl eq 8 shah et al 2015 then hocl can react with h2o2 to form 1o2 eq 9 secondly cl can react with oh to produce various reactive chlorine containing species including cl cloh and cl2 chen et al 2019 shah et al 2015 wang et al 2020c eqs 10 11 8 9 hocl ho2 cl 1o2 h2o 10 11 cl cl cl2 although previous studies showed that the chlorine containing species is weaker than the primary reactive species produced by aops such as oh wang et al 2011 the effect of cl on the removal mainly depends on the properties of degradable substrates for example it was reported that the removal rate constant of nap in feii edds uv paa system chen et al 2021 and diclofenac in zero valent copper zvc paa system were higher zhang et al 2021c while cl has been reported to slightly inhibit the degradation of tetracycline tc in the zero valent iron nzvi paa system zhang et al 2022 and smx in ruo2 supported multi walled carbon nanotube paa systems qian et al 2022 kim et al 2019 found that cl with the added dose from 100 μm to1000 μm had a negligible contribution to the degradation of carbamazepine cbz in the co paa system wang et al 2021 reported that cl had an insignificant effect on the degradation of smx in cofe2o4 paa system similar results were also found by wang et al 2020b hco3 is the most common and primary anion in groundwater previous studies showed that hco3 could inhibit the degradation of pollutants in some advanced oxidation processes yang et al 2017 implying that hco3 at groundwater environmental levels positively affects the removal of smx in this study the addition of hco3 inhibited the removal of smx and the intensity of inhibition was not sensitive to changes in concentration as the hco3 concentration increased smx removal decreased when adding 50 100 150 and 300 mg l of hco3 the removal of smx was 67 70 70 43 66 60 and 64 27 respectively compared with the removal of 93 52 without hco3 there was a certain degree of inhibition fig 5 c this may be because ch3c o oo and hco3 react to produce hco3 and co3 eqs 12 13 but hco3 and co3 had worse removal performance for smx the addition of hco3 inhibited the removal of smx which is similar to the conclusions mentioned in the literature smx removal was inhibited by hco3 in uv h2o2 yang et al 2017 and ruo2 supported multi walled carbon nanotube paa systems qian et al 2022 and tc removal was inhibited hco3 in nzvi paa system zhang et al 2022 12 13 hco 3 h 2 o h 3 o co 3 so4 2 does not change the ph value of the reaction system nor does it react with the oxidants of the ps system and h2o2 system however the removal efficiency of smx was suppressed when the so4 2 was added shown in fig 5 d there is no report on the effect of catalytic ability and degradation ability caused by so4 2 in the paa system but previous research indicated that so4 2 can be adsorbed by positively charged materials on the surface thereby reducing the number of active sites on the materials therefore so4 2 may compete with paa for active sites and inhibit the removal of smx wang and wang 2021 3 5 3 effect of humic acid and dissolved oxygen natural organic matter nom ubiquitous material in natural water bodies is electronic rich because it contains abundant oxygen containing functional groups carboxyl carbonyl and hydroxyl they may inhibit or strengthen the catalytic oxidation of pollutants according to previous research long et al 2019 michael kordatou et al 2015 humic acid ha as an important element of nom had been adequately investigated on its effect in aops huang et al 2021 zhou et al 2015b generally the addition of ha in the paa ac600 sxx system has no obvious effect on the degradation system as shown in fig 5 e the performance of the removal of smx by adding ha mainly depended on the concentration of ha ha inhibited the removal of smx at high concentrations over 5 mg l and promoted the removal of smx at low concentrations when the concentration of ha was low 1 mg l the removal was optimal and the removal of smx reached 95 96 at 90 min more than 93 52 without ha when the ha were at concentrations of 5 mg l 10 mg l and 50 mg l the removal at 90 min reached 93 50 93 58 and 91 75 when ha was at a low concentration less than 5 mg l ha might participate in the catalytic activation reaction chain and generate reactive species to promote smx oxidation degradation huang et al 2021 similar results were reported by zhou et al 2015b that ha at an environmentally relevant concentration less than 4 0 mg l strengthened the degradation of smx due to the quinone carbonyl c o content in ha smx removal decreased when the concentration of ha was at a high level probably because of the competing reaction of ha for the reactive species since electron rich sites of ha can captivate electrophilic reactive species michael kordatou et al 2015 ha could be adsorbed by the surface of carbon materials and occupy reactive sites therefore inhibiting the catalytic process long et al 2019 moreover the paa ac600 system was further operated in spiked real groundwater samples to assess its practical performance for smx removal as shown in fig 5 f the removal of smx was slightly suppressed and decreased by 12 after 90 min was observed in real groundwater this is mainly because groundwater is rich in bicarbonate ions results indicated that the paa ac600 system was prospective to be applied in real groundwater treatment the dissolved oxygen content of groundwater is slightly lower than that of surface water while diving groundwater dissolved oxygen levels has almost no effect on the paa ac600 smx system of this experiment the dissolved oxygen was adjusted to 5 5 mg l by controlling the nitrogen flow rate the measured real groundwater dissolved oxygen value was used as the experimental background value as shown in fig s14 when the dissolved oxygen in the solution decreased from 8 5 to 5 5 the smx removal was not greatly affected which may be because the dissolved oxygen in this system did not participate in the reaction 3 6 oxidation feature of other antibiotics considering that this system contains both free radical and non radical pathways the degradation of various antibiotics including sulfonamides sas smx sulfamethazine smt sulfadiazine sdz and fluoroquinolones ofloxacin ofx was further investigated to demonstrate the selectivity of the paa ac600 process for all selected compounds the degradation process followed first order kinetics fig 6 a the experiment showed that only ofx had the lowest removal by activated paa and the removal rate was 0 01240 min 1 however sa compounds with different substituents also showed significant differences in removal rates overall the removal rate of sa with six membered heterocyclic groups was lower than that of sas with five membered heterocyclic moieties for example the observed removal rates of stz and smx with a five membered heterocycle were higher than that of sdz fig 6 b respectively this result demonstrates the substituent dependent removal feature of paa ac600 which may be related to the aggressive behavior of active species the degradation process is highly electrophilic in nature and a similar phenomenon occurs in co ii doped g c3n4 paa system liu et al 2021 3 7 degradation pathway of smx and the biological toxicity of its intermediate products according to the results of the dft calculation table s5 lu and chen 2012 and uplc q tof ms analysis of the intermediate products the possible smx degradation pathway for the paa ac600 system was proposed in fig 7 the structural formula and molecular number of smx are shown in fig s15 in pathway 1 the benzene ring c 2 and or c 4 atoms are attacked to form the products p 1 and p 2 in pathway 2 the cleavage of the s n bond produced intermediate products p 2 and p 3 li et al 2021 reported that r o reacted with smx to break the s n bond in ru iii paa system while the cleavage of the s n bond was also reported in a co ii doped g c3n4 paa system for smx removal by an electron transfer mechanism liu et al 2021 this may be because the sulfonamide group has one of the most negative surfaces electrostatic potential esp values in the smx molecule which can be seen from the esp mapping molecule vdw surface in smx fig s16 the esp values near the atoms on the smx surface were shown in fig s17 therefore it is easy for the sulfonamide group to be attacked by attracting the electrophilic reagent through electrostatic attraction at the initial stage of the chemical reaction which leads to the cleavage of the s n bond in the sulfonamide group in pathway 3 the reaction of the nh2 group on the benzene ring with electrophiles since the nitrogen atom 17 n on the amino group has the largest value of the f function in the entire molecule and is extremely vulnerable to attack by electrophiles during this process n centered radical would be produced and then coupled to form azosulfamethoxazole p 5 m z 503 widely reported as an intermediate product of oxidation of smx in ru iii paa system li et al 2021 and co paa system wang et al 2020c while the coupling reaction between the n center radicals can only exit in aops dominated by a free radical mechanism which also confirmed the conclusion that r o exists in paa ac600 system liu et al 2021 in pathway 4 zhang et al 2021b the olefinic double bond bond 14 c 15 c on the isoxazole ring is attacked by the electrophilic r o and oxidized to p 7 m z 288 then the s n bond cleavage of p 7 formed p 4 m z 133 according to the calculation of the fukui function table s5 it was known that the nh2 is the most vulnerable site to be attacked by electrophiles in pathway 5 nh2 was oxidized by r o and converted to no2 nitrobenzene compound was produced p 8 m z 283 ding et al 2021 a similar reaction is also observed in co paa system was observed and wang et al 2020c indicated that the nh2 group in smx is vulnerable to r o the results of the dft calculation are consistent with the results of mass spectrometry which better explains the degradation mechanism of smx degradation intermediate compounds that are more toxic than the parent compound may appear during pharmaceutical removal mirzaei et al 2018 yan et al 2019 therefore the toxicity of smx and its degradation intermediates is calculated using ecosar 2 0 the acute toxicity endpoint values for aquatic organisms were displayed in table s6 it can be found that the acute toxicity of most intermediates is close to or even lower than the parent compound fig 8 the biological toxicity of the product p 7 is much lower than that of the parent compound while the toxicity of p 4 and p 5 has increased table s6 however according to the previous literature data the overall toxicity of the smx degradation system that produced p 4 lai et al 2018 and p 5 mirzaei et al 2018 are reduced respectively therefore although smx is not fully mineralized the overall toxicity is considerably reduced luminescent bacteria toxicity tests were conducted by vibrio qinghaiensis q67 for the validation of the toxicity of the degradation products mixture the luminescence l l0 of q67 which had been quenched when exposed to the reaction solution for 0 25 h was studied to evaluate the change of acute toxicity during the degradation process text s6 as shown in fig s18 there was almost no inhibition of q67 luminescence during the degradation of smx which indicated that the change in the toxicity during the degradation process was not obvious the results suggested that the mixture toxicity of degradation products is not higher than that of smx this was consistent with the results of the ecosar simulation in addition it was reported that the inhibitory effect of smx degradation products after advanced oxidation on escherichia coli is significantly weakened wang et al 2016 hence it can effectively inhibit the development of antibiotic resistance and the production of resistance genes in bacteria in the environment in summary the low impact groundwater antibiotic degradation system provided by this study has good application potential and prospects 4 conclusion this study is the first to systematically study the removal of smx via paa activated by the thermally modified activated carbon ac600 in the groundwater the ac600 exhibited an excellent oxidant utility owing to abundant defects and oxygen containing functional groups based on the quenching experiments and epr results paa can be effectively activated by ac600 and electron transfer process and r o including ch3c o o and ch3c o oo were responsible for the degradation of smx different kinds of pharmaceuticals were also investigated and the nap removal experiments also fully proved the existence and contribution of r o the paa ac600 system worked well at ph 3 9 and the removal of smx dropped sharply when the alkalinity of the solution increases the presence of so4 2 do and nom had negligible effects on the removal of smx hco3 had an inhibitory effect and chloride ion cl promoted the removal of smx and the system achieved better removal of smx in real groundwater the paa ac600 system showed excellent anti interference ability and satisfactory decontamination performance and had a good potential for groundwater organic pollutant remediation low impact groundwater organic pollutants treatment ideas are proposed for the first time which is expected to reduce groundwater pollution or secondary pollution during the degradation process it will also provide new insights into the economic environmentally friendly and effective metal free paa activator for groundwater remediation declaration of

16117,due to their unique surface structures and physicochemical properties microplastics mps can adsorb other contaminants thus impacting their toxicity and fate in aquatic ecosystems in the present study the adsorption and transportation of copper ions cu2 in polyethylene pe 5 and 150 μm and their combined effects on four submerged macrophyte species were assessed results demonstrated that the addition of pe reduced the cu2 concentration in copper sulfate cuso4 solution and the adsorption of cu2 in pe 10 mg l increased with cuso4 concentration 100 600 μmol l pe alone exhibited no inhibitory effects on macrophytes while cu2 showed fatal toxicity toward the macrophytes however the combination of pe and cu2 showed lower inhibitory effects on macrophytes and the toxicity attenuation varied among species additionally pe may act as a carrier like a trojan horse for the environmental transfer of cu2 thereby hosting cu2 toxicity against macrophytes in the imported environment our findings indicate that pe acts as both an antidote to and carrier of cu2 toxicity in macrophytes this study should help in clarifying the combined effects and risk assessments of mps and heavy metals in future studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics copper adsorption behavior combined effects submerged macrophytes carrier 1 introduction due to their favorable properties including durability and low cost plastics remain an essential product in modern life and continue to accumulate in large quantities in the environment barnes et al 2009 microplastics mps defined as plastics with a particle size 5 mm depeursinge et al 2010 originate from industrial and cleaning products and the breakdown of larger plastics cole et al 2011 cong et al 2019 mps are now ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems and arise emerging concern globally rochman 2018 compared with larger plastics mps accumulate more easily in biological systems through ingestion by organisms resulting in higher potential to induce toxicity avio et al 2015 wang et al 2018 researches have shown that exposure to polystyrene ps beads mean size 0 5 μm can significantly inhibit photosynthesis and reduce chlorophyll content in microalgae 3 8 μm chlorella vulgaris besseling et al 2014 fernández et al 2020 tunali et al 2020 in addition some mps e g ps beads 0 7 0 9 mm and polyvinyl chloride pvc fragments 1 6 0 8 mm exhibit significant adsorption of certain contaminants including persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals e g copper cu zinc zn and lead pb due to their larger specific surface area and hydrophobicity brennecke et al 2016 commercial mps have been widely applied to study the interaction behaviors between mps and other contaminants gao et al 2019 li et al 2020 mps primarily adsorb contaminants via adsorption sites on their surfaces or occasionally combine with contaminants via covalent or ionic bonds cao et al 2021 zhou et al 2020b as a result mp properties can have considerable influence on contaminant adsorption capacity smaller and regularly spherical shaped mps have a larger specific surface area and more adsorption sites and thus exhibit higher adsorption capacity brennecke et al 2016 gao et al 2019 lee and hur 2020 turner and holmes 2015 meanwhile mps in the environment are often aged heterogenetic and mixed with other chemicals under long term weathering li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020b weathering process in biological systems leads to a weaker mp structure and biofilm formation on the mp surface munoz et al 2021 therefore aged mps have more chemisorption sites and more frequent biological interactions on the surface substantial amounts of heavy metals have been found in mps collected in the field dobaradaran et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 reported that heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems is positively correlated with interactions between heavy metals and mps interactions i e adsorption and desorption between heavy metals and mps may alter their ecotoxicity and mobility as mps can easily migrate between and within aquatic systems and carry contaminants like a trojan horse liu et al 2018 however the co exposure of mps and heavy metals and their combined effects on organisms are usually neglected xia et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 studies have been conducted on the combined effects of mps and heavy metals on microalgae davarpanah and guilhermino 2019 liu et al 2021 wan et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2020 although the conclusions remain controversial research on chlorella vulgaris mean size 10 μm using mp beads mean size 250 μm ps and mean size 150 μm pvc and heavy metals cu2 and cadmium ions cd2 found that metal toxicity is attenuated after chemical co exposure wang et al 2021 with metal adsorption by the mps resulting in a decrease in the concentrations of cu2 and cd2 and thus reduced metal toxicity to microalgae in contrast research on tetraselmis chuii mean size 2 to 10 μm exposed to mps mean size 1 to 5 μm and au nanoparticles mean size 5 nm found that mixtures are more toxic to microalgae than the individual components davarpanah and guilhermino 2019 thus more species need to be studied regarding the combined effects of mps and heavy metals macrophytes play an important role in aquatic ecosystems and are often used as model plants in standardized toxicity tests for risk assessment jeppesen et al 1998 sesin et al 2021 among these plants submerged macrophytes can absorb and tolerate certain amounts of heavy metals but excessive exposure can cause harm xing et al 2013 yu et al 2020 in view of the wide distribution of mps and heavy metals in aquatic ecosystems and their inevitable interactions studies on the combined effects of metals and mps on submerged macrophytes are urgently needed cu is an indispensable trace element in organisms bhattacharya et al 2016 however as one of the most used metals ren et al 2009 zhang et al 2014a cu has become a contaminant of concern in aquatic environments ben sasson et al 2016 rehman et al 2019 pe is widely used due to its resistance to low temperature and corrosion artham et al 2009 and has become a global mp contaminant munier and bendell 2018 in the current study we investigated the adsorption behavior of cu2 on different sized pe 5 and 150 μm differences in pe adsorption abilities under different concentrations of cu2 and pe were also explored batch experiments measuring combined toxicity in four macrophyte species were conducted based on the inhibition of chlorophyll fluorescence growth rate chlorophyll content and bicarbonate utilization capacity the effect of pe as a carrier of cu2 was then assessed using a 96 h bioassay under different pe treatments we hypothesized that cu2 toxicity towards macrophytes could be alleviated by the addition of pe i e antidote effect and or pe could transport cu2 between environments thus introducing cu2 toxicity to those macrophytes i e carrier effect the results of this study should help improve our understanding of the combined effects and risk assessments of mps and heavy metals in future studies 2 materials

density of 0 94 0 99 kg m3 containing no additives zhou et al 2020a two sizes of pe i e 5 μm spe and 150 μm lpe were used for the experiments with surface areas of 672 4 and 477 6 m2 kg respectively table 1 the pe particles were gold plated and the surface microstructure fig 1 was examined using scanning electron microscopy sem tm3030 hitachi japan the cu2 stock solution 0 1 mol l was prepared using copper sulfate cuso4 and distilled water and then stored at 4 c four submerged macrophyte species i e cabomba caroliniana a gray ceratophyllum demersum l elodea nuttallii planch h st john and

pre cultivated separately in different concrete ponds 1 m 1 m 1 m filled with tap water in a greenhouse zhang et al 2019 2 2 adsorption of cuso4 on mps the effects of cuso4 or pe particle concentration on the amount of cu2 adsorbed by pe were investigated the pe stock solutions 1 g l were prepared with pe particles and distilled water prior to the tests the pe stock and cuso4 solutions were mixed quantitatively and used in the adsorption experiments to study the effects of cuso4 concentration on the ability of pe particles to adsorb cu2 adsorption experiments were conducted under different cuso4 concentrations 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 μmol l and a maintained pe particle concentration 10 mg l in the mixed solutions all tests were performed in a 300 ml solution in 500 ml glass flasks to avoid mps interference from other sources and all treatments had five replicates another adsorption test using different pe particle concentrations 10 100 500 1000 2000 and 5000 mg l was conducted to study its effects on the ability of pe to adsorb cu2 the particle size distribution and specific surface area of pe particles in solution with different concentrations were measured with laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 marvin england the d 10 d 50 d 90 represent the particle size corresponding to the cumulative particle size distribution percentage in the solution reaching 10 50 and 90 respectively in brief the cuso4 concentration was set to 100 μmol l and other conditions were the same as above the mixed solutions were shaken at 110 rpm for 12 h at a constant temperature of 28 c and then transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube for centrifugation at 300 rpm for 30 min at room temperature with the pe particles then filtered out we added quantitative sodium diethyldithiocarbamate c2h5 2ncssna 3h2o dropwise to the obtained supernatant followed by an appropriate amount of buffer solution nh3 nh4cl to adjust the ph to 8 11 to ensure the accuracy of the results absorbance of the final solution was then measured at a wavelength of 452 nm to determine the concentration of cu2 zuccarni and kampuš 2011 the adsorption of cu2 per unit mass of pe particles qe μmol cu2 mg was calculated using eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e w where c0 is the initial cu2 concentration μmol l ce is the remaining cu2 concentration in the solution μmol l and w is the mass concentration of pe particles mg l the langmuir freundlich and henry models were applied to fit the adsorption isotherms the langmuir model assumes that adsorption occurs at specific homogeneous adsorption sites of the adsorbent indicating chemisorption whereas the freundlich model assumes that adsorption occurs on heterogeneous surfaces of the adsorbent indicating physisorption foo and hameed 2010 model details are described in the supplementary materials 2 3 single and combined toxicity bioassays the effects of cuso4 on macrophytes under pe exposure were investigated all macrophytes were trimmed to 10 cm and cultivated in distilled water at room temperature for 24 h to ensure the same initial state prior to testing jiang et al 2014 experiments were performed in a growth cabinet under 28 c 125 μmol photon m2 s light photosynthetically active radiation par and 12 h 12 h light dark cycle to simulate a natural growth environment zhang et al 2019 the macrophytes were separately treated with cuso4 solution at various concentrations for 96 h in 500 ml glass flasks the macrophytes were then measured for pigment content chlorophyll a chl a chlorophyll b chl b and carotenoids by ethanol extraction cao et al 2014 and photosynthetic activity via changes in chlorophyll fluorescence chlf emissions maxwell and johnson 2000 the maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii fv fm and maximal electron transport rate etrmax of chlf were recorded using a pam 2500 chlorophyll fluorometer walz effeltrich germany and pamwin 3 software the chlf parameters were applied to indicate whether the macrophytes were under stress bussotti et al 2020 and fv fm was used to establish a dose response curve to reflect the relationship between cuso4 toxicity on macrophytes and cuso4 concentrations the half maximal effective concentration ec50 i e the point with the highest slope of the curve indicates that changes in cuso4 concentration around this point should significantly alter its toxicity to macrophytes huang et al 2020 lewis and thursby 2018 the cuso4 concentrations used in the mixed and single cu systems were the ec50 values of the corresponding macrophytes to investigate the combined effects of pe particles and cuso4 macrophytes were cultivated in a mixed cuso4 mp stock solution for 96 h under 28 c the initial ph of the toxicity experiment ranged within 5 5 6 0 and we manually altered it as 6 0 cao et al 2014 the experimental systems with no addition of pollutants included the control single pe system single cuso4 system and joint pe and cuso4 system distilled water was applied in the control for culture as it is reported to have no inhibitory effects on organisms in acute toxicity tests liu et al 2017 and plastic interference could be avoided the cuso4 concentrations in the experimental systems were set according to the ec50 values of each species and two different sized pe particles were applied in all pe systems 10 mg l consistent with environmental concentrations respectively the relative growth rate of plant length rgr l based on relative length changes in test subjects chen et al 2020 pigment content and chlf were then measured using eq 2 2 rgr l 1000 lo g 10 l lo g 10 l 0 t where l0 is the initial macrophyte length 10 cm l is the macrophyte length at the end of the experiment cm and t is the duration of the experiment d the unit of rgr l is μm d the final ph of the solution was measured to evaluate the changes in the plant s ability to utilize bicarbonate hco3 huang et al 2019 for this the treated macrophytes were washed and transferred for cultivation in sealed glass bottles containing 50 ml of buffer solution 1 mmol l na khco3 then placed under 24 h continuous light each treatment consisted of four replicates to confirm the reproducibility of the test 2 4 transfer and desorption of cu on mp particles two different sized mp particles were immersed in a high concentration cuso4 solution 0 1 mol l for 1 month prior to testing the mixed solution was then filtered through gridded glass microfiber 0 45 μm filter paper gf f 47 mm ø whatman usa with a vacuum pump the pe particles were extracted and configured into two different concentration solutions 10 and 100 mg l c demersum is often used as a model plant in standardized toxicity tests involving heavy metals e g cu and zn cao et al 2020 hak et al 2020 thomas et al 2016 based on known systems and our previous tests c demersum was chosen to perform the experiments in brief 10 cm shoots of c demersum were cultivated in the solutions with distilled water and virgin pe particle solution 100 mg l used as the control macrophyte treatments and cultivation conditions were the same as in section 2 3 each treatment consisted of four replicates the fv fm of c demersum was measured every 24 h to evaluate plant stress after 96 h plant length chlf pigment content and ability to utilize bicarbonate were measured to determine impact on macrophyte growth 2 5 statistical analysis r software v3 6 1 for windows was used to conduct all statistical analyses all datasets were checked for normal distribution and homogeneity of variance and log transformed when necessary the error bars in the figures indicate the standard deviation sd of four or five replicates one way analysis of variance anova was used for biotic variable analysis followed by tukey s multi comparison test when significant differences were found the level of significance was 0 05 3 results 3 1 adsorption of cu on mp particles particle size distribution and specific surface area of different concentrations of pe are shown in table 2 and fig 2 3 at concentrations of 10 500 mg l most spe particles were below 80 μm in size d 90 52 9 80 5 μm at concentrations of 10 100 mg l most lpe particles were below 140 μm in size d 90 133 137 μm with the increase in pe concentration particle size increased significantly at high concentrations 2000 mg l most lpe particles were greater than 1000 μm in size d 50 1000 μm d 90 2120 μm indicating significant aggregation of pe particles in the solution in addition with the increase in pe concentration 10 5000 mg l the average specific surface area of the two different sized pe particles decreased 561 2 96 98 m2 kg although the specific surface area of spe 561 2 118 7 m2 kg was higher than that of lpe 425 8 96 98 m2 kg reductions in cu2 concentration and qe of mixed solutions under different cuso4 or pe particle concentrations are shown in fig 4 and table s1 s2 respectively results indicated that the pe particles adsorbed cu2 and adsorption ability varied under different conditions table s3 both the cuso4 and pe particle concentrations significantly affected cu2 reduction for both lpe f 5 30 21 23 p 0 001 f 5 30 64 11 p 0 001 and spe particles f 5 30 34 71 p 0 001 f 5 30 43 19 p 0 001 there was however no consistent dose response relationship correspondingly the qe for both the lpe and spe particles was significantly affected by cuso4 concentration as the concentration of cuso4 increased the qe of the lpe particles increased 2 9 0 5 to 11 1 0 8 μmol mg significantly and then plateaued 10 6 0 9 μmol mg at the cuso4 concentration of 400 600 μmol l for spe particles the qe continued to increase with cuso4 concentration 4 0 0 4 to 21 7 1 3 μmol mg and became significantly higher than the qe of the lpe particles p 0 001 at the cuso4 concentration of 600 μmol l there were significant differences in the qe of the different sized pe particles under varying pe concentrations the qe was highest in the mixed solution with a pe particle concentration of 10 mg l 2 7 1 3 μmol mg for lpe 4 0 0 8 μmol mg for spe the increase in pe particle concentration resulted in a significant decrease in the qe of both the lpe f 5 30 234 9 p 0 001 and spe particles f 5 30 204 7 p 0 001 in addition the qe of the spe particles was significantly higher than that of the lpe particles 3 2 cu toxicity in submerged macrophytes dose response curves for the four selected macrophytes to cuso4 were constructed based on fv fm values and the indicators of ec50 were determined fig 5 thus reflecting tolerance to cu results showed that e nuttallii and c demersum had a similar ec50 6 6 1 4 μmol l 6 1 1 4 μmol l respectively and c caroliniana and h verticillata had a similar ec50 67 6 10 7 μmol l 55 9 9 1 μmol l respectively for cuso4 based on these results in the combined toxicity test the concentration of cuso4 used in the single cuso4 system and joint pe and cuso4 system for e nuttallii and c caroliniana was 6 μmol l and for c demersum and h verticillata was 60 μmol l 3 3 combined effects of mps and cu on macrophyte growth the responses of each macrophyte species to the control cuso4 pe particles and their mixture are shown in fig 6 and table s4 no significant differences were found in any parameter between the control and pe treatment groups table s5 thus indicating that pe particles had no explicit inhibitory effects on macrophytes regardless of particle size as shown in fig 6a compared with h verticillata exposed to the single cuso4 system the fv fm in the joint pe and cuso4 system increased by 97 6 reaching similar levels as the control this increasing trend in fv fm between the joint pe and cuso4 and single cuso4 systems was also found for c caroliniana 26 2 and e nuttallii 55 3 while the c demersum fv fm value only increased by 7 3 and showed no significant difference from the single cuso4 system correspondingly as seen in fig 6b the etrmax value obtained in the joint system was significantly higher than that obtained in the cuso4 system the increase in chlf parameters in the joint system compared to the single cuso4 system indicated attenuation of cu toxicity on the tested macrophytes the etrmax value of e nuttallii in the lpe joint system 88 0 23 0 μmol e m2 s was significantly higher than that in the single cuso4 system 44 7 29 4 μmol e m2 s while the spe joint system 68 0 27 1 μmol e m2 s did not show a significant difference from the single cuso4 system except for this no significant differences in chlf parameters were found between the lpe and spe joint systems suggesting that pe size did not affect the level of cu toxicity attenuation on the tested macrophytes during the tests we observed that macrophyte shoots under cuso4 toxicity became fragile and some decayed into fragments this was further reflected by the mostly negative rgr l values log transformed shown in fig 6c for macrophytes in the single cuso4 system compared with the single cuso4 system the rgr l values in the joint pe and cuso4 system increased the maximum rgr l of the joint systems was found for e nuttallii 1 1 0 2 which also unexpectedly had an rgr l value 0 0 4 0 3 for the single cuso4 system the rgr l of the joint group containing lpe particles was higher than that containing spe particles for instance the rgr l value for h verticillata in the joint group with lpe particles was 0 4 0 8 but with spe particles was 2 3 0 9 the response of leaf chl a among the different systems was similar to that of rgr l the addition of pe particles into the cuso4 system resulted in an increase in leaf chl a compared with the single cuso4 system fig 6e for c caroliniana leaf chl a in the joint system 0 30 0 05 mg g was marginally lower than that in the control 0 55 0 19 mg g and five times that in the single cuso4 system 0 06 0 06 mg g there were no significant differences in leaf chl a between the joint systems with different sized pe particles for leaf chl b levels in h verticillata were 52 1 higher in the joint system than in the single cuso4 system 0 24 0 03 mg g no significant differences in chl b were found in any system for c caroliniana and c demersum for e nuttallii chl b values in the single cuso4 system 0 20 0 03 mg g and joint system 0 17 0 05 mg g were significantly lower than that in the control 0 36 0 05 mg g the differences in growth rate and chlorophyll content between the systems consistent with the chlf parameters indicated that the addition of pe weakened the inhibitory effect of cuso4 on macrophytes except for c caroliniana the final ph in the control for the tested species was higher than 9 fig 6b and the final ph was highest for h verticillata 10 4 0 3 these results indicate that c demersum e nuttallii and h verticillata had the ability to utilize bicarbonate in the solution with h verticillata showing the strongest ability among them the final ph of the plants declined to 7 8 8 1 in both the single cuso4 and joint pe and cuso4 systems however the final ph of h verticillata in the joint system reached 8 9 0 2 above 9 in some replicates suggesting partial restoration of its ability to utilize bicarbonate in the solution 3 4 transportation of cu on mps the fv fm values of c demersum after 4 day exposure are shown in fig 7 and table s6 results showed that the fv fm of c demersum exposed to pe pre soaked in cuso4 decreased at the end of exposure the fv fm of c demersum in the 100 mg l pre soaked pe system decreased to 0 and the macrophytes died similarly in the 10 mg l pre soaked lpe and spe systems the fv fm values were 0 28 0 29 and 0 05 0 1 respectively which were significantly lower than the fv fm in the virgin pe system these results indicated that the pre soaked pe transferred into the system had an inhibitory or even lethal effect on c demersum meanwhile fv fm in the 10 mg l pre soaked lpe system was markedly higher than that in the other pre soaked pe treatments indicating minor toxicity other physiological indicators in c demersum at the end of exposure are shown in fig 8 and table s7 regardless of pe particle size or concentration the chl a chl b and final ph values in c demersum cultured in the pre soaked pe system were similar and significantly lower than those cultured in the virgin pe system table s8 except for chl a of c demersum in the 10 mg l pre soaked lpe system which was higher than that in all other pre soaked pe systems 4 discussion 4 1 adsorption of cu on mp particles in aquatic environments heavy metals have a strong affinity for organic polymers including mps ashton et al 2010 rios et al 2007 and can be adsorbed at the mp interface where they bind with surface ligands ashton et al 2010 rios et al 2007 town et al 2018 in previous laboratory studies virgin mps 10 and 50 μm ps pellets have been shown to absorb a certain amount 0 26 0 58 mg g of heavy metals pb cu cd and nickel yuan et al 2020 in the current study adsorption capacity 3 84 5 76 mg g was much higher under the same conditions mps concentration 500 mg l potentially due to the physical properties of the pe particles i e smaller size which resulted in a higher specific surface area and stronger cu2 adsorption similarly our results were lower than those described by zong et al 2021 who used 0 5 μm sized ps particles ca 26 2 0 5 mg g thus the adsorption rate of mps for heavy metals appears to be related to their physical and chemical properties wang et al 2018 various laboratory studies have confirmed that mp absorption of heavy metals increases with heavy metal concentration yuan et al 2020 and mp specific surface area li et al 2020 yu et al 2021 in the present study the goodness of fit for all pe isotherms was similar table s9 although the langmuir model did not fit the spe particles the heavy metal adsorption capacities of mps are related to the environmental conditions and their surface properties including hydrophobic interactions van der waals forces hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions gao et al 2019 for the pe used in the present study adsorption behaviors may be explained by electrostatic interactions cao et al 2021 zhou et al 2020c as ionic bond strength and binding rate are related to ion concentration in solution and adsorption processes are in dynamic equilibrium changes in ion concentration can cause the desorption of adsorbed ions yang et al 2019 here we observed that the amount of cu2 adsorbed by the pe particles increased with increasing concentration of cuso4 while cu2 adsorption by the lpe particles reached saturation at cuso4 concentrations of 400 600 μmol l the spe particles exhibited greater adsorption potential and exceeded the adsorption achieved by the lpe particles fig 4c for spherical particles like pe particle in the tests an increase in size results in a decrease in specific surface area under the same weight krika and benlahbib 2015 davarpanah and guilhermino 2019 found higher aggregation and sedimentation in high concentration mp solutions compared with low concentration mp solutions mp aggregation in solution can result in irregularly shaped and large sized plastic clusters as well as an increase in sedimentation ratio aggregation can lead to a decrease in the specific surface area of mps and sedimentation can result in a decrease in the total amount of mps involved in adsorption activities correspondingly in the present study pe agglomerated to form larger particles table 2 as the concentration of pe increased while both total adsorption and unit adsorption capacity of the pe particles to cu2 decreased thus massive aggregation and sedimentation of pe particles may partially explain the decrease in adsorption capacity found in our study unlike the virgin mps used in our experiments mps in the environment are often under long term aging and weathering processes and thus tend to be more reactive due to higher specific surface areas brennecke et al 2016 holmes et al 2012 vedolin et al 2018 this is attributed to the processes of photo mechanical and oxidative degradation resulting in the formation of new functional groups on the mp surfaces chandra and rustgi 1997 mato et al 2001 i e mp surface charge and porosity increase via the accumulation of chemical hydrogens and biofilms artham et al 2009 holmes et al 2012 mato et al 2001 morét ferguson et al 2010 thus we anticipate that adsorption between aged mps and heavy metals should be higher than that found in laboratory tests and their complex interactions should be considered due to the characteristics of aging mps 4 2 combined effects of mps and cuso4on macrophytes high concentrations of cu can be toxic to the growth and physiological activities of plants lewis et al 2001 nagajyoti et al 2010 and different plants have different tolerances to cu pedersen et al 2000 rehman et al 2019 here the bioassay results indicated that macrophyte growth and leaf chlorophyll indicators decreased significantly following exposure to cuso4 compared to the control and single pe system and the cuso4 ec50 values of each species varied additionally evidence indicates that interactions between mps and other contaminants in the environment can alter their ecotoxicity to aquatic organisms xia et al 2020 in this study the addition of pe particles significantly reduced cuso4 toxicity in the submerged macrophytes this is consistent with the study of zhu et al 2020 who found that the toxic effects of cu nanoparticles ca 30 nm on the growth rate of skeletonema costatum average size 10 μm decline significantly with the addition of mps polyvinyl chloride 1 μm these results suggest that adsorption of cu2 and cu nanoparticles on mps can alleviate nano cu toxicity in skeletonema costatum the authors proposed that there are two possible mechanisms for this alleviation of toxicity one mechanism may be that mps characterized with low toxicity at low concentrations adsorb some cu2 thus decreasing its bioavailability for microalgae this inference is supported by our results showing that pe reduced the toxicity of cuso4 to the macrophytes fig 6 the second mechanism may be that mps cover the surface of the cell thereby blocking contact between the cell and cu2 and reducing their interactions in contrast to our study tunali et al 2020 reported that based on differences in growth rate and chl a of chlorella vulgaris size of 2 to 10 μm the toxicity of mp metal combinations is higher than that of single mps ps 0 5 μm or metals cu zn and manganese interestingly the authors argued that mps are adsorbed and embedded in the algal cells thereby providing channels for the metals to contact the cells the difference between that study and our results could be attributed to mp size with the larger mps 5 and 150 μm in our study unlikely to become embedded in the macrophyte cells in addition as macrophyte leaves 2 5 cm are much larger than microalgae the pe particles 5 and 150 μm could not cover the surface of the leaves as they could microalgae indicating that the first mechanism is a more reasonable explanation of cu toxicity attenuation in our study mps are also reported to have a direct inhibitory effect on macrophyte growth van weert et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 zhou et al 2020a in the environment although obvious phytotoxicity was not found in the present study smaller mps nanoplastics exhibit higher phytotoxic activity van weert et al 2019 and can affect organisms at the cellular level zhu et al 2020 thus the final combined effects of mps and heavy metals are correlated with mp size and concentration interestingly the mp particles exhibited a size effect on cu2 adsorption in the adsorption experiments section 3 1 but showed no size effect on cu2 toxicity in the combined exposure experiments according to the adsorption experiment when the concentration of cuso4 was lower than 100 μmol l the difference in the adsorption of cu2 between the two different sized pe particles was not significant fig 4 in the combined exposure experiment the cuso4 concentrations used for the four macrophytes were lower than 100 μmol l fig 5 and thus no significant differences in the detoxification effects were found between the different sized pe particles additionally the degree of cuso4 phytotoxicity attenuation by the pe particles varied among the different macrophyte species for h verticillata the chlf parameters and chl a content in the joint pe and cuso4 system were similar to those of the control in addition the ability of h verticillata to utilize bicarbonate was not significantly inhibited in the joint system aquatic plants utilize bicarbonate in various ways giordano et al 2005 and of the three enzymes involved sharkia et al 1994 the ubiquitous external carbonic anhydrase caext dimario et al 2018 moroney et al 2001 is positively correlated with bicarbonate utilization efficiency beer and rehnberg 1997 björk et al 1997 previous studies have indicated that excessive metal ions cu2 cd2 and zn2 in the environment can significantly inhibit caext activity bielmyer et al 2010 demirdağ et al 2014 wang et al 2005 this may explain the inhibitory effect of cuso4 containing toxic cu2 on bicarbonate utilization efficiency of macrophytes in the present study fig 6d in addition h verticillata possesses complex biochemical co2 concentrating mechanisms as found in ottelia alismoides in the same family and diverse methods of bicarbonate use huang et al 2018 shao et al 2017 zhang et al 2014b which may contribute to the stronger detoxification effect of pe on cuso4 4 3 carrier effect of mps in the present study we used pe as a carrier for cu2 and assessed the inhibitory effects of pe with and without cu2 on c demersum results indicated that pe with cu2 100 mg l of 5 μm and 150 μm 10 mg l of 5 μm showed acute toxicity fv fm 0 after 72 h in c demersum fig 8 as virgin pe 100 mg l had no apparent inhibitory effect on c demersum the reduction in fv fm final ph and chlorophyll content in c demersum cultivated in pe with cu2 must have been caused by the desorption or accumulation of cu2 as c demersum decayed and died within a short period the cu2 desorbed in the culture must have reached a much higher level than ec50 ca 6 μmol l as seen in the dose response curves since the adsorption of cu2 on pe is in a dynamic equilibrium the change of cuso4 concentration should lead to the adsorption and desorption of cu2 as the results in 3 1 indicated a decrease in cuso4 concentration resulted in a decrease in qe we concluded that transportation by pe particles between high and low concentrations of cu2 resulted in the desorption of cu2 in the low concentration culture correspondingly the fv fm and chl a of 10lpe with cu were exceptionally large among other pe with cu treatments under the same cu2 and pe concentrations the adsorption capacity of lpe was smaller than spe thus compared to other treatments of pe with cu treatment of 10lpe with cu should have the smallest amount of cu2 adsorption and the released cu2 concentrations thus are expected to be the lowest in the experimental environment therewith relative endpoints fv fm and chl a of macrophytes under the treatment of 10lpe with cu should be higher than those of other treatment groups of pe with cu as fv fm and chl a reflects the degree of stress that plants receive bussotti et al 2020 the introduction of other pollutants e g heavy metals and organic pollutants into new environments by mps and their more severe toxic effects on organisms when combined may occur frequently in natural aquatic ecosystems brennecke et al 2016 holmes et al 2012 unlike virgin pe used in experiments many additives are used in the production of plastics eerkes medrano et al 2015 leading to the release of large amounts of harmful substances during environmental degradation cole et al 2011 concurrently aged mps exhibit greater adsorption capacity for other contaminants than virgin mps wang et al 2021a and thus their transportation to different environments could cause adverse impacts on those organisms within in the present study we investigated the effects of mps as heavy metal carriers on macrophytes for the first time based on our findings research on the combined effects of mps and other contaminants should consider this carrier effect and additional macrophyte based studies should be conducted 5 conclusion in the current study we used commercial mps to mimic the behavior of mps found in the natural environment results showed that the addition of pe particles 5 and 150 μm increased the adsorption of cu2 and reduced the concentration of cu2 in the solution the adsorption amount increased with increasing cuso4 concentration or decreasing pe concentration the pe particles alone had no direct inhibitory effect on the submerged macrophytes but when combined with cuso4 reduced the toxicity of cu2 to macrophyte growth and photosynthesis the degree of toxicity attenuation by pe particles was strongest in h verticillata and showed no correlation with particle size however the transport of pe with cu2 induced toxicity against c demersum in culture in conclusion the mps showed dual effects on macrophytes i e mitigating the toxicity of other contaminants through adsorption and importing external pollutants

16117,due to their unique surface structures and physicochemical properties microplastics mps can adsorb other contaminants thus impacting their toxicity and fate in aquatic ecosystems in the present study the adsorption and transportation of copper ions cu2 in polyethylene pe 5 and 150 μm and their combined effects on four submerged macrophyte species were assessed results demonstrated that the addition of pe reduced the cu2 concentration in copper sulfate cuso4 solution and the adsorption of cu2 in pe 10 mg l increased with cuso4 concentration 100 600 μmol l pe alone exhibited no inhibitory effects on macrophytes while cu2 showed fatal toxicity toward the macrophytes however the combination of pe and cu2 showed lower inhibitory effects on macrophytes and the toxicity attenuation varied among species additionally pe may act as a carrier like a trojan horse for the environmental transfer of cu2 thereby hosting cu2 toxicity against macrophytes in the imported environment our findings indicate that pe acts as both an antidote to and carrier of cu2 toxicity in macrophytes this study should help in clarifying the combined effects and risk assessments of mps and heavy metals in future

including durability and low cost plastics remain an essential product in modern life and continue to accumulate in large quantities in the environment barnes et al 2009 microplastics mps defined as

aquatic ecosystems and arise emerging concern globally rochman 2018 compared with larger plastics mps accumulate more easily in biological systems through ingestion by organisms resulting in higher

have considerable influence on contaminant adsorption capacity smaller and regularly spherical shaped mps have a larger specific surface area and more adsorption sites and thus exhibit higher adsorption capacity brennecke et al 2016 gao et al 2019 lee and hur 2020 turner and holmes 2015 meanwhile mps in the environment are often aged heterogenetic and mixed with other chemicals under long term weathering li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020b weathering process in biological systems leads to a weaker mp structure and biofilm formation on the mp surface munoz et al 2021 therefore aged mps have more chemisorption sites and more frequent biological interactions on the surface substantial amounts of heavy metals have been found in mps collected in the field dobaradaran et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 reported that heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems is positively correlated with interactions between heavy metals and mps interactions i e adsorption and desorption between heavy metals and mps may alter their ecotoxicity and mobility as mps can easily migrate between and within aquatic systems and carry contaminants like a trojan horse liu et al 2018 however the co exposure of mps and heavy metals and their combined effects on organisms are usually neglected xia et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 studies have been conducted on the combined effects of mps and heavy metals on microalgae davarpanah and guilhermino 2019 liu et al 2021 wan et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2020 although the conclusions remain controversial research on chlorella vulgaris mean size 10 μm using mp beads mean size 250 μm ps and mean size 150 μm pvc and heavy metals cu2 and cadmium ions cd2 found that metal toxicity is attenuated after chemical co exposure wang et al 2021 with metal adsorption by the mps resulting in a decrease in the concentrations of cu2 and cd2 and thus reduced metal toxicity to microalgae in contrast research on tetraselmis chuii mean size 2 to 10 μm exposed to mps mean size 1 to 5 μm and au nanoparticles mean size 5 nm found that mixtures are more toxic to microalgae than the individual components davarpanah and guilhermino 2019 thus more species need to be studied regarding the combined effects of mps and heavy metals macrophytes play an important role in aquatic ecosystems and are often used as model plants in standardized toxicity tests for risk assessment jeppesen et al 1998 sesin et al 2021 among these plants submerged macrophytes can absorb and tolerate certain amounts of heavy metals but excessive exposure can cause harm xing et al 2013 yu et al 2020 in view of the wide distribution of mps and heavy metals in aquatic ecosystems and their inevitable interactions studies on the combined effects of metals and mps on submerged macrophytes are urgently needed cu is an indispensable trace element in organisms bhattacharya et al 2016 however as one of the most used metals ren et al 2009 zhang et al 2014a cu has become a contaminant of concern in aquatic environments ben sasson et al 2016 rehman et al 2019 pe is widely used due to its resistance to low temperature and corrosion artham et al 2009 and has become a global mp contaminant munier and bendell 2018 in the current study we investigated the adsorption behavior of cu2 on different sized pe 5 and 150 μm differences in pe adsorption abilities under different concentrations of cu2 and pe were also explored batch experiments measuring combined toxicity in four macrophyte species were conducted based on the inhibition of chlorophyll fluorescence growth rate chlorophyll content and bicarbonate utilization capacity the effect of pe as a carrier of cu2 was then assessed using a 96 h bioassay under different pe treatments we hypothesized that cu2 toxicity towards macrophytes could be alleviated by the addition of pe i e antidote effect and or pe could transport cu2 between environments thus introducing cu2 toxicity to those macrophytes i e carrier effect the results of this study should help improve our understanding of the combined effects and risk assessments of mps and heavy metals in future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 material preparation industrially synthesized pe particles were purchased from zhongcheng plastic co ltd guangdong china the pe particles were inert spherically shaped powders with a density of 0 94 0 99 kg m3 containing no additives zhou et al 2020a two sizes of pe i e 5 μm spe and 150 μm lpe were used for the experiments with surface areas of 672 4 and 477 6 m2 kg respectively table 1 the pe particles were gold plated and the surface microstructure fig 1 was examined using scanning electron microscopy sem tm3030 hitachi japan the cu2 stock solution 0 1 mol l was prepared using copper sulfate cuso4 and distilled water and then stored at 4 c four submerged macrophyte species i e cabomba caroliniana a gray ceratophyllum demersum l elodea nuttallii planch h st john and hydrilla verticillata linn f r were collected from freshwater ponds in august 2020 at wuhan botany garden chinese academy of sciences n 30 32 42 29 e 114 25 4 44 fig s1 the collected plants were then pre cultivated separately in different concrete ponds 1 m 1 m 1 m filled with tap water in a greenhouse zhang et al 2019 2 2 adsorption of cuso4 on mps the effects of cuso4 or pe particle concentration on the amount of cu2 adsorbed by pe were investigated the pe stock solutions 1 g l were prepared with pe particles and distilled water prior to the tests the pe stock and cuso4 solutions were mixed quantitatively and used in the adsorption experiments to study the effects of cuso4 concentration on the ability of pe particles to adsorb cu2 adsorption experiments were conducted under different cuso4 concentrations 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 μmol l and a maintained pe particle concentration 10 mg l in the mixed solutions all tests were performed in a 300 ml solution in 500 ml glass flasks to avoid mps interference from other sources and all treatments had five replicates another adsorption test using different pe particle concentrations 10 100 500 1000 2000 and 5000 mg l was conducted to study its effects on the ability of pe to adsorb cu2 the particle size distribution and specific surface area of pe particles in solution with different concentrations were measured with laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 marvin england the d 10 d 50 d 90 represent the particle size corresponding to the cumulative particle size distribution percentage in the solution reaching 10 50 and 90 respectively in brief the cuso4 concentration was set to 100 μmol l and other conditions were the same as above the mixed solutions were shaken at 110 rpm for 12 h at a constant temperature of 28 c and then transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube for centrifugation at 300 rpm for 30 min at room temperature with the pe particles then filtered out we added quantitative sodium diethyldithiocarbamate c2h5 2ncssna 3h2o dropwise to the obtained supernatant followed by an appropriate amount of buffer solution nh3 nh4cl to adjust the ph to 8 11 to ensure the accuracy of the results absorbance of the final solution was then measured at a wavelength of 452 nm to determine the concentration of cu2 zuccarni and kampuš 2011 the adsorption of cu2 per unit mass of pe particles qe μmol cu2 mg was calculated using eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e w where c0 is the initial cu2 concentration μmol l ce is the remaining cu2 concentration in the solution μmol l and w is the mass concentration of pe particles mg l the langmuir freundlich and henry models were applied to fit the adsorption isotherms the langmuir model assumes that adsorption occurs at specific homogeneous adsorption sites of the adsorbent indicating chemisorption whereas the freundlich model assumes that adsorption occurs on heterogeneous surfaces of the adsorbent indicating physisorption foo and hameed 2010 model details are described in the supplementary materials 2 3 single and combined toxicity bioassays the effects of cuso4 on macrophytes under pe exposure were investigated all macrophytes were trimmed to 10 cm and cultivated in distilled water at room temperature for 24 h to ensure the same initial state prior to testing jiang et al 2014 experiments were performed in a growth cabinet under 28 c 125 μmol photon m2 s light photosynthetically active radiation par and 12 h 12 h light dark cycle to simulate a natural growth environment zhang et al 2019 the macrophytes were separately treated with cuso4 solution at various concentrations for 96 h in 500 ml glass flasks the macrophytes were then measured for pigment content chlorophyll a chl a chlorophyll b chl b and carotenoids by ethanol extraction cao et al 2014 and photosynthetic activity via changes in chlorophyll fluorescence chlf emissions maxwell and johnson 2000 the maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii fv fm and maximal electron transport rate etrmax of chlf were recorded using a pam 2500 chlorophyll fluorometer walz effeltrich germany and pamwin 3 software the chlf parameters were applied to indicate whether the macrophytes were under stress bussotti et al 2020 and fv fm was used to establish a dose response curve to reflect the relationship between cuso4 toxicity on macrophytes and cuso4 concentrations the half maximal effective concentration ec50 i e the point with the highest slope of the curve indicates that changes in cuso4 concentration around this point should significantly alter its toxicity to macrophytes huang et al 2020 lewis and thursby 2018 the cuso4 concentrations used in the mixed and single cu systems were the ec50 values of the corresponding macrophytes to investigate the combined effects of pe particles and cuso4 macrophytes were cultivated in a mixed cuso4 mp stock solution for 96 h under 28 c the initial ph of the toxicity experiment ranged within 5 5 6 0 and we manually altered it as 6 0 cao et al 2014 the experimental systems with no addition of pollutants included the control single pe system single cuso4 system and joint pe and cuso4 system distilled water was applied in the control for culture as it is reported to have no inhibitory effects on organisms in acute toxicity tests liu et al 2017 and plastic interference could be avoided the cuso4 concentrations in the experimental systems were set according to the ec50 values of each species and two different sized pe particles were applied in all pe systems 10 mg l consistent with environmental concentrations respectively the relative growth rate of plant length rgr l based on relative length changes in test subjects chen et al 2020 pigment content and chlf were then measured using eq 2 2 rgr l 1000 lo g 10 l lo g 10 l 0 t where l0 is the initial macrophyte length 10 cm l is the macrophyte length at the end of the experiment cm and t is the duration of the experiment d the unit of rgr l is μm d the final ph of the solution was measured to evaluate the changes in the plant s ability to utilize bicarbonate hco3 huang et al 2019 for this the treated macrophytes were washed and transferred for cultivation in sealed glass bottles containing 50 ml of buffer solution 1 mmol l na khco3 then placed under 24 h continuous light each treatment consisted of four replicates to confirm the reproducibility of the test 2 4 transfer and desorption of cu on mp particles two different sized mp particles were immersed in a high concentration cuso4 solution 0 1 mol l for 1 month prior to testing the mixed solution was then filtered through gridded glass microfiber 0 45 μm filter paper gf f 47 mm ø whatman usa with a vacuum pump the pe particles were extracted and configured into two different concentration solutions 10 and 100 mg l c demersum is often used as a model plant in standardized toxicity tests involving heavy metals e g cu and zn cao et al 2020 hak et al 2020 thomas et al 2016 based on known systems and our previous tests c demersum was chosen to perform the experiments in brief 10 cm shoots of c demersum were cultivated in the solutions with distilled water and virgin pe particle solution 100 mg l used as the control macrophyte treatments and cultivation conditions were the same as in section 2 3 each treatment consisted of four replicates the fv fm of c demersum was measured every 24 h to evaluate plant stress after 96 h plant length chlf pigment content and ability to utilize bicarbonate were measured to determine impact on macrophyte growth 2 5 statistical analysis r software v3 6 1 for windows was used to conduct all statistical analyses all datasets were checked for normal distribution and homogeneity of variance and log transformed when necessary the error bars in the figures indicate the standard deviation sd of four or five replicates one way analysis of variance anova was used for biotic variable analysis followed by tukey s multi comparison test when significant differences were found the level of significance was 0 05 3 results 3 1 adsorption of cu on mp particles particle size distribution and specific surface area of different concentrations of pe are shown in table 2 and fig 2 3 at concentrations of 10 500 mg l most spe particles were below 80 μm in size d 90 52 9 80 5 μm at concentrations of 10 100 mg l most lpe particles were below 140 μm in size d 90 133 137 μm with the increase in pe concentration particle size increased significantly at high concentrations 2000 mg l most lpe particles were greater than 1000 μm in size d 50 1000 μm d 90 2120 μm indicating significant aggregation of pe particles in the solution in addition with the increase in pe concentration 10 5000 mg l the average specific surface area of the two different sized pe particles decreased 561 2 96 98 m2 kg although the specific surface area of spe 561 2 118 7 m2 kg was higher than that of lpe 425 8 96 98 m2 kg reductions in cu2 concentration and qe of mixed solutions under different cuso4 or pe particle concentrations are shown in fig 4 and table s1 s2 respectively results indicated that the pe particles adsorbed cu2 and adsorption ability varied under different conditions table s3 both the cuso4 and pe particle concentrations significantly affected cu2 reduction for both lpe f 5 30 21 23 p 0 001 f 5 30 64 11 p 0 001 and spe particles f 5 30 34 71 p 0 001 f 5 30 43 19 p 0 001 there was however no consistent dose response relationship correspondingly the qe for both the lpe and spe particles was significantly affected by cuso4 concentration as the concentration of cuso4 increased the qe of the lpe particles increased 2 9 0 5 to 11 1 0 8 μmol mg significantly and then plateaued 10 6 0 9 μmol mg at the cuso4 concentration of 400 600 μmol l for spe particles the qe continued to increase with cuso4 concentration 4 0 0 4 to 21 7 1 3 μmol mg and became significantly higher than the qe of the lpe particles p 0 001 at the cuso4 concentration of 600 μmol l there were significant differences in the qe of the different sized pe particles under varying pe concentrations the qe was highest in the mixed solution with a pe particle concentration of 10 mg l 2 7 1 3 μmol mg for lpe 4 0 0 8 μmol mg for spe the increase in pe particle concentration resulted in a significant decrease in the qe of both the lpe f 5 30 234 9 p 0 001 and spe particles f 5 30 204 7 p 0 001 in addition the qe of the spe particles was significantly higher than that of the lpe particles 3 2 cu toxicity in submerged macrophytes dose response curves for the four selected macrophytes to cuso4 were constructed based on fv fm values and the indicators of ec50 were determined fig 5 thus reflecting tolerance to cu results showed that e nuttallii and c demersum had a similar ec50 6 6 1 4 μmol l 6 1 1 4 μmol l respectively and c caroliniana and h verticillata had a similar ec50 67 6 10 7 μmol l 55 9 9 1 μmol l respectively for cuso4 based on these results in the combined toxicity test the concentration of cuso4 used in the single cuso4 system and joint pe and cuso4 system for e nuttallii and c caroliniana was 6 μmol l and for c demersum and h verticillata was 60 μmol l 3 3 combined effects of mps and cu on macrophyte growth the responses of each macrophyte species to the control cuso4 pe particles and their mixture are shown in fig 6 and table s4 no significant differences were found in any parameter between the control and pe treatment groups table s5 thus indicating that pe particles had no explicit inhibitory effects on macrophytes regardless of particle size as shown in fig 6a compared with h verticillata exposed to the single cuso4 system the fv fm in the joint pe and cuso4 system increased by 97 6 reaching similar levels as the control this increasing trend in fv fm between the joint pe and cuso4 and single cuso4 systems was also found for c caroliniana 26 2 and e nuttallii 55 3 while the c demersum fv fm value only increased by 7 3 and showed no significant difference from the single cuso4 system correspondingly as seen in fig 6b the etrmax value obtained in the joint system was significantly higher than that obtained in the cuso4 system the increase in chlf parameters in the joint system compared to the single cuso4 system indicated attenuation of cu toxicity on the tested macrophytes the etrmax value of e nuttallii in the lpe joint system 88 0 23 0 μmol e m2 s was significantly higher than that in the single cuso4 system 44 7 29 4 μmol e m2 s while the spe joint system 68 0 27 1 μmol e m2 s did not show a significant difference from the single cuso4 system except for this no significant differences in chlf parameters were found between the lpe and spe joint systems suggesting that pe size did not affect the level of cu toxicity attenuation on the tested macrophytes during the tests we observed that macrophyte shoots under cuso4 toxicity became fragile and some decayed into fragments this was further reflected by the mostly negative rgr l values log transformed shown in fig 6c for macrophytes in the single cuso4 system compared with the single cuso4 system the rgr l values in the joint pe and cuso4 system increased the maximum rgr l of the joint systems was found for e nuttallii 1 1 0 2 which also unexpectedly had an rgr l value 0 0 4 0 3 for the single cuso4 system the rgr l of the joint group containing lpe particles was higher than that containing spe particles for instance the rgr l value for h verticillata in the joint group with lpe particles was 0 4 0 8 but with spe particles was 2 3 0 9 the response of leaf chl a among the different systems was similar to that of rgr l the addition of pe particles into the cuso4 system resulted in an increase in leaf chl a compared with the single cuso4 system fig 6e for c caroliniana leaf chl a in the joint system 0 30 0 05 mg g was marginally lower than that in the control 0 55 0 19 mg g and five times that in the single cuso4 system 0 06 0 06 mg g there were no significant differences in leaf chl a between the joint systems with different sized pe particles for leaf chl b levels in h verticillata were 52 1 higher in the joint system than in the single cuso4 system 0 24 0 03 mg g no significant differences in chl b were found in any system for c caroliniana and c demersum for e nuttallii chl b values in the single cuso4 system 0 20 0 03 mg g and joint system 0 17 0 05 mg g were significantly lower than that in the control 0 36 0 05 mg g the differences in growth rate and chlorophyll content between the systems consistent with the chlf parameters indicated that the addition of pe weakened the inhibitory effect of cuso4 on macrophytes except for c caroliniana the final ph in the control for the tested species was higher than 9 fig 6b and the final ph was highest for h verticillata 10 4 0 3 these results indicate that c demersum e nuttallii and h verticillata had the ability to utilize bicarbonate in the solution with h verticillata showing the strongest ability among them the final ph of the plants declined to 7 8 8 1 in both the single cuso4 and joint pe and cuso4 systems however the final ph of h verticillata in the joint system reached 8 9 0 2 above 9 in some replicates suggesting partial restoration of its ability to utilize bicarbonate in the solution 3 4 transportation of cu on mps the fv fm values of c demersum after 4 day exposure are shown in fig 7 and table s6 results showed that the fv fm of c demersum exposed to pe pre soaked in cuso4 decreased at the end of exposure the fv fm of c demersum in the 100 mg l pre soaked pe system decreased to 0 and the macrophytes died similarly in the 10 mg l pre soaked lpe and spe systems the fv fm values were 0 28 0 29 and 0 05 0 1 respectively which were significantly lower than the fv fm in the virgin pe system these results indicated that the pre soaked pe transferred into the system had an inhibitory or even lethal effect on c demersum meanwhile fv fm in the 10 mg l pre soaked lpe system was markedly higher than that in the other pre soaked pe treatments indicating minor toxicity other physiological indicators in c demersum at the end of exposure are shown in fig 8 and table s7 regardless of pe particle size or concentration the chl a chl b and final ph values in c demersum cultured in the pre soaked pe system were similar and significantly lower than those cultured in the virgin pe system table s8 except for chl a of c demersum in the 10 mg l pre soaked lpe system which was higher than that in all other pre soaked pe systems 4 discussion 4 1 adsorption of cu on mp particles in aquatic environments heavy metals have a strong affinity for organic polymers including mps ashton et al 2010 rios et al 2007 and can be adsorbed at the mp interface where they bind with surface ligands ashton et al 2010 rios et al 2007 town et al 2018 in previous laboratory studies virgin mps 10 and 50 μm ps pellets have been shown to absorb a certain amount 0 26 0 58 mg g of heavy metals pb cu cd and nickel yuan et al 2020 in the current study adsorption capacity 3 84 5 76 mg g was much higher under the same conditions mps concentration 500 mg l potentially due to the physical properties of the pe particles i e smaller size which resulted in a higher specific surface area and stronger cu2 adsorption similarly our results were lower than those described by zong et al 2021 who used 0 5 μm sized ps particles ca 26 2 0 5 mg g thus the adsorption rate of mps for heavy metals appears to be related to their physical and chemical properties wang et al 2018 various laboratory studies have confirmed that mp absorption of heavy metals increases with heavy metal concentration yuan et al 2020 and mp specific surface area li et al 2020 yu et al 2021 in the present study the goodness of fit for all pe isotherms was similar table s9 although the langmuir model did not fit the spe particles the heavy metal adsorption capacities of mps are related to the environmental conditions and their surface properties including hydrophobic interactions van der waals forces hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions gao et al 2019 for the pe used in the present study adsorption behaviors may be explained by electrostatic interactions cao et al 2021 zhou et al 2020c as ionic bond strength and binding rate are related to ion concentration in solution and adsorption processes are in dynamic equilibrium changes in ion concentration can cause the desorption of adsorbed ions yang et al 2019 here we observed that the amount of cu2 adsorbed by the pe particles increased with increasing concentration of cuso4 while cu2 adsorption by the lpe particles reached saturation at cuso4 concentrations of 400 600 μmol l the spe particles exhibited greater adsorption potential and exceeded the adsorption achieved by the lpe particles fig 4c for spherical particles like pe particle in the tests an increase in size results in a decrease in specific surface area under the same weight krika and benlahbib 2015 davarpanah and guilhermino 2019 found higher aggregation and sedimentation in high concentration mp solutions compared with low concentration mp solutions mp aggregation in solution can result in irregularly shaped and large sized plastic clusters as well as an increase in sedimentation ratio aggregation can lead to a decrease in the specific surface area of mps and sedimentation can result in a decrease in the total amount of mps involved in adsorption activities correspondingly in the present study pe agglomerated to form larger particles table 2 as the concentration of pe increased while both total adsorption and unit adsorption capacity of the pe particles to cu2 decreased thus massive aggregation and sedimentation of pe particles may partially explain the decrease in adsorption capacity found in our study unlike the virgin mps used in our experiments mps in the environment are often under long term aging and weathering processes and thus tend to be more reactive due to higher specific surface areas brennecke et al 2016 holmes et al 2012 vedolin et al 2018 this is attributed to the processes of photo mechanical and oxidative degradation resulting in the formation of new functional groups on the mp surfaces chandra and rustgi 1997 mato et al 2001 i e mp surface charge and porosity increase via the accumulation of chemical hydrogens and biofilms artham et al 2009 holmes et al 2012 mato et al 2001 morét ferguson et al 2010 thus we anticipate that adsorption between aged mps and heavy metals should be higher than that found in laboratory tests and their complex interactions should be considered due to the characteristics of aging mps 4 2 combined effects of mps and cuso4on macrophytes high concentrations of cu can be toxic to the growth and physiological activities of plants lewis et al 2001 nagajyoti et al 2010 and different plants have different tolerances to cu pedersen et al 2000 rehman et al 2019 here the bioassay results indicated that macrophyte growth and leaf chlorophyll indicators decreased significantly following exposure to cuso4 compared to the control and single pe system and the cuso4 ec50 values of each species varied additionally evidence indicates that interactions between mps and other contaminants in the environment can alter their ecotoxicity to aquatic organisms xia et al 2020 in this study the addition of pe particles significantly reduced cuso4 toxicity in the submerged macrophytes this is consistent with the study of zhu et al 2020 who found that the toxic effects of cu nanoparticles ca 30 nm on the growth rate of skeletonema costatum average size 10 μm decline significantly with the addition of mps polyvinyl chloride 1 μm these results suggest that adsorption of cu2 and cu nanoparticles on mps can alleviate nano cu toxicity in skeletonema costatum the authors proposed that there are two possible mechanisms for this alleviation of toxicity one mechanism may be that mps characterized with low toxicity at low concentrations adsorb some cu2 thus decreasing its bioavailability for microalgae this inference is supported by our results showing that pe reduced the toxicity of cuso4 to the macrophytes fig 6 the second mechanism may be that mps cover the surface of the cell thereby blocking contact between the cell and cu2 and reducing their interactions in contrast to our study tunali et al 2020 reported that based on differences in growth rate and chl a of chlorella vulgaris size of 2 to 10 μm the toxicity of mp metal combinations is higher than that of single mps ps 0 5 μm or metals cu zn and manganese interestingly the authors argued that mps are adsorbed and embedded in the algal cells thereby providing channels for the metals to contact the cells the difference between that study and our results could be attributed to mp size with the larger mps 5 and 150 μm in our study unlikely to become embedded in the macrophyte cells in addition as macrophyte leaves 2 5 cm are much larger than microalgae the pe particles 5 and 150 μm could not cover the surface of the leaves as they could microalgae indicating that the first mechanism is a more reasonable explanation of cu toxicity attenuation in our study mps are also reported to have a direct inhibitory effect on macrophyte growth van weert et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 zhou et al 2020a in the environment although obvious phytotoxicity was not found in the present study smaller mps nanoplastics exhibit higher phytotoxic activity van weert et al 2019 and can affect organisms at the cellular level zhu et al 2020 thus the final combined effects of mps and heavy metals are correlated with mp size and concentration interestingly the mp particles exhibited a size effect on cu2 adsorption in the adsorption experiments section 3 1 but showed no size effect on cu2 toxicity in the combined exposure experiments according to the adsorption experiment when the concentration of cuso4 was lower than 100 μmol l the difference in the adsorption of cu2 between the two different sized pe particles was not significant fig 4 in the combined exposure experiment the cuso4 concentrations used for the four macrophytes were lower than 100 μmol l fig 5 and thus no significant differences in the detoxification effects were found between the different sized pe particles additionally the degree of cuso4 phytotoxicity attenuation by the pe particles varied among the different macrophyte species for h verticillata the chlf parameters and chl a content in the joint pe and cuso4 system were similar to those of the control in addition the ability of h verticillata to utilize bicarbonate was not significantly inhibited in the joint system aquatic plants utilize bicarbonate in various ways giordano et al 2005 and of the three enzymes involved sharkia et al 1994 the ubiquitous external carbonic anhydrase caext dimario et al 2018 moroney et al 2001 is positively correlated with bicarbonate utilization efficiency beer and rehnberg 1997 björk et al 1997 previous studies have indicated that excessive metal ions cu2 cd2 and zn2 in the environment can significantly inhibit caext activity bielmyer et al 2010 demirdağ et al 2014 wang et al 2005 this may explain the inhibitory effect of cuso4 containing toxic cu2 on bicarbonate utilization efficiency of macrophytes in the present study fig 6d in addition h verticillata possesses complex biochemical co2 concentrating mechanisms as found in ottelia alismoides in the same family and diverse methods of bicarbonate use huang et al 2018 shao et al 2017 zhang et al 2014b which may contribute to the stronger detoxification effect of pe on cuso4 4 3 carrier effect of mps in the present study we used pe as a carrier for cu2 and assessed the inhibitory effects of pe with and without cu2 on c demersum results indicated that pe with cu2 100 mg l of 5 μm and 150 μm 10 mg l of 5 μm showed acute toxicity fv fm 0 after 72 h in c demersum fig 8 as virgin pe 100 mg l had no apparent inhibitory effect on c demersum the reduction in fv fm final ph and chlorophyll content in c demersum cultivated in pe with cu2 must have been caused by the desorption or accumulation of cu2 as c demersum decayed and died within a short period the cu2 desorbed in the culture must have reached a much higher level than ec50 ca 6 μmol l as seen in the dose response curves since the adsorption of cu2 on pe is in a dynamic equilibrium the change of cuso4 concentration should lead to the adsorption and desorption of cu2 as the results in 3 1 indicated a decrease in cuso4 concentration resulted in a decrease in qe we concluded that transportation by pe particles between high and low concentrations of cu2 resulted in the desorption of cu2 in the low concentration culture correspondingly the fv fm and chl a of 10lpe with cu were exceptionally large among other pe with cu treatments under the same cu2 and pe concentrations the adsorption capacity of lpe was smaller than spe thus compared to other treatments of pe with cu treatment of 10lpe with cu should have the smallest amount of cu2 adsorption and the released cu2 concentrations thus are expected to be the lowest in the experimental environment therewith relative endpoints fv fm and chl a of macrophytes under the treatment of 10lpe with cu should be higher than those of other treatment groups of pe with cu as fv fm and chl a reflects the degree of stress that plants receive bussotti et al 2020 the introduction of other pollutants e g heavy metals and organic pollutants into new environments by mps and their more severe toxic effects on organisms when combined may occur frequently in natural aquatic ecosystems brennecke et al 2016 holmes et al 2012 unlike virgin pe used in experiments many additives are used in the production of plastics eerkes medrano et al 2015 leading to the release of large amounts of harmful substances during environmental degradation cole et al 2011 concurrently aged mps exhibit greater adsorption capacity for other contaminants than virgin mps wang et al 2021a and thus their transportation to different environments could cause adverse impacts on those organisms within in the present study we investigated the effects of mps as heavy metal carriers on macrophytes for the first time based on our findings research on the combined effects of mps and other contaminants should consider this carrier effect and additional macrophyte based studies should be conducted 5 conclusion in the current study we used commercial mps to mimic the behavior of mps found in the natural environment results showed that the addition of pe particles 5 and 150 μm increased the adsorption of cu2 and reduced the concentration of cu2 in the solution the adsorption amount increased with increasing cuso4 concentration or decreasing pe concentration the pe particles alone had no direct inhibitory effect on the submerged macrophytes but when combined with cuso4 reduced the toxicity of cu2 to macrophyte growth and photosynthesis the degree of toxicity attenuation by pe particles was strongest in h verticillata and showed no correlation with particle size however the transport of pe with cu2 induced toxicity against c demersum in culture in conclusion the mps showed dual effects on macrophytes i e mitigating the toxicity of other contaminants through adsorption and importing external pollutants

16118,anaerobic digestion ad has been widely employed for wastewater and organic waste treatment in which methanogenesis is highly driven by close microbial interactions among intricate microbial communities however the ecological processes underpinning the community assembly that support methanogenesis in such engineered ecosystems remain largely unknown especially when exposed to challenging circumstances e g high temperature ammonium content here eight ad bioreactors were seeded with four different inocula two from full scale mesophilic ad systems and the other two from lab scale mesophilic ad systems and were operated under thermophilic conditions 55 c for treating thermal hydrolysis process thp pre treated waste activated sludge to investigate how mesophilic community responds to thermophilic conditions during the long term cultivation results showed that the inocula collected from the full scale systems were more resilient than that from the lab scale systems which may be primarily attributed to indigenous robust methanogens as a result the former efficiently generated methane which was predominantly contributed by methanothermobacter and methanosarcina healthy ad ecosystem while methanogenic activity was remarkably prohibited in the latter dysfunctional ad ecosystem thermophilic environment was a strong selection force resulting in the convergence of microbial communities in both the healthy and dysfunctional ad ecosystems deterministic processes predominated the community assembly regardless of ad ecosystem function but stronger influences of stochastic processes were observed in dysfunctional ad ecosystems which was likely attributable from the stronger effect of immigrants from the feedstock as indicated by molecular ecological network analysis the microbial network structures in the healthy ad ecosystems were more stable than those in the dysfunctional ad ecosystems although keystone taxa were different among the bioreactors most of which played vital roles in organic hydrolysis fermentation to sum up this study greatly improved our understanding of the relationships between microbiological traits and ad ecosystem function

employed for wastewater and solid treatment e g waste activated sludge was food waste agricultural wastes to pursue energy recovery and neutrality cakir and stenstrom 2005 ward et al 2008 this process highly relies on synergistic interactions of different trophic groups to form a complicated metabolic network to meticulously and efficiently complete the four sequential steps namely hydrolysis fermentation acetogenesis and methanogenesis vanwonterghem et al 2014 the intricate interspecies interactions coupled with community diversity composition and function directly influence the performance of ad systems wagner and loy 2002 griffin and wells 2017 understanding of the ecological processes underpinning anaerobic microbial community assembly would help regulate ad system performance which to our knowledge needs more effort microbial community assembly is generally thought to be governed by both deterministic and stochastic processes liébana et al 2019 xu et al 2020 yu et al 2021 deterministic processes include selection by abiotic and biotic factors influencing organismal fitness and thereby determining the community compositions and species abundance fargione et al 2003 conversely stochastic processes comprise random birth death and dispersal events that result in indistinguishable communities from those produced by random chance chave 2004 although some previous studies qualitatively investigated microbial community assembly in ad ecosystems vanwonterghem et al 2014 ju et al 2017 lin et al 2017 peces et al 2018 they were conducted at well controlled systems without dramatic operation changes operating conditions e g sludge retention time temperature can exert important influences on microbial structure and community assembly xia et al 2018 for instance sun et al 2021 reported that stochasticity rather than determinism played a more important role in the microbial community assembly of activated sludge during seasonal dynamics in the scenario where thermophilic reactors are seeded with mesophilic cultures it would be a great challenge for mesophilic sludge microbiota to respond to the high temperature for instance mesophiles that cannot tolerate high temperature would lose their activity even die likely altering niche availability the sudden exposure of mesophilic microbiota to high temperature would also force them to experience a reshuffle process as such it raises high levels of uncertainties about community assembly processes and their relationship with ad ecosystem functioning bioreactors are ideal model ecosystems and operation manipulation of replicated bioreactors under elaborately controlled conditions would help to infer causal relationships and statistically significant results stegen et al 2013 santillan et al 2019 engineered thermophilic ad ecosystems have frequently been used to digest sludge or organic wastes in practice thermal hydrolysis process thp assisted thermophilic ad ecosystems is one of such representatives since thp is an effective pre treatment step to improve hydrolysis and solubilization of was thereby increasing overall methane yield which has been adopted in full scale plants kepp et al 2000 barber 2016 however only microbial α and β diversity patterns as well as community compositions have previously been focused on in thermophilic thp ad ecosystems shin et al 2019 westerholm et al 2019 chen et al 2020 wu et al 2020 of note thp produces high concentrations of recalcitrant compounds lu et al 2018 which enter into thermophilic thp ad bioreactors and together with high ammonium chen et al 2020 may cause inhibitory toxic effects on microbiota such harsh conditions along with high temperature create more challenging living habits for mesophilic microbiota however under this environment how stochasticity and determinism affect community assembly processes of anaerobic microbiomes still remains unknown lab scale biosystems are generally more well controlled than full scale ones in terms of operational parameters e g temperature organic loading the response patterns of microbial communities in mesophilic full scale and lab scale bioreactors could be likely different when facing challenging conditions thus ad bioreactors with different inocula collected from full scale and lab scale ad engineered ecosystems would allow us to have a holistic and comprehensive picture of how mesophilic microbiota responds to thermophilic conditions during the long term cultivation in terms of community assembly and functionality in this study eight thp ad bioreactors seeded with four types of inocula collected from mesophilic ad systems two from full scale mesophilic ad systems and the other two from lab scale mesophilic ad systems were operated under thermophilic condition 55 c at the same solid sludge retention time srt and organic loading rate thp sludge as the feedstock system performance e g methane production volatile fatty acids vfas ph was regularly monitored high throughput 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was employed to study the temporal dynamics of microbial community during the whole operation we then used null model to determine the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in regulating the community assembly under thermophilic condition and their relationship with system function phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens were constructed to reveal the microbial interaction patterns and ecological roles of co occurring taxa filling the knowledge gap mentioned above with these methods would advance our understanding of microbial ecology particularly at challenging conditions and provide insights into the start up operation and optimization of thermophilic ad systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation the experiments were conducted in eight 500 ml anaerobic bioreactors with working volume of 400 ml four types of inocula collected from mesophilic ad systems were investigated in this study full scale thp ad hereafter referred to as fthp vs laboratory scale thp ad hereafter referred to as lthp and full scale conventional ad treating was hereafter referred to as fcad vs laboratory scale conventional ad treating was hereafter referred to as lcad the thp sludge collected from a full scale thp system in a local water reclamation plant was used as the feedstock 6 bar 160 c for 30 min in order to avoid negatively influencing the stirring performance caused by the high solids concentration in the bioreactors the thp sludge was diluted by tap water with a dilution factor of 1 5 times before being utilized as the feedstock resulting in the total solids ts concentration of 50 44 3 62 g l table 1 the volatile solids vs ratio of seeding sludge and feed sludge was 2 the detailed information about the properties of seeding sludge and feedstock is present in table 1 each inoculum was tested in two replicate bioreactors all the bioreactors were purged with nitrogen to create anaerobic environments before being sealed with rubber stoppers the rubber stoppers were connected to two hoses one was connected with 3 l gas bag for collecting biogas and the other was used for discharging and feeding sludge the bioreactors were operated at 55 c with a continuous stirring speed of 80 rpm 60 ml of feed sludge were added into all the bioreactors every three days after discharging the same amount of sludge resulting in srt of 20 days which was in the typical srt range employed for ad systems coelho et al 2011 pilli et al 2015 the bioreactors were continuously operated for 81 days during which the biogas production and methane ch4 fraction were measured periodically meanwhile the total ammonia ta including nh4 and nh3 volatile fatty acids vfas and ph in the feed and digested sludge were measured microbial communities in the inocula and sludge samples collected from all the bioreactors on days 3 6 9 12 15 30 48 and

mp biomedicals singapore following the manufacturer s instruction the v4 hypervariable region of 16s rrna genes was amplified using the primer pair 515f and 806r to target both the bacterial and archaeal domains the illumina miseq sequencing service was provided by major biotech co ltd shanghai china raw sequences were analysed using qiime2 bolyen et al 2019 briefly raw paired end sequences were merged quality filtered chimera checked and clustered into amplicon sequence variants asvs with dada2 v1 18 callahan et al 2016 taxonomical assignment of asvs was conducted within qiime2 environment using the silva 138 database at a minimal 70 confidence estimate the putative microbial functions of all the sludge samples were predicted for functional traits analysis with tax4fun based on the default reference datasets ref99nr aßhauer et al 2015 2 3 network construction using the random matrix theory rmt based approach rmt based approach was employed to construct the pmens of microbial communities in the thermophilic ad reactors with different inocula according to the protocols developed by deng et al 2012 the pmens analysis was conducted using the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena the detailed information can be found in our previous studies zhang et al 2021 gephi software 0 9 2 was used for network visualization 2 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova and a post hoc tukey s hsd test were used to determine the significant differences in ta free ammonia fa and vfas concentrations in the supernatant of discharged sludge as well as methane production among the ad bioreactors using a 0 05 significant level p 0 05 non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds based on bray curtis distance or weighted unifrac distance was performed with r vegan package to determine the β diversity of microbial communities such analysis was also used to study the function dissimilarity among the bioreactors a permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices permanova and an analysis of similarity anosim were conducted with r vegan package to assess the statistical difference among the ad bioreactors with different inocula during the nmds analysis the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes on microbial community assemblages was quantified with a null model developed by stegen et al 2013 and stegen et al 2015 more detailed information can be found in stegen et al 2015 the sloan neutral model was also employed to investigate the potential importance of stochastic process to community assembly through predicting the relationship between asv occurring frequency and their relative abundance sloan et al 2006 in this model m denotes the estimated immigration rate which means that the possibility of the random loss of an individual in a local community is substituted by dispersal from the metacommunity 2 5 physico chemical

different inocula fthp reactors took 21 days to achieve stable performance with methane yield of 247 18 ml g vsadd while fcad reactors took a longer time 39 days to achieve stable performance with comparable yield of 243 25 ml g vsadd during the stable period however the four ad reactors with inocula from lab scale ad systems including lthp reactors adapted to thp sludge previously had poor methane yield over the entire operational period 50 20 ml g vsadd of note from day 51 onwards the methane production in both lcad and lthp reactors slightly increased in lthp and lcad reactors the total concentrations of vfas gradually increased to maxima of 8028 and 8405 mg l between days 42 48 fig 2 respectively followed by gradually decreasing trends acetate and propionate were the dominant species of vfas in which acetate concentration had a similar trend with total vfas while propionate concentration approximately 1500 mg l in both lthp and lcad was stable over the course of experiment this is due to the fact that propionate metabolism is thermodynamically unfavorable δg0 76 0 kj mol li et al 2012 and its biodegradation needs tight cooperation between syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacteria and methanogenic archaea zhang et al 2021 even in well performed fthp and fcad reactors there were still approximately 2000 mg l propionate accounting for more than 50 of the total vfa concentrations 2906 273 mg l in fthp and 3401 609 mg l in fcad the high concentration of residual vfas suggests that srt of 20 d was not sufficient for methanogenic archaea to effectively consume the produced vfas in addition ta concentration in all the ad bioreactors was similar 2052 90 mg n l fig 1b suggesting that the extent of hydrolysis and fermentation of proteinaceous materials did not have a substantial difference among all the bioreactors although large amounts of vfas accumulated in lthp and lcad reactors these reactors were still maintained at neutral conditions ph x223c7 0 fig s1 which may be due to the high alkalinity concentrations in the bioreactors fig s2 owing to the significantly higher ph in fthp and fcad reactors than that in lthp and lcad reactors fig s1 the fa concentrations were significantly higher in fthp and fcad reactors p 0 05 fig 1b briefly the fa concentrations in fthp and fcad reactors were 775 90 mg n l and 544 73 mg n l respectively while its concentration in lthp and lcad was below 300 mg n l the present results indicate that the low methanogenic activity in the under performed reactors lthp and lcad could likely be resulted from the inhibitory effect of vfas moreover the methanogenic archaea in fthp and fcad reactors could tolerate the toxic effect of high fa concentration 3 2 effect of different inocula on microbial diversity and compositions under thermophilic conditions after quality filtering and trimming a total of 2 609 103 sequences from 64 sludge samples were recovered via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to investigate how the inoculum affected the development of the diversity and composition of the microbial community for comparison at the same sequencing depth the sequences were rarefied to 30 346 sequences per sample the good s coverage of all the samples was above 99 9 data not shown suggesting that the sequencing depth can represent the diversity of the microbial community of each sample the decreasing trends of shannon index showed that the microbial diversity reduced along with time fig 3 a b c d moreover the shannon index in the healthy ad reactors fthp and fcad was higher than that in the dysfunctional ad reactors lthp and lcad correspondingly pielou index showed that the microbial community evenness slightly decreased with the operational time and the community evenness in the healthy ad reactors was higher than that in the dysfunctional ad reactors fig 3e f g h therefore the anaerobic microbial community with intended function fthp and fcad harbored higher α diversities than the dysfunctional microbial community lthp and lcad under thermophilic conditions it may be due to the fact that the pronounced accumulation of vfas posed a greater pressure than free ammonia on microbial community thereby reducing the biodiversity of microbial community clustering of the microbial community by the bioreactor performance was observed based on the bray curtis dissimilarity and the weighted unifrac distance permanova and anosim p 0 001 fig 4 a b it shows that the microbial community in ad reactors with different inocula had respective and clear evolution trajectories the microbial communities in the healthy bioreactors were gradually convergent which was significantly separated from those in the dysfunctional reactors the functional dissimilarity based on bray curtis dissimilarity was also analysed using the tax4fun putative function prediction method fig 4c a similar trend with community composition dissimilarity was also observed the clustering of community compositions and functional compositions in under performed systems at the later stage of operation may be due to the functional community pertaining to hydrolysis and fermentation functioning normally therefore the thermophilic condition could be a strong environmental factor influencing the anaerobic community succession regardless of the inoculum type as for the microbial composition at the phylum level bacteroidota and firmicutes were the dominant phyla in fthp and lthp inocula accounting for 31 6 40 8 and 42 5 43 9 respectively fig 5 the predominant phyla in the fcad and lcad inocula had differences in which bacteroidota 20 1 chloroflex 12 8 firmicutes 10 3 and synergistota 9 7 were dominated in the former while bacteroidota 42 0 proteobacteria 19 7 and spirochaetota 5 9 were dominated in the latter since the inocula were collected from the ad systems operated at mesophilic conditions an obvious shift in the microbial communities was observed in all the reactors when cultivated at thermophilic conditions for example bacteroidota decreased to a very low abundance in all the microbial communities 1 5 coprothermobacterota was not detected in the seed sludge but gradually grew along with increased abundance during the incubation briefly at the end of operational period the populated phyla in the microbial community of healthy bioreactors were similar fthp and fcad in which firmicutes 43 9 47 7 thermotogota 17 2 20 1 coprothermobacterota 11 9 18 0 and synergistota 13 6 14 9 predominated the dominant phyla and their abundance in dysfunctional microbial communities lthp and lcad were different from those in the fthp and fcad for instance in addition to firmicutes 42 3 47 6 synergistota 31 2 35 1 and coprothermobacterota 4 3 12 2 proteobacteria 7 5 11 7 was predominated at the end of operational period there were also substantial differences in microbial communities at genus level between healthy and dysfunctional bioreactors fig 5 and fig s3 although some predominant genera were the same in the microbial community between healthy and dysfunctional bioreactors their relative abundance was different for instance the relative abundance of defluviitoga 14 8 25 4 in fthp and fcad was significantly higher than that in lthp and lcad 0 7 1 9 p 0 05 during the stable period of methane production conversely the relative abundance of acetomicrobium in fthp and fcad 13 8 19 4 was significantly lower than that in lthp and lcad 31 4 43 5 p 0 05 moreover several predominant genera were different between the healthy and the dysfunctional microbial communities such as d8a 2 and srb2 in fthp and fcad pseudomonas and lactobacillus in lthp and lcad the specific functions of d8a 2 and srb2 have not been determined but it can be speculated that they could grow and thrive at thermophilic conditions and may play important roles in thermophilic thp ad systems according to midas database microbial database for activated sludge nierychlo et al 2020 pseudomonas and lactobacillus were related to organic fermentation hydrolysis they could be the true participants in organic biotransformation under thermophilic conditions in addition methanospirillum methanolinea and methanothermobacter were the dominant methanogens however methanospirillum and methanolinea could not tolerate the high temperature resulting in their disappearance at the later stage of operational period although hydrogenotrophic methanothermobacter was non detectable in the inocula it flourished in the microbial communities during the long term cultivation fthp and fcad 1 9 4 3 had higher abundance of methanothermobacter than that of lthp and lcad 0 72 1 73 during the stable period from day 48 to day 81 a similar trend was also observed for methanosarcina 1 2 1 8 in fthp and fcad vs 0 02 0 7 in lthp and lcad fig s4 which could be capable of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis overall the total relative abundance of methanogenic genera in fthp and fcad was higher than that in lthp and lcad 3 2 6 1 vs 0 9 2 4 it could partially explain why the formers could produce more methane than the latters 3 3 stochasticity versus determinism in anaerobic community assembly under thermophilic conditions since the mesophilic anaerobic community had different responses e g biodiversity compositions to thermophilic conditions the mechanisms influencing the microbial diversity and compositions were further uncovered by the null model both deterministic and stochastic processes were observed during the microbial succession fig 6 the majority of βnti values fell into the range of 2 regardless of system performance indicating that deterministic selection dominated by homogenous selection was the main driver of community succession the respective contributions of specific events of stochastic and deterministic assembly processes were then quantified environmental selection explained 80 0 81 7 and 65 0 85 0 of the community assemblage turnover in healthy and dysfunctional ad reactors respectively fig 6b regarding stochastic processes i e dispersal limitation ecological drift homogenizing dispersal the dispersal limitation in the microbial community of fthp was stronger than that of lthp 3 3 vs 11 7 a similar trend was also observed in the microbial community between fcad and lcad conversely homogenizing dispersal was stronger in the dysfunctional reactors than in the healthy reactors 8 3 16 7 vs 1 7 3 3 ecological drift is indicative of random species drift including birth death and reproduction which contributed 5 0 3 3 6 7 and 2 5 during the community assemblages of fthp lthp fcad and lcad respectively the results indicated that determinism played a paramount role in anaerobic community assembly under highly selective conditions irrespective of the system performance 3 4 microbial co occurrence patterns under thermophilic conditions the distinct microbial diversity composition and community assembly among the four types of anaerobic microbial community revealed that the different patterns of biological interactions biological interactions have also been considered the major drivers during microbial assemblages ju and zhang 2015 we therefore dissected the co occurrence patterns in the community succession of different groups with the rmt based network approach fig 7 the significant differences in the topological traits between all networks and their corresponding random networks and higher networks small world coefficients are suggestive of small world and modular traits of the pmens in the microbial community table 2 the microbial community with intended function had higher average clustering coefficient avgcc and average connectivity avgk as well as shorter harmonic geodesic distance hd than dysfunctional microbial communities fthp vs lthp fcad vs lcad indicating the interplays among the asvs were more intensive in fthp and fcad this result suggests that the healthy microbial communities had more stable network structures in the constructed ecological networks there were 158 nodes linked by 567 edges for fthp 172 nodes linked by 427 edges for lthp 118 nodes linked by 556 edges and 191 nodes linked by 643 edges for lcad observed among which more than 93 of the links were positive in all the networks suggesting that high interspecific cooperation rather than competition predominated in the microbial interactions in addition fthp and fcad microbial networks had lower modularities 0 575 for fthp 0 532 for fcad than that of lthp and lcad 0 685 for lthp 0 637for lcad table 2 thus microbial functionality seemed to be associated with microbial co occurrence patterns keystone taxa crucial in maintaining network structures and community function were identified based on the plot of within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi fig 7 shows that fthp and fcad ecological networks had more keystone species than that of lthp and lcad 5 for fthp vs 3 for lthp 4 for fcad vs 3 for lcad most of the keystone taxa belonged to firmicutes and proteobacteria phyla the taxonomic information of the keystone taxa was presented in table s1 moreover fthp and fcad had more connectors among modules than lthp and lcad in which lthp ecological network had no connectors while lcad only has one connector among the keystone taxa some of them had low relative abundance 1 throughout the entire operational period such as asv8 g lactobacillus asv187 g caldicoprobacter asv229 g authm297 asv233 g tissierella asv240 g w27 and asv568 f comamonadaceae suggesting the important roles of rare species in maintaining the stability of microbial networks under thermophilic conditions 4 discussion 4 1 inocula influenced the start up of thermophilic ad ecosystems the inocula collected from full scale mesophilic anaerobic digesters treating thp sludge or was could gradually transform into desirable microbial communities with intended function under thermophilic conditions during the long term cultivation while the inocula taken from laboratory scale mesophilic anaerobic digesters could not the indigenous microbiota could play a paramount role in successfully establishing desirable populations under thermophilic conditions the dysfunctional ecosystems had similar amounts of ta production as healthy ecosystems indicating that the broad spectrum of bacteria involved in organic hydrolysis fermentation could have a fast response to adapt to the high temperature which is supported by the abundant hydrolyzers fermenters in both systems defluviitoga coprothermobacter etc in this light the difference in ecosystem functions may be likely due to the presence of specific high temperature tolerant pioneers for methanogenic activity in the inocula collected from full scale ad systems in the inocula from the full scale systems methanobacterium methanomethylovorans and candidatus methanomethylicus were detected fig s4 these methanogens have often been reported in thermophilic anaerobic digestion ecosystems jiang et al 2005 ho et al 2013 yang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 unlike lab scale digesters under temperature well controlled conditions the full scale mesophilic anaerobic digesters could easily be exposed to thermophilic conditions temporarily during the daytime in singapore tropical region their presence in the inocula could provide a relatively favourable environment for the rapid colonization and growth of methanothermobacter and methanosarcina especially at the starting period ensuring the timely consumption of acetic acid and h2 and then avoiding the collapse of ecosystem function however these pioneers may not tolerate the potential toxic effects caused by fa resulting in their abundance reduction or disappearance after 9 days of operation during the operation of the dysfunctional ecosystems methanothermobacter and methanosarcina also existed which is consistent with the detectable methane production however their abundance and activity were low fig 5 resulting in substantial vfas accumulation 4 2 differences in microbial diversity and community assembly processes between healthy and dysfunctional thermophilic ad ecosystems encountering the challenging conditions the biodiversity of all the indigenous microbial communities in the inocula gradually decreased suggesting the crucial role of environmental selection in governing community assembly and succession null model results also indicated that determinism predominated the microbial community assembly under thermophilic conditions regardless of ecosystem function it suggests that high temperature as a strong abiotic environmental factor highly selected against certain species to form local communities high concentrations of vfas and or fa as other environmental stress factors may also synergistically improve the contribution of determinism during the community assembly in this study the microcosms were operated in a highly controlled manner in temperature and srt increasing the homogeneity of environmental conditions in general homogeneity in environmental conditions facilitates the role of deterministic processes via homogeneous selection resulting in more similar community structures among ecosystems sun et al 2021 yu et al 2021 this can explain why the microbial community in the healthy ecosystems or dysfunctional ecosystems tended to be convergent towards respective directions after long term cultivation fig 4 at the later stage of operational period the microbial communities in the healthy ecosystems fthp and fcad harbored higher biodiversity than that in the dysfunctional ecosystems lthp and lcad it may be due to the remarkable accumulation of vfas in the dysfunctional ecosystems likely causing inhibitory toxic effects on taxa particularly rare taxa and thereby reducing microbial richness and evenness zhang et al 2019 also demonstrated that when deterministic processes dominated the community assembly higher biodiversity would generally show better ecosystem function methanogenic activity relies on the intricate and balanced trophic groups from hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis steps as well as the intensive interaction among them since methanogens cannot utilize complicated and or macromolecular organics zhang et al 2022 thus a highly diverse community is a prerequisite for efficient and stable methane production in the ad ecosystems under thermophilic conditions although deterministic processes were the main contributors to microbial community assembly in all the systems the community assembly in dysfunctional ecosystems was subjected to greater influences of stochastic processes e g dispersal events it may be attributed to the high chance of colonization by immigrant taxa from the feedstock the thp sludge should be active microbiota free but it was stored in a cold room during the whole operational period microbes growth may initiate supported by fluorescent staining of dead live cells of thp sludge fig s5 in fact the dilution of thp sludge with primary sludge was before being fed into ad systems is a common practice which inevitably introduces new microbiota jiang et al 2021 this result is consistent with the finding of sloan ncm analysis showing the m values in well performed reactors 0 011 and 0 015 for fthp and fcad were lower than those in under performed reactors 0 025 for both lthp and lcad fig s6 this result indicates that compared to dysfunctional ecosystems under thermophilic conditions colonization of immigrant taxa from feedstock in a healthy one would be subjected to stronger restriction high fa concentration has been demonstrated to induce inhibition on microbial activity liu et al 2019 christou et al 2021 according to eq 1 the fa concentration in the feedstock was low x223c2 mg n l but its concertation in the healthy ecosystems was up to 544 775 mg n l in this light compared to that in the dysfunctional ad systems 300 mg n l higher fa concentrations in the healthy ad systems could have stronger inhibitory effects on those immigrants and then prevent their colonization in the reactors 4 3 differences in microbial co occurrence patterns between healthy and dysfunctional thermophilic ad ecosystems compared to the dysfunctional ecosystems the community of healthy ecosystems tended to form more intensive and complex networks with less but bigger modules as well as lower modularity it is due to the fact that ad food web requires different functional microbial populations to co exist harmoniously in the pmens analysis modularity can be interpreted as microbial niches or functional units eiler et al 2012 a higher modularity suggests a higher extent of niche differentiation which could lead to weaker interactions among microbes faust and raes 2012 moreover there were more connectors in the networks of healthy ecosystems than in the dysfunctional ecosystems fig 7 such connectors could play an important role in transferring information among modules which likely allow the networks to be resistant to environmental stress thus the microbial networks of healthy ecosystems could be more resistant to many strong external disturbances under thermophilic conditions keystone taxa are commonly thought to be initiating components of ecological networks that could drive metacommunity composition and function and their disappearance may lead to the collapse of networks shi et al 2016 more keystone species in the networks of healthy ecosystems would be beneficial for efficient information transfer or cross feeding within and or among modules improving community resistance and ecosystem stability it should be noted that some of the keystone species had a very low abundance indicating low abundant taxa could still exert important influences on ecosystem structures and functions rare taxa can also serve as an active microbial seedbank and pool of metabolic potential that can become predominant species following a perturbation or a change of environment ju et al 2017 liébana et al 2019 for instance the dominant bacteria at the end of experiment e g defluviitoga keratinibaculum acetomicrobium coprothermobacter etc were less abundant or even not detected in the inocula although homogenous selection dominated the community assembly none of the putative keystone species was the same among the microbial communities of the four systems this result is consistent with context dependency theory that keystone taxa play paramount roles only under certain circumstances power et al 1996 according to midas database nierychlo et al 2020 most of the keystone taxa were capable of organic hydrolysis fermentation acetomicrobium caldicoprobacter defluviitoga keratinibaculum lactobacillus tissierella these taxa were also frequently detected in thermophilic ad systems lee et al 2016 watanabe et al 2017 chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 it should be noted that none of methanogens was identified as keystone species in all the systems suggesting that hydrolytic fermentative bacteria may play more important roles in regulating ecological structure and function in thermophilic ad systems likely via mutualism or commensalism for instance lactic acid produced by lactobacillus can be decomposed into acetate and h2 by defluviitoga which can be further metabolized by methanogens e g methanothermobacter methanosarcina 4 4 implications these results showed that the types of mesophilic inoculum highly affected the ad ecosystem functioning under thermophilic conditions for process engineering such as thermophilic thp ad start up the most efficient way is to seed the inoculum from thermophilic systems seeding inoculum from mesophilic digesters is possible but may not be easy to achieve stable performance in a shot time period more meticulous operational strategies such as a gradual increase in organic loading rate to avoid a sudden vfa accumulation and ph drop ph control via acid alkaline addition prolonged srt or step wise increase of temperature may be feasible which warrants further verification although the system achieved stable performance at srt of 20 d i e fthp fcad substantial amounts of vfas were still present in order to maximize methane yield in practice the srt of thp assisted thermophilic ads should be longer than 20 d the healthy and dysfunctional ecosystems in this study can be used as model systems to simulate functional and deteriorated thermophilic ad systems respectively as such the findings obtained in this study also have great implications for the operation and maintenance of thermophilic ad or thp ad digesters which would assist us to predict system performance for instance the occurring of stronger effects of stochastic events may be an indication of deterioration in system performance or system failure suggesting that corrective measures are required in practice primary sludge was or thp sludge mixed with primary sludge was is commonly used as the feedstock the highly diverse community in the feedstock may also affect the stochastic or deterministic process xu et al 2021 the discrepancy in community assembly processes between healthy and dysfunctional ad systems would be more pronounced which merits further investigation of note some of the keystone taxa were uncultured it highlights the need of applying advanced techniques e g genome centric metagenomics metatranscriptomics to determine the exact roles of these individual members from metabolic function perspective this will provide useful information to manipulate microbial assembly and succession 5 conclusions the inocula from full scale mesophilic ad reactors were more resilient than those from lab scale mesophilic ad reactors when their living habit changed from mesophilic to thermophilic it was most likely due to the difference in indigenous methanogenic species thermophilic condition as a strong selection force drove the anaerobic communities to be convergent towards respective directions in both the healthy and dysfunctional ad ecosystems deterministic processes dominated the anaerobic microbial community assembly under thermophilic conditions regardless of ad ecosystem function however the decline in system performance strengthened the effects of stochastic processes which may be primarily attributed to the stronger influences of immigrants from the feedstock thermophilic ad ecosystem function linked to microbial interactions the microbial networks of healthy thermophilic ad ecosystems possessed lower modularity and harmonic geodesic distance as well as higher average connectivity than that of dysfunctional thermophilic ad

16118,anaerobic digestion ad has been widely employed for wastewater and organic waste treatment in which methanogenesis is highly driven by close microbial interactions among intricate microbial communities however the ecological processes underpinning the community assembly that support methanogenesis in such engineered ecosystems remain largely unknown especially when exposed to challenging circumstances e g high temperature ammonium content here eight ad bioreactors were seeded with four different inocula two from full scale mesophilic ad systems and the other two from lab scale mesophilic ad systems and were operated under thermophilic conditions 55 c for treating thermal hydrolysis process thp pre treated waste activated sludge to investigate how mesophilic community responds to thermophilic conditions during the long term cultivation results showed that the inocula collected from the full scale systems were more resilient than that from the lab scale systems which may be primarily attributed to indigenous robust methanogens as a result the former efficiently generated methane which was predominantly contributed by methanothermobacter and methanosarcina healthy ad ecosystem while methanogenic activity was remarkably prohibited in the latter dysfunctional ad ecosystem thermophilic environment was a strong selection force resulting in the convergence of microbial communities in both the healthy and dysfunctional ad ecosystems deterministic processes predominated the community assembly regardless of ad ecosystem function but stronger influences of stochastic processes were observed in dysfunctional ad ecosystems which was likely attributable from the stronger effect of immigrants from the feedstock as indicated by molecular ecological network analysis the microbial network structures in the healthy ad ecosystems were more stable than those in the dysfunctional ad ecosystems although keystone taxa were different among the bioreactors most of which played vital roles in organic hydrolysis fermentation to sum up this study greatly improved our understanding of the relationships between microbiological traits and ad ecosystem function

highly relies on synergistic interactions of different trophic groups to form a complicated metabolic network to meticulously and efficiently complete the four sequential steps namely hydrolysis

performance of ad systems wagner and loy 2002 griffin and wells 2017 understanding of the ecological processes underpinning anaerobic microbial community assembly would help regulate ad system performance which to our knowledge needs more effort microbial community assembly is generally thought to be governed by both deterministic and stochastic processes liébana et al 2019 xu et al 2020 yu et al 2021 deterministic processes include selection by abiotic and biotic factors influencing organismal fitness and thereby determining the community compositions and species abundance fargione et al 2003 conversely stochastic processes comprise random birth death and dispersal events that result in indistinguishable communities from those produced by random chance chave 2004 although some previous studies qualitatively investigated microbial community assembly in ad ecosystems vanwonterghem et al 2014 ju et al 2017 lin et al 2017 peces et al 2018 they were conducted at well controlled systems without dramatic operation changes operating conditions e g sludge retention time temperature can exert important influences on microbial structure and community assembly xia et al 2018 for instance sun et al 2021 reported that stochasticity rather than determinism played a more important role in the microbial community assembly of activated sludge during seasonal dynamics in the scenario where thermophilic reactors are seeded with mesophilic cultures it would be a great challenge for mesophilic sludge microbiota to respond to the high temperature for instance mesophiles that cannot tolerate high temperature would lose their activity even die likely altering niche availability the sudden exposure of mesophilic microbiota to high temperature would also force them to experience a reshuffle process as such it raises high levels of uncertainties about community assembly processes and their relationship with ad ecosystem functioning bioreactors are ideal model ecosystems and operation manipulation of replicated bioreactors under elaborately controlled conditions would help to infer causal relationships and statistically significant results stegen et al 2013 santillan et al 2019 engineered thermophilic ad ecosystems have frequently been used to digest sludge or organic wastes in practice thermal hydrolysis process thp assisted thermophilic ad ecosystems is one of such representatives since thp is an effective pre treatment step to improve hydrolysis and solubilization of was thereby increasing overall methane yield which has been adopted in full scale plants kepp et al 2000 barber 2016 however only microbial α and β diversity patterns as well as community compositions have previously been focused on in thermophilic thp ad ecosystems shin et al 2019 westerholm et al 2019 chen et al 2020 wu et al 2020 of note thp produces high concentrations of recalcitrant compounds lu et al 2018 which enter into thermophilic thp ad bioreactors and together with high ammonium chen et al 2020 may cause inhibitory toxic effects on microbiota such harsh conditions along with high temperature create more challenging living habits for mesophilic microbiota however under this environment how stochasticity and determinism affect community assembly processes of anaerobic microbiomes still remains unknown lab scale biosystems are generally more well controlled than full scale ones in terms of operational parameters e g temperature organic loading the response patterns of microbial communities in mesophilic full scale and lab scale bioreactors could be likely different when facing challenging conditions thus ad bioreactors with different inocula collected from full scale and lab scale ad engineered ecosystems would allow us to have a holistic and comprehensive picture of how mesophilic microbiota responds to thermophilic conditions during the long term cultivation in terms of community assembly and functionality in this study eight thp ad bioreactors seeded with four types of inocula collected from mesophilic ad systems two from full scale mesophilic ad systems and the other two from lab scale mesophilic ad systems were operated under thermophilic condition 55 c at the same solid sludge retention time srt and organic loading rate thp sludge as the feedstock system performance e g methane production volatile fatty acids vfas ph was regularly monitored high throughput 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was employed to study the temporal dynamics of microbial community during the whole operation we then used null model to determine the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in regulating the community assembly under thermophilic condition and their relationship with system function phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens were constructed to reveal the microbial interaction patterns and ecological roles of co occurring taxa filling the knowledge gap mentioned above with these methods would advance our understanding of microbial ecology particularly at challenging conditions and provide insights into the start up operation and optimization of thermophilic ad systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation the experiments were conducted in eight 500 ml anaerobic bioreactors with working volume of 400 ml four types of inocula collected from mesophilic ad systems were investigated in this study full scale thp ad hereafter referred to as fthp vs laboratory scale thp ad hereafter referred to as lthp and full scale conventional ad treating was hereafter referred to as fcad vs laboratory scale conventional ad treating was hereafter referred to as lcad the thp sludge collected from a full scale thp system in a local water reclamation plant was used as the feedstock 6 bar 160 c for 30 min in order to avoid negatively influencing the stirring performance caused by the high solids concentration in the bioreactors the thp sludge was diluted by tap water with a dilution factor of 1 5 times before being utilized as the feedstock resulting in the total solids ts concentration of 50 44 3 62 g l table 1 the volatile solids vs ratio of seeding sludge and feed sludge was 2 the detailed information about the properties of seeding sludge and feedstock is present in table 1 each inoculum was tested in two replicate bioreactors all the bioreactors were purged with nitrogen to create anaerobic environments before being sealed with rubber stoppers the rubber stoppers were connected to two hoses one was connected with 3 l gas bag for collecting biogas and the other was used for discharging and feeding sludge the bioreactors were operated at 55 c with a continuous stirring speed of 80 rpm 60 ml of feed sludge were added into all the bioreactors every three days after discharging the same amount of sludge resulting in srt of 20 days which was in the typical srt range employed for ad systems coelho et al 2011 pilli et al 2015 the bioreactors were continuously operated for 81 days during which the biogas production and methane ch4 fraction were measured periodically meanwhile the total ammonia ta including nh4 and nh3 volatile fatty acids vfas and ph in the feed and digested sludge were measured microbial communities in the inocula and sludge samples collected from all the bioreactors on days 3 6 9 12 15 30 48 and

mp biomedicals singapore following the manufacturer s instruction the v4 hypervariable region of 16s rrna genes was amplified using the primer pair 515f and 806r to target both the bacterial and archaeal domains the illumina miseq sequencing service was provided by major biotech co ltd shanghai china raw sequences were analysed using qiime2 bolyen et al 2019 briefly raw paired end sequences were merged quality filtered chimera checked and clustered into amplicon sequence variants asvs with dada2 v1 18 callahan et al 2016 taxonomical assignment of asvs was conducted within qiime2 environment using the silva 138 database at a minimal 70 confidence estimate the putative microbial functions of all the sludge samples were predicted for functional traits analysis with tax4fun based on the default reference datasets ref99nr aßhauer et al 2015 2 3 network construction using the random matrix theory rmt based approach rmt based approach was employed to construct the pmens of microbial communities in the thermophilic ad reactors with different inocula according to the protocols developed by deng et al 2012 the pmens analysis was conducted using the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena the detailed information can be found in our previous studies zhang et al 2021 gephi software 0 9 2 was used for network visualization 2 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova and a post hoc tukey s hsd test were used to determine the significant differences in ta free ammonia fa and vfas concentrations in the supernatant of discharged sludge as well as methane production among the ad bioreactors using a 0 05 significant level p 0 05 non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds based on bray curtis distance or weighted unifrac distance was performed with r vegan package to determine the β diversity of microbial communities such analysis was also used to study the function dissimilarity among the bioreactors a permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices permanova and an analysis of similarity anosim were conducted with r vegan package to assess the statistical difference among the ad bioreactors with different inocula during the nmds analysis the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes on microbial community assemblages was quantified with a null model developed by stegen et al 2013 and stegen et al 2015 more detailed information can be found in stegen et al 2015 the sloan neutral model was also employed to investigate the potential importance of stochastic process to community assembly through predicting the relationship between asv occurring frequency and their relative abundance sloan et al 2006 in this model m denotes the estimated immigration rate which means that the possibility of the random loss of an individual in a local community is substituted by dispersal from the metacommunity 2 5 physico chemical

different inocula fthp reactors took 21 days to achieve stable performance with methane yield of 247 18 ml g vsadd while fcad reactors took a longer time 39 days to achieve stable performance with comparable yield of 243 25 ml g vsadd during the stable period however the four ad reactors with inocula from lab scale ad systems including lthp reactors adapted to thp sludge previously had poor methane yield over the entire operational period 50 20 ml g vsadd of note from day 51 onwards the methane production in both lcad and lthp reactors slightly increased in lthp and lcad reactors the total concentrations of vfas gradually increased to maxima of 8028 and 8405 mg l between days 42 48 fig 2 respectively followed by gradually decreasing trends acetate and propionate were the dominant species of vfas in which acetate concentration had a similar trend with total vfas while propionate concentration approximately 1500 mg l in both lthp and lcad was stable over the course of experiment this is due to the fact that propionate metabolism is thermodynamically unfavorable δg0 76 0 kj mol li et al 2012 and its biodegradation needs tight cooperation between syntrophic propionate oxidizing bacteria and methanogenic archaea zhang et al 2021 even in well performed fthp and fcad reactors there were still approximately 2000 mg l propionate accounting for more than 50 of the total vfa concentrations 2906 273 mg l in fthp and 3401 609 mg l in fcad the high concentration of residual vfas suggests that srt of 20 d was not sufficient for methanogenic archaea to effectively consume the produced vfas in addition ta concentration in all the ad bioreactors was similar 2052 90 mg n l fig 1b suggesting that the extent of hydrolysis and fermentation of proteinaceous materials did not have a substantial difference among all the bioreactors although large amounts of vfas accumulated in lthp and lcad reactors these reactors were still maintained at neutral conditions ph x223c7 0 fig s1 which may be due to the high alkalinity concentrations in the bioreactors fig s2 owing to the significantly higher ph in fthp and fcad reactors than that in lthp and lcad reactors fig s1 the fa concentrations were significantly higher in fthp and fcad reactors p 0 05 fig 1b briefly the fa concentrations in fthp and fcad reactors were 775 90 mg n l and 544 73 mg n l respectively while its concentration in lthp and lcad was below 300 mg n l the present results indicate that the low methanogenic activity in the under performed reactors lthp and lcad could likely be resulted from the inhibitory effect of vfas moreover the methanogenic archaea in fthp and fcad reactors could tolerate the toxic effect of high fa concentration 3 2 effect of different inocula on microbial diversity and compositions under thermophilic conditions after quality filtering and trimming a total of 2 609 103 sequences from 64 sludge samples were recovered via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to investigate how the inoculum affected the development of the diversity and composition of the microbial community for comparison at the same sequencing depth the sequences were rarefied to 30 346 sequences per sample the good s coverage of all the samples was above 99 9 data not shown suggesting that the sequencing depth can represent the diversity of the microbial community of each sample the decreasing trends of shannon index showed that the microbial diversity reduced along with time fig 3 a b c d moreover the shannon index in the healthy ad reactors fthp and fcad was higher than that in the dysfunctional ad reactors lthp and lcad correspondingly pielou index showed that the microbial community evenness slightly decreased with the operational time and the community evenness in the healthy ad reactors was higher than that in the dysfunctional ad reactors fig 3e f g h therefore the anaerobic microbial community with intended function fthp and fcad harbored higher α diversities than the dysfunctional microbial community lthp and lcad under thermophilic conditions it may be due to the fact that the pronounced accumulation of vfas posed a greater pressure than free ammonia on microbial community thereby reducing the biodiversity of microbial community clustering of the microbial community by the bioreactor performance was observed based on the bray curtis dissimilarity and the weighted unifrac distance permanova and anosim p 0 001 fig 4 a b it shows that the microbial community in ad reactors with different inocula had respective and clear evolution trajectories the microbial communities in the healthy bioreactors were gradually convergent which was significantly separated from those in the dysfunctional reactors the functional dissimilarity based on bray curtis dissimilarity was also analysed using the tax4fun putative function prediction method fig 4c a similar trend with community composition dissimilarity was also observed the clustering of community compositions and functional compositions in under performed systems at the later stage of operation may be due to the functional community pertaining to hydrolysis and fermentation functioning normally therefore the thermophilic condition could be a strong environmental factor influencing the anaerobic community succession regardless of the inoculum type as for the microbial composition at the phylum level bacteroidota and firmicutes were the dominant phyla in fthp and lthp inocula accounting for 31 6 40 8 and 42 5 43 9 respectively fig 5 the predominant phyla in the fcad and lcad inocula had differences in which bacteroidota 20 1 chloroflex 12 8 firmicutes 10 3 and synergistota 9 7 were dominated in the former while bacteroidota 42 0 proteobacteria 19 7 and spirochaetota 5 9 were dominated in the latter since the inocula were collected from the ad systems operated at mesophilic conditions an obvious shift in the microbial communities was observed in all the reactors when cultivated at thermophilic conditions for example bacteroidota decreased to a very low abundance in all the microbial communities 1 5 coprothermobacterota was not detected in the seed sludge but gradually grew along with increased abundance during the incubation briefly at the end of operational period the populated phyla in the microbial community of healthy bioreactors were similar fthp and fcad in which firmicutes 43 9 47 7 thermotogota 17 2 20 1 coprothermobacterota 11 9 18 0 and synergistota 13 6 14 9 predominated the dominant phyla and their abundance in dysfunctional microbial communities lthp and lcad were different from those in the fthp and fcad for instance in addition to firmicutes 42 3 47 6 synergistota 31 2 35 1 and coprothermobacterota 4 3 12 2 proteobacteria 7 5 11 7 was predominated at the end of operational period there were also substantial differences in microbial communities at genus level between healthy and dysfunctional bioreactors fig 5 and fig s3 although some predominant genera were the same in the microbial community between healthy and dysfunctional bioreactors their relative abundance was different for instance the relative abundance of defluviitoga 14 8 25 4 in fthp and fcad was significantly higher than that in lthp and lcad 0 7 1 9 p 0 05 during the stable period of methane production conversely the relative abundance of acetomicrobium in fthp and fcad 13 8 19 4 was significantly lower than that in lthp and lcad 31 4 43 5 p 0 05 moreover several predominant genera were different between the healthy and the dysfunctional microbial communities such as d8a 2 and srb2 in fthp and fcad pseudomonas and lactobacillus in lthp and lcad the specific functions of d8a 2 and srb2 have not been determined but it can be speculated that they could grow and thrive at thermophilic conditions and may play important roles in thermophilic thp ad systems according to midas database microbial database for activated sludge nierychlo et al 2020 pseudomonas and lactobacillus were related to organic fermentation hydrolysis they could be the true participants in organic biotransformation under thermophilic conditions in addition methanospirillum methanolinea and methanothermobacter were the dominant methanogens however methanospirillum and methanolinea could not tolerate the high temperature resulting in their disappearance at the later stage of operational period although hydrogenotrophic methanothermobacter was non detectable in the inocula it flourished in the microbial communities during the long term cultivation fthp and fcad 1 9 4 3 had higher abundance of methanothermobacter than that of lthp and lcad 0 72 1 73 during the stable period from day 48 to day 81 a similar trend was also observed for methanosarcina 1 2 1 8 in fthp and fcad vs 0 02 0 7 in lthp and lcad fig s4 which could be capable of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis overall the total relative abundance of methanogenic genera in fthp and fcad was higher than that in lthp and lcad 3 2 6 1 vs 0 9 2 4 it could partially explain why the formers could produce more methane than the latters 3 3 stochasticity versus determinism in anaerobic community assembly under thermophilic conditions since the mesophilic anaerobic community had different responses e g biodiversity compositions to thermophilic conditions the mechanisms influencing the microbial diversity and compositions were further uncovered by the null model both deterministic and stochastic processes were observed during the microbial succession fig 6 the majority of βnti values fell into the range of 2 regardless of system performance indicating that deterministic selection dominated by homogenous selection was the main driver of community succession the respective contributions of specific events of stochastic and deterministic assembly processes were then quantified environmental selection explained 80 0 81 7 and 65 0 85 0 of the community assemblage turnover in healthy and dysfunctional ad reactors respectively fig 6b regarding stochastic processes i e dispersal limitation ecological drift homogenizing dispersal the dispersal limitation in the microbial community of fthp was stronger than that of lthp 3 3 vs 11 7 a similar trend was also observed in the microbial community between fcad and lcad conversely homogenizing dispersal was stronger in the dysfunctional reactors than in the healthy reactors 8 3 16 7 vs 1 7 3 3 ecological drift is indicative of random species drift including birth death and reproduction which contributed 5 0 3 3 6 7 and 2 5 during the community assemblages of fthp lthp fcad and lcad respectively the results indicated that determinism played a paramount role in anaerobic community assembly under highly selective conditions irrespective of the system performance 3 4 microbial co occurrence patterns under thermophilic conditions the distinct microbial diversity composition and community assembly among the four types of anaerobic microbial community revealed that the different patterns of biological interactions biological interactions have also been considered the major drivers during microbial assemblages ju and zhang 2015 we therefore dissected the co occurrence patterns in the community succession of different groups with the rmt based network approach fig 7 the significant differences in the topological traits between all networks and their corresponding random networks and higher networks small world coefficients are suggestive of small world and modular traits of the pmens in the microbial community table 2 the microbial community with intended function had higher average clustering coefficient avgcc and average connectivity avgk as well as shorter harmonic geodesic distance hd than dysfunctional microbial communities fthp vs lthp fcad vs lcad indicating the interplays among the asvs were more intensive in fthp and fcad this result suggests that the healthy microbial communities had more stable network structures in the constructed ecological networks there were 158 nodes linked by 567 edges for fthp 172 nodes linked by 427 edges for lthp 118 nodes linked by 556 edges and 191 nodes linked by 643 edges for lcad observed among which more than 93 of the links were positive in all the networks suggesting that high interspecific cooperation rather than competition predominated in the microbial interactions in addition fthp and fcad microbial networks had lower modularities 0 575 for fthp 0 532 for fcad than that of lthp and lcad 0 685 for lthp 0 637for lcad table 2 thus microbial functionality seemed to be associated with microbial co occurrence patterns keystone taxa crucial in maintaining network structures and community function were identified based on the plot of within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi fig 7 shows that fthp and fcad ecological networks had more keystone species than that of lthp and lcad 5 for fthp vs 3 for lthp 4 for fcad vs 3 for lcad most of the keystone taxa belonged to firmicutes and proteobacteria phyla the taxonomic information of the keystone taxa was presented in table s1 moreover fthp and fcad had more connectors among modules than lthp and lcad in which lthp ecological network had no connectors while lcad only has one connector among the keystone taxa some of them had low relative abundance 1 throughout the entire operational period such as asv8 g lactobacillus asv187 g caldicoprobacter asv229 g authm297 asv233 g tissierella asv240 g w27 and asv568 f comamonadaceae suggesting the important roles of rare species in maintaining the stability of microbial networks under thermophilic conditions 4 discussion 4 1 inocula influenced the start up of thermophilic ad ecosystems the inocula collected from full scale mesophilic anaerobic digesters treating thp sludge or was could gradually transform into desirable microbial communities with intended function under thermophilic conditions during the long term cultivation while the inocula taken from laboratory scale mesophilic anaerobic digesters could not the indigenous microbiota could play a paramount role in successfully establishing desirable populations under thermophilic conditions the dysfunctional ecosystems had similar amounts of ta production as healthy ecosystems indicating that the broad spectrum of bacteria involved in organic hydrolysis fermentation could have a fast response to adapt to the high temperature which is supported by the abundant hydrolyzers fermenters in both systems defluviitoga coprothermobacter etc in this light the difference in ecosystem functions may be likely due to the presence of specific high temperature tolerant pioneers for methanogenic activity in the inocula collected from full scale ad systems in the inocula from the full scale systems methanobacterium methanomethylovorans and candidatus methanomethylicus were detected fig s4 these methanogens have often been reported in thermophilic anaerobic digestion ecosystems jiang et al 2005 ho et al 2013 yang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 unlike lab scale digesters under temperature well controlled conditions the full scale mesophilic anaerobic digesters could easily be exposed to thermophilic conditions temporarily during the daytime in singapore tropical region their presence in the inocula could provide a relatively favourable environment for the rapid colonization and growth of methanothermobacter and methanosarcina especially at the starting period ensuring the timely consumption of acetic acid and h2 and then avoiding the collapse of ecosystem function however these pioneers may not tolerate the potential toxic effects caused by fa resulting in their abundance reduction or disappearance after 9 days of operation during the operation of the dysfunctional ecosystems methanothermobacter and methanosarcina also existed which is consistent with the detectable methane production however their abundance and activity were low fig 5 resulting in substantial vfas accumulation 4 2 differences in microbial diversity and community assembly processes between healthy and dysfunctional thermophilic ad ecosystems encountering the challenging conditions the biodiversity of all the indigenous microbial communities in the inocula gradually decreased suggesting the crucial role of environmental selection in governing community assembly and succession null model results also indicated that determinism predominated the microbial community assembly under thermophilic conditions regardless of ecosystem function it suggests that high temperature as a strong abiotic environmental factor highly selected against certain species to form local communities high concentrations of vfas and or fa as other environmental stress factors may also synergistically improve the contribution of determinism during the community assembly in this study the microcosms were operated in a highly controlled manner in temperature and srt increasing the homogeneity of environmental conditions in general homogeneity in environmental conditions facilitates the role of deterministic processes via homogeneous selection resulting in more similar community structures among ecosystems sun et al 2021 yu et al 2021 this can explain why the microbial community in the healthy ecosystems or dysfunctional ecosystems tended to be convergent towards respective directions after long term cultivation fig 4 at the later stage of operational period the microbial communities in the healthy ecosystems fthp and fcad harbored higher biodiversity than that in the dysfunctional ecosystems lthp and lcad it may be due to the remarkable accumulation of vfas in the dysfunctional ecosystems likely causing inhibitory toxic effects on taxa particularly rare taxa and thereby reducing microbial richness and evenness zhang et al 2019 also demonstrated that when deterministic processes dominated the community assembly higher biodiversity would generally show better ecosystem function methanogenic activity relies on the intricate and balanced trophic groups from hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis steps as well as the intensive interaction among them since methanogens cannot utilize complicated and or macromolecular organics zhang et al 2022 thus a highly diverse community is a prerequisite for efficient and stable methane production in the ad ecosystems under thermophilic conditions although deterministic processes were the main contributors to microbial community assembly in all the systems the community assembly in dysfunctional ecosystems was subjected to greater influences of stochastic processes e g dispersal events it may be attributed to the high chance of colonization by immigrant taxa from the feedstock the thp sludge should be active microbiota free but it was stored in a cold room during the whole operational period microbes growth may initiate supported by fluorescent staining of dead live cells of thp sludge fig s5 in fact the dilution of thp sludge with primary sludge was before being fed into ad systems is a common practice which inevitably introduces new microbiota jiang et al 2021 this result is consistent with the finding of sloan ncm analysis showing the m values in well performed reactors 0 011 and 0 015 for fthp and fcad were lower than those in under performed reactors 0 025 for both lthp and lcad fig s6 this result indicates that compared to dysfunctional ecosystems under thermophilic conditions colonization of immigrant taxa from feedstock in a healthy one would be subjected to stronger restriction high fa concentration has been demonstrated to induce inhibition on microbial activity liu et al 2019 christou et al 2021 according to eq 1 the fa concentration in the feedstock was low x223c2 mg n l but its concertation in the healthy ecosystems was up to 544 775 mg n l in this light compared to that in the dysfunctional ad systems 300 mg n l higher fa concentrations in the healthy ad systems could have stronger inhibitory effects on those immigrants and then prevent their colonization in the reactors 4 3 differences in microbial co occurrence patterns between healthy and dysfunctional thermophilic ad ecosystems compared to the dysfunctional ecosystems the community of healthy ecosystems tended to form more intensive and complex networks with less but bigger modules as well as lower modularity it is due to the fact that ad food web requires different functional microbial populations to co exist harmoniously in the pmens analysis modularity can be interpreted as microbial niches or functional units eiler et al 2012 a higher modularity suggests a higher extent of niche differentiation which could lead to weaker interactions among microbes faust and raes 2012 moreover there were more connectors in the networks of healthy ecosystems than in the dysfunctional ecosystems fig 7 such connectors could play an important role in transferring information among modules which likely allow the networks to be resistant to environmental stress thus the microbial networks of healthy ecosystems could be more resistant to many strong external disturbances under thermophilic conditions keystone taxa are commonly thought to be initiating components of ecological networks that could drive metacommunity composition and function and their disappearance may lead to the collapse of networks shi et al 2016 more keystone species in the networks of healthy ecosystems would be beneficial for efficient information transfer or cross feeding within and or among modules improving community resistance and ecosystem stability it should be noted that some of the keystone species had a very low abundance indicating low abundant taxa could still exert important influences on ecosystem structures and functions rare taxa can also serve as an active microbial seedbank and pool of metabolic potential that can become predominant species following a perturbation or a change of environment ju et al 2017 liébana et al 2019 for instance the dominant bacteria at the end of experiment e g defluviitoga keratinibaculum acetomicrobium coprothermobacter etc were less abundant or even not detected in the inocula although homogenous selection dominated the community assembly none of the putative keystone species was the same among the microbial communities of the four systems this result is consistent with context dependency theory that keystone taxa play paramount roles only under certain circumstances power et al 1996 according to midas database nierychlo et al 2020 most of the keystone taxa were capable of organic hydrolysis fermentation acetomicrobium caldicoprobacter defluviitoga keratinibaculum lactobacillus tissierella these taxa were also frequently detected in thermophilic ad systems lee et al 2016 watanabe et al 2017 chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 it should be noted that none of methanogens was identified as keystone species in all the systems suggesting that hydrolytic fermentative bacteria may play more important roles in regulating ecological structure and function in thermophilic ad systems likely via mutualism or commensalism for instance lactic acid produced by lactobacillus can be decomposed into acetate and h2 by defluviitoga which can be further metabolized by methanogens e g methanothermobacter methanosarcina 4 4 implications these results showed that the types of mesophilic inoculum highly affected the ad ecosystem functioning under thermophilic conditions for process engineering such as thermophilic thp ad start up the most efficient way is to seed the inoculum from thermophilic systems seeding inoculum from mesophilic digesters is possible but may not be easy to achieve stable performance in a shot time period more meticulous operational strategies such as a gradual increase in organic loading rate to avoid a sudden vfa accumulation and ph drop ph control via acid alkaline addition prolonged srt or step wise increase of temperature may be feasible which warrants further verification although the system achieved stable performance at srt of 20 d i e fthp fcad substantial amounts of vfas were still present in order to maximize methane yield in practice the srt of thp assisted thermophilic ads should be longer than 20 d the healthy and dysfunctional ecosystems in this study can be used as model systems to simulate functional and deteriorated thermophilic ad systems respectively as such the findings obtained in this study also have great implications for the operation and maintenance of thermophilic ad or thp ad digesters which would assist us to predict system performance for instance the occurring of stronger effects of stochastic events may be an indication of deterioration in system performance or system failure suggesting that corrective measures are required in practice primary sludge was or thp sludge mixed with primary sludge was is commonly used as the feedstock the highly diverse community in the feedstock may also affect the stochastic or deterministic process xu et al 2021 the discrepancy in community assembly processes between healthy and dysfunctional ad systems would be more pronounced which merits further investigation of note some of the keystone taxa were uncultured it highlights the need of applying advanced techniques e g genome centric metagenomics metatranscriptomics to determine the exact roles of these individual members from metabolic function perspective this will provide useful information to manipulate microbial assembly and succession 5 conclusions the inocula from full scale mesophilic ad reactors were more resilient than those from lab scale mesophilic ad reactors when their living habit changed from mesophilic to thermophilic it was most likely due to the difference in indigenous methanogenic species thermophilic condition as a strong selection force drove the anaerobic communities to be convergent towards respective directions in both the healthy and dysfunctional ad ecosystems deterministic processes dominated the anaerobic microbial community assembly under thermophilic conditions regardless of ad ecosystem function however the decline in system performance strengthened the effects of stochastic processes which may be primarily attributed to the stronger influences of immigrants from the feedstock thermophilic ad ecosystem function linked to microbial interactions the microbial networks of healthy thermophilic ad ecosystems possessed lower modularity and harmonic geodesic distance as well as higher average connectivity than that of dysfunctional thermophilic ad

16119,the activated sludge wastewater treatment process has been thoroughly researched in more than 100 years yet there are still operational challenges that have not been fully resolved such a challenge is the control of filamentous bulking caused by the overgrowth of certain filamentous bacteria in this study we tested different mitigation strategies to reduce filamentous bulking caused by two common filamentous genera found in full scale water resource recovery facilities wrrf candidatus microthrix and candidatus amarolinea pax dosing ozone addition hydrocyclone implementation and the addition of nano coagulants were tested as mitigation strategies in four parallel treatment lines in a full scale wrrf over three consecutive years unexpectedly the activated sludge settleability was not affected by any of the mitigation strategies some of the strategies appeared to have a strong mitigating effect on the two filamentous species however detailed analyses of the microbial communities revealed strong recurrent seasonal variations in all four lines including the control line which masked the real effect after removing the effect of the seasonal variation by using a time series decomposition approach it was clear that the filamentous bacteria were mostly unaffected by the mitigation strategies only pax dosing had some effect on ca microthrix but only on one species ca microthrix subdominans and not on the most common ca microthrix parvicella overall our study shows the importance of long term monitoring of microbial communities at species level to understand the normal seasonal pattern to effectively plan and execute full scale experiments moreover the results highlight the importance of using parallel reference treatment lines when evaluating the effect of mitigation strategies in full scale treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords filamentous bulking pax dosing ozonation hydrocyclone nano coagulant full scale wrrf time series analysis 1 introduction the activated sludge as process is a well established biotechnology for wastewater treatment around the world a well functioning microbial community is the backbone of the as process and the optimal operation of water resource recovery facilities wrrf depends on the biomass composition the increasing number of studies analyzing the microbial community composition wu et al 2019 nierychlo et al 2020a dueholm et al 2021 longitudinal studies targeting microbial community dynamics jiang et al 2016 griffin and wells 2017 jiang et al 2018 petrovski et al 2020 sun et al 2021 and ecophysiological studies in full scale as systems e g nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 petriglieri et al 2021 singleton et al 2021 have greatly improved our understanding of the microbial ecology of wrrf however there are still several operational problems in wrrf that can be linked to the presence of specific microorganisms which have not yet been resolved filamentous bacteria are important for the formation of stable flocs in activated sludge plants henze et al 2008 however overgrowth of filamentous bacteria can cause bulking or foaming nielsen et al 2009 resulting in unstable operation and deteriorated process performance due to inefficient secondary clarification henze et al 2008 several studies have tried to understand the cause of filamentous bulking by investigating the characteristics and physiology of filamentous bacteria rossetti et al 2005 mcilroy et al 2013 miłobȩdzka et al 2016 andersen et al 2019 nierychlo et al 2019 2020b 2021 but targeted mitigation strategies are still lacking for many species or they have shown inconsistent results some of the most common filamentous bacteria causing bulking belong to genus candidatus microthrix in the phylum actinobacteria nielsen et al 2009 wang et al 2014a wágner et al 2015 miłobȩdzka et al 2016 wang et al 2016 nierychlo et al 2020b 2021 and several species in the phylum chloroflexi nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 nierychlo et al 2020b ca microthrix consumes primarily long chain fatty acids and can store lipids under aerobic and anaerobic conditions mcilroy et al 2013 ca microthrix is able to store poly phosphate and has been found in some cases as the main contributor for phosphorus removal under bulking conditions wang et al 2014b but does not have a dynamic phosphorus cycling as the typical polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos nierychlo et al 2021 low temperature low dissolved oxygen do long solids retention time srt and low food to microorganism f m ratio are reported to be advantageous for their growth rossetti et al 2005 fan et al 2020 nierychlo et al 2021 there are two common species across the world ca microthrix parvicella and ca microthrix subdominans typically coexisting in wrrfs treating municipal wastewater nierychlo et al 2021 there seem to be some physiological differences between the two species with ca m subdominans able to grow better at higher oxygen concentrations while ca m parvicella is likely microaerophilic nierychlo et al 2021 the phylum chloroflexi includes several filamentous genera where some contribute to poor sludge settling while others support good floc formation nittami et al 2017 nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 candidatus villigracilis is mostly found inside the flocs possibly supporting good floc formation whereas candidatus promineofilum and candidatus sarcinithrix have been connected to bulking events nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 in particular candidatus amarolinea has been reported to cause severe bulking events in danish wrrfs andersen et al 2019 nierychlo et al 2020b and local foaming events in china jiang et al 2018 different mitigation strategies are used to reduce the effect of filamentous bulking a general treatment method to target most filamentous bacteria is the addition of ozone to the return activated sludge ras ozone targets the protruding filamentous bacteria with a larger surface area thus improving the floc structure and consequently the settleability of the sludge nilsson et al 2014 2019 however different filamentous morphotypes are observed to have different responses to ozone treatment e g gordonia was found to be less affected barbarroja et al 2019 another approach is to use hydrocyclones to separate the biomass based on density and size the heavier fraction of the sludge is retained and returned to the process tank while the lighter fraction is removed with the effluent kent et al 2018 hydrocyclones are commonly used together with the demon process to retain the slow growing anammox bacteria and wash out flocculent biomass lackner et al 2014 hydrocyclones in full scale activated sludge systems kent et al 2018 and sequencing batch reactors sbrs xu et al 2019 have improved the settling properties of the sludge more targeted methods are also used to control specific species for example polyaluminum chloride pac referred to as pax in this study is dosed to specifically target ca microthrix as it affects the exopolymeric layer inhibiting the exoenzyme lipase activity and substrate uptake nielsen et al 2005 hamit eminovski et al 2010 fan et al 2020 pax is applied in many full scale plants usually with good results roels et al 2002 but there are also cases reported by the wrrf operators that it can be ineffective it has been observed that in order to achieve removal of ca microthrix a dosage of 1 5 to 4 5 g al kg mlss and a minimum dosing time of 3 3 5 weeks are needed roels et al 2002 as we will further demonstrate in this study seasonal patterns of the microbial community are observed in activated sludge systems ju et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 griffin and wells 2017 jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 johnston and behrens 2020 petrovski et al 2020 peces et al 2022 sun et al 2021 such variations may challenge traditional full scale mitigating experiments as it can be difficult to differentiate the effect of the tested mitigation strategy from the normal seasonal variation especially if these variations are not well described or if no control line is included several studies have shown that specific bacteria belonging to important functional groups such as nitrifiers paos and filamentous bacteria are affected by yearly seasonal variations e g ju et al 2014 jiang et al 2018 petrovski et al 2020 sun et al 2021 moreover we have recently shown the importance of analyzing seasonality at species level since species belonging to the same higher taxonomic unit e g genus or same functional guilds may show different seasonal patterns peces et al 2022 therefore there is a need to investigate how yearly seasonal variations impact the evaluation of full scale testing results at species level the ecosystem specific reference database for activated sludge and anaerobic digesters midas 3 provides reproducible species level identification of the bacteria in wrrfs nierychlo et al 2020a using this tool the aim of the study was to assess the effect of different mitigation strategies to reduce filamentous bulking in a full scale wrrf with four independent parallel treatment lines during a 3 year survey period we investigated the effect of pax dosing ozone dosing hydrocyclones and nano coagulants on i the activated sludge settleability ii the changes in overall microbial community composition and iii the changes in the most abundant filamentous bacteria i e ca microthrix and ca amarolinea moreover we investigated the effect of seasonal microbial variation on the evaluation and interpretation of the experimental results 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of damhusåen wrrf damhusåen wrrf copenhagen denmark has a design capacity of 350 000 population equivalent pe and treats municipal wastewater with approximately 15 20 industrial contribution expressed as chemical oxygen demand cod fraction estimated based on the amount of industrial water in the catchment area and the types of industries the wrrf has four parallel treatment lines a b c and d with dedicated secondary clarifiers and return sludge on each line so it is possible to test different treatment methods in full scale by comparing independent parallel lines the wrrf is designed as an enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr system with alternating bio denitro operation known as biodenipho bundgaard et al 1989 each treatment line consists of one anaerobic tank two aeration denitrifying tanks and six secondary clarifiers in lines b c and d the return sludge is collected from their respective secondary clarifiers and it is directed back to the beginning of the treatment line where it is mixed with the wastewater ebpr process operation line a is operated as side stream hydrolysis ssh where part of the return sludge is collected and directed into an anaerobic tank operated with a long residence time approximately 24 h more about how the ssh is operated and what are the advantages of this operation can be found in vollertsen et al 2006 in line a the influent wastewater is added only after the anaerobic tank more details on the design and operation of damhusåen wrrf can be found in table s1 supporting information si average influent wastewater characteristics are also shown in the si table s2 si suspended solids in the process tanks were relatively constant over the whole experimental period with a median value of 3 3 g ss l supporting fig s1 si 2 2 experimental design four full scale experiments were conducted to test the control of filamentous bulking pax dosing and nano coagulant dosing were tested in line a ozonation in line d and hydrocyclones in line c fig s2 si line b was left in all cases as a reference line without any treatment polyaluminum chloride pax15 kemira finland was dosed in the return sludge just before entering the treatment line a fig s3 si first the recommended dose by the supplier was used however it was halved when a white tint started appearing in the sludge the recommended daily dose of 1 5 g al kg ss was added in the period 06 03 2018 to 12 04 2018 37 days the dosing was lowered to half the amount in the consecutive period 13 04 2018 to 18 06 2018 66 days ozone treatment was conducted using a primozone gm18 ozone generator primozone production ab sweden fig s4 si approximately 8 15 of the return sludge in line d was mixed with the ozone in a contact tank with a daily dose of 4 5 5 g ozone kg ss the return sludge flow to the contact tank was between 20 and 36 m3 h and the residence time in the contact tank was 5 10 minutes two dosing periods were conducted between 10 08 2018 and 21 09 2018 42 days and between 26 03 2019 and 10 04 2019 15 days six hydrocyclones fig s5 si were installed in line c to separate the heavy sludge underflow from the loose light fraction overflow part of the return sludge was led through the hydrocyclones with an inflow of 21 m3 h the overflow sludge was directed away with a flow of 14 m3 h while the underflow sludge was led back to the treatment line with a flow of 7 m3 h the normal waste activated sludge removal was stopped in this line as itwas done via the overflow of the hydrocyclones two test periods were conducted between 15 10 2019 to 27 10 2019 12 days and between 18 01 2020 to 10 03 2020 52 days an inorganic coagulant based on nanotechnology norfloc nf1 alumichem denmark was dosed during one year between 14 04 2020 and 13 04 2021 in line a 364 days the dosage of the coagulant was controlled based on the actual flow and approximately 12 mg l of coagulant was dosed in the first few months which was then slowly reduced to 4 mg l in the colder winter months the nano coagulant was dosed directly in the aeration tank in line a instead of the iron chloride that is usually added to the treatment lines 2 3 sample collection and analysis metadata were collected from damhusåen wrrf including online sensor

randers wrrf with a daily dose of 1 15 g al kg ss and this was added in the period 28 03 2017 to 18 05 2017 polyaluminum chloride nordpac nordisk aluminat a s denmark was dosed at aalborg west wrrf in three periods between 2015 2017 the specific periods and the applied dose are shown in table s3 si 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mitigation strategies on sludge settleability the settling properties assessed by dsvi values were most of the time above or around the threshold in all four lines considered to indicate sludge with poor settling characteristics 120 ml g mielczarek et al 2012 dosing of pax nano coagulant and use of hydrocyclone did not affect the settleability of the sludge in the respective line compared to the other lines fig 1 ozone dosage in line d seemed to cause a decrease of the dsvi but by comparing with the other three lines it was clear that all lines had low and similar dsvi values during the same period besides this very small effect of ozone the increase of dsvi after ozone dosing was slightly delayed compared to the reference lines fig 1 these results highlight the importance of having parallel reference lines to evaluate the effect of mitigation strategies we observed a clear decrease in dsvi in all lines after the mitigation strategies were implemented but not only in the line with treatment if we had used only one line to evaluate the treatment strategies for example line a in case of the pax and nano coagulant dosing and line c in case of the hydrocyclone implementation the conclusions would have been that they were very efficient thus it is important to draw conclusions very carefully in full scale with only one treatment line and no reference line the use of reference lines to compare mitigation measures of bulking in full scale systems are very rare e g levén et al 2016 but necessary to draw correct conclusions 3 2 microbial community composition and settling properties the microbial communities in the four treatment lines were very similar during the 3 year period investigated as seen by pcoa ordination fig 2 a lines b c and d clustered tightly together suggesting that they were very similar in microbial structure throughout the years while line a was slightly different this is also visualized and supported by the top 25 most abundant genera with some dissimilarity in line a in the abundances but not identity figs 2 b s7 si line a is operated as ssh as opposed to the traditional ebpr scheme for the other lines hence this could result in the differences observed the most abundant genera were typical for danish ebpr plants with the pao tetrasphaera and the filamentous ca microthrix among them nierychlo et al 2020a several genera showed periodic increase and decrease in relative read abundance some of the most abundant genera ca microthrix rhodobacter midas g 70 class gammaproteobacteria trichococcus rhodoferax and olb8 among others showed clear periodicity related to seasonal variations fig s8 si in line a which is operated as ssh we observed several genera among the most abundant that were in lower abundance compared to the other three lines tetrasphaera midas g 70 ca competibacter midas g 399 and fodinicola however the trends for these genera are still identical among the lines fig s8 si similar to many other danish wrrfs the most abundant filamentous bacteria in damhusåen wrrf were ca microthrix and ca amarolinea in relative read abundances up to 30 followed by other typical filamentous bacteria found in denmark nierychlo et al 2020b and globally dueholm et al 2021 figs 2c s9 si line b c and d were very similar with minor abundance differences among some filamentous bacteria in line a fig s10 si the most abundant filamentous bacteria had a profound effect on the settling properties the dsvi values correlated well with the abundance of ca microthrix and ca amarolinea figs 3 s11 si where high abundance caused poor settling activated sludge the sum of the abundance of ca microthrix and ca amarolinea showed moderate correlation with dsvi in all lines r2 0 5 there was a low or no positive correlation between the dsvi and other filamentous bacteria r2 0 4 we found similar results in all lines figs 3 s11 si this suggests that the sludge settleability was strongly shaped by ca microthrix and ca amarolinea as has also been observed in other full scale wrrf in denmark and other countries wang et al 2014a wágner et al 2015 miłobȩdzka et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 nierychlo et al 2020b interestingly the presence of ca villigracilis fodinicola and leptothrix showed a negative correlation to dsvi in the case of ca villigracilis this could suggest improved settling properties when abundant by providing a strong backbone in the flocs nierychlo et al 2019 in case of the other two genera some of their species could be non filamentous thus resulting in negative correlation with dsvi 3 3 evaluation of microbial seasonal dynamics in a recent study we have shown high microbial seasonality at species level in danish wrrfs where species belonging to the same functional guild or the same genus did not follow the same seasonal dynamics peces et al 2022 as also observed by peces et al 2022 the variation in wastewater temperature could not explain all the different seasonal dynamics as many species did not show a strong linear correlation with temperature changes figs s12 and s13 si independently of the factors contributing to the seasonal dynamics such variations challenge full scale mitigating experiments as it may be difficult to differentiate the effect of the mitigation strategy tested from the normal seasonal variation the filamentous microbial community was classified based on their seasonal cohort i e the period during the year where the maximum relative read abundance is typically observed in each treatment line fig 4 the largest fraction of filamentous bacteria belonged to the autumn and spring cohorts fig 4a this agrees with other studies showing that the colder temperatures or often in the transition between cold and warmer periods coincide with higher relative abundance of filamentous bacteria and settling problems jiang et al 2016 petrovski et al 2020 nierychlo et al 2021 the autumn cohort included the highest number of filamentous species approximately 30 different species fig 4a the cumulative relative abundance of the autumn cohort was the highest mean relative abundance 8 14 however the relative abundance of the autumn cohort was dominated by ca amarolinea midas s 1 mean relative abundance 5 9 the difference observed in line c is related to the cohort classification of ca amarolinea midas s 1 where the estimated maximum abundance was found in week 37 summer cohort but very close to the summer and autumn cohort classification threshold i e week 38 table s4 si this species is often found in other danish wrrfs in the autumn cohort peces et al 2022 and was a main contributing filament to poor settling in this treatment plant fig 3 and other danish wrrfs nierychlo et al 2020b the spring cohort included only a few filamentous species 4 7 different species but their cumulative average relative abundance was surprisingly high 6 8 due to the second most abundant filamentous species ca m parvicella ca m parvicella is present mainly in the northern hemisphere and has a very strong seasonal pattern nierychlo et al 2021 peces et al 2022 not all the filamentous species showed a significant seasonal variation for example ca microthrix subdominans as shown in this study fig 5 a and in other danish wrrfs nierychlo et al 2021 peces et al 2022 we observed some differences in the seasonal dynamics among the different treatment lines but the maximum abundance peaks for each species were present at similar time points in each line fig 4b this clearly shows that understanding the seasonal dynamics of specific species is important and may be confounded with relative read abundance variations caused by the tested mitigation strategy 3 4 evaluation of filamentous bulking mitigation strategies four mitigation strategies were tested at the treatment plant in periods ranging from a few weeks to a few months the effect of the mitigation strategy was evaluated by including both the behavior in all four lines and the seasonal variation in microbial community structure dosage of pax was assumed to control ca microthrix if we used only one line line a to assess the results we would conclude that the pax dosing was very successful in reducing the abundance of ca m parvicella from 15 to 8 and still decreasing by end of the pax dosing fig 5a however by comparing to the other lines we could see that ca m parvicella decreased in all lines also in those without pax dosage this suggested that this decrease was most probably related to its normal seasonal variation a result that was confirmed by time series analysis of the 3 year long experimental period showing a recurrent strong seasonal variation of ca m parvicella fig 5a some positive effects of two of the mitigation strategies could be observed when analyzing them in combination with time series analysis and reference lines fig 5a to do so the raw relative read abundance time series were deseasonalized to evaluate if the effect of the mitigation strategy was still observable fig 5b during the pax dosing period abundance of ca amarolinea midas s 1 increased in line a similarly to the reference lines while ca m parvicella was stable in this period in all lines fig 5b despite the abundance of ca m subdominans was consistently lower in line a than the rest of the lines it showed a decreasing trend in line a during the pax dosing as opposed to the reference lines in both the raw time series and the deseasonalized time series fig 5a and b this suggests that this species might be affected by the pax dosing in contrast to ca m parvicella data collected from other danish wrrfs during pax dosing periods these periods are unrelated to the experiments at damhusåen wrrf and were recorded during standard dosing periods targeted against filamentous bulking also show that pax treatment was overall ineffective for ca m parvicella but in some cases effective against ca m subdominans figs s14 and s15 si the typical values for pax dosing in full scale wrrfs are reported to be between 1 5 4 5 g al kg ss roels et al 2002 fan et al 2020 this corresponds with the dosage applied in this study in the first 37 days of dosing which was then reduced to half dosage based on the recommendation by the supplier since species resolution was not possible in previous studies the differences in observed outcomes of pax dosages may be due to differences in the species composition in the wrrfs ozone was dosed during two periods in line d ozone treatment seemed to rapidly decrease the abundance of ca amarolinea midas s 1 after the first dosing period while after the second dosing period it seemed to delay the growth compared to the other lines fig 5 a however as opposed to the raw time series data we did not observe a difference in the trend of any of the bacteria in this treatment line compared to the reference lines in the deseasonalized time series fig 5 b thus the effect of ozone could not be conclusively resolved barbarroja et al 2019 found that different filamentous morphotypes were affected in different ways by ozone addition levén et al 2016 found that ozone dosing had an effect on the ca microthrix abundance in the treated line compared to the control line already after 21 days of dosing however in this period their ozone dosage was higher 6 6 g o3 kg mlss than in our study potentially making it more efficient to target filaments they have found however that even at a dose of 4 4 g o3 kg mlss comparable to this study the svi remained low compared to the control line there could be discrepancies insrt between the two studies resulting in differences in the effectiveness of the ozone treatment lyko et al 2012 reported the usage of low ozone dosage i e 1 6 g o3 kg mlss for a long time period for 8 months ozone applied only 1 week a month to be successful in lowering the svi at a full scale wrrf thus higher ozone dosage and or longer application times should be tested in order to properly evaluate the effect of ozone dosing on the filamentous bacteria abundance the implementation of hydrocyclones in line c also showed discrepancies between raw time series data and deseasonalized time series data for example during the second hydrocyclone run the increase of ca amarolinea midas s 1 was delayed compared to the other lines but this observation could not be confirmed with the deseasonalized time series fig 5b the srt in the system is relatively high approximately 25 days thus our experimental hydrocyclone trials were probably too short 12 and 23 days to observe any substantial change although not many full scale studies are reported in literature likely several months would be needed to change the sludge characteristics kent et al 2018 therefore a longer hydrocyclone operation time should be tested to properly evaluate the effect of hydrocyclone implementation on the filamentous bacteria similarly during the nano coagulant dosing period in line a we did not observe differences compared to the reference lines in the top three filamentous bacteria fig 5b however the plant operators reported that during wet weather conditions line a was able to handle the hydraulic load the wet weather flow to the four biological lines is 10 000 m3 h of the plant better than the other lines the effluent tss fig s16 si was only measured in the combined effluent from the wrrf thus any quantitative evaluation could not be made this could potentially be due to improved floc structure in line a thus although changes in the filamentous bacteria composition did not occur structural changes might have occurred in the sludge flocs due to the coagulant dosing overall we found that none of the treatment strategies successfully controlled the main filamentous bacteria associated with poor settling characteristics at the wrrf however these results could only be interpreted properly when removing the seasonal component of the time series data and by comparing with parallel lines in the same wrrf in light of our results it is important to plan such experiments with knowledge about the occurrence of the targeted bacteria and their seasonal dynamics for example knowing that ca m parvicella shows a strong recurrent seasonal pattern increasing during late autumn until spring experiments can be planned to target the period of rising abundance however seasonal dynamics may be species and wrrf specific peces et al 2022 so long term monitoring of microbial communities prior to full scale experiments is important to understand the normal seasonal pattern of the target species in each wrrf and to effectively choose and implement mitigation strategies 4 conclusions different mitigation strategies to reduce filamentous bulking in full scale wrrf commonly experiencing settling problems were tested in four parallel independent treatment lines pax dosing ozone addition hydrocyclone implementation and the addition of nano coagulants the sludge settleability measured as dsvi was not affected by any of the mitigation strategies at the tested dose and length of the test period ca microthrix and ca amarolinea were the two main filamentous bacterial genera causing bulking pax ozone and nano coagulant addition appeared to have a strong mitigating effect on these species however more detailed investigations showed that seasonal dynamics of these bacteria masked the real results and that no mitigation method showed convincing results the effect of the seasonal variation was removed by using a time series decomposition approach developed using a 3 years long community survey pax dosing was possibly successful in controlling ca microthrix subdominans but not the more common ca microthrix parvicella overall it is important to monitor the microbial communities at species level to understand the normal seasonal dynamics in order to effectively plan and execute experiments the results highlight the difficulties and biases of drawing conclusions based on testing in a single full scale treatment line long time series and or parallel reference lines are needed to properly evaluate the effect of mitigation strategies in full scale wrrfs declaration of competing interest the

16119,the activated sludge wastewater treatment process has been thoroughly researched in more than 100 years yet there are still operational challenges that have not been fully resolved such a challenge is the control of filamentous bulking caused by the overgrowth of certain filamentous bacteria in this study we tested different mitigation strategies to reduce filamentous bulking caused by two common filamentous genera found in full scale water resource recovery facilities wrrf candidatus microthrix and candidatus amarolinea pax dosing ozone addition hydrocyclone implementation and the addition of nano coagulants were tested as mitigation strategies in four parallel treatment lines in a full scale wrrf over three consecutive years unexpectedly the activated sludge settleability was not affected by any of the mitigation strategies some of the strategies appeared to have a strong mitigating effect on the two filamentous species however detailed analyses of the microbial communities revealed strong recurrent seasonal variations in all four lines including the control line which masked the real effect after removing the effect of the seasonal variation by using a time series decomposition approach it was clear that the filamentous bacteria were mostly unaffected by the mitigation strategies only pax dosing had some effect on ca microthrix but only on one species ca microthrix subdominans and not on the most common ca microthrix parvicella overall our study shows the importance of long term monitoring of microbial communities at species level to understand the normal seasonal pattern to effectively plan and execute full scale experiments moreover the results highlight the importance of using parallel reference treatment lines when evaluating the effect of mitigation strategies in full scale treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords filamentous bulking pax dosing ozonation hydrocyclone nano coagulant full scale wrrf time series analysis 1 introduction the activated sludge as process is a well established biotechnology for wastewater treatment around the world a well functioning microbial community is the backbone of the as process and the optimal operation of water resource recovery facilities wrrf depends on the biomass composition the increasing number of studies analyzing the microbial community composition wu et al 2019 nierychlo et al 2020a dueholm et al 2021 longitudinal studies targeting microbial community dynamics jiang et al 2016 griffin and wells 2017 jiang et al 2018 petrovski et al 2020 sun et al 2021 and ecophysiological studies in full scale as systems e g nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 petriglieri et al 2021 singleton et al 2021 have greatly improved our understanding of the microbial ecology of wrrf however there are still several operational problems in wrrf that can be linked to the presence of specific microorganisms which have not yet been resolved filamentous bacteria are important for the formation of stable flocs in activated sludge plants henze et al 2008 however overgrowth of filamentous bacteria can cause bulking or foaming nielsen et al 2009 resulting in unstable operation and deteriorated process performance due to inefficient secondary clarification henze et al 2008 several studies have tried to understand the cause of filamentous bulking by investigating the characteristics and physiology of filamentous bacteria rossetti et al 2005 mcilroy et al 2013 miłobȩdzka et al 2016 andersen et al 2019 nierychlo et al 2019 2020b 2021 but targeted mitigation strategies are still lacking for many species or they have shown inconsistent results some of the most common filamentous bacteria causing bulking belong to genus candidatus microthrix in the phylum actinobacteria nielsen et al 2009 wang et al 2014a wágner et al 2015 miłobȩdzka et al 2016 wang et al 2016 nierychlo et al 2020b 2021 and several species in the phylum chloroflexi nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 nierychlo et al 2020b ca microthrix consumes primarily long chain fatty acids and can store lipids under aerobic and anaerobic conditions mcilroy et al 2013 ca microthrix is able to store poly phosphate and has been found in some cases as the main contributor for phosphorus removal under bulking conditions wang et al 2014b but does not have a dynamic phosphorus cycling as the typical polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos nierychlo et al 2021 low temperature low dissolved oxygen do long solids retention time srt and low food to microorganism f m ratio are reported to be advantageous for their growth rossetti et al 2005 fan et al 2020 nierychlo et al 2021 there are two common species across the world ca microthrix parvicella and ca microthrix subdominans typically coexisting in wrrfs treating municipal wastewater nierychlo et al 2021 there seem to be some physiological differences between the two species with ca m subdominans able to grow better at higher oxygen concentrations while ca m parvicella is likely microaerophilic nierychlo et al 2021 the phylum chloroflexi includes several filamentous genera where some contribute to poor sludge settling while others support good floc formation nittami et al 2017 nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 candidatus villigracilis is mostly found inside the flocs possibly supporting good floc formation whereas candidatus promineofilum and candidatus sarcinithrix have been connected to bulking events nierychlo et al 2019 speirs et al 2019 in particular candidatus amarolinea has been reported to cause severe bulking events in danish wrrfs andersen et al 2019 nierychlo et al 2020b and local foaming events in china jiang et al 2018 different mitigation strategies are used to reduce the effect of filamentous bulking a general treatment method to target most filamentous bacteria is the addition of ozone to the return activated sludge ras ozone targets the protruding filamentous bacteria with a larger surface area thus improving the floc structure and consequently the settleability of the sludge nilsson et al 2014 2019 however different filamentous morphotypes are observed to have different responses to ozone treatment e g gordonia was found to be less affected barbarroja et al 2019 another approach is to use hydrocyclones to separate the biomass based on density and size the heavier fraction of the sludge is retained and returned to the process tank while the lighter fraction is removed with the effluent kent et al 2018 hydrocyclones are commonly used together with the demon process to retain the slow growing anammox bacteria and wash out flocculent biomass lackner et al 2014 hydrocyclones in full scale activated sludge systems kent et al 2018 and sequencing batch reactors sbrs xu et al 2019 have improved the settling properties of the sludge more targeted methods are also used to control specific species for example polyaluminum chloride pac referred to as pax in this study is dosed to specifically target ca microthrix as it affects the exopolymeric layer inhibiting the exoenzyme lipase activity and substrate uptake nielsen et al 2005 hamit eminovski et al 2010 fan et al 2020 pax is applied in many full scale plants usually with good results roels et al 2002 but there are also cases reported by the wrrf operators that it can be ineffective it has been observed that in order to achieve removal of ca microthrix a dosage of 1 5 to 4 5 g al kg mlss and a minimum dosing time of 3 3 5 weeks are needed roels et al 2002 as we will further demonstrate in this study seasonal patterns of the microbial community are observed in activated sludge systems ju et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 griffin and wells 2017 jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 johnston and behrens 2020 petrovski et al 2020 peces et al 2022 sun et al 2021 such variations may challenge traditional full scale mitigating experiments as it can be difficult to differentiate the effect of the tested mitigation strategy from the normal seasonal variation especially if these variations are not well described or if no control line is included several studies have shown that specific bacteria belonging to important functional groups such as nitrifiers paos and filamentous bacteria are affected by yearly seasonal variations e g ju et al 2014 jiang et al 2018 petrovski et al 2020 sun et al 2021 moreover we have recently shown the importance of analyzing seasonality at species level since species belonging to the same higher taxonomic unit e g genus or same functional guilds may show different seasonal patterns peces et al 2022 therefore there is a need to investigate how yearly seasonal variations impact the evaluation of full scale testing results at species level the ecosystem specific reference database for activated sludge and anaerobic digesters midas 3 provides reproducible species level identification of the bacteria in wrrfs nierychlo et al 2020a using this tool the aim of the study was to assess the effect of different mitigation strategies to reduce filamentous bulking in a full scale wrrf with four independent parallel treatment lines during a 3 year survey period we investigated the effect of pax dosing ozone dosing hydrocyclones and nano coagulants on i the activated sludge settleability ii the changes in overall microbial community composition and iii the changes in the most abundant filamentous bacteria i e ca microthrix and ca amarolinea moreover we investigated the effect of seasonal microbial variation on the evaluation and interpretation of the experimental results 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of damhusåen wrrf damhusåen wrrf copenhagen denmark has a design capacity of 350 000 population equivalent pe and treats municipal wastewater with approximately 15 20 industrial contribution expressed as chemical oxygen demand cod fraction estimated based on the amount of industrial water in the catchment area and the types of industries the wrrf has four parallel treatment lines a b c and d with dedicated secondary clarifiers and return sludge on each line so it is possible to test different treatment methods in full scale by comparing independent parallel lines the wrrf is designed as an enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr system with alternating bio denitro operation known as biodenipho bundgaard et al 1989 each treatment line consists of one anaerobic tank two aeration denitrifying tanks and six secondary clarifiers in lines b c and d the return sludge is collected from their respective secondary clarifiers and it is directed back to the beginning of the treatment line where it is mixed with the wastewater ebpr process operation line a is operated as side stream hydrolysis ssh where part of the return sludge is collected and directed into an anaerobic tank operated with a long residence time approximately 24 h more about how the ssh is operated and what are the advantages of this operation can be found in vollertsen et al 2006 in line a the influent wastewater is added only after the anaerobic tank more details on the design and operation of damhusåen wrrf can be found in table s1 supporting information si average influent wastewater characteristics are also shown in the si table s2 si suspended solids in the process tanks were relatively constant over the whole experimental period with a median value of 3 3 g ss l supporting fig s1 si 2 2 experimental design four full scale experiments were conducted to test the control of filamentous bulking pax dosing and nano coagulant dosing were tested in line a ozonation in line d and hydrocyclones in line c fig s2 si line b was left in all cases as a reference line without any treatment polyaluminum chloride pax15 kemira finland was dosed in the return sludge just before entering the treatment line a fig s3 si first the recommended dose by the supplier was used however it was halved when a white tint started appearing in the sludge the recommended daily dose of 1 5 g al kg ss was added in the period 06 03 2018 to 12 04 2018 37 days the dosing was lowered to half the amount in the consecutive period 13 04 2018 to 18 06 2018 66 days ozone treatment was conducted using a primozone gm18 ozone generator primozone production ab sweden fig s4 si approximately 8 15 of the return sludge in line d was mixed with the ozone in a contact tank with a daily dose of 4 5 5 g ozone kg ss the return sludge flow to the contact tank was between 20 and 36 m3 h and the residence time in the contact tank was 5 10 minutes two dosing periods were conducted between 10 08 2018 and 21 09 2018 42 days and between 26 03 2019 and 10 04 2019 15 days six hydrocyclones fig s5 si were installed in line c to separate the heavy sludge underflow from the loose light fraction overflow part of the return sludge was led through the hydrocyclones with an inflow of 21 m3 h the overflow sludge was directed away with a flow of 14 m3 h while the underflow sludge was led back to the treatment line with a flow of 7 m3 h the normal waste activated sludge removal was stopped in this line as itwas done via the overflow of the hydrocyclones two test periods were conducted between 15 10 2019 to 27 10 2019 12 days and between 18 01 2020 to 10 03 2020 52 days an inorganic coagulant based on nanotechnology norfloc nf1 alumichem denmark was dosed during one year between 14 04 2020 and 13 04 2021 in line a 364 days the dosage of the coagulant was controlled based on the actual flow and approximately 12 mg l of coagulant was dosed in the first few months which was then slowly reduced to 4 mg l in the colder winter months the nano coagulant was dosed directly in the aeration tank in line a instead of the iron chloride that is usually added to the treatment lines 2 3 sample collection and analysis metadata were collected from damhusåen wrrf including online sensor

randers wrrf with a daily dose of 1 15 g al kg ss and this was added in the period 28 03 2017 to 18 05 2017 polyaluminum chloride nordpac nordisk aluminat a s denmark was dosed at aalborg west wrrf in three periods between 2015 2017 the specific periods and the applied dose are shown in table s3 si 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mitigation strategies on sludge settleability the settling properties assessed by dsvi values were most of the time above or around the threshold in all four lines considered to indicate sludge with poor settling characteristics 120 ml g mielczarek et al 2012 dosing of pax nano coagulant and use of hydrocyclone did not affect the settleability of the sludge in the respective line compared to the other lines fig 1 ozone dosage in line d seemed to cause a decrease of the dsvi but by comparing with the other three lines it was clear that all lines had low and similar dsvi values during the same period besides this very small effect of ozone the increase of dsvi after ozone dosing was slightly delayed compared to the reference lines fig 1 these results highlight the importance of having parallel reference lines to evaluate the effect of mitigation strategies we observed a clear decrease in dsvi in all lines after the mitigation strategies were implemented but not only in the line with treatment if we had used only one line to evaluate the treatment strategies for example line a in case of the pax and nano coagulant dosing and line c in case of the hydrocyclone implementation the conclusions would have been that they were very efficient thus it is important to draw conclusions very carefully in full scale with only one treatment line and no reference line the use of reference lines to compare mitigation measures of bulking in full scale systems are very rare e g levén et al 2016 but necessary to draw correct conclusions 3 2 microbial community composition and settling properties the microbial communities in the four treatment lines were very similar during the 3 year period investigated as seen by pcoa ordination fig 2 a lines b c and d clustered tightly together suggesting that they were very similar in microbial structure throughout the years while line a was slightly different this is also visualized and supported by the top 25 most abundant genera with some dissimilarity in line a in the abundances but not identity figs 2 b s7 si line a is operated as ssh as opposed to the traditional ebpr scheme for the other lines hence this could result in the differences observed the most abundant genera were typical for danish ebpr plants with the pao tetrasphaera and the filamentous ca microthrix among them nierychlo et al 2020a several genera showed periodic increase and decrease in relative read abundance some of the most abundant genera ca microthrix rhodobacter midas g 70 class gammaproteobacteria trichococcus rhodoferax and olb8 among others showed clear periodicity related to seasonal variations fig s8 si in line a which is operated as ssh we observed several genera among the most abundant that were in lower abundance compared to the other three lines tetrasphaera midas g 70 ca competibacter midas g 399 and fodinicola however the trends for these genera are still identical among the lines fig s8 si similar to many other danish wrrfs the most abundant filamentous bacteria in damhusåen wrrf were ca microthrix and ca amarolinea in relative read abundances up to 30 followed by other typical filamentous bacteria found in denmark nierychlo et al 2020b and globally dueholm et al 2021 figs 2c s9 si line b c and d were very similar with minor abundance differences among some filamentous bacteria in line a fig s10 si the most abundant filamentous bacteria had a profound effect on the settling properties the dsvi values correlated well with the abundance of ca microthrix and ca amarolinea figs 3 s11 si where high abundance caused poor settling activated sludge the sum of the abundance of ca microthrix and ca amarolinea showed moderate correlation with dsvi in all lines r2 0 5 there was a low or no positive correlation between the dsvi and other filamentous bacteria r2 0 4 we found similar results in all lines figs 3 s11 si this suggests that the sludge settleability was strongly shaped by ca microthrix and ca amarolinea as has also been observed in other full scale wrrf in denmark and other countries wang et al 2014a wágner et al 2015 miłobȩdzka et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 nierychlo et al 2020b interestingly the presence of ca villigracilis fodinicola and leptothrix showed a negative correlation to dsvi in the case of ca villigracilis this could suggest improved settling properties when abundant by providing a strong backbone in the flocs nierychlo et al 2019 in case of the other two genera some of their species could be non filamentous thus resulting in negative correlation with dsvi 3 3 evaluation of microbial seasonal dynamics in a recent study we have shown high microbial seasonality at species level in danish wrrfs where species belonging to the same functional guild or the same genus did not follow the same seasonal dynamics peces et al 2022 as also observed by peces et al 2022 the variation in wastewater temperature could not explain all the different seasonal dynamics as many species did not show a strong linear correlation with temperature changes figs s12 and s13 si independently of the factors contributing to the seasonal dynamics such variations challenge full scale mitigating experiments as it may be difficult to differentiate the effect of the mitigation strategy tested from the normal seasonal variation the filamentous microbial community was classified based on their seasonal cohort i e the period during the year where the maximum relative read abundance is typically observed in each treatment line fig 4 the largest fraction of filamentous bacteria belonged to the autumn and spring cohorts fig 4a this agrees with other studies showing that the colder temperatures or often in the transition between cold and warmer periods coincide with higher relative abundance of filamentous bacteria and settling problems jiang et al 2016 petrovski et al 2020 nierychlo et al 2021 the autumn cohort included the highest number of filamentous species approximately 30 different species fig 4a the cumulative relative abundance of the autumn cohort was the highest mean relative abundance 8 14 however the relative abundance of the autumn cohort was dominated by ca amarolinea midas s 1 mean relative abundance 5 9 the difference observed in line c is related to the cohort classification of ca amarolinea midas s 1 where the estimated maximum abundance was found in week 37 summer cohort but very close to the summer and autumn cohort classification threshold i e week 38 table s4 si this species is often found in other danish wrrfs in the autumn cohort peces et al 2022 and was a main contributing filament to poor settling in this treatment plant fig 3 and other danish wrrfs nierychlo et al 2020b the spring cohort included only a few filamentous species 4 7 different species but their cumulative average relative abundance was surprisingly high 6 8 due to the second most abundant filamentous species ca m parvicella ca m parvicella is present mainly in the northern hemisphere and has a very strong seasonal pattern nierychlo et al 2021 peces et al 2022 not all the filamentous species showed a significant seasonal variation for example ca microthrix subdominans as shown in this study fig 5 a and in other danish wrrfs nierychlo et al 2021 peces et al 2022 we observed some differences in the seasonal dynamics among the different treatment lines but the maximum abundance peaks for each species were present at similar time points in each line fig 4b this clearly shows that understanding the seasonal dynamics of specific species is important and may be confounded with relative read abundance variations caused by the tested mitigation strategy 3 4 evaluation of filamentous bulking mitigation strategies four mitigation strategies were tested at the treatment plant in periods ranging from a few weeks to a few months the effect of the mitigation strategy was evaluated by including both the behavior in all four lines and the seasonal variation in microbial community structure dosage of pax was assumed to control ca microthrix if we used only one line line a to assess the results we would conclude that the pax dosing was very successful in reducing the abundance of ca m parvicella from 15 to 8 and still decreasing by end of the pax dosing fig 5a however by comparing to the other lines we could see that ca m parvicella decreased in all lines also in those without pax dosage this suggested that this decrease was most probably related to its normal seasonal variation a result that was confirmed by time series analysis of the 3 year long experimental period showing a recurrent strong seasonal variation of ca m parvicella fig 5a some positive effects of two of the mitigation strategies could be observed when analyzing them in combination with time series analysis and reference lines fig 5a to do so the raw relative read abundance time series were deseasonalized to evaluate if the effect of the mitigation strategy was still observable fig 5b during the pax dosing period abundance of ca amarolinea midas s 1 increased in line a similarly to the reference lines while ca m parvicella was stable in this period in all lines fig 5b despite the abundance of ca m subdominans was consistently lower in line a than the rest of the lines it showed a decreasing trend in line a during the pax dosing as opposed to the reference lines in both the raw time series and the deseasonalized time series fig 5a and b this suggests that this species might be affected by the pax dosing in contrast to ca m parvicella data collected from other danish wrrfs during pax dosing periods these periods are unrelated to the experiments at damhusåen wrrf and were recorded during standard dosing periods targeted against filamentous bulking also show that pax treatment was overall ineffective for ca m parvicella but in some cases effective against ca m subdominans figs s14 and s15 si the typical values for pax dosing in full scale wrrfs are reported to be between 1 5 4 5 g al kg ss roels et al 2002 fan et al 2020 this corresponds with the dosage applied in this study in the first 37 days of dosing which was then reduced to half dosage based on the recommendation by the supplier since species resolution was not possible in previous studies the differences in observed outcomes of pax dosages may be due to differences in the species composition in the wrrfs ozone was dosed during two periods in line d ozone treatment seemed to rapidly decrease the abundance of ca amarolinea midas s 1 after the first dosing period while after the second dosing period it seemed to delay the growth compared to the other lines fig 5 a however as opposed to the raw time series data we did not observe a difference in the trend of any of the bacteria in this treatment line compared to the reference lines in the deseasonalized time series fig 5 b thus the effect of ozone could not be conclusively resolved barbarroja et al 2019 found that different filamentous morphotypes were affected in different ways by ozone addition levén et al 2016 found that ozone dosing had an effect on the ca microthrix abundance in the treated line compared to the control line already after 21 days of dosing however in this period their ozone dosage was higher 6 6 g o3 kg mlss than in our study potentially making it more efficient to target filaments they have found however that even at a dose of 4 4 g o3 kg mlss comparable to this study the svi remained low compared to the control line there could be discrepancies insrt between the two studies resulting in differences in the effectiveness of the ozone treatment lyko et al 2012 reported the usage of low ozone dosage i e 1 6 g o3 kg mlss for a long time period for 8 months ozone applied only 1 week a month to be successful in lowering the svi at a full scale wrrf thus higher ozone dosage and or longer application times should be tested in order to properly evaluate the effect of ozone dosing on the filamentous bacteria abundance the implementation of hydrocyclones in line c also showed discrepancies between raw time series data and deseasonalized time series data for example during the second hydrocyclone run the increase of ca amarolinea midas s 1 was delayed compared to the other lines but this observation could not be confirmed with the deseasonalized time series fig 5b the srt in the system is relatively high approximately 25 days thus our experimental hydrocyclone trials were probably too short 12 and 23 days to observe any substantial change although not many full scale studies are reported in literature likely several months would be needed to change the sludge characteristics kent et al 2018 therefore a longer hydrocyclone operation time should be tested to properly evaluate the effect of hydrocyclone implementation on the filamentous bacteria similarly during the nano coagulant dosing period in line a we did not observe differences compared to the reference lines in the top three filamentous bacteria fig 5b however the plant operators reported that during wet weather conditions line a was able to handle the hydraulic load the wet weather flow to the four biological lines is 10 000 m3 h of the plant better than the other lines the effluent tss fig s16 si was only measured in the combined effluent from the wrrf thus any quantitative evaluation could not be made this could potentially be due to improved floc structure in line a thus although changes in the filamentous bacteria composition did not occur structural changes might have occurred in the sludge flocs due to the coagulant dosing overall we found that none of the treatment strategies successfully controlled the main filamentous bacteria associated with poor settling characteristics at the wrrf however these results could only be interpreted properly when removing the seasonal component of the time series data and by comparing with parallel lines in the same wrrf in light of our results it is important to plan such experiments with knowledge about the occurrence of the targeted bacteria and their seasonal dynamics for example knowing that ca m parvicella shows a strong recurrent seasonal pattern increasing during late autumn until spring experiments can be planned to target the period of rising abundance however seasonal dynamics may be species and wrrf specific peces et al 2022 so long term monitoring of microbial communities prior to full scale experiments is important to understand the normal seasonal pattern of the target species in each wrrf and to effectively choose and implement mitigation strategies 4 conclusions different mitigation strategies to reduce filamentous bulking in full scale wrrf commonly experiencing settling problems were tested in four parallel independent treatment lines pax dosing ozone addition hydrocyclone implementation and the addition of nano coagulants the sludge settleability measured as dsvi was not affected by any of the mitigation strategies at the tested dose and length of the test period ca microthrix and ca amarolinea were the two main filamentous bacterial genera causing bulking pax ozone and nano coagulant addition appeared to have a strong mitigating effect on these species however more detailed investigations showed that seasonal dynamics of these bacteria masked the real results and that no mitigation method showed convincing results the effect of the seasonal variation was removed by using a time series decomposition approach developed using a 3 years long community survey pax dosing was possibly successful in controlling ca microthrix subdominans but not the more common ca microthrix parvicella overall it is important to monitor the microbial communities at species level to understand the normal seasonal dynamics in order to effectively plan and execute experiments the results highlight the difficulties and biases of drawing conclusions based on testing in a single full scale treatment line long time series and or parallel reference lines are needed to properly evaluate the effect of mitigation strategies in full scale wrrfs declaration of competing interest the
