18020,suspended biofilm carriers mediating direct interspecies electron transfer diet based syntrophic metabolism is a promising strategy to enhance anaerobic digestion and methane production by associating the advantages of conductive suspended biofilm carriers and anaerobic integrated floating fixed film and activated sludge an iffas process however the current knowledge of diet using conductive suspended biofilm carrier is still limited in this study novel electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers had been prepared by introducing a series of graphite powders 3 wt 5 wt and 7 wt into high density polyethylene hdpe and applied in an iffas reactors results showed that an iffas reactors filled with graphite modified carriers could enhance the degradation of organic matters and the production of methane significantly in comparison with the control reactor filled with conventional hdpe carriers at organic loading rates olrs of 5 9 23 7 kg cod m3 d microbial analysis proved that 7 wt graphite modified carrier improved approximately 4 2 abundance of geobacter and 7 3 abundance of electrotrophic methanogens methanothrix that exchange electron via diet comparing with that of hdpe carriers respectively these findings demonstrated that electron mediator suspended biofilm carrier was able to potentially proceed diet and enhance the efficiency of anaerobic digestion and recover ch4 related energy graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm carrier an iffas direct interspecies electron transfer diet graphite ch4 recovery 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad of organic matters is a widely used technology in the efficient treatment of organic wastewater and the simultaneous generation of renewable energy sources up to now ad has been reported in a variety of biofilm systems such as anaerobic fluidized bed reactor anaerobic moving biofilm reactor and anaerobic sequencing biofilm batch reactor due to the advantages of strong shock resistance ability high organic matter removal rate and efficient methane production karadag et al 2015 apart from these biofilm technologies our previous research reported a kind of hybrid suspended growth biofilm system named anaerobic integrated floating fixed film activated sludge an iffas which incorporates a high surface area of free floating media in oxygen deprived zones of the sludge process where biomass grow as both floating floc and biofilm mao 2018 considering floc and biofilm are characterized as distinctive microbial structures huang et al 2017 mahendran et al 2012 an iffas offers associated benefits of the potential multiple redox states combining with anaerobic operational conditions therefore this technique may gain additional treatment capacity when treating industrial wastewater containing organic pollutants due to the presence of both flocs and biofilms in recent decades interspecies hydrogen transfer iht has been considered as the predominant working mode between syntrophs and methanogens during anaerobic methanogenesis stams and plugge 2009 in which h2 served as the electron carrier however iht is a weak biological link and vulnerable to environmental conditions when iht is limited the increase of hydrogen partial pressure will break the balance of syntrophic metabolism and even lead to the failure of ad muyzer and stams 2008 recent studies have found that acetoclastic methanogens methanothrix and methanosarcina species can directly receive electrons with the help of electrochemically active bacteria such as geobacter sp morita et al 2011 rotaru et al 2014 in particular the presence of geobacter sp in anaerobic mixed cultures has been always reported and their role of transferring electrons to methanogens was comprehensively elucidated by electrically conductive pili and c type cytochromes distributing on flagella or outer surface liu et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 this process is referred to as direct interspecies electron transfer diet which is regarded as an alternative to iht in syntrophic metabolism of ad in a more thermodynamically favorable way zhao et al 2017 further studies revealed that electrically conductive carbon materials such as granular activated carbon gac carbon cloth graphite could serve as the electrical conduits to facilitate diet and promote the conversion from organic matters to methane during anaerobic digestion chen et al 2014 lei et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 the primary mechanism is that conductive materials cm are capable of substituting the role of pili and c type cytochromes and working as an electron mediator between geobactor and electrotrophic methanogens when diet is established by cm it will provide more energy to support the growth of syntrophic partners and further drive them to metabolize more substrates which is favorable to strengthen the treatment of organic wastewater and improve the productivity of methane in ad process barua and dhar 2017 in fact cm used as support media are for the retention of biomass and develop diet based biofilm in which electrons generated from geobacter can migrate through cm to electrotrophic methanogens although the fundamental mechanism of fixed or suspended cm for the enhancement of ad is similar principally due to diet there are some inevitable disadvantages of fixed cm in practical application for example excess biomass accumulation may lead to clogging of bed fixed bed processes have to face diffusional limitations due to poor mass transfer and the size and shape of cm incorporated in anaerobic digester require sophisticated process design on the contrary suspended cm are capable of effectively avoiding clogging of bed maintaining favorable mass transfer and increasing the diverseness of system as well as improving the abundance of methanogens moreover the moving carriers could provide an additional quick pathway for the long distance electron transfer ren et al 2018 and facilitate the increase of methane yield morgan sagastume et al 2019 although the suspended cm present such superiorities there have been few investigations in diet with conductive suspended carriers because these conventional cm are not easy to fluidize due to the density limitation either higher or lower than the density of water a promising strategy to fluidize cm and further establish diet based biofilm is to develop novel suspended biofilm carriers modified with electron mediator which is capable of rapid improving the abundance of geobacter and electrotrophic methanogens and can be easily fluidized by influent or mechanical mixing as an inexpensive and excellent electrical conductivity material graphite has been applied for enhancing diet in ad systems dang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 and exhibits an ideal potential in working as an electron mediator for enhancing ad on the other hand high density polyethylene hdpe is the one of preferred polymer materials to produce suspended biofilm carriers due to its plasticity density and durability therefore blending appropriate proportion of graphite powders with hdpe is regarded to be an effective approach to provide long standing conductive mediators for diet on the surface of carriers which associates the advantages of an iffas process and proceeds diet with syntrophic partners to our best knowledge this work is the first by applying graphite modified suspended biofilm carriers in an iffas system for the establishment of diet and the enhancement of ad and demonstrates the high performance of the strategy in ad moreover this kind of novel biofilm carriers is characterized by inexpensive easy to manufacture and strong mechanical strength therefore an iffas process based on the novel electron mediator suspended biofilm carrier shows great potential in establishing diet in practical application comparing with fixed bed process based on the described subjects the purpose of this research was to enhance the efficiency of ad and recover ch4 related energy in a hybrid system using the novel carrier the pollutants removal performances methane production rates and microbial community structures were evaluated and analyzed under different influent organic loading rates olrs aiming to assess the suitable blending proportion of graphite and pursue a new optimized technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers were prepared by blending a series of graphite powders 3 wt 5 wt and 7 wt into the hdpe granule assisted by hydrophilic auxiliary materials as reported in our previous study liu et al 2018 the mixture was uniformly dispersed under mechanical stirring using a cylindrical blender 100 rpm for 10 min graphite powders were purchased from tianjin bodi chemical co ltd tianjin china with average particle sizes over 75 μm and conductivity of 457 9 s cm afterwards a laboratory scale single screw extruder with the length to diameter ratio l d of 25 1 was used to extrude with the screw speed of 8 rpm a vacuum system and a dragger were used for finalizing the design and dragging cylinder respectively the carriers were small cylinders with a cross inside and fins on the outside the length diameter and specific surface area of the cylinder were 10 mm 10 mm and 580 m2 m3 respectively as a control hdpe carriers without graphite powders or hydrophilic auxiliary materials were prepared following the same manufacturing processes of the electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers the electro conductivity of hdpe carriers was 1 69 10 5 s cm determined by a four probe measurement keithley 2400 usa and those of the graphite modified carriers with different graphite proportions were increased to 1 81 10 5 s cm 3 wt 2 67 10 5 s cm 5 wt and 3 54 10 5 s cm 7 wt respectively the specific surface area of hdpe carriers was 580 m2 m3 2 2 experimental setup and operation strategy five lab scale cylindrical reactors 40 cm in height 10 cm in diameter and 1 8 l working volume were operated parallelly fig 1 including two control reactors anaerobic flocs reactor r1 and conventional hdpe carrier

controlled at 35 c by a water bath circulating system to ensure carriers fluidization a stirrer device jj 1 xichengxinrui china was utilized intermittently stir 1 h stop 5 h referring that intermittent mixing was beneficial for methanogenic biofilm growth and methane production kariyama et al 2018 seeding sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester of a municipal waste treatment plant in dalian china the total suspended sludge tss of the seeding sludge was 11957 203 mg l while the ratio of volatile suspended sludge vss to tss was 0 51 before inoculation filtration was carried out to remove the large solid particles which might influence initial water quality measurement the inoculated sludge dosage of each reactor was 600 ml in order to create similar initial environments among the reactors five reactors were operated for 10 days of startup without carriers under initial influent olr of 5 9 kg cod m3 d influent chemical oxygen demand cod was maintained about 5837 0 267 0 mg l afterwards different proportional graphite modified carriers and hdpe carriers were added into the reactors with the packing ratio of 30 vcarrier vreactor and the five reactors were operated with influent olr of 5 9 kg cod m3 d stage1 from day 40 the influent olr of the five reactors gradually increased from 5 9 kg cod m3 d to 23 7 kg cod m3 d during the next 63 days stage 2 5 by reducing hrt to 18 h stage 2 12 h stage 3 and increasing the concentration of influent cod to 8358 1 258 2 mg l stage 4 and 11868 3 637 2 mg l stage 5 respectively the composition of synthetic organic

favorable environment for methanogens 2 3 chemical analysis the concentration of cod was determined by using hach s method 8000 hach dr 890 usa tss and vss were analyzed in accordance with the

framework repository https osf io vq79n 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of the cod removal and methane production in order to assess pollutant removal performance and methane generation of the five reactors without carriers with hdpe carriers and with graphite modified carriers influent and effluent cod the methane production rate and the yield of methane were evaluated and shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2a five reactors underwent an unstable phase during the initial 30 days with the influent olr of 5 9 kg cod m3 d stage 1 this phenomenon was probably attributed to the fact that biofilm went through a rapid growth period and the community structure of microorganisms was unstable in this phase nevertheless from day 30 to day 39 stage 1 the average cod removal efficiency reached 79 5 83 3 87 7 88 4 and 90 0 respectively in r1 r5 table 1 it could be observed that cod removal efficiencies of the reactors filled with graphite modified carriers r3 r4 r5 were enhanced comparing with r2 filled with hdpe carriers and r1 without carriers meanwhile the cod removal performance was positively related to graphite proportions in carriers p 0 05 table 1 it was speculated that the more graphite in the carriers could provide more conductive conduits on carrier s surface of which geobacter cells and electrotrophic methanogens cells could exchange electron via diet accordingly park et al 2018 when hrt was reduced from 24 h to 18 h and 12 h stage 2 and stage 3 olr increased from 5 9 kg cod m3 d to 7 8 kg cod m3 d and 11 7 kg cod m3 d respectively to further evaluate the organic pollutants removal capacity of the an iffas systems in these two stages stable cod degradation performance was observed in five reactors nevertheless similar to those phenomena in stage 1 the cod removal efficiencies of the experimental group reactors r3 r4 and r5 were greater than that of control reactors r1 and r2 table 1 from day 66 to day 85 the influent olr increased to 16 8 kg cod m3 d stage 4 to further evaluate the ability to tolerate organic loadings in five reactors the cod removal efficiency significantly reduced in the r1 however an iffas reactors r2 r5 still trended to be stable after a short time of fluctuation it was demonstrated that an iffas could gain significant treatment capacity in comparison with anaerobic flocs system when treating high olr organic pollutants due to the presence of both flocs and biofilms especially over 89 average cod removal rate was achieved in graphite modified carrier reactors table 1 which was greater than that of r2 86 3 filled with hdpe carriers p 0 05 the similar phenomenon was observed at stage 5 when influent olr increased to 23 7 kg cod m3 d and the greatest cod removal efficiency was always achieved in r5 with 7 wt graphite modified carriers these results indicated that reactors filled with graphite modified carriers had strong ability to tolerate olr impacts which was supported by the reports that the syntrophic conversion of organic matters to methane could be accelerated by the adding of cm even under the high olr condition dang et al 2016 lei et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 hence it could be inferred that the relatively better performance of cod removal in r3 r4 and r5 resulted from the distribution of conductive graphite in carriers that could potentially accelerate syntrophic metabolism by establishing diet as the influent olr increased from 5 9 kg cod m3 d to 23 7 kg cod m3 d stage 1 stage 5 the production rate of methane in five reactors was gradually increasing fig 2b during the stable phase of stage 1 day 30 to day 39 the production rate of methane in r3 r4 r5 filled with graphite modified carriers was about 7 8 9 5 higher than that of r2 with hdpe carriers and about 15 5 17 4 higher than that of r1 without carriers it could be observed that an iffas systems filled with graphite modified carriers exhibited distinct superiority in methane production comparing with those reactors filled with hdpe carriers or without carriers when olr increased to 7 8 kg cod m3 d stage 2 it was exciting to observe that much higher methane production rates were obtained in experimental group reactors r3 r4 r5 with the increment of 14 2 23 3 and 22 3 31 3 comparing with r2 and r1 respectively such better performances in terms of methane production in the reactors filled with graphite modified carriers indicated that more effective interspecies electron transfer might be established to promote syntrophic metabolism when influent olrs increased at stage 3 4 and 5 methane production rate in experimental group reactors r3 r4 r5 still improved significantly p 0 05 which increased about 12 4 26 6 stage 3 6 3 13 8 stage 4 and 11 7 17 8 stage 5 comparing with that of r2 it was worth noting that graphite modified carrier reactors displayed distinct advantages of methane production even under the condition of relatively high olrs in addition although slight increase of cod removal efficiencies was observed in r3 r4 and r5 at stage 3 4 and 5 table 1 these three experimental group reactors still showed strong methane production capacity it indicated that the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane via diet probably occurred moreover r5 filled with 7 wt graphite modified carriers always presented the best methane production performances among all the five reactors through the whole operation period these results demonstrated that graphite modified carrier could promote the production of methane by potentially establishing diet and carriers with more proportion of graphite showed greater methane production capacity previous reports proved that biomass was an essential factor affecting methane production in ad systems maslon and tomaszek 2015 therefore the biomass of anaerobic flocs and biofilms was measured and shown in table 2 apparently neither tss nor vss showed significant difference among graphite modified carrier filled reactors and hdpe carrier filled reactor therefore it was regarded that graphite modified carrier could promote methane production by accelerating electron transfer rather than forming more biomass methane yield is another important index to evaluate ad efficiency in this study the yield of methane was calculated and displayed in fig 2c the total methane yield percentage should be over 50 in anaerobic process usually around 70 however the yield of methane is commonly more than 70 owing to the pathway of carbon dioxide reduced to methane via diet in this study reactors filled with graphite modified carriers r3 r4 and r5 revealed higher methane yield than r2 and r1 throughout the operation period and the highest methane yield of 93 3 was achieved in r4 at stage 2 olr of 7 8 kg cod m3 d it indicated that more carbon could be transformed into methane in experimental group reactors filled with graphite modified carriers and potential diet might be established in general r3 r4 and r5 filled with graphite modified carriers performed greater cod removal efficiency and energy production comparing with hdpe carrier filled reactor and without carrier filled reactor comparing with hdpe carriers the electro conductivities of these graphite modified biofilm carriers increased and pollutant removal and methane production performance were positively correlated with their electro conductivities this result also meant that the more graphite powders dispersed on the carriers could provide more conductive conduits for the establishment of diet therefore it is feasible to improve the performance of anaerobic digestion by appropriately increasing the proportion of graphite in carriers moreover auxiliary materials and functional materials selected for carrier modification were cheaper than hdpe granules and blended in small proportions therefore the cost of graphite modified carriers was comparable to or even more economic than that of hdpe carriers and the blended diatomite could increase the tensile strength of carriers as reported in our previous study mao 2018 therefore we believed this type of novel carriers could be used for even a longer period without excessive costs 3 2 performances of vfas removal vfas such as ethanol acetate propionate and butyrate are important intermediate products during ad process they are likely to lower the ph and inhibit the process of methane production when they accumulate in the reactor therefore enhancing the treatment of vfas seems particularly important to maintain stable methane production in this study effluent ethanol acetate and propionate were measured and the results were shown in fig 3 effluent ethanol was around 92 44 mg cod l and presented little difference among the five reactors data not shown it was probably attributing to the fact that ethanol was preferably to be transformed to acetate by fermentation bacteria and utilized by methanogens subsequently lin et al 2018 on the contrary there were significant differences p 0 05 in propionate and acetate removal rates among the reactors the effluent concentration of acetate and propionate in graphite modified carrier filled reactors r3 r4 and r5 was lower than that of r2 and r1 during the operation to be specific propionate and acetate removal rates increased by 4 1 24 6 and 2 0 9 4 p 0 05 respectively in graphite modified carrier filled reactors comparing with the hdpe carrier filled reactor throughout the operation moreover the difference of acetate and propionate removal rates among the three graphite modified carrier filled reactors showed the tendency that the more proportion of graphite in carriers the better vfas removal rates were achieved it is well known that ethanol or propionate can be metabolized by fermentation bacteria and transformed to acetate further utilized by methanogens the lower effluent acetate and propionate detected in r3 r4 and r5 suggested that the progress of methanogenesis was enhanced owing to the filling of graphite modified carriers 3 3 scanning electron micrograph analysis the sem photographs of microbial morphology in five floc samples and four biofilm samples were shown in fig 4 it indicated that cells with different morphology rod filamentous and globular shapes were identified in these samples the biomass density was great and the majority of microorganism was filamentous closely related to methanothrix besides the rod shaped cells with flagella closely related to geobacter existed and were connected with methanogens it also revealed that relatively higher abundance of rod shaped cells with flagella was observed in graphite modified carrier reactors both on biofilm and in floc which could be inferred that graphite modified carriers enriched more geobacter than hdpe carriers and proceeded the diet with methanogens accordingly 3 4 microbial community analysis after 103 days operation the microbial community structures of floc r1 r5 and biofilm r2 r5 samples from five reactors were analyzed via high throughput 16s rrna pyrosequencing 225 bacterial genera and 16 archaeal genera were detected and the results were shown in fig 5 as fig 5a showed that geobacter confirmed as the typical species participating in diet process morita et al 2011 rotaru et al 2014 was detected in the five reactors both in flocs and on biofilms which could be attributed to the fact that ethanol stimulated the methanogenic communities for establishing diet based syntrophic metabolism zhao and zhang 2019 however about 7 abundance of geobacter was observed in biofilm sample of r5 which was higher than that of r4 biofilm 4 4 r3 biofilm 2 4 and r2 biofilm 2 8 in particular 7 wt graphite modified carriers enriched about 1 5 fold abundance of geobacter compared with that of hdpe carriers furthermore the total abundance of geobacter both flocs and biofilms in graphite modified carrier filled reactors was 18 9 in r5 18 8 in r4 and 11 9 in r3 respectively which was higher than that of r2 10 8 and r1 8 9 this result suggested that graphite modified carriers supplemented to the reactors could significant increase the abundance of geobacter syntrophobacter and smithella species known to metabolize propionate to acetate and carbon dioxide with the production of h2 de bok et al 2004 were more abundant in graphite modified carrier reactors compared with r1 and r2 the sufficient species were beneficial for propionate metabolism which was in accordance with the results of fig 3b that relatively low effluent propionate was observed in r3 r4 and r5 however neither syntrophobacter nor smithella have been reported to be capable of extracellular electron transfer hatamoto et al 2007 sousa et al 2007 and thus are unlikely to participate in diet their increases suggested even on the surface of electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers the enrichment conditions employed to enrich propionate metabolism via diet did not exclude the metabolism via iht in addition the experimental group reactors r4 and r5 not only enriched more geobacter species but also enriched more electrotrophic methanogens methanothrix species also known as methanosaeta wang et al 2019 capable of receiving the electron from gecbacter and forming diet was the most dominant genus of methanogenic archaea in flocs and biofilms fig 5b this type of acetoclastic methanogenic archaea accounted for 79 2 and 78 1 in r5 and r4 respectively which were greater than that of r2 71 9 and r1 72 4 the increased abundance of methanothrix species in r4 and r5 might be ascribed to the fact that graphite modified carriers were capable of enriching more geobacter which accelerated the decomposition of organic matters to acetate and stimulated the enrichment of this acetoclastic methanogens subsequently however it was worth mentioning that the better cod removal performance and methane production capacity were achieved in r3 though there was no significant difference in the abundance of methanothrix between r3 70 4 and r2 71 9 it was speculated that the better performance of r3 was probably ascribed to the enriched geobacter in the system which accelerated the conversion of organics to methane as documented in previous finding yang et al 2017 and the little difference of this methanogens was attributed to the possibility that the low amount of graphite 3 wt dispersed in carriers was not sufficient to enrich methanothrix methanosarcina another methanogens proved as electron accepting partner via diet rotaru et al 2014 was also detected in five reactors and revealed little difference among the samples apparently electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers showed better advantageous to enrich geobacter and methanothrix than hdpe carriers it is well known that the initial attachment is regarded as the key step for biofilm formation zhao et al 2015 reported that conductive carbon materials could promote interspecies electrical connections which might save substantial cellular energy and promote the initial adaptation of microorganism to interact via diet it indicated that the conductive graphite powders dispersed on the surface of carriers can alleviate the energy consumed by microbes for the formation of interspecies electrical connections therefore when more graphite powders blended with hdpe more conductive conduits could be supplied for electron exchanging between geobacter and methanothrix which could accelerate the initial adaptation and facilitate more geobacter and methanothrix attaching to the carriers besides methanobacterium species the well known hydrogen utilizing methanogens jin et al 2019 were detected with low abundance of 10 5 12 5 in three experimental group reactors in comparison the relative abundance of methanobacterium was 25 6 in r1 and 16 0 in r2 this significant difference in hydrogen utilizing comminutes indicated that interspecies hydrogen transfer might play a subordinate role while diet took place as a predominant metabolic pathway owing to the addition of electron mediator biofilm carriers in experimental group reactors 4 conclusions a kind of novel electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers was successfully prepared by blending hdpe with conductive graphite powders results proved that graphite modified carriers enriched more abundance of geobacter and methanothrix both in flocs and biofilms which could potentially proceed diet and enhance the treatment of acetate propionate and show a high methane production rate accordingly this study provides a new strategy and technology

18020,suspended biofilm carriers mediating direct interspecies electron transfer diet based syntrophic metabolism is a promising strategy to enhance anaerobic digestion and methane production by associating the advantages of conductive suspended biofilm carriers and anaerobic integrated floating fixed film and activated sludge an iffas process however the current knowledge of diet using

the production of methane significantly in comparison with the control reactor filled with conventional hdpe carriers at organic loading rates olrs of 5 9 23 7 kg cod m3 d microbial analysis proved that 7 wt graphite modified carrier improved approximately 4 2 abundance of geobacter and 7 3 abundance of electrotrophic methanogens methanothrix that exchange electron via diet comparing with that of hdpe carriers respectively these findings demonstrated that electron mediator suspended biofilm carrier was able to potentially proceed diet and enhance the efficiency of anaerobic digestion and recover ch4 related energy graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm carrier an iffas direct interspecies electron transfer diet graphite ch4 recovery 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad of organic matters is a widely used technology in the efficient treatment of organic wastewater and the simultaneous generation of renewable energy sources up to now ad has been reported in a variety of biofilm systems such as anaerobic fluidized bed reactor anaerobic moving biofilm reactor and anaerobic sequencing biofilm batch reactor due to the advantages of strong shock resistance ability high organic matter removal rate and efficient methane production karadag et al 2015 apart from these biofilm technologies our previous research reported a kind of hybrid suspended growth biofilm system named anaerobic integrated floating fixed film activated sludge an iffas which incorporates a high surface area of free floating media in oxygen deprived zones of the sludge process where biomass grow as both floating floc and biofilm mao 2018 considering floc and biofilm are characterized as distinctive microbial structures huang et al 2017 mahendran et al 2012 an iffas offers associated benefits of the potential multiple redox states combining with anaerobic operational conditions therefore this technique may gain additional treatment capacity when treating industrial wastewater containing organic pollutants due to the presence of both flocs and biofilms in recent decades interspecies hydrogen transfer iht has been considered as the predominant working mode between syntrophs and methanogens during anaerobic methanogenesis stams and plugge 2009 in which h2 served as the electron carrier however iht is a weak biological link and vulnerable to environmental conditions when iht is limited the increase of hydrogen partial pressure will break the balance of syntrophic metabolism and even lead to the failure of ad muyzer and stams 2008 recent studies have found that acetoclastic methanogens methanothrix and methanosarcina species can directly receive electrons with the help of electrochemically active bacteria such as geobacter sp morita et al 2011 rotaru et al 2014 in particular the presence of geobacter sp in anaerobic mixed cultures has been always reported and their role of transferring electrons to methanogens was comprehensively elucidated by electrically conductive pili and c type cytochromes distributing on flagella or outer surface liu et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 this process is referred to as direct interspecies electron transfer diet which is regarded as an alternative to iht in syntrophic metabolism of ad in a more thermodynamically favorable way zhao et al 2017 further studies revealed that electrically conductive carbon materials such as granular activated carbon gac carbon cloth graphite could serve as the electrical conduits to facilitate diet and promote the conversion from organic matters to methane during anaerobic digestion chen et al 2014 lei et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 the primary mechanism is that conductive materials cm are capable of substituting the role of pili and c type cytochromes and working as an electron mediator between geobactor and electrotrophic methanogens when diet is established by cm it will provide more energy to support the growth of syntrophic partners and further drive them to metabolize more substrates which is favorable to strengthen the treatment of organic wastewater and improve the productivity of methane in ad process barua and dhar 2017 in fact cm used as support media are for the retention of biomass and develop diet based biofilm in which electrons generated from geobacter can migrate through cm to electrotrophic methanogens although the fundamental mechanism of fixed or suspended cm for the enhancement of ad is similar principally due to diet there are some inevitable disadvantages of fixed cm in practical application for example excess biomass accumulation may lead to clogging of bed fixed bed processes have to face diffusional limitations due to poor mass transfer and the size and shape of cm incorporated in anaerobic digester require sophisticated process design on the contrary suspended cm are capable of effectively avoiding clogging of bed maintaining favorable mass transfer and increasing the diverseness of system as well as improving the abundance of methanogens moreover the moving carriers could provide an additional quick pathway for the long distance electron transfer ren et al 2018 and facilitate the increase of methane yield morgan sagastume et al 2019 although the suspended cm present such superiorities there have been few investigations in diet with conductive suspended carriers because these conventional cm are not easy to fluidize due to the density limitation either higher or lower than the density of water a promising strategy to fluidize cm and further establish diet based biofilm is to develop novel suspended biofilm carriers modified with electron mediator which is capable of rapid improving the abundance of geobacter and electrotrophic methanogens and can be easily fluidized by influent or mechanical mixing as an inexpensive and excellent electrical conductivity material graphite has been applied for enhancing diet in ad systems dang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 and exhibits an ideal potential in working as an electron mediator for enhancing ad on the other hand high density polyethylene hdpe is the one of preferred polymer materials to produce suspended biofilm carriers due to its plasticity density and durability therefore blending appropriate proportion of graphite powders with hdpe is regarded to be an effective approach to provide long standing conductive mediators for diet on the surface of carriers which associates the advantages of an iffas process and proceeds diet with syntrophic partners to our best knowledge this work is the first by applying graphite modified suspended biofilm carriers in an iffas system for the establishment of diet and the enhancement of ad and demonstrates the high performance of the strategy in ad moreover this kind of novel biofilm carriers is characterized by inexpensive easy to manufacture and strong mechanical strength therefore an iffas process based on the novel electron mediator suspended biofilm carrier shows great potential in establishing diet in practical application comparing with fixed bed process based on the described subjects the purpose of this research was to enhance the efficiency of ad and recover ch4 related energy in a hybrid system using the novel carrier the pollutants removal performances methane production rates and microbial community structures were evaluated and analyzed under different influent organic loading rates olrs aiming to assess the suitable blending proportion of graphite and pursue a new optimized technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers were prepared by blending a series of graphite powders 3 wt 5 wt and 7 wt into the hdpe granule assisted by hydrophilic auxiliary materials as reported in our previous study liu et al 2018 the mixture was uniformly dispersed under mechanical stirring using a cylindrical blender 100 rpm for 10 min graphite powders were purchased from tianjin bodi chemical co ltd tianjin china with average particle sizes over 75 μm and conductivity of 457 9 s cm afterwards a laboratory scale single screw extruder with the length to diameter ratio l d of 25 1 was used to extrude with the screw speed of 8 rpm a vacuum system and a dragger were used for finalizing the design and dragging cylinder respectively the carriers were small cylinders with a cross inside and fins on the outside the length diameter and specific surface area of the cylinder were 10 mm 10 mm and 580 m2 m3 respectively as a control hdpe carriers without graphite powders or hydrophilic auxiliary materials were prepared following the same manufacturing processes of the electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers the electro conductivity of hdpe carriers was 1 69 10 5 s cm determined by a four probe measurement keithley 2400 usa and those of the graphite modified carriers with different graphite proportions were increased to 1 81 10 5 s cm 3 wt 2 67 10 5 s cm 5 wt and 3 54 10 5 s cm 7 wt respectively the specific surface area of hdpe carriers was 580 m2 m3 2 2 experimental setup and operation strategy five lab scale cylindrical reactors 40 cm in height 10 cm in diameter and 1 8 l working volume were operated parallelly fig 1 including two control reactors anaerobic flocs reactor r1 and conventional hdpe carrier

controlled at 35 c by a water bath circulating system to ensure carriers fluidization a stirrer device jj 1 xichengxinrui china was utilized intermittently stir 1 h stop 5 h referring that intermittent mixing was beneficial for methanogenic biofilm growth and methane production kariyama et al 2018 seeding sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester of a municipal waste treatment plant in dalian china the total suspended sludge tss of the seeding sludge was 11957 203 mg l while the ratio of volatile suspended sludge vss to tss was 0 51 before inoculation filtration was carried out to remove the large solid particles which might influence initial water quality measurement the inoculated sludge dosage of each reactor was 600 ml in order to create similar initial environments among the reactors five reactors were operated for 10 days of startup without carriers under initial influent olr of 5 9 kg cod m3 d influent chemical oxygen demand cod was maintained about 5837 0 267 0 mg l afterwards different proportional graphite modified carriers and hdpe carriers were added into the reactors with the packing ratio of 30 vcarrier vreactor and the five reactors were operated with influent olr of 5 9 kg cod m3 d stage1 from day 40 the influent olr of the five reactors gradually increased from 5 9 kg cod m3 d to 23 7 kg cod m3 d during the next 63 days stage 2 5 by reducing hrt to 18 h stage 2 12 h stage 3 and increasing the concentration of influent cod to 8358 1 258 2 mg l stage 4 and 11868 3 637 2 mg l stage 5 respectively the composition of synthetic organic

favorable environment for methanogens 2 3 chemical analysis the concentration of cod was determined by using hach s method 8000 hach dr 890 usa tss and vss were analyzed in accordance with the

framework repository https osf io vq79n 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of the cod removal and methane production in order to assess pollutant removal performance and methane generation of the five reactors without carriers with hdpe carriers and with graphite modified carriers influent and effluent cod the methane production rate and the yield of methane were evaluated and shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2a five reactors underwent an unstable phase during the initial 30 days with the influent olr of 5 9 kg cod m3 d stage 1 this phenomenon was probably attributed to the fact that biofilm went through a rapid growth period and the community structure of microorganisms was unstable in this phase nevertheless from day 30 to day 39 stage 1 the average cod removal efficiency reached 79 5 83 3 87 7 88 4 and 90 0 respectively in r1 r5 table 1 it could be observed that cod removal efficiencies of the reactors filled with graphite modified carriers r3 r4 r5 were enhanced comparing with r2 filled with hdpe carriers and r1 without carriers meanwhile the cod removal performance was positively related to graphite proportions in carriers p 0 05 table 1 it was speculated that the more graphite in the carriers could provide more conductive conduits on carrier s surface of which geobacter cells and electrotrophic methanogens cells could exchange electron via diet accordingly park et al 2018 when hrt was reduced from 24 h to 18 h and 12 h stage 2 and stage 3 olr increased from 5 9 kg cod m3 d to 7 8 kg cod m3 d and 11 7 kg cod m3 d respectively to further evaluate the organic pollutants removal capacity of the an iffas systems in these two stages stable cod degradation performance was observed in five reactors nevertheless similar to those phenomena in stage 1 the cod removal efficiencies of the experimental group reactors r3 r4 and r5 were greater than that of control reactors r1 and r2 table 1 from day 66 to day 85 the influent olr increased to 16 8 kg cod m3 d stage 4 to further evaluate the ability to tolerate organic loadings in five reactors the cod removal efficiency significantly reduced in the r1 however an iffas reactors r2 r5 still trended to be stable after a short time of fluctuation it was demonstrated that an iffas could gain significant treatment capacity in comparison with anaerobic flocs system when treating high olr organic pollutants due to the presence of both flocs and biofilms especially over 89 average cod removal rate was achieved in graphite modified carrier reactors table 1 which was greater than that of r2 86 3 filled with hdpe carriers p 0 05 the similar phenomenon was observed at stage 5 when influent olr increased to 23 7 kg cod m3 d and the greatest cod removal efficiency was always achieved in r5 with 7 wt graphite modified carriers these results indicated that reactors filled with graphite modified carriers had strong ability to tolerate olr impacts which was supported by the reports that the syntrophic conversion of organic matters to methane could be accelerated by the adding of cm even under the high olr condition dang et al 2016 lei et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 hence it could be inferred that the relatively better performance of cod removal in r3 r4 and r5 resulted from the distribution of conductive graphite in carriers that could potentially accelerate syntrophic metabolism by establishing diet as the influent olr increased from 5 9 kg cod m3 d to 23 7 kg cod m3 d stage 1 stage 5 the production rate of methane in five reactors was gradually increasing fig 2b during the stable phase of stage 1 day 30 to day 39 the production rate of methane in r3 r4 r5 filled with graphite modified carriers was about 7 8 9 5 higher than that of r2 with hdpe carriers and about 15 5 17 4 higher than that of r1 without carriers it could be observed that an iffas systems filled with graphite modified carriers exhibited distinct superiority in methane production comparing with those reactors filled with hdpe carriers or without carriers when olr increased to 7 8 kg cod m3 d stage 2 it was exciting to observe that much higher methane production rates were obtained in experimental group reactors r3 r4 r5 with the increment of 14 2 23 3 and 22 3 31 3 comparing with r2 and r1 respectively such better performances in terms of methane production in the reactors filled with graphite modified carriers indicated that more effective interspecies electron transfer might be established to promote syntrophic metabolism when influent olrs increased at stage 3 4 and 5 methane production rate in experimental group reactors r3 r4 r5 still improved significantly p 0 05 which increased about 12 4 26 6 stage 3 6 3 13 8 stage 4 and 11 7 17 8 stage 5 comparing with that of r2 it was worth noting that graphite modified carrier reactors displayed distinct advantages of methane production even under the condition of relatively high olrs in addition although slight increase of cod removal efficiencies was observed in r3 r4 and r5 at stage 3 4 and 5 table 1 these three experimental group reactors still showed strong methane production capacity it indicated that the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane via diet probably occurred moreover r5 filled with 7 wt graphite modified carriers always presented the best methane production performances among all the five reactors through the whole operation period these results demonstrated that graphite modified carrier could promote the production of methane by potentially establishing diet and carriers with more proportion of graphite showed greater methane production capacity previous reports proved that biomass was an essential factor affecting methane production in ad systems maslon and tomaszek 2015 therefore the biomass of anaerobic flocs and biofilms was measured and shown in table 2 apparently neither tss nor vss showed significant difference among graphite modified carrier filled reactors and hdpe carrier filled reactor therefore it was regarded that graphite modified carrier could promote methane production by accelerating electron transfer rather than forming more biomass methane yield is another important index to evaluate ad efficiency in this study the yield of methane was calculated and displayed in fig 2c the total methane yield percentage should be over 50 in anaerobic process usually around 70 however the yield of methane is commonly more than 70 owing to the pathway of carbon dioxide reduced to methane via diet in this study reactors filled with graphite modified carriers r3 r4 and r5 revealed higher methane yield than r2 and r1 throughout the operation period and the highest methane yield of 93 3 was achieved in r4 at stage 2 olr of 7 8 kg cod m3 d it indicated that more carbon could be transformed into methane in experimental group reactors filled with graphite modified carriers and potential diet might be established in general r3 r4 and r5 filled with graphite modified carriers performed greater cod removal efficiency and energy production comparing with hdpe carrier filled reactor and without carrier filled reactor comparing with hdpe carriers the electro conductivities of these graphite modified biofilm carriers increased and pollutant removal and methane production performance were positively correlated with their electro conductivities this result also meant that the more graphite powders dispersed on the carriers could provide more conductive conduits for the establishment of diet therefore it is feasible to improve the performance of anaerobic digestion by appropriately increasing the proportion of graphite in carriers moreover auxiliary materials and functional materials selected for carrier modification were cheaper than hdpe granules and blended in small proportions therefore the cost of graphite modified carriers was comparable to or even more economic than that of hdpe carriers and the blended diatomite could increase the tensile strength of carriers as reported in our previous study mao 2018 therefore we believed this type of novel carriers could be used for even a longer period without excessive costs 3 2 performances of vfas removal vfas such as ethanol acetate propionate and butyrate are important intermediate products during ad process they are likely to lower the ph and inhibit the process of methane production when they accumulate in the reactor therefore enhancing the treatment of vfas seems particularly important to maintain stable methane production in this study effluent ethanol acetate and propionate were measured and the results were shown in fig 3 effluent ethanol was around 92 44 mg cod l and presented little difference among the five reactors data not shown it was probably attributing to the fact that ethanol was preferably to be transformed to acetate by fermentation bacteria and utilized by methanogens subsequently lin et al 2018 on the contrary there were significant differences p 0 05 in propionate and acetate removal rates among the reactors the effluent concentration of acetate and propionate in graphite modified carrier filled reactors r3 r4 and r5 was lower than that of r2 and r1 during the operation to be specific propionate and acetate removal rates increased by 4 1 24 6 and 2 0 9 4 p 0 05 respectively in graphite modified carrier filled reactors comparing with the hdpe carrier filled reactor throughout the operation moreover the difference of acetate and propionate removal rates among the three graphite modified carrier filled reactors showed the tendency that the more proportion of graphite in carriers the better vfas removal rates were achieved it is well known that ethanol or propionate can be metabolized by fermentation bacteria and transformed to acetate further utilized by methanogens the lower effluent acetate and propionate detected in r3 r4 and r5 suggested that the progress of methanogenesis was enhanced owing to the filling of graphite modified carriers 3 3 scanning electron micrograph analysis the sem photographs of microbial morphology in five floc samples and four biofilm samples were shown in fig 4 it indicated that cells with different morphology rod filamentous and globular shapes were identified in these samples the biomass density was great and the majority of microorganism was filamentous closely related to methanothrix besides the rod shaped cells with flagella closely related to geobacter existed and were connected with methanogens it also revealed that relatively higher abundance of rod shaped cells with flagella was observed in graphite modified carrier reactors both on biofilm and in floc which could be inferred that graphite modified carriers enriched more geobacter than hdpe carriers and proceeded the diet with methanogens accordingly 3 4 microbial community analysis after 103 days operation the microbial community structures of floc r1 r5 and biofilm r2 r5 samples from five reactors were analyzed via high throughput 16s rrna pyrosequencing 225 bacterial genera and 16 archaeal genera were detected and the results were shown in fig 5 as fig 5a showed that geobacter confirmed as the typical species participating in diet process morita et al 2011 rotaru et al 2014 was detected in the five reactors both in flocs and on biofilms which could be attributed to the fact that ethanol stimulated the methanogenic communities for establishing diet based syntrophic metabolism zhao and zhang 2019 however about 7 abundance of geobacter was observed in biofilm sample of r5 which was higher than that of r4 biofilm 4 4 r3 biofilm 2 4 and r2 biofilm 2 8 in particular 7 wt graphite modified carriers enriched about 1 5 fold abundance of geobacter compared with that of hdpe carriers furthermore the total abundance of geobacter both flocs and biofilms in graphite modified carrier filled reactors was 18 9 in r5 18 8 in r4 and 11 9 in r3 respectively which was higher than that of r2 10 8 and r1 8 9 this result suggested that graphite modified carriers supplemented to the reactors could significant increase the abundance of geobacter syntrophobacter and smithella species known to metabolize propionate to acetate and carbon dioxide with the production of h2 de bok et al 2004 were more abundant in graphite modified carrier reactors compared with r1 and r2 the sufficient species were beneficial for propionate metabolism which was in accordance with the results of fig 3b that relatively low effluent propionate was observed in r3 r4 and r5 however neither syntrophobacter nor smithella have been reported to be capable of extracellular electron transfer hatamoto et al 2007 sousa et al 2007 and thus are unlikely to participate in diet their increases suggested even on the surface of electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers the enrichment conditions employed to enrich propionate metabolism via diet did not exclude the metabolism via iht in addition the experimental group reactors r4 and r5 not only enriched more geobacter species but also enriched more electrotrophic methanogens methanothrix species also known as methanosaeta wang et al 2019 capable of receiving the electron from gecbacter and forming diet was the most dominant genus of methanogenic archaea in flocs and biofilms fig 5b this type of acetoclastic methanogenic archaea accounted for 79 2 and 78 1 in r5 and r4 respectively which were greater than that of r2 71 9 and r1 72 4 the increased abundance of methanothrix species in r4 and r5 might be ascribed to the fact that graphite modified carriers were capable of enriching more geobacter which accelerated the decomposition of organic matters to acetate and stimulated the enrichment of this acetoclastic methanogens subsequently however it was worth mentioning that the better cod removal performance and methane production capacity were achieved in r3 though there was no significant difference in the abundance of methanothrix between r3 70 4 and r2 71 9 it was speculated that the better performance of r3 was probably ascribed to the enriched geobacter in the system which accelerated the conversion of organics to methane as documented in previous finding yang et al 2017 and the little difference of this methanogens was attributed to the possibility that the low amount of graphite 3 wt dispersed in carriers was not sufficient to enrich methanothrix methanosarcina another methanogens proved as electron accepting partner via diet rotaru et al 2014 was also detected in five reactors and revealed little difference among the samples apparently electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers showed better advantageous to enrich geobacter and methanothrix than hdpe carriers it is well known that the initial attachment is regarded as the key step for biofilm formation zhao et al 2015 reported that conductive carbon materials could promote interspecies electrical connections which might save substantial cellular energy and promote the initial adaptation of microorganism to interact via diet it indicated that the conductive graphite powders dispersed on the surface of carriers can alleviate the energy consumed by microbes for the formation of interspecies electrical connections therefore when more graphite powders blended with hdpe more conductive conduits could be supplied for electron exchanging between geobacter and methanothrix which could accelerate the initial adaptation and facilitate more geobacter and methanothrix attaching to the carriers besides methanobacterium species the well known hydrogen utilizing methanogens jin et al 2019 were detected with low abundance of 10 5 12 5 in three experimental group reactors in comparison the relative abundance of methanobacterium was 25 6 in r1 and 16 0 in r2 this significant difference in hydrogen utilizing comminutes indicated that interspecies hydrogen transfer might play a subordinate role while diet took place as a predominant metabolic pathway owing to the addition of electron mediator biofilm carriers in experimental group reactors 4 conclusions a kind of novel electron mediator suspended biofilm carriers was successfully prepared by blending hdpe with conductive graphite powders results proved that graphite modified carriers enriched more abundance of geobacter and methanothrix both in flocs and biofilms which could potentially proceed diet and enhance the treatment of acetate propionate and show a high methane production rate accordingly this study provides a new strategy and technology

18021,nanofiltration nf is extensively applied after coagulation which is conducive to alleviate organic fouling on nf membranes and improve water purification performance however inorganic fouling which remains the major obstacle to limit the wider application of nf could be enhanced by even low dosage coagulant few researchers realize the existence of coagulant enhanced scaling much less control it this study investigated the effects of ph values on ferric coagulant influenced membrane performance during the nanofiltration of brackish water both membrane flux behavior initial membrane flux normalized flux during filtration scaling resistance and scaling composition and ion interception filtrate conductivity and ions removal were considered solution properties zeta potential and nanoparticle size were measured and coagulant speciation variation was stimulated by visual minteq software mechanisms of ferric coagulant influenced membrane performance were analyzed from two aspects on the basis of correlation analyses interface interaction on membrane surface and salts crystallization process bulk crystallization and surface crystallization results showed that both bulk crystallization in feed solution and surface crystallization on membrane surface were dramatically induced by coagulant coagulant enhanced fouling layer resistance decreased after the initial increase when ph varied from 3 0 to 10 0 fe oh 3 a kind of active ingredients in ferric coagulant was highly responsible for the enhanced scaling layer resistance coagulant was found improving ionic removal under acidic conditions despite the fact that it could worsen removal under alkaline conditions this study is of valuable reference to figure out the mechanisms of coagulant influenced membrane performance and find a feasible approach to avoid membrane deterioration in coagulant influenced nf process graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanofiltration coagulant gypsum scaling ion interception ph value interface interaction 1 introduction membrane fouling remains to be the major obstacle to limit the wider application of nanofiltration nf in water treatment since it can lead to an increased production cost for extra energy demand frequent chemical cleaning and additional replacement of membranes wang et al 2017 based on the nature of different foulants deposited to the membrane surface nf membrane fouling may be classified as organic fouling inorganic fouling and biofouling al amoudi 2010 even though these fouling have a similar negative influence on the membrane performance inorganic fouling appears to be more common in nanofiltration due to its wider applications on brackish water purification and seawater desalination in some water shortage regions matin et al 2019 rathinam et al 2018 park et al 2018 inorganic fouling usually crystallizes in feed solution bulk crystallization or on membrane surface surface crystallization where the ionic concentration increases and exceeds the solubility limit of slightly soluble salts because of their efficient retention by the nf membranes wang et al 2016a as a hard precipitate of inorganic fouling scaling is usually referred as the formation of deposits of inverse solubility salts such as calcium carbonate calcium sulfate and calcium phosphate in practical production gypsum scaling is considered as the most common inorganic fouling on the membranes le gouellec and elimelech 2002 therefore development of gypsum scaling layers on the membranes should be strictly controlled during nf in advanced treatment for drinking water coagulation is usually applied before nf to provide higher quality of water and alleviate membrane fouling kohler et al 2016 racar et al 2017 during coagulation a broad range of dissolved organic substances are effectively removed by coagulant hydrolysis products through electrostatic neutralization and destabilization pivokonsky et al 2012 however some soluble coagulating agents remain residual in feed solution after coagulation and are introduced in nf process unexpectedly despite the recognition of inevitable coagulant accumulation on membrane surface during long term filtration ding et al 2017 few researchers realize the possible influence of coagulant on nf membrane performance much less to control it steric hindrance resulted from nanoscale pore size and electrostatic repulsion resulted from charge nature of nf membranes in feed solution ionization of carboxyl groups on membrane surface are simultaneously responsible for the rejection mechanisms in nf process lin 2017 considering the hydrolysis of coagulating cations electrostatic repulsion on nf membrane surface may be also influenced by coagulant but needs more identifications on the other hand some researchers have also realized the possibility of coagulant influenced crystallization bystriansy et al demonstrated that the behavior of supersaturated calcium sulfate solution may be affected by ferric ions such as the reduction of crystallization induction time and acceleration of crystallization process even at low iron concentration bystriansy et al 2016 it was also proved that both ferric ions and aluminum ions also show dramatic influence on morphologies of calcium sulfate crystallization yang et al 2018 however there is still a lack of knowledge on the role of coagulant on gypsum scaling and ionic interception in nf process hence it is important to gain a thorough understanding on mechanisms of coagulant influenced membrane performance in nf process variation of ph values has been identified to affect the performance of water treatment processes including coagulation nanofiltration and even crystallization sun et al 2015 nilsson et al 2008 xu et al 2019 therefore evaluating the effects of convenient ph adjustment on the coagulant influenced membrane performance is of much importance to find an operational strategy to alleviate gypsum scaling and improve ions interception efficiency in nf process to the best of our knowledge there have been few published papers to study this effort in real coagulation process feed solution is a complex system including natural organic macromolecules noms inorganic salts coagulants and other pollutants it was difficult to investigate the mechanisms of gypsum scaling enhanced by individual pollutants or their combination in nf process thoroughly if we did not distinguish coagulants from noms therefore investigating the effects of individual coagulant on enhanced gypsum scaling in nf process in present study is also of valuable reference for a thorough understanding on the mechanisms of coagulant influenced nf membrane performance the combined effects of coagulant and other pollutants on gypsum scaling in nf process is out of present study s scope but needs further investigation in following research the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ph on coagulant influenced membrane performance during the nanofiltration of brackish water the membrane performances with or without coagulant in feed solution were compared both membrane fouling initial membrane flux normalized flux during filtration scaling composition and resistance distribution and ion interception ionic removal and filtrate conductivity were considered correlation analyses was applied to figure out the mechanisms of coagulant influenced membrane performance fig 1 shows the main schematics of the present study the results could contribute to the further understanding of mechanisms about coagulant influenced gypsum scaling and ionic interception in nf and provide valuable reference on how to avoid membrane deterioration by coagulant in practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and procedures the filtration experiments were performed in a cross flow system equipped with a metering pump type p bran luebbe german that maintained stable water pressure in the circulation system nanofiltration membranes were placed inside the membrane module cf042d sterlitech usa with an effective area of 42 cm2 the thermostatic water container dc 0510 scientz china was used to maintain the water temperature at 25 c during the circulation the filtrate was collected by a conical flask and weighted by an electronic balance hzy b2200 usa hz huazhi while the weights were recorded by an online computer every minute the bench scale filtration experiments consisted of three consecutive steps namely membrane compaction equilibrium and scaling the selected membranes were compacted with deionized water at 0 8 mpa for 1 h then compacted membranes were conditioned with the baseline solution until steady flux was attained as the initial membrane flux for calculating normalized flux and resistance the baseline solution had the same ph values ionic strength and coagulant concentration with scaling solution after membrane equilibrium baseline solution was replaced with the simulated brackish water for the gypsum scaling the scaling experiments continued until the weight of filtrate reached 200 g working pressure was kept at 0 8 mpa and flow velocity was maintained at 0 5 l min both parameters were kept constant throughout the experiment unless otherwise stated ferric chloride fecl3 was applied as typical coagulant in conventional coagulation process in present study it was added in feed solution directly with the dosage of 0 01 mm to simulate the actual effluent form coagulation sedimentation tank and make sure the reliability of coagulant involved feed solution for further investigation feed solution full of calcium and sulfate ions was configurated to simulate the brackish water the detailed compositions of baseline

visual minteq model visual minteq model version 3 1 focuses on the calculation of ions speciation concentration and solubility in aqueous solution liu et al 2011 in the present study it was used to stimulate the speciation distribution of coagulant ferric ions and other ions in the simulated brackish water at different ph values default equilibrium constants of the compounds and precipitates in the software database was applied before performing the stimulation input data of calcium chloride solution 35 mm sodium sulfate solution 20 mm and ferric chloride solution 0 01 mm only in the coagulant involved solution were added in the software 2 2 5 correlation analyses determined by the coefficient of determination 0 r2 1 and regression coefficient correlation analyses were conducted to identify the main mechanism of coagulant influenced gypsum scaling and ion interception efficiency in nf at different ph values using unary linear regression in ibm statistical product and service solutions software version 26 0 both concentration polarization and coagulant speciation were taken into consideration in the correlation analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of feed solution zeta potential of the feed solution at different ph values was tested to characterize the solution properties as summarized in fig 2 zeta potential of the feed solution exhibited electronegativity whether coagulant was added or not compared to coagulant free groups the feed solution was more positively charged with coagulant the most significant differences of zeta potential between these two groups were observed at the ph of 6 5 iron iii chloride hexahydrate was employed as a coagulant and ferric ion fe3 were abundant in the coagulant contaminated solution difference in zeta potential might have resulted from a combination between negatively charged hydroxide ions and multivalent cations ferric ions in the feed solution as illustrated in fig 3 the measurement of particle size distribution was used to acquire further understanding on the properties of different feed solutions the particle size increased with increasing ph values especially in coagulant contaminated groups where the particle size was mainly spread in an area between 400 and 2000 nm meanwhile coagulant exhibited significant role in enlarging the particle size at ph 5 0 particle size of the coagulant contaminated solution focused on an area from 459 to 712 nm which was much bigger than coagulant free groups from 59 to 69 nm the greatest particle size of 1999 nm was observed in coagulant contaminated solution at the ph of 10 0 while particles with a size of only 220 nm were formed in coagulant free solution however comparable particle size distribution of these two different solutions at ph 3 0 indicated the coagulant exerted little influence on the size distribution at low ph value it can be inferred that both alkalization and coagulant are favorable to increase particle size of the supersaturated salts solutions the probable reason for this could be the formation of bulk crystallization 3 2 speciation distribution of coagulant the coagulant speciation distribution at different ph values were simulated by visual minteq software as shown in fig 4 coagulant speciation varied significantly under different ph conditions at a ph of 3 0 feso4 became the main existing form of fe element 6 41 μm while only 10 μm coagulant was added in feed solution previously however most ferric ions were dramatically transformed to fe oh 2 when the ph value was increased to 8 0 in addition the generation of fe oh 3 aq may not be neglected with continuous alkalization though they remained a small part of the total coagulant considering the coagulant speciation distribution as the ph increased ferric ions were found easily combining with hydroxide ions oh in the feed solution these simulation results were also consistent with the variation of fe hydrolysis products under different ph conditions in previous study sun et al 2015 speciation distribution of all the ions at different ph is presented in figure s1 though variation of ph values showed significant influence on speciation distribution of ferric coagulant there existed little difference for speciation distribution of other ions whether ferric coagulant was added or not it appears that neither by the addition of coagulant nor changing the ph values change of ionic speciation distribution would occur except the ferric ions 3 3 effect of ph on coagulant influenced flux behavior in nanofiltration 3 3 1 initial membrane flux the impact of ph values on initial membrane flux was investigated for coagulant free contaminated solutions as presented in fig 5 the initial membrane flux increased after the initial decrease when the feed solution was continuously alkalized from ph 3 0 the turning points of membrane flux variation were observed at the ph of 5 0 when the ph values increased from 5 0 to 10 0 the initial membrane flux was drastically increased from 8 4 10 6 to 19 7 10 6 m s for a coagulant contaminated solution while weaker improvement of membrane permeability to water was achieved in coagulant free solution from 8 8 10 6 to 17 9 10 6 m s ferric coagulant could increase the membrane flux remarkably after strong alkalization even though it had a slight negative effect on the initial membrane flux under acidic conditions ph 3 0 and 5 0 the ratio of initial flux for coagulant contaminated solution to flux for coagulant free solution increased to 1 29 at a ph of 8 0 while the ratios of 1 13 and 1 10 were achieved at ph 6 5 and 10 0 respectively it is well known that the charge of nf membranes varied from different ph values in solution and there exhibits less electropositivity more electronegativity with alkalization wadekar and vidic 2018 mehdipour et al 2015 the increased electrostatic repulsion under stronger acidic alkaline conditions could enlarge the membrane pore size and thus enhance membrane permeability to water in addition when the feed solution is adjusted to certain ph value there exhibits an isoelectric point iep at which membrane surface charge could disappear therefore pore size could be effectively compressed by water pressure with a decrease of membrane flux kilduff et al 2004 it was also reported that nf270 membranes comprise amphoteric surfaces with an isoelectric point of about ph 5 zhou et al 2014 variation of electrostatic charges on the membranes actually results from the neutralization reaction between hydroxyl ions oh in water and carboxyl groups cooh on the membranes for coagulant contaminated solution ferric ions could easily adhere to the membrane surface during filtration and then combined with the extra hydroxyl ions due to electrostatic interactions these processes could remarkably accelerate the neutralization reaction between hydroxyl ions in the feed solution and carboxylic groups on membrane surface therefore electropositivity of the membranes was weakened with the coagulant at low ph while the membrane pore size was compressed resulting in flux decline on the other hand electronegativity on the membrane surface could be further enhanced with the coagulant at higher ph the increased electronegativity was favorable for enlarging the pore size of nf membranes resulting in a weaker steric hindrance and greater membrane permeability to water concentration polarization widely existed on membrane filtration processes which could induce serious membrane fouling thus decreasing the ion interception efficiency in nf process chaudhuri and jogdand 2017 vogel et al 2010 therefore concentration polarization modulus cpm and saturation index si were calculated in this study table 2 it was obvious that cpm and initial membrane flux showed similar tendencies because cpm is positively associated with the membrane flux according to eq 6 it is to be noted that saturation index of gypsum was calculated because gypsum was found to dominate the scaling effect the highest values of cpm 7 07 and si 5 21 were achieved with coagulant at the ph of 10 0 3 3 2 normalized flux during filtration the normalized flux during filtration was taken into consideration to evaluate the effects of ph on the coagulant influenced membrane performance as shown in fig 6 simulated brackish water could cause significant flux decline except at ph 3 0 when the flux curves still remained horizontal during the filtration step as seen in fig 6 b d it is remarkable to notice that the normalized flux did not decrease below 1 0 at the beginning of filtration until certain volume of solution penetrate through membranes which we defined as extra volume in present study compared to coagulant free groups less extra volume was required in coagulant contaminated groups regardless of ph values meanwhile the necessary extra volume decreased from 95 7 to 24 2 ml for coagulant contaminated solution from 117 9 to 63 3 ml for coagulant free solution when the ph values varied from 5 0 to 8 0 under the strongest alkaline conditions ph 10 0 of present study membrane was severely fouled and normalized flux was less than 1 0 from the very start of filtration it may be inferred that both alkalization and coagulant could aggravate a short term flux decline when nf membranes were applied for the filtration of brackish water and they had a synergistic effect on it to gain a better understanding on long term membrane performance the detection of terminal normalized flux was carried out and two curves with u shape were observed when the feed solution varied from acidic to alkaline condition fig 7 compared to coagulant free groups a severer flux decline was observed in coagulant contaminated groups under the same ph conditions the smallest terminal normalized flux for the coagulant free solution 0 42 and coagulant contaminated solution 0 08 were simultaneously achieved at a ph value of 8 0 unexpectedly increasing the ph value to 10 0 failed to further decrease the flux regardless of the presence of coagulant the difference in the normalized flux between coagulant free groups and coagulant contaminated groups could be considered as the part of long term flux decline induced by coagulant though little differences of terminal normalized flux generated at ph 3 0 and 5 0 it suddenly increased to 0 33 at ph 6 5 and then decreased to 0 26 when ph was adjusted to 10 0 it can be concluded that alkalization has contributed to aggravate the coagulant enhanced flux decline after the long term filtration 3 3 3 scaling composition the scaling composition on membrane surface was measured to investigate the mechanism of coagulant influenced membrane fouling as well as to evaluate the effects of ph as illustrated in fig 8 a the amount of scaling was found to decrease after the initial increase with sustained alkalization in addition the histogram indicated that the coagulant could effectively enhance the scaling for both calcium and sulfate especially when the ph was adjusted into the weak acidic range ph 5 0 however both gypsum scaling and coagulant could hardly form on membranes under strong acidic condition ph 3 0 fig 8 b indicated that alkalization allowed coagulant to adhere to nf membranes more easily in order to have a further study on specific composition of scaling the molar ratio of calcium to sulfate in scaling layer was calculated this ratio was found to fluctuate around 1 0 under different conditions table 3 the results demonstrate that calcium scaling always appeared in coordinating with sulfate scaling due to the formation of gypsum caso4 scaling during filtration 3 3 4 resistance distribution as illustrated in fig 9 coagulant contaminated solutions caused severer fouling layer resistance rf than the coagulant free solutions at all the ph conditions besides fouling layer resistance induced by coagulant contaminated solution decreased after an initial increase with continuous alkalization the greatest resistance generated at a ph value of 8 0 which was approximately 5 times as the fouling layer resistance without the presence of coagulant on the contrary fouling layer resistance hardly changed in coagulant free groups when the ph values varied from 5 0 to 8 0 however both excessive acidification and alkalization made it difficult to develop fouling layer resistance in nanofiltration the correlation between fouling layer resistance difference δrf rf coagulant contaminated rf coagulant free and coagulant concentration on membrane surface was estimated in table 4 even though the fouling layer resistance difference seemed to be slightly positively associated with the coagulant ferric ions concentration on the membranes r2 0 28 further analysis may be needed to clarify specific mechanisms of enhanced gypsum scaling by the coagulant therefore a regression analyses between different speciation of coagulant and fouling layer resistance difference were conducted the coefficients of determination r2 and slopes were calculated and presented in fig 10 among all the speciation of coagulant fe oh 3 aq showed the most reliable correlations with fouling layer resistance difference r2 0 68 while the most effective coagulant which could enhance fouling layer resistance was also proved to be fe oh 3 aq slope 8 51 10 14 the results indicated that fe oh 3 aq was highly responsible for enhanced fouling layer resistance in nf according to previous studies two key procedures are required for crystallization including nucleation and crystal growth al amoudi 2010 without sufficient nuclei gypsum scaling could still hardly crystallize onto nf membrane surface during filtration of supersaturated salts solution lin et al 2019 it is observed that even alkalization failed to enhance gypsum scaling and fouling layer resistance evidently in coagulant free groups it was further inferred that there was a comparable effect of fe oh 3 aq and other particles which were proved to act as nuclei to promote crystallization and induce severe flux decline wang et al 2016b unary linear regression equations between scaling composition and fouling layer resistance were also established using our experiment data as illustrated in table 5 fouling layer resistance exhibited a strong correlation with calcium r2 0 79 and sulfate r2 0 81 concentration on the membranes in coagulant free groups however there was no correlation between calcium sulfate concentration and the fouling layer resistance in coagulant contaminated groups the probable reason could be that the morphologies of scaling layer were also affected by the presence of coagulant in our previous study coagulant was proved to induce loose and porous gypsum scaling layer on nf membranes lin et al 2019 after analyzing the data of figs 8 and 9 it can be seen that gypsum scaling enhanced by coagulant failed to induce the corresponding flux decline at the ph of 5 0 the crystallization mechanisms consist of bulk crystallization and surface crystallization bulk crystallization generated in solutions homogeneously followed by the crystal deposition onto membrane surface while the surface crystallization is induced directly onto membrane surface as the heterogeneous scaling both of these are responsible for scaling on nf membranes lee et al 1999 but these processes always coexist with a competition which could be influenced by the solution chemistry and process parameters her et al 2000 dydo et al 2004 according to our experimental results the coagulant could enhance not only the surface crystallization fig 8 but also the bulk crystallization fig 3 compared to bulk crystallization surface crystallization could induce severer flux decline in nf due to the formation of a denser scaling layer and in situ blockage of the membranes especially at a low crossflow velocity and a high operating pressure lee and lee 2000 the competition between different crystallization mechanisms further weakens the flux decline caused by surface crystallization therefore the unexpected flux behavior at ph 5 0 could result from the greater deposition of loose and porous scaling from coagulant enhanced bulk crystallization near isoelectric point at which the electrostatic repulsion between scaling layer and membranes vanished with excessive alkalization to ph 10 0 both the amount of scaling on membranes and fouling layer resistance decreased unexpectedly whether coagulant was added or not in feed solution according to the variation of nanoparticle size mentioned in section 3 1 these behaviors could be attributed to the enhanced bulk crystallization in feed solution by excessive alkalization and soluble coagulant then electrostatic repulsion prevented negative bulk crystallization from depositing on negatively charged membrane surface the mechanisms of coagulant influenced gypsum scaling under different ph conditions were further presented in fig 11 it was noteworthy that the influences of concentration polarization and initial membrane flux were also taken into consideration to clarify the mechanism of coagulant enhanced gypsum scaling however the fitting results suggested that fouling layer resistance showed weak correlations with them table s3 these results were different from the phenomenon in previous study where lee et al found that concentration polarization should be responsible for gypsum scaling in nanofiltration lee and lee 2000 the probable explanation could be that in this experiment the concentration of caso4 near the membranes was far supersaturated under different experimental conditions and therefore was not any restriction on gypsum scaling and flux decline it was implied concentration polarization was not the main factor which could influence fouling layer resistance in the present study 3 4 effect of ph on coagulant influenced ion interception efficiency in nanofiltration 3 4 1 filtrate conductivity to evaluate the ion interception efficiency of nf membranes with without coagulant the conductivity of filtrate was measured both ph values and coagulant exerted a remarkably influence on conductivity of filtrate as illustrated in fig 12 the conductivity of filtrate increased with increasing ph values in addition the introduction of coagulant in feed solution could further deteriorate the filtrate quality especially under alkaline conditions at the ph of 8 0 the conductivity of filtrate in coagulant contaminated groups increased to 2847 87 μs cm which was 216 49 μs cm higher than the filtrate conductivity in control groups to investigate the mechanism of coagulant influenced ion interception efficiency in nf correlations between the difference of filtrate conductivity and the difference of concentration polarization modulus initial membrane flux were additionally estimated as summarized in table 6 unary linear regressions were well established by all experiment data and the difference of concentration polarization was found slightly responsible for the change of filtrate conductivity r2 0 35 while there existed a stronger correlation between the filtrate conductivity difference and membrane flux difference r2 0 53 the slope values indicated that there should be a positive association between them besides the evaluation of correlations between filtrate conductivity difference and different speciation of coagulant was also conducted and presented in supplementary section however as illustrated in table s4 the coefficients of determination indicated that the individual speciation of coagulant played a minor role in the deterioration of filtrate quality 3 4 2 ionic removal the removal of different ions was also monitored to gain a further understanding on coagulant influenced ion interception efficiency in nanofiltration as shown in fig 12 stronger acidity made it possible to remove calcium ions more efficiently with decreasing ph values of coagulant contaminated solution from 8 0 to 3 0 the removal of calcium continuously increased from 70 to 98 however though the results were consistent with the variation of sodium and chloride concentration in filtrate table 7 sulfate could be thoroughly removed by nanofiltration membranes all the time table 8 it has been proved that the interception mechanism in nanofiltration consisted of steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion lin 2017 the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged substances and nf membranes vanished under certain acidic conditions membranes became neutral or positively charged but sulfate which exhibited electronegativity in water could still hardly found in the filtrate it was inferred that steric hindrance allowed membranes to reject sulfate ions thoroughly according to previous studies alkalization could effectively enhance the electronegativity of membranes resulting in greater negative electrostatic repulsion and larger pore size kilduff et al 2004 as presented in table 7 the concentration of negatively charged chloride ions in filtrate still increased continuously when the ph values increased from 3 0 to 10 0 it meant that steric hindrance should be responsible for the rejection of not only polyvalent ions but also univalent ions by nanofiltration in present study some researchers argued that it was difficult for nanofiltration membranes to retain ions through steric hindrance epsztein et al 2018 but tanninen et al also found that the separation of ions in nanofiltration depended on their size characteristics due to a high ion concentration that lessened the charge effect of the membranes tanninen and nystrom 2002 compared to coagulant contaminated groups calcium ions were more effectively rejected in coagulant free groups at most of the ph values at the ph of 10 0 nf membranes showed greater efficiency in rejecting calcium ions for coagulant free solution while the removal rate decreased to 52 for coagulant contaminated solution however better performance in removing calcium ions was achieved with coagulant at ph 3 0 similarly more chloride ions penetrated through nf membranes in coagulant contaminated groups except at the ph of 3 0 these behaviors could be well explained by the viewpoint that steric hindrance played a more significant role in the ionic rejection by nf membranes than electrostatic repulsion in present study on the other hand coagulant failed to have an apparent influence on sodium concentration in filtrate the phenomena could be attributed to difference of ions radius according to previous studies the radius for sodium ion chloride ion and sulfate ion were about 0 117 nm 0 181 nm and 0 300 nm respectively though the radius for calcium ion 0 100 nm was the smallest among these ions calcium ion usually exists in hydrated formats in aqueous solution which hydrated radius was 0 260 nm tansel et al 2006 indicating that ions can be rejected by nanofiltration membranes through steric hindrance with the ability of so4 2 ca2 cl na the results of this study imply that coagulant adhered to membranes could weaken electropositivity making membrane compressed to enhance steric hindrance under certain acidic conditions additionally as mentioned in section 3 3 1 coagulant could also enhance electronegativity enlarge membrane pore size weaken steric hindrance and increase membrane flux under certain alkaline conditions therefore reliable correlations between the deterioration of filtrate conductivity and the difference concentration polarization modulus membrane flux could be well established on the data given in table 6 the mechanisms of coagulant influenced interception of ions by nf membranes under different ph conditions were presented in fig 13 4 conclusions this study focused on the influence of ferric coagulant on membrane flux behavior and ion interception efficiency at different ph values during the nanofiltration of brackish water the mechanisms of ferric coagulant influenced nf membrane performance at different ph was further verified on the basis of correlation analysis considering the interface interaction on membrane surface and salts crystallization process bulk crystallization and surface crystallization both bulk crystallization in feed solution and surface crystallization on nf membrane surface were dramatically induced by coagulant however the terminal fouling layer resistance enhanced by coagulant decreased after an initial increase when the ph values increased from 3 0 to 10 0 and the severest membrane fouling was observed in coagulant contaminated groups at the ph of 8 0 the visual minteq simulation results indicated that coagulant speciation varied from different ph values and fe oh 3 a kind of active ingredients in ferric coagulant was highly responsible for enhanced fouling layer resistance according to the correlations analyses neither concentration polarization nor saturation index of gypsum was the main factor in affecting gypsum scaling in nf process in present study the decreased removal of not only cations but also anions by nf membranes with increasing alkalization indicated that steric hindrance played a more important role in ions rejection than electrostatic repulsion in present study coagulant was found worsening ionic removal by nf membranes under alkaline conditions despite the fact that it could enhance the removal under acidic conditions the coagulant adhered to nf membranes accelerated the neutralization reaction between hydroxyl ions in the feed solution and carboxylic groups on membrane surface therefore ferric coagulant could weaken membrane electropositivity make membranes compressed enhance steric hindrance and decrease membrane flux in nf process under certain acidic conditions while it could also enhance membrane electronegativity enlarge membrane pore size weaken steric hindrance and increase membrane permeability to water in certain alkaline cases the present results showed that feed acidification could alleviate coagulant enhanced membrane fouling while it also allowed coagulant to strengthen the ionic rejection during nf treatment of brackish water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18021,nanofiltration nf is extensively applied after coagulation which is conducive to alleviate organic fouling on nf membranes and improve water purification performance however inorganic fouling which remains the major obstacle to limit the wider application of nf could be enhanced by even low dosage coagulant few researchers realize the existence of coagulant enhanced scaling much less control it this study investigated the effects of ph values on ferric coagulant influenced membrane performance during the nanofiltration of brackish water both membrane flux behavior initial membrane flux normalized flux during filtration scaling resistance and scaling composition and ion interception filtrate conductivity and ions removal were considered solution properties zeta potential and nanoparticle size were measured and coagulant speciation variation was stimulated by visual minteq software mechanisms of ferric coagulant influenced membrane performance were analyzed from two aspects on the basis of correlation analyses interface interaction on membrane surface and salts crystallization process bulk crystallization and surface crystallization results showed that both bulk crystallization in feed solution and surface crystallization on membrane surface were dramatically induced by coagulant coagulant enhanced fouling layer resistance decreased after the initial increase when ph varied from 3 0 to 10 0 fe oh 3 a kind of active ingredients in ferric coagulant was highly responsible for the enhanced scaling layer resistance coagulant was found improving ionic removal under acidic conditions despite the fact that it could worsen removal under alkaline conditions this study is of valuable reference to figure out the mechanisms of coagulant influenced membrane performance and find a feasible approach to avoid membrane deterioration in coagulant influenced nf process graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanofiltration coagulant gypsum scaling ion interception ph value interface interaction 1 introduction membrane fouling remains to be the major obstacle to limit the wider application of nanofiltration nf in water treatment since it can lead to an increased production cost for extra energy demand frequent chemical cleaning and additional replacement of membranes wang et al 2017 based on the nature of different foulants deposited to the membrane surface nf membrane fouling may be classified as organic fouling inorganic fouling and biofouling al amoudi 2010 even though these fouling have a similar negative influence on the membrane performance inorganic fouling appears to be more common in nanofiltration due to its wider applications on brackish water purification and seawater desalination in some water shortage regions matin et al 2019 rathinam et al 2018 park et al 2018 inorganic fouling usually crystallizes in feed solution bulk crystallization or on membrane surface surface crystallization where the ionic concentration increases and exceeds the solubility limit of slightly soluble salts because of their efficient retention by the nf membranes wang et al 2016a as a hard precipitate of inorganic fouling scaling is usually referred as the formation of deposits of inverse solubility salts such as calcium carbonate calcium sulfate and calcium phosphate in practical production gypsum scaling is considered as the most common inorganic fouling on the membranes le gouellec and elimelech 2002 therefore development of gypsum scaling layers on the membranes should be strictly controlled during nf in advanced treatment for drinking water coagulation is usually applied before nf to provide higher quality of water and alleviate membrane fouling kohler et al 2016 racar et al 2017 during coagulation a broad range of dissolved organic substances are effectively removed by coagulant hydrolysis products through electrostatic neutralization and destabilization pivokonsky et al 2012 however some soluble coagulating agents remain residual in feed solution after coagulation and are introduced in nf process unexpectedly despite the recognition of inevitable coagulant accumulation on membrane surface during long term filtration ding et al 2017 few researchers realize the possible influence of coagulant on nf membrane performance much less to control it steric hindrance resulted from nanoscale pore size and electrostatic repulsion resulted from charge nature of nf membranes in feed solution ionization of carboxyl groups on membrane surface are simultaneously responsible for the rejection mechanisms in nf process lin 2017 considering the hydrolysis of coagulating cations electrostatic repulsion on nf membrane surface may be also influenced by coagulant but needs more identifications on the other hand some researchers have also realized the possibility of coagulant influenced crystallization bystriansy et al demonstrated that the behavior of supersaturated calcium sulfate solution may be affected by ferric ions such as the reduction of crystallization induction time and acceleration of crystallization process even at low iron concentration bystriansy et al 2016 it was also proved that both ferric ions and aluminum ions also show dramatic influence on morphologies of calcium sulfate crystallization yang et al 2018 however there is still a lack of knowledge on the role of coagulant on gypsum scaling and ionic interception in nf process hence it is important to gain a thorough understanding on mechanisms of coagulant influenced membrane performance in nf process variation of ph values has been identified to affect the performance of water treatment processes including coagulation nanofiltration and even crystallization sun et al 2015 nilsson et al 2008 xu et al 2019 therefore evaluating the effects of convenient ph adjustment on the coagulant influenced membrane performance is of much importance to find an operational strategy to alleviate gypsum scaling and improve ions interception efficiency in nf process to the best of our knowledge there have been few published papers to study this effort in real coagulation process feed solution is a complex system including natural organic macromolecules noms inorganic salts coagulants and other pollutants it was difficult to investigate the mechanisms of gypsum scaling enhanced by individual pollutants or their combination in nf process thoroughly if we did not distinguish coagulants from noms therefore investigating the effects of individual coagulant on enhanced gypsum scaling in nf process in present study is also of valuable reference for a thorough understanding on the mechanisms of coagulant influenced nf membrane performance the combined effects of coagulant and other pollutants on gypsum scaling in nf process is out of present study s scope but needs further investigation in following research the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ph on coagulant influenced membrane performance during the nanofiltration of brackish water the membrane performances with or without coagulant in feed solution were compared both membrane fouling initial membrane flux normalized flux during filtration scaling composition and resistance distribution and ion interception ionic removal and filtrate conductivity were considered correlation analyses was applied to figure out the mechanisms of coagulant influenced membrane performance fig 1 shows the main schematics of the present study the results could contribute to the further understanding of mechanisms about coagulant influenced gypsum scaling and ionic interception in nf and provide valuable reference on how to avoid membrane deterioration by coagulant in practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and procedures the filtration experiments were performed in a cross flow system equipped with a metering pump type p bran luebbe german that maintained stable water pressure in the circulation system nanofiltration membranes were placed inside the membrane module cf042d sterlitech usa with an effective area of 42 cm2 the thermostatic water container dc 0510 scientz china was used to maintain the water temperature at 25 c during the circulation the filtrate was collected by a conical flask and weighted by an electronic balance hzy b2200 usa hz huazhi while the weights were recorded by an online computer every minute the bench scale filtration experiments consisted of three consecutive steps namely membrane compaction equilibrium and scaling the selected membranes were compacted with deionized water at 0 8 mpa for 1 h then compacted membranes were conditioned with the baseline solution until steady flux was attained as the initial membrane flux for calculating normalized flux and resistance the baseline solution had the same ph values ionic strength and coagulant concentration with scaling solution after membrane equilibrium baseline solution was replaced with the simulated brackish water for the gypsum scaling the scaling experiments continued until the weight of filtrate reached 200 g working pressure was kept at 0 8 mpa and flow velocity was maintained at 0 5 l min both parameters were kept constant throughout the experiment unless otherwise stated ferric chloride fecl3 was applied as typical coagulant in conventional coagulation process in present study it was added in feed solution directly with the dosage of 0 01 mm to simulate the actual effluent form coagulation sedimentation tank and make sure the reliability of coagulant involved feed solution for further investigation feed solution full of calcium and sulfate ions was configurated to simulate the brackish water the detailed compositions of baseline solution and scaling solution are given in table 1 before each procedure 4 l solution was freshly prepared ahead of time details of reagents and nf membranes are provided in the supplemental section all experiments were conducted at least in triplicate to reduce errors 2 2 analytical methods and calculations 2 2 1 analytical methods a ph meter pb 10 sartorius german was used for the measurement of ph while preparing the solutions both zeta potential and nanoscale particle size of the feed solutions were measured by a zetasizer nano instruments zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the conductivity of

visual minteq model visual minteq model version 3 1 focuses on the calculation of ions speciation concentration and solubility in aqueous solution liu et al 2011 in the present study it was used to stimulate the speciation distribution of coagulant ferric ions and other ions in the simulated brackish water at different ph values default equilibrium constants of the compounds and precipitates in the software database was applied before performing the stimulation input data of calcium chloride solution 35 mm sodium sulfate solution 20 mm and ferric chloride solution 0 01 mm only in the coagulant involved solution were added in the software 2 2 5 correlation analyses determined by the coefficient of determination 0 r2 1 and regression coefficient correlation analyses were conducted to identify the main mechanism of coagulant influenced gypsum scaling and ion interception efficiency in nf at different ph values using unary linear regression in ibm statistical product and service solutions software version 26 0 both concentration polarization and coagulant speciation were taken into consideration in the correlation analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of feed solution zeta potential of the feed solution at different ph values was tested to characterize the solution properties as summarized in fig 2 zeta potential of the feed solution exhibited electronegativity whether coagulant was added or not compared to coagulant free groups the feed solution was more positively charged with coagulant the most significant differences of zeta potential between these two groups were observed at the ph of 6 5 iron iii chloride hexahydrate was employed as a coagulant and ferric ion fe3 were abundant in the coagulant contaminated solution difference in zeta potential might have resulted from a combination between negatively charged hydroxide ions and multivalent cations ferric ions in the feed solution as illustrated in fig 3 the measurement of particle size distribution was used to acquire further understanding on the properties of different feed solutions the particle size increased with increasing ph values especially in coagulant contaminated groups where the particle size was mainly spread in an area between 400 and 2000 nm meanwhile coagulant exhibited significant role in enlarging the particle size at ph 5 0 particle size of the coagulant contaminated solution focused on an area from 459 to 712 nm which was much bigger than coagulant free groups from 59 to 69 nm the greatest particle size of 1999 nm was observed in coagulant contaminated solution at the ph of 10 0 while particles with a size of only 220 nm were formed in coagulant free solution however comparable particle size distribution of these two different solutions at ph 3 0 indicated the coagulant exerted little influence on the size distribution at low ph value it can be inferred that both alkalization and coagulant are favorable to increase particle size of the supersaturated salts solutions the probable reason for this could be the formation of bulk crystallization 3 2 speciation distribution of coagulant the coagulant speciation distribution at different ph values were simulated by visual minteq software as shown in fig 4 coagulant speciation varied significantly under different ph conditions at a ph of 3 0 feso4 became the main existing form of fe element 6 41 μm while only 10 μm coagulant was added in feed solution previously however most ferric ions were dramatically transformed to fe oh 2 when the ph value was increased to 8 0 in addition the generation of fe oh 3 aq may not be neglected with continuous alkalization though they remained a small part of the total coagulant considering the coagulant speciation distribution as the ph increased ferric ions were found easily combining with hydroxide ions oh in the feed solution these simulation results were also consistent with the variation of fe hydrolysis products under different ph conditions in previous study sun et al 2015 speciation distribution of all the ions at different ph is presented in figure s1 though variation of ph values showed significant influence on speciation distribution of ferric coagulant there existed little difference for speciation distribution of other ions whether ferric coagulant was added or not it appears that neither by the addition of coagulant nor changing the ph values change of ionic speciation distribution would occur except the ferric ions 3 3 effect of ph on coagulant influenced flux behavior in nanofiltration 3 3 1 initial membrane flux the impact of ph values on initial membrane flux was investigated for coagulant free contaminated solutions as presented in fig 5 the initial membrane flux increased after the initial decrease when the feed solution was continuously alkalized from ph 3 0 the turning points of membrane flux variation were observed at the ph of 5 0 when the ph values increased from 5 0 to 10 0 the initial membrane flux was drastically increased from 8 4 10 6 to 19 7 10 6 m s for a coagulant contaminated solution while weaker improvement of membrane permeability to water was achieved in coagulant free solution from 8 8 10 6 to 17 9 10 6 m s ferric coagulant could increase the membrane flux remarkably after strong alkalization even though it had a slight negative effect on the initial membrane flux under acidic conditions ph 3 0 and 5 0 the ratio of initial flux for coagulant contaminated solution to flux for coagulant free solution increased to 1 29 at a ph of 8 0 while the ratios of 1 13 and 1 10 were achieved at ph 6 5 and 10 0 respectively it is well known that the charge of nf membranes varied from different ph values in solution and there exhibits less electropositivity more electronegativity with alkalization wadekar and vidic 2018 mehdipour et al 2015 the increased electrostatic repulsion under stronger acidic alkaline conditions could enlarge the membrane pore size and thus enhance membrane permeability to water in addition when the feed solution is adjusted to certain ph value there exhibits an isoelectric point iep at which membrane surface charge could disappear therefore pore size could be effectively compressed by water pressure with a decrease of membrane flux kilduff et al 2004 it was also reported that nf270 membranes comprise amphoteric surfaces with an isoelectric point of about ph 5 zhou et al 2014 variation of electrostatic charges on the membranes actually results from the neutralization reaction between hydroxyl ions oh in water and carboxyl groups cooh on the membranes for coagulant contaminated solution ferric ions could easily adhere to the membrane surface during filtration and then combined with the extra hydroxyl ions due to electrostatic interactions these processes could remarkably accelerate the neutralization reaction between hydroxyl ions in the feed solution and carboxylic groups on membrane surface therefore electropositivity of the membranes was weakened with the coagulant at low ph while the membrane pore size was compressed resulting in flux decline on the other hand electronegativity on the membrane surface could be further enhanced with the coagulant at higher ph the increased electronegativity was favorable for enlarging the pore size of nf membranes resulting in a weaker steric hindrance and greater membrane permeability to water concentration polarization widely existed on membrane filtration processes which could induce serious membrane fouling thus decreasing the ion interception efficiency in nf process chaudhuri and jogdand 2017 vogel et al 2010 therefore concentration polarization modulus cpm and saturation index si were calculated in this study table 2 it was obvious that cpm and initial membrane flux showed similar tendencies because cpm is positively associated with the membrane flux according to eq 6 it is to be noted that saturation index of gypsum was calculated because gypsum was found to dominate the scaling effect the highest values of cpm 7 07 and si 5 21 were achieved with coagulant at the ph of 10 0 3 3 2 normalized flux during filtration the normalized flux during filtration was taken into consideration to evaluate the effects of ph on the coagulant influenced membrane performance as shown in fig 6 simulated brackish water could cause significant flux decline except at ph 3 0 when the flux curves still remained horizontal during the filtration step as seen in fig 6 b d it is remarkable to notice that the normalized flux did not decrease below 1 0 at the beginning of filtration until certain volume of solution penetrate through membranes which we defined as extra volume in present study compared to coagulant free groups less extra volume was required in coagulant contaminated groups regardless of ph values meanwhile the necessary extra volume decreased from 95 7 to 24 2 ml for coagulant contaminated solution from 117 9 to 63 3 ml for coagulant free solution when the ph values varied from 5 0 to 8 0 under the strongest alkaline conditions ph 10 0 of present study membrane was severely fouled and normalized flux was less than 1 0 from the very start of filtration it may be inferred that both alkalization and coagulant could aggravate a short term flux decline when nf membranes were applied for the filtration of brackish water and they had a synergistic effect on it to gain a better understanding on long term membrane performance the detection of terminal normalized flux was carried out and two curves with u shape were observed when the feed solution varied from acidic to alkaline condition fig 7 compared to coagulant free groups a severer flux decline was observed in coagulant contaminated groups under the same ph conditions the smallest terminal normalized flux for the coagulant free solution 0 42 and coagulant contaminated solution 0 08 were simultaneously achieved at a ph value of 8 0 unexpectedly increasing the ph value to 10 0 failed to further decrease the flux regardless of the presence of coagulant the difference in the normalized flux between coagulant free groups and coagulant contaminated groups could be considered as the part of long term flux decline induced by coagulant though little differences of terminal normalized flux generated at ph 3 0 and 5 0 it suddenly increased to 0 33 at ph 6 5 and then decreased to 0 26 when ph was adjusted to 10 0 it can be concluded that alkalization has contributed to aggravate the coagulant enhanced flux decline after the long term filtration 3 3 3 scaling composition the scaling composition on membrane surface was measured to investigate the mechanism of coagulant influenced membrane fouling as well as to evaluate the effects of ph as illustrated in fig 8 a the amount of scaling was found to decrease after the initial increase with sustained alkalization in addition the histogram indicated that the coagulant could effectively enhance the scaling for both calcium and sulfate especially when the ph was adjusted into the weak acidic range ph 5 0 however both gypsum scaling and coagulant could hardly form on membranes under strong acidic condition ph 3 0 fig 8 b indicated that alkalization allowed coagulant to adhere to nf membranes more easily in order to have a further study on specific composition of scaling the molar ratio of calcium to sulfate in scaling layer was calculated this ratio was found to fluctuate around 1 0 under different conditions table 3 the results demonstrate that calcium scaling always appeared in coordinating with sulfate scaling due to the formation of gypsum caso4 scaling during filtration 3 3 4 resistance distribution as illustrated in fig 9 coagulant contaminated solutions caused severer fouling layer resistance rf than the coagulant free solutions at all the ph conditions besides fouling layer resistance induced by coagulant contaminated solution decreased after an initial increase with continuous alkalization the greatest resistance generated at a ph value of 8 0 which was approximately 5 times as the fouling layer resistance without the presence of coagulant on the contrary fouling layer resistance hardly changed in coagulant free groups when the ph values varied from 5 0 to 8 0 however both excessive acidification and alkalization made it difficult to develop fouling layer resistance in nanofiltration the correlation between fouling layer resistance difference δrf rf coagulant contaminated rf coagulant free and coagulant concentration on membrane surface was estimated in table 4 even though the fouling layer resistance difference seemed to be slightly positively associated with the coagulant ferric ions concentration on the membranes r2 0 28 further analysis may be needed to clarify specific mechanisms of enhanced gypsum scaling by the coagulant therefore a regression analyses between different speciation of coagulant and fouling layer resistance difference were conducted the coefficients of determination r2 and slopes were calculated and presented in fig 10 among all the speciation of coagulant fe oh 3 aq showed the most reliable correlations with fouling layer resistance difference r2 0 68 while the most effective coagulant which could enhance fouling layer resistance was also proved to be fe oh 3 aq slope 8 51 10 14 the results indicated that fe oh 3 aq was highly responsible for enhanced fouling layer resistance in nf according to previous studies two key procedures are required for crystallization including nucleation and crystal growth al amoudi 2010 without sufficient nuclei gypsum scaling could still hardly crystallize onto nf membrane surface during filtration of supersaturated salts solution lin et al 2019 it is observed that even alkalization failed to enhance gypsum scaling and fouling layer resistance evidently in coagulant free groups it was further inferred that there was a comparable effect of fe oh 3 aq and other particles which were proved to act as nuclei to promote crystallization and induce severe flux decline wang et al 2016b unary linear regression equations between scaling composition and fouling layer resistance were also established using our experiment data as illustrated in table 5 fouling layer resistance exhibited a strong correlation with calcium r2 0 79 and sulfate r2 0 81 concentration on the membranes in coagulant free groups however there was no correlation between calcium sulfate concentration and the fouling layer resistance in coagulant contaminated groups the probable reason could be that the morphologies of scaling layer were also affected by the presence of coagulant in our previous study coagulant was proved to induce loose and porous gypsum scaling layer on nf membranes lin et al 2019 after analyzing the data of figs 8 and 9 it can be seen that gypsum scaling enhanced by coagulant failed to induce the corresponding flux decline at the ph of 5 0 the crystallization mechanisms consist of bulk crystallization and surface crystallization bulk crystallization generated in solutions homogeneously followed by the crystal deposition onto membrane surface while the surface crystallization is induced directly onto membrane surface as the heterogeneous scaling both of these are responsible for scaling on nf membranes lee et al 1999 but these processes always coexist with a competition which could be influenced by the solution chemistry and process parameters her et al 2000 dydo et al 2004 according to our experimental results the coagulant could enhance not only the surface crystallization fig 8 but also the bulk crystallization fig 3 compared to bulk crystallization surface crystallization could induce severer flux decline in nf due to the formation of a denser scaling layer and in situ blockage of the membranes especially at a low crossflow velocity and a high operating pressure lee and lee 2000 the competition between different crystallization mechanisms further weakens the flux decline caused by surface crystallization therefore the unexpected flux behavior at ph 5 0 could result from the greater deposition of loose and porous scaling from coagulant enhanced bulk crystallization near isoelectric point at which the electrostatic repulsion between scaling layer and membranes vanished with excessive alkalization to ph 10 0 both the amount of scaling on membranes and fouling layer resistance decreased unexpectedly whether coagulant was added or not in feed solution according to the variation of nanoparticle size mentioned in section 3 1 these behaviors could be attributed to the enhanced bulk crystallization in feed solution by excessive alkalization and soluble coagulant then electrostatic repulsion prevented negative bulk crystallization from depositing on negatively charged membrane surface the mechanisms of coagulant influenced gypsum scaling under different ph conditions were further presented in fig 11 it was noteworthy that the influences of concentration polarization and initial membrane flux were also taken into consideration to clarify the mechanism of coagulant enhanced gypsum scaling however the fitting results suggested that fouling layer resistance showed weak correlations with them table s3 these results were different from the phenomenon in previous study where lee et al found that concentration polarization should be responsible for gypsum scaling in nanofiltration lee and lee 2000 the probable explanation could be that in this experiment the concentration of caso4 near the membranes was far supersaturated under different experimental conditions and therefore was not any restriction on gypsum scaling and flux decline it was implied concentration polarization was not the main factor which could influence fouling layer resistance in the present study 3 4 effect of ph on coagulant influenced ion interception efficiency in nanofiltration 3 4 1 filtrate conductivity to evaluate the ion interception efficiency of nf membranes with without coagulant the conductivity of filtrate was measured both ph values and coagulant exerted a remarkably influence on conductivity of filtrate as illustrated in fig 12 the conductivity of filtrate increased with increasing ph values in addition the introduction of coagulant in feed solution could further deteriorate the filtrate quality especially under alkaline conditions at the ph of 8 0 the conductivity of filtrate in coagulant contaminated groups increased to 2847 87 μs cm which was 216 49 μs cm higher than the filtrate conductivity in control groups to investigate the mechanism of coagulant influenced ion interception efficiency in nf correlations between the difference of filtrate conductivity and the difference of concentration polarization modulus initial membrane flux were additionally estimated as summarized in table 6 unary linear regressions were well established by all experiment data and the difference of concentration polarization was found slightly responsible for the change of filtrate conductivity r2 0 35 while there existed a stronger correlation between the filtrate conductivity difference and membrane flux difference r2 0 53 the slope values indicated that there should be a positive association between them besides the evaluation of correlations between filtrate conductivity difference and different speciation of coagulant was also conducted and presented in supplementary section however as illustrated in table s4 the coefficients of determination indicated that the individual speciation of coagulant played a minor role in the deterioration of filtrate quality 3 4 2 ionic removal the removal of different ions was also monitored to gain a further understanding on coagulant influenced ion interception efficiency in nanofiltration as shown in fig 12 stronger acidity made it possible to remove calcium ions more efficiently with decreasing ph values of coagulant contaminated solution from 8 0 to 3 0 the removal of calcium continuously increased from 70 to 98 however though the results were consistent with the variation of sodium and chloride concentration in filtrate table 7 sulfate could be thoroughly removed by nanofiltration membranes all the time table 8 it has been proved that the interception mechanism in nanofiltration consisted of steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion lin 2017 the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged substances and nf membranes vanished under certain acidic conditions membranes became neutral or positively charged but sulfate which exhibited electronegativity in water could still hardly found in the filtrate it was inferred that steric hindrance allowed membranes to reject sulfate ions thoroughly according to previous studies alkalization could effectively enhance the electronegativity of membranes resulting in greater negative electrostatic repulsion and larger pore size kilduff et al 2004 as presented in table 7 the concentration of negatively charged chloride ions in filtrate still increased continuously when the ph values increased from 3 0 to 10 0 it meant that steric hindrance should be responsible for the rejection of not only polyvalent ions but also univalent ions by nanofiltration in present study some researchers argued that it was difficult for nanofiltration membranes to retain ions through steric hindrance epsztein et al 2018 but tanninen et al also found that the separation of ions in nanofiltration depended on their size characteristics due to a high ion concentration that lessened the charge effect of the membranes tanninen and nystrom 2002 compared to coagulant contaminated groups calcium ions were more effectively rejected in coagulant free groups at most of the ph values at the ph of 10 0 nf membranes showed greater efficiency in rejecting calcium ions for coagulant free solution while the removal rate decreased to 52 for coagulant contaminated solution however better performance in removing calcium ions was achieved with coagulant at ph 3 0 similarly more chloride ions penetrated through nf membranes in coagulant contaminated groups except at the ph of 3 0 these behaviors could be well explained by the viewpoint that steric hindrance played a more significant role in the ionic rejection by nf membranes than electrostatic repulsion in present study on the other hand coagulant failed to have an apparent influence on sodium concentration in filtrate the phenomena could be attributed to difference of ions radius according to previous studies the radius for sodium ion chloride ion and sulfate ion were about 0 117 nm 0 181 nm and 0 300 nm respectively though the radius for calcium ion 0 100 nm was the smallest among these ions calcium ion usually exists in hydrated formats in aqueous solution which hydrated radius was 0 260 nm tansel et al 2006 indicating that ions can be rejected by nanofiltration membranes through steric hindrance with the ability of so4 2 ca2 cl na the results of this study imply that coagulant adhered to membranes could weaken electropositivity making membrane compressed to enhance steric hindrance under certain acidic conditions additionally as mentioned in section 3 3 1 coagulant could also enhance electronegativity enlarge membrane pore size weaken steric hindrance and increase membrane flux under certain alkaline conditions therefore reliable correlations between the deterioration of filtrate conductivity and the difference concentration polarization modulus membrane flux could be well established on the data given in table 6 the mechanisms of coagulant influenced interception of ions by nf membranes under different ph conditions were presented in fig 13 4 conclusions this study focused on the influence of ferric coagulant on membrane flux behavior and ion interception efficiency at different ph values during the nanofiltration of brackish water the mechanisms of ferric coagulant influenced nf membrane performance at different ph was further verified on the basis of correlation analysis considering the interface interaction on membrane surface and salts crystallization process bulk crystallization and surface crystallization both bulk crystallization in feed solution and surface crystallization on nf membrane surface were dramatically induced by coagulant however the terminal fouling layer resistance enhanced by coagulant decreased after an initial increase when the ph values increased from 3 0 to 10 0 and the severest membrane fouling was observed in coagulant contaminated groups at the ph of 8 0 the visual minteq simulation results indicated that coagulant speciation varied from different ph values and fe oh 3 a kind of active ingredients in ferric coagulant was highly responsible for enhanced fouling layer resistance according to the correlations analyses neither concentration polarization nor saturation index of gypsum was the main factor in affecting gypsum scaling in nf process in present study the decreased removal of not only cations but also anions by nf membranes with increasing alkalization indicated that steric hindrance played a more important role in ions rejection than electrostatic repulsion in present study coagulant was found worsening ionic removal by nf membranes under alkaline conditions despite the fact that it could enhance the removal under acidic conditions the coagulant adhered to nf membranes accelerated the neutralization reaction between hydroxyl ions in the feed solution and carboxylic groups on membrane surface therefore ferric coagulant could weaken membrane electropositivity make membranes compressed enhance steric hindrance and decrease membrane flux in nf process under certain acidic conditions while it could also enhance membrane electronegativity enlarge membrane pore size weaken steric hindrance and increase membrane permeability to water in certain alkaline cases the present results showed that feed acidification could alleviate coagulant enhanced membrane fouling while it also allowed coagulant to strengthen the ionic rejection during nf treatment of brackish water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18022,metalimnetic oxygen minima are observed in many lakes and reservoirs but the mechanisms behind this phenomena are not well understood thus we simulated the metalimnetic oxygen minimum mom in the rappbode reservoir with a well established two dimensional water quality model ce qual w2 to systematically quantify the chain of events leading to its formation we used high resolution measured data to calibrate the model which accurately reproduced the physical e g water level and water temperature biogeochemical e g nutrient and oxygen dynamics and ecological e g algal community dynamics features of the reservoir particularly the spatial and temporal extent of the mom the results indicated that around 60 of the total oxygen consumption rate in the mom layer originated from benthic processes whereas the remainder originated from pelagic processes the occurrence of the cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens in the metalimnion delayed and slightly weakened the mom through photosynthesis although its decaying biomass ultimately induced the mom our research also confirmed the decisive role of water temperature in the formation of the mom since the water temperatures and thus benthic and pelagic oxygen consumption rates were higher in the metalimnion than in the hypolimnion our model is not only providing novel conclusions about the drivers of mom development and their quantitative contributions it is also a new tool for understanding and predicting ecological and biogeochemical water quality dynamics graphical abstract image 1 keywords rappbode reservoir ce qual w2 planktothrix rubescens metalimnion oxygen consumption benthic processes 1 introduction the concentration of dissolved oxygen do is a key factor for surface water quality and significantly influences biogeochemical cycling in aquatic ecosystems rhodes et al 2017 terry et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 for example do concentration directly affects growth and survival of aquatic organisms as well as predator prey interactions wang et al 1978 oxygen interacts with the retention and release of phosphorus in the sediment and can influence the trophic status of lakes and reservoirs hupfer and lewandowski 2008 kang et al 2018 due to the importance of do on aquatic ecosystems it is not surprising that many investigations have focused on its dynamics and influencing factors many recent studies have reported a decline in do concentration in temperate stratified standing waters foley et al 2012 analysed the long term observations of blelham tarn a monomictic lake in england and found that hypolimnetic anoxia the duration of hypolimnetic do concentration 1g o2 m 3 of the lake extended by nearly three months between 1966 and 2007 knoll et al 2018 found that the minimum oxygen concentration in the hypolimnion of an oligotrophic lake declined by 4 4 mg l 1 within 27 years as a consequence of climate warming deep water oxygen content in several perialpine lakes decreased significantly between 1992 and 2016 rogora et al 2018 all these studies focused on oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion and the mechanisms involved were fully characterised in contrast little attention has been paid to do loss within the metaliminon and the occurrence of metalimnetic oxygen minima hereafter mom is far less understood the metalimnion is the layer of high temperature and density gradients at the transition between the upper continuously mixing epilimnion and the hypolimnion the occurrence of moms is affecting aquatic biogeochemistry limnetic communities and has been described in many lakes and reservoirs worldwide wetzel 2001 a mom forms a barrier for many organisms and therefore influences the vertical distribution and biomass production of invertebrates horppila et al 2000 and fish liljendahl nurminen et al 2008 rice et al 2013 illustrated that metalimnetic hypoxia can cause fish kills in lake norman additionally mcclure et al 2018 reported the occurrence of mom in the falling creek reservoir and indicated that the phenomenon can significantly change greenhouse gas dynamics in drinking water reservoirs a mom can induce water quality deteriorations due to release of manganese or other unwanted substances and may require management interventions moms form where vertical turbulent diffusion rates are low because this restricts the replenishment of oxygen from the water above or below kreling et al 2017 scientists disagree about the mechanisms triggering the phenomenon and several hypotheses have been put forward early work by shapiro 1960 illustrated that the respiration of copepods is the main driver of metalimnetic oxygen depletion in lake washington later research by nix 1981 indicated that the high oxygen consumption in the metalimnion of degray reservoir usa could be attributed to the entrainment of inflows with high loads of reduced substances e g iron manganese a recent study by müller et al 2012 pointed out that rapid decomposition of organic materials sinking from the epilimnion may also play an important role in pelagic oxygen dynamics as indicated by kreling et al 2017 however many limnologists question these hypotheses which currently remain speculation rather than explanation the metalimnion is characterized by very strong local gradients in temperature biomass microbial activity and transport rates of gas and solutes this makes it extremely difficult to empirically quantify the different processes that contribute to mom formation coupled hydrodynamic ecological models are well suited to analyze and explain the mechanisms of do depletion and predict its future evolution elliott 2012 hamilton and schladow 1997 ladwig et al 2018 because they can simultaneously resolve transport and reactive processes a detailed review of lake models by arhonditsis and brett 2004 concluded that predictive abilities for do are high in comparison to biological variables e g algae more than 160 papers have been published in this field during the past 20 years web of science search on the topic lake oxygen depletion model however as stated above most of these studies focused on modelling the depletion of hypolimnetic do and simulating the oxygen loss in the metalimnion remains a challenge weber et al 2017 joehnk and umlauf 2001 presented a study about simulating the mom in lake ammer using a one dimensional 1d physical ecological coupled model they assumed that temperature dependent biological oxygen demand bod and stratification duration were the main factors contributing to mom development antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 followed a similar approach to simulate the mom in lake vegoritis and suggested that the vertical turbulent diffusivity kz had a big influence on metalimnetic do dynamics however none of these models resolved other ecosystem components like phytoplankton or nutrient dynamics and thus were unable to link do dynamics to ecosystem dynamics hence the results from such model studies are not easily transferable to other systems and unsuited to identify the drivers responsible for the do depletion we therefore argue for the development of an advanced water quality model that fully describes the ecological processes related to the mom including autotrophic and heterotrophic ecosystem processes to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind this phenomenon in this publication we used a well established water quality model ce qual w2 with a spatially explicit representation of hydrodynamics oxygen nutrients and phytoplankton community dynamics to simulate the mom in the rappbode reservoir germany in a previous study the spatio temporal dynamics of a mom in the reservoir were studied in great detail providing empirical evidence that a bloom of the cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens hereafter p rubescens in the metalimnion provides an important contribution for the formation of the mom wentzky et al 2019 our model based systems analysis with closed dynamic budgets of oxygen nutrients and organic carbon allows us to quantify the contribution of p rubescens to the mom we were interested in finding out whether moms can also emerge without metalimnetic phytoplankton mass developments for this purpose we employed an experimental modelling approach mooij et al 2010 and systematically studied and quantified the chain of events leading to the formation of the mom beyond wentzky et al 2019 who proved the important contribution of pelagic oxygen depletion we include sediment oxygen demand in our model and attempt to put both in relation to each other for rappbode reservoir besides this focused research question we also strive to develop a template for an ecological lake model that can capture the dominant physical and biogeochemical processes in the metalimnion and predict metalimnetic dynamics 2 methods 2 1 study site rappbode reservoir is located in the eastern harz mountains and has a maximum depth of 89 m fig 1 it is the core of the rappbode system a network of 6 reservoirs used for flood protection environmental flows hydropower recreation and drinking water supply the reservoir was constructed in 1959 and it was filled to capacity by 1964 it is the largest drinking water reservoir in germany supplying drinking water to more than 1 million people mi et al 2019 it receives water from two tributaries hassel and rappbode pre reservoirs and a transfer gallery from königshütte reservoir the water of the rappbode reservoir is discharged downstream into wendefurth reservoir rinke et al 2013 the reservoir is a typical dimictic water body which stratifies in summer and winter and mixes completely in spring and autumn analysis of long term monitoring data showed that the reduced use of phosphate containing detergents strongly decreased the phosphorus concentration in the reservoir after 1991 which decreased the total phosphorus concentration during the mixing period from 0 163 mg l 1 to 0 027 mg l 1 and shifted the reservoir from a eutrophic to a mesotrophic state wentzky et al 2018 this strong decrease of phosphorus however did not reduce the phytoplankton biomass for which the annual mean biovolume was 1 164 mg l 1 based on long term measurements from 1971 to 2016 wentzky et al 2018 2 2 numerical model the two dimensional longitudinal vertical hydrodynamic and water quality

attenuation follows lambert beers law and includes algal self shading i e the overall light extinction coefficient is calculated by a background extinction coefficient plus the specific absorption cross section of the two phytoplankton groups multiplied by their respective biomasses oxygen consumption in the model depends on phytoplankton respiration decaying dissolved and particulate organic matter which are imported by inflows and produced through phytoplankton mortality through nitrification of ammonia and through sediment consumption the decay of organic matter is also linked to regeneration of nutrients to account for sediment oxygen consumption and anoxic sediment release of phosphate and ammonium a zero order sediment compartment was included in the model as has been reported in recent studies with a similar topic brito et al 2018 chong et al 2018 terry et al 2017 since the 2 d model is discretized into grid cells in the longitudinal and vertical directions each grid cell is homogeneous in the lateral direction and contains a sediment surface and a water volume in accordance with the bathymetry of the reservoir accordingly in each 2d grid cell sediment oxygen consumption plays a role to some extent and the model explicitly accounts for oxygen consumption from both littoral and profundal sediments in view of the research objective and limitation of observational data other compartments like zooplankton epiphyton or macrophytes were not included in the model in this study the latest version of w2 v4 1 was used to simulate rappbode reservoir w2 is suited for the reservoir because of its long narrow and deep shape for which the lateral gradients in both hydrodynamic and water quality variables can be neglected see fig 1 the computational grid was built based on the hypsographic data provided by the reservoir authority talsperrenbetrieb sachsen anhalt the bathymetry input file contains four branches including two branches for side arms so that the physical structure of the reservoir could be well represented by the model domain fig s1 in total the reservoir was split into 106 segments along the longitudinal direction the horizontal grid spacing ranged from 100 m to 400 m in the longitudinal direction and 5 m 700 m in the lateral direction whereas the vertical grid spacing was always 1 m overall the full spatial model domain consisted of 3976 model cells the grid based elevation volume relationship matched well with the observed bathymetry 2 3 model setup and input data the boundary conditions for running w2 include time series of meteorological input inflow including discharge water temperature nutrients and outflow discharge the meteorological input data include wind speed air temperature wind direction shortwave radiation cloud cover fraction and dew point temperature the first four items were obtained from a monitoring buoy installed in the central part of the rappbode reservoir see rinke et al 2013 high frequency observations every 10 min were averaged to hourly values for driving the model the very few missing values were filled by measurements from a nearby monitoring station at the rappbode pre reservoir friese et al 2014 rinke et al 2013 cloud cover fraction data were taken from the harzgerode station of the german weather service 15 km away from the research area dew point temperatures were calculated from relative humidity and air temperature by the following equation bolton 1980 1 t d p λ ln r h 100 β t λ t β ln r h 100 β t λ t where t dp is the dew point temperature in c rh is the relative humidity in t is the air temperature in c and λ 237 7 c and β 17 27 are constants the daily inflow and outflow discharges were provided by the reservoir authority of the state of saxony anhalt talsperrenbetrieb sachsen anhalt inflow water temperatures were drawn from a ysi 6200 probe at the pre reservoirs and königshütte reservoir see rinke et al 2013 inflow nutrients nitrate ammonia orthophosphate silicate were measured at biweekly resolution by continuous flow photometry cfa skalar the netherlands at the upstream stations of the rappbode reservoir friese et al 2014 the minimum time step for the simulation was set to 1 s as recommended to keep numerical stability the output frequency of the simulation was 1 h to enable sub daily changes of hydrodynamic and water quality variables initial conditions water level water temperature nutrients algal and oxygen concentration for starting the simulation were taken from measurements conducted at the deepest point of the reservoir see wentzky et al 2018 since the simulation started during deep recirculation in winter a single vertical profile was used to initialize all horizontal segments 2 4 model calibration the model was run and calibrated from january 19th to december 31st in 2016 this period was selected because this year showed a clear metalimnetic oxygen minimum which was covered by high quality observational data for both stratification and water quality the field data used for calibration were measured close to the dam wall same location as for initial conditions including 1 daily water level provided by the reservoir authority 2 biweekly profiles of water temperature and dissolved oxygen measured by a hydrolab ds5 probe 3 biweekly profiles of nutrient concentration nitrate and silicate measured by accredited methods following german standards see wentzky et al 2018 4 biweekly profiles of algae concentration p rubescens and diatoms detected by a multi channel fluorescence probe fluoroprobe bbe moldaenke gmbh we separately determined the plankton composition by microscopic counts for more information about differentiating algal groups from the fluorescence probe see wentzky et al 2019 we did not calibrate ammonia or orthophosphate in the study since most measurements in 2016 were below the detection limit 0 01 mg l 1 for ammonia 0 003 mg l 1 for orthophosphate model adjustment and calibration was realized in three steps more details of the underlying procedures are given in the si step 1 water budget deviations in the water budget could always be attributed to inaccurate input data of bathymetry inflow and outflow discharge we closed the water budget by incorporating a distributed tributary as it was recommended in the manual of w2 a graphical illustration of this distributed inflow is given in fig s2 step 2 water temperatures we only calibrated the wind sheltering coefficient by minimizing rmse see table s1 in the si for further details and intentionally left all other internal hydrodynamics parameters unchanged because they have a solid empirical basis mi et al 2018 note that the background extinction coefficient was not calibrated but determined based on in situ measurements we set its value close to the minimum extinction coefficient that was observed in 2016 according to measurements of photosynthetically available radiation with two spherical licor li 193sa light sensors 0 45 m 1 see supplementary fig s4 step 3 water quality model we intentionally did not rely on computational optimization algorithms to parameterize the model in our experience such algorithms can produce a good model fit but can lead to over optimized parameterizations with low transferability to other systems biased results outside the optimized state space and less explanatory power for systems analysis fenocchi et al 2019 for instance we initially used a semi automated optimization procedure which yielded a low model error for oxygen and good spatial and temporal representation of the mom and chlorophyll concentration of diatoms and p rubescens however this was based on biologically unrealistic parameter combinations including very low pigment content and very high phosphorus affinity of p rubescens compared to diatoms combined with a low sediment oxygen demand in our experience as many parameters as possible should be determined a priori by expert knowledge and empirical evidence in order to incorporate ecological understanding of the important processes this produces a more robust transferable model even at the expense of a slightly higher model error the following empirical observations provided guidance for the specification of the ecological model i a strong growth of diatoms in the epilimnion after the onset of stratification ii subsequent full depletion of phosphate in the epilimnion and sedimentation of diatoms iii appearance and growth of p rubescens in the metalimnion and iv intense oxygen depletion in the metalimnion coinciding with the disappearance of p rubescens based on the different ecological niches that spring diatoms and p rubescens occupied in rappbode reservoir we parameterized spring diatoms as r strategists with high maximum growth rates and moderate light requirements whereas we characterized p rubescens as a k strategist with slow growth rate low mortality rate due to grazing resistance and an adaptation to low light and cold regimes posch et al 2012 walsby and jüttner 2006 by combination of literature values ecological expert knowledge and evaluation of historical data from rappbode reservoir we were able to a priori determine all parameters of the ecological model except the four key parameters ag 1 ag 2 asat 1 and asat 2 see table 1 which describe light dependent growth of both algal groups and required calibration the details of this calibration procedure as well as the description of the a priori parameterization are outlined in the si since the formation of a mom was sensitive to sediment oxygen demand sod we independently estimated sod in the hypolimnion from measured oxygen profiles using the model of livingstone and imboden 1996 see supplementary information and fig s5 for details the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to measure model performance these coefficients are widely used to evaluate model performance carraro et al 2012 mi et al 2018 we used packages tidyr metrics and hydrogof in r version 3 4 3 to organize simulation output data and for calculating rmse and nse 2 5 sensitivity analysis and model robustness we performed a local sensitivity analysis one by one parameter of the ecological model by changing each parameter value p in table 1 by 5 and 10 and calculated specific sensitivity coefficients ssc see rangel peraza et al 2016 for the minimum oxygen concentrations in the mom do min as s s c d o m i n m o d d o m i n r e f d o m i n r e f p m o d p r e f p r e f here the indices ref and mod stand for reference and modified parameter settings respectively after evaluating the four parameter changes for each parameter we averaged the ssc values in order to achieve an average sensitivity result at the local vicinity of each parameter value we defined do min as the global minimum do concentration in the top 35m of the reservoir the three parameters at1 ahssi 1 and sodk2 were not included because at1 for diatoms and ahssi 1 were 0 and it makes no sense to change them on a percentage scale and sodk2 in the reference simulation is 0 99 which is not allowed to be higher than 1 we used the same set of simulations for a robustness assessment and evaluated the characteristics of the mom under the various parameter perturbations in order to analyze the robustness of the mom phenomenon with respect to our parameterization for each simulation we analysed the value of do min 35m the depth of do min 35m as well as the difference in do concentration between the minimum and 8 m below and above taken at the day in which the minimum occurs 2 6 model system analysis we used the calibrated model to investigate the contributions of pelagic p rubescens and diatoms and benthic processes sod to the formation of the mom by hierarchical model experiments where different processes were turned off and compared to the reference simulation scenario a obtained with the calibrated model we firstly switched off only the module of p rubescens scenario b and then only the diatoms scenario c respectively to quantify the contribution of these two algal groups to the mom subsequently we switched off both algal modules simultaneously scenario d to check the total influence of pelagic processes on the mom in order to test the contribution of benthic processes to mom formation we turned off the sod module and left both algal groups active scenario e finally as a control treatment we run the model without algae and without sod 3 results 3 1 model performance and goodness of fit the parameters used in the calibrated model are shown in table 1 an additional distributed inflow with a small discharge yearly mean value of 0 05 m3 s 1 was incorporated into the simulation in order to close the water budget the simulated water level agreed well with the observations rmse 0 03 m r2 0 99 nse 0 99 see fig s3 the simulated water temperatures were also in excellent agreement with the measurements rmse 0 45 c r2 0 99 nse 0 99 fig 2 including the dynamics in thermocline depth indicating an accurate reproduction of the hydrodynamic processes in the reservoir the simulated timing of stratification onset and autumnal mixing also agreed well with the observed data fig 2 the model adequately captured the dynamics of the two algal groups see fig 3 the r2 values for both p rubescens and diatoms were above 0 5 table 2 and the model well reproduced the spring diatom bloom as well as the autumnal metalimnetic bloom of p rubescens see fig 3 although the model slightly underestimated the maximum concentration of p rubescens in summer it accurately captured the timing of the p rubescens bloom day 200 250 its vertical localization as well as the gradual decline of the bloom from late august due to decreasing irradiance the model satisfactorily captured the peak concentration 6 5 μg l 1 given as chlorophyll a of diatoms during spring but slightly underestimated the deep water concentrations in winter and spring the model also correctly predicted the nutrient concentrations table 2 figs 4 and 5 with better performance for silicate r2 0 84 than for nitrate r2 0 69 because of thermal stratification and strong depletion in the illuminated surface layers the observed nutrient concentrations were always higher in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion and the model reproduced this pattern the simulated nitrate concentrations were slightly but systematically lower than measurements resulting in a low value for nse although the vertical gradients were well reproduced fig 4 the modeled silicate concentrations at the surface from late summer to early winter were slightly higher than the measurements fig 5 the model accurately captured the observed oxygen dynamics r2 0 84 particularly the spatial and temporal extent of the mom in the sampling location figs 6 and 7 in accordance with the measurements the formation of the mom started at the end of july and the concentration decreased gradually to its lowest value in mid september both the modeled and observed oxygen concentrations showed that the oxygen minimum began to diminish in early october and totally disappeared in november under conditions of weakening stratification and intensifying mixing in conclusion goodness of fit estimates showed an excellent performance of w2 in rappbode reservoir with very precise predictions for the physical variables water level and temperature high accuracy for chemical variables oxygen and nutrients and also good accuracy for biological state variables diatoms and p rubescens these high model skills enable us to use the model for a process oriented systems analysis 3 2 sensitivity analysis and model robustness the analysis of parameter sensitivity identified a few highly sensitive parameters with respect to the minimum oxygen concentration within the mom which are either involved in diatom dynamics sediment oxygen demand or p rubescens dynamics see table 1 interestingly these most sensitive parameters were not centered around a specific state variable e g p rubescence but refer to pelagic as well as benthic components indicating that both pelagic and benthic processes can have a strong effect on the minimum oxygen concentration of the mom the phenomenon of mom appeared highly robust against the parameterization as perturbations of the parameters never produced oxygen dynamics without a mom the minimum concentration the depth location is varying slightly with parameter changes see si for a detailed description but the patterns of vertical do gradients remained similar the minimum oxygen concentration from the calibrated model for example was at 5 mg l 1 and in all simulations with perturbed parameters this value remained in the range of 4 3 5 7 mg l 1 fig s6 3 3 mechanistic understanding of mom formation the separate effect of pelagic p rubescens and diatoms and benthic processes sod on the metalimnetic do concentration is illustrated in fig 8 in the absence of p rubescens scenario b the diatom concentration in the metalimnion depth of 10 m during the summer day 180 250 increased slightly from 1 26 mg l 1 in the reference scenario a to 1 83 mg l 1 notably the mom was more pronounced in scenario b with an average do concentration of 6 28 mg l 1 in the autumn mom layer taken as the water layer between 10 and 20 m and from day 240 300 which was lower than the 6 75 mg l 1 in the reference simulation in scenario c the simulation without diatoms p rubescens bloomed one month earlier at the end of june than in the reference simulation at the end of july the metalimnetic algal concentration reached 20 μg l 1 in scenario c which was twice as high as in the reference simulation this in turn produced a local metalimnetic oxygen maximum in early summer that reached a concentration up to 14 mg l 1 although a weak mom was still present in scenario c from day 250 onwards the average do concentration in the autumn mom layer was 8 31 mg l 1 which was much higher than in the reference simulation 6 75 mg l 1 additionally the hypolimnetic do concentrations were higher in scenario c than in the reference simulation scenario c demonstrates that the presence of p rubescens postpones and weakens the mom because during the growth phase a net oxygen production occurs within the metalimnion and no oxygen consumption from diatom derived biomass reference scenario is taking place the most remarkable result from scenario d was that the mom was still present despite the absence of both diatoms and p rubescens with essentially no organic matter production in the water column the oxygen in the metalimnion in this scenario is consumed solely by the sediment resulting in a mom with an average do concentration of 8 52 mg l 1 oxygen depletion from metalimnetic sediments is higher than that from the deeper hypolimnetic sediments because of higher temperature at this depth compared to deeper layers this conclusion is further confirmed by the results in scenario e in which only the sod was turned off while the algae were still present this scenario clearly showed that only the activities from the two algal groups cannot trigger the mom finally the mom also disappeared completely in our control scenario f i e when all the pelagic processes were removed and sod was set to 0 in this case the do distribution in the water column was solely driven by temperature dependent oxygen solubility at the different depths and atmospheric equilibrium within the epilimnion in order to quantify the contributions from the different processes at play in the formation of the mom we extracted the oxygen production rates from photosynthesis and the consumption rates from organic matter decay and sediment oxygen demand out of the reference simulation oxygen production by photosynthesis reached 0 2 mg l 1 day 1 in the surface layer during the spring diatom bloom which began at the time of stratification onset around day 100 fig 9 a after the spring bloom diatoms continued to produce oxygen in the metalimnion at a lower rate between day 150 and 200 p rubescens replaced diatoms in the metalimnion the oxygen production rate was then lower than in spring and reached values around 0 1 mg l 1 day 1 the do consumption through decomposition of pelagic organic material derived from dead algae was high in spring in the surface layers day 100 160 fig 9b with maximum values of 0 08 mg l 1 day 1 afterwards do consumption remained relatively high in the metalimnion for another 2 months after day 220 do consumption by organic matter decreased in the metalimnion with an average rate of 0 009 mg l 1 day 1 in autumn within the mom layer the sediment consumed a large amount of oxygen in the bottom layers fig 9c due to the high ratio of sediment area to water volume given the strong temperature dependence of sediment oxygen consumption rate sediment oxygen consumption was also high in the warmer layers of the epilimnion and metalimnion fig 9c the average oxygen consumption rate in the autumn mom layer caused by sod was 0 015 mg l 1 day 1 taken together all the different oxygen production and consumption terms fig 9d about 60 of the total simulated consumption rate in the autumn mom layer i e 0 024 mg l 1 day 1 originated from benthic processes while the remaining 40 originated from pelagic mineralization of dead algal biomass in conclusion the mom is formed by both pelagic and benthic do depletion p rubescens delivers large parts of the pelagic organic matter that fuels pelagic do consumption but it also produces oxygen during the growth phase and therefore effectively postpones the mom formation 4 discussion in this study we used a well developed water quality model to identify and analyze the drivers of mom formation on the one hand our research confirms the previous conclusion from wentzky et al 2019 that the occurrence of p rubescens delivers an important contribution for the formation of the mom on the other hand this study also shows that the process chain is more complex and sod also significantly contributes to the phenomenon our study is innovative because we employed an ecosystem model not only to reproduce observations and quantitative patterns but also to identify and quantify processes and test hypotheses in a series of simulation experiments our model system combines the major physical e g vertical transport and thermodynamics biogeochemical e g nutrient and oxygen dynamics and ecological e g algal community dynamics resource limitation features of this complex ecosystem the simulation results were in good agreement with measurements for all variables and the rmse for the water temperature was lower than that obtained in other recent studies chong et al 2018 lee et al 2018 park et al 2018 based on a meta analysis of the performance of different water quality models by arhonditsis and brett 2004 the simulation accuracy of water temperature in this study can be regarded as top level furthermore the model accurately reproduced the dynamics of nutrients two main algal groups in the reservoir diatoms and p rubescens and dissolved oxygen particularly the temporal and spatial extent of the mom see figs 3 7 the r2 of 0 84 for oxygen is much higher than the median value of 0 70 calculated from 569 oxygen modelling studies shown in arhonditsis and brett 2004 using a 1d physical biological coupled model joehnk and umlauf 2001 and antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 also captured the mom in lake ammer and lake vegoritis respectively however these models only considered total chlorophyll a rather than the dynamics of different phytoplankton groups as suggested by joehnk and umlauf 2001 merely simulating the chlorophyll a is too general and accounting for specific algal properties can improve the accuracy of model simulations our work substantiates this statement as the ecological features of the different algal groups in our model play an important role in the mom formation however although our model is far more detailed than previous approaches we were also forced to apply simplications in terms of process formulations and state variables zooplankton grazing for example is only indirectly represented by algae mortality and bacterial respiration is integrated into degradation of organic matter the diverse phytoplankton community is reduced to two functional groups diatoms p rubescens which largely represent the photoautotrophic organisms but not mixotrophs which occur during late summer in rappbode reservoir to the best of our knowledge however this work is the first modelling research which systematically elucidates the mechanisms that trigger moms in inland waters in a process chain including biogeochemical and ecological dynamics a detailed evaluation of the model with respect to sensitivity and robostness corroborated with the findings from our simulation experiments in the respect that parameters for algal dynamics as well as sediment related parameters were highly sensitive this implies that both pelagic and benthic processes have a large influence on the mom our model findings were also robust against the parameterization the phenomenon of a mom was formed under all parameter perturbations and can be classified as a very robust feature of the rappbode reservoir model we interpret this outcome as an indicator that our conclusions are valid over a broad range of parametter values 4 1 processes driving formation of a metalimnetic oxygen minimum our results identify a chain of events leading to the formation of the mom that is more complex than the mechanism described in wentzky et al 2019 comparing scenario a and b see fig 8 showed that diatoms also contributed to the formation of mom since sinking organic matter originating from dead diatoms consumed do in the metalimnion in the reference simulation however this do consumption was not visible because the growing p rubescens replaced the dying diatoms and the do that p rubescens produced was utilized to break down the diatom biomass therefore do remained rather constant during this time although the turnover was high in the absence of diatoms in scenario c the earlier onset of p rubescens therefore triggered a metalimnetic oxygen maximum in late spring and delayed and decreased mom formation although decomposition of organic material from dead p rubescens ultimately transformed the metalimnetic oxygen maximum into a minimum moreover when p rubescens was excluded from the simulation in scenario b the mom formed earlier and attained a lower do concentration because organic matter degradation from diatoms and sod consumed oxygen from day 150 onwards in fact the occurrence of p rubescens delayed and slightly weakened the mom although its biomass ultimately induced the mom additonally a weak but clear oxygen minimum still formed in the metalimnion in scenario d which did not contain any algae fig 8 but sod as the sole do sink in order to assure that the value of sod in our model is within a reasonable empirical range we extracted sod values from other water bodies from literature si table s2 it turned out that our value of 3 go2 m 2 d 1 is a typical value that can also be found in other water bodies this indicates that benthic oxygen conspumtion can significantly influence metalimnetic oxygen dynamics in other lakes or reservoirs shapiro 1960 identified three factors that might lead to the formation of a mom 1 inflow with low oxygen content 2 in situ biological and chemical processes 3 sediment consumption in rappbode reservoir the first factor could be excluded since oxygen from the inflows was always saturated also the mom was captured at depths between 11 m and 13 m in front of the dam as illustrated in fig s7 during the period of the mom formation the inflows were much warmer than water at 11 m depth even during nocturnal cooling events in exceptionally cold summer nights only in mid october i e at the time of mom erosion inflow temperatures approached metalimnetic temperatures also high loads of sediments as an alternative process for deep inflow intrusions can be ruled out because almost all of the sediments from the inflow are efficiently retained in the upstream pre dams additionally the total inflow discharge during the occurrence of the mom i e from day 240 300 was very low always lower than 0 5 m3 s 1 see fig s8 in conclusion any influence of inflows on mom formation can be ruled out the remaining two factors from shapiro 1960 in situ biological chemical processes and sod appeared to contribute to the mom formation in rappbode reservoir as shown by our scenario analysis we further extracted and compared the simulated oxygen profiles at shallower sections in the reservoir at the same time of 2016 10th september as the measurements in 2015 from wentzky et al 2019 see fig s9 although we do not have the corresponding measured oxygen profiles in 2016 based on our knowledge of the reservoir the principal oxygen distribution patterns were similar in 2015 and 2016 and the oxygen patterns should be comparable we found that horizontal variablility of the simulated mom in 2016 was a little larger than that of the measurements in 2015 see their fig 3 this may be a sign that our model did not completely capture the contribution of benthic and pelagic oxygen depletion along the longitudinal axis the morphometry of rappbode reservoir is characterised by steep slopes that do not allow the formation of sustained sediment layers at many places we therefore speculate that the sod in the canyon shaped upstream parts is lower than that in the central basin where plankton growth and sedimentation of organic material is much higher hence we may have slightly overestimated the contribution of sod to the formation of the mom at these upstream sites however this should not change our conclusion that the sod plays an important role in the mom development besides these biogeochemical drivers the physical environment is decisive for the persistence of a mom the metalimnion is a region with low vertical mixing due to strong density gradients and this mixing refuge prevents the mom from being refilled with oxygen from above or below dong et al 2019 this low mixing refuge is clearly evident in the rappbode reservoir and a commmon feature of stably stratified lakes and reservoirs boehrer and schultze 2008 4 2 the role of temperature we believe that the oxygen uptake by the sediment contributes to the mom in the rappbode reservoir water temperature alone can change the sod rate by a factor of 10 within the range of 4 30 c pace and prairie 2005 which is in accordance with our calibrated sod temperature rate multipliers see table 1 the sediment oxygen consumption rate is therefore highly sensitive to water temperature terry et al 2017 in rappbode reservoir water temperature below 20 m depth is below 6 c the whole year round fig s10 the low water temperatures in these layers decrease oxygen consumption from the sediment in contrast the temperature in the upper 15 m e g metalimnion and epilimnion is always above 10 c in summer which leads to a relatively high sediment oxygen demand in the epilimnion atmospheric exchange can offset the sediment uptake in the metalimnion i e 10 m 15 m depth however the low vertical diffusivity caused by intense stratification strongly inhibits any flux of oxygen from above or below therefore the high sod rate which results from the warm temperature combined with the disconnection from the atmosphere is a significant factor causing the mom in the reservoir higher temperatures also significantly enhance algal biomass decay rates conover et al 2016 england et al 2015 concluded that compared to the beginning of the 21st century the global mean temperature at the end of the century will increase by nearly 5 c under high greenhouse gas emissions also surface water temperatures have increased globally by 0 34 c decade 1 in recent decades o reilly and sharma 2015 possibly higher water temperatures under strong climate warming may increase the mom in future in temperate climates this trend is further enhanced by an increasing stratification duration fang and stefan 2009 radbourne et al 2019 shatwell et al 2019 therefore further modelling scenarios should focus on how to optimize management practices e g artificial aeration different withdrawal depths to mitigate the negative influence caused by the increase in air temperatures the advanced water quality model in this study systematically explained the ecological processes related to the mom formation in rappbode reservoir we extended the findings of wentzky et al 2019 by showing that not only pelagic but also benthic processes contribute to mom formation where the strong temperature and density gradients in the metalimnion play a decisive role since moms are widespread in stratified lakes and reservoirs our model may be transferred to other systems to identify the drivers responsible for moms in different case studies a valuable next step would therefore be an application of this model in a multi lake comparison to better understand the mechanisms behind mom development at a large scale 5 conclusions in this study we used a well established water quality model ce qual w2 to illustrate the mechanism behind the formation of metalimnetic oxygen minima mom in rappbode reservoir the results showed that our model performed well in reproducing the physical e g water level and water temperature biogeochemical e g nutrient and oxygen dynamics and ecological e g algal community dynamics features of the reservoir particularly the spatial and temporal extent of the mom through a scenario analysis we found that growth of the cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens in the metalimnion postponed and weakened the mom through photosynthesis although the decomposition of its biomass ultimately induced the mom moreover the results showed that not only pelagic processes but also benthic processes e g sediment oxygen demand contributed to the formation of the mom besides these biogeochemical drivers the physical environment was demonstrated as a determinant for the persistence of a mom the high density gradient in the thermocline restricted downward transport of oxygen from surface waters yet the higher temperatures in the metalimnion relative to the hypolimnion caused locally increased oxygen consumption rates from the sediment and decaying organic matter which contributed to the formation of the mom since the global warming trend is supposed to increase the mom in future it is recommended in the further modelling scenarios to elucidate how to optimize the reservoir operation

18022,metalimnetic oxygen minima are observed in many lakes and reservoirs but the mechanisms behind this phenomena are not well understood thus we simulated the metalimnetic oxygen minimum mom in the rappbode reservoir with a well established two dimensional water quality model ce qual w2 to systematically quantify the chain of events leading to its formation we used high resolution measured data to calibrate the model which accurately reproduced the physical e g water level and water temperature biogeochemical e g nutrient and oxygen dynamics and ecological e g algal community dynamics features of the reservoir particularly the spatial and temporal extent of the mom the results indicated that around 60 of the total oxygen consumption rate in the mom layer originated from benthic processes whereas the remainder originated from pelagic processes the occurrence of the cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens in the metalimnion delayed and slightly weakened the mom through photosynthesis although its decaying biomass ultimately induced the mom our research also confirmed the decisive role of water temperature in the formation of the mom since the water temperatures and thus benthic and pelagic oxygen consumption rates were higher in the metalimnion than in the hypolimnion our model is not only providing novel conclusions about the drivers of mom development and their quantitative contributions it is also a new tool for understanding and predicting ecological and biogeochemical water quality dynamics graphical abstract image 1 keywords rappbode reservoir ce

that hypolimnetic anoxia the duration of hypolimnetic do concentration 1g o2 m 3 of the lake extended by nearly three months between 1966 and 2007 knoll et al 2018 found that the minimum oxygen

has been paid to do loss within the metaliminon and the occurrence of metalimnetic oxygen minima hereafter mom is far less understood the metalimnion is the layer of high temperature and density gradients at the transition between the upper continuously mixing epilimnion and the hypolimnion the occurrence of moms is affecting aquatic biogeochemistry limnetic communities and has been described in many lakes and reservoirs worldwide wetzel 2001 a mom forms a barrier for many organisms and therefore influences the vertical distribution and biomass production of invertebrates horppila et al 2000 and fish liljendahl nurminen et al 2008 rice et al 2013 illustrated that metalimnetic hypoxia can cause fish kills in lake norman additionally mcclure et al 2018 reported the occurrence of mom in the falling creek reservoir and indicated that the phenomenon can significantly change greenhouse gas dynamics in drinking water reservoirs a mom can induce water quality deteriorations due to release of manganese or other unwanted substances and may require management interventions moms form where vertical turbulent diffusion rates are low because this restricts the replenishment of oxygen from the water above or below kreling et al 2017 scientists disagree about the mechanisms triggering the phenomenon and several hypotheses have been put forward early work by shapiro 1960 illustrated that the respiration of copepods is the main driver of metalimnetic oxygen depletion in lake washington later research by nix 1981 indicated that the high oxygen consumption in the metalimnion of degray reservoir usa could be attributed to the entrainment of inflows with high loads of reduced substances e g iron manganese a recent study by müller et al 2012 pointed out that rapid decomposition of organic materials sinking from the epilimnion may also play an important role in pelagic oxygen dynamics as indicated by kreling et al 2017 however many limnologists question these hypotheses which currently remain speculation rather than explanation the metalimnion is characterized by very strong local gradients in temperature biomass microbial activity and transport rates of gas and solutes this makes it extremely difficult to empirically quantify the different processes that contribute to mom formation coupled hydrodynamic ecological models are well suited to analyze and explain the mechanisms of do depletion and predict its future evolution elliott 2012 hamilton and schladow 1997 ladwig et al 2018 because they can simultaneously resolve transport and reactive processes a detailed review of lake models by arhonditsis and brett 2004 concluded that predictive abilities for do are high in comparison to biological variables e g algae more than 160 papers have been published in this field during the past 20 years web of science search on the topic lake oxygen depletion model however as stated above most of these studies focused on modelling the depletion of hypolimnetic do and simulating the oxygen loss in the metalimnion remains a challenge weber et al 2017 joehnk and umlauf 2001 presented a study about simulating the mom in lake ammer using a one dimensional 1d physical ecological coupled model they assumed that temperature dependent biological oxygen demand bod and stratification duration were the main factors contributing to mom development antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 followed a similar approach to simulate the mom in lake vegoritis and suggested that the vertical turbulent diffusivity kz had a big influence on metalimnetic do dynamics however none of these models resolved other ecosystem components like phytoplankton or nutrient dynamics and thus were unable to link do dynamics to ecosystem dynamics hence the results from such model studies are not easily transferable to other systems and unsuited to identify the drivers responsible for the do depletion we therefore argue for the development of an advanced water quality model that fully describes the ecological processes related to the mom including autotrophic and heterotrophic ecosystem processes to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind this phenomenon in this publication we used a well established water quality model ce qual w2 with a spatially explicit representation of hydrodynamics oxygen nutrients and phytoplankton community dynamics to simulate the mom in the rappbode reservoir germany in a previous study the spatio temporal dynamics of a mom in the reservoir were studied in great detail providing empirical evidence that a bloom of the cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens hereafter p rubescens in the metalimnion provides an important contribution for the formation of the mom wentzky et al 2019 our model based systems analysis with closed dynamic budgets of oxygen nutrients and organic carbon allows us to quantify the contribution of p rubescens to the mom we were interested in finding out whether moms can also emerge without metalimnetic phytoplankton mass developments for this purpose we employed an experimental modelling approach mooij et al 2010 and systematically studied and quantified the chain of events leading to the formation of the mom beyond wentzky et al 2019 who proved the important contribution of pelagic oxygen depletion we include sediment oxygen demand in our model and attempt to put both in relation to each other for rappbode reservoir besides this focused research question we also strive to develop a template for an ecological lake model that can capture the dominant physical and biogeochemical processes in the metalimnion and predict metalimnetic dynamics 2 methods 2 1 study site rappbode reservoir is located in the eastern harz mountains and has a maximum depth of 89 m fig 1 it is the core of the rappbode system a network of 6 reservoirs used for flood protection environmental flows hydropower recreation and drinking water supply the reservoir was constructed in 1959 and it was filled to capacity by 1964 it is the largest drinking water reservoir in germany supplying drinking water to more than 1 million people mi et al 2019 it receives water from two tributaries hassel and rappbode pre reservoirs and a transfer gallery from königshütte reservoir the water of the rappbode reservoir is discharged downstream into wendefurth reservoir rinke et al 2013 the reservoir is a typical dimictic water body which stratifies in summer and winter and mixes completely in spring and autumn analysis of long term monitoring data showed that the reduced use of phosphate containing detergents strongly decreased the phosphorus concentration in the reservoir after 1991 which decreased the total phosphorus concentration during the mixing period from 0 163 mg l 1 to 0 027 mg l 1 and shifted the reservoir from a eutrophic to a mesotrophic state wentzky et al 2018 this strong decrease of phosphorus however did not reduce the phytoplankton biomass for which the annual mean biovolume was 1 164 mg l 1 based on long term measurements from 1971 to 2016 wentzky et al 2018 2 2 numerical model the two dimensional longitudinal vertical hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 hereafter w2 was selected for this study the us army corps of engineers first launched the model in 1975 and the department of civil and environmental engineering at portland state university currently maintains and updates it w2 has been successfully used in simulating hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes including the relationships between temperature nutrients algae dissolved oxygen organic matter and sediment for different water bodies worldwide chang et al 2015 chong et al 2018 chuo et al 2019 kobler et al 2018 sadeghian et al 2018 a brief description of the relevant processes in oxygen dynamics in w2 is provided below but for more detailed information about the model readers are referred to the user manual cole and wells 2006 and an active user forum https w2forum cee pdx edu in our study the hydrodynamic water level and water temperature and water quality two algae groups nutrients and dissolved oxygen modules were used oxygen is produced by photosynthesis of the two phytoplankton groups whose photosynthetic rates depend on available light and nutrients phosphate nitrate ammonium for both groups silicate only for diatoms vertical light attenuation follows lambert beers law and includes algal self shading i e the overall light extinction coefficient is calculated by a background extinction coefficient plus the specific absorption cross section of the two phytoplankton groups multiplied by their respective biomasses oxygen consumption in the model depends on phytoplankton respiration decaying dissolved and particulate organic matter which are imported by inflows and produced through phytoplankton mortality through nitrification of ammonia and through sediment consumption the decay of organic matter is also linked to regeneration of nutrients to account for sediment oxygen consumption and anoxic sediment release of phosphate and ammonium a zero order sediment compartment was included in the model as has been reported in recent studies with a similar topic brito et al 2018 chong et al 2018 terry et al 2017 since the 2 d model is discretized into grid cells in the longitudinal and vertical directions each grid cell is homogeneous in the lateral direction and contains a sediment surface and a water volume in accordance with the bathymetry of the reservoir accordingly in each 2d grid cell sediment oxygen consumption plays a role to some extent and the model explicitly accounts for oxygen consumption from both littoral and profundal sediments in view of the research objective and limitation of observational data other compartments like zooplankton epiphyton or macrophytes were not included in the model in this study the latest version of w2 v4 1 was used to simulate rappbode reservoir w2 is suited for the reservoir because of its long narrow and deep shape for which the lateral gradients in both hydrodynamic and water quality variables can be neglected see fig 1 the computational grid was built based on the hypsographic data provided by the reservoir authority talsperrenbetrieb sachsen anhalt the bathymetry input file contains four branches including two branches for side arms so that the physical structure of the reservoir could be well represented by the model domain fig s1 in total the reservoir was split into 106 segments along the longitudinal direction the horizontal grid spacing ranged from 100 m to 400 m in the longitudinal direction and 5 m 700 m in the lateral direction whereas the vertical grid spacing was always 1 m overall the full spatial model domain consisted of 3976 model cells the grid based elevation volume relationship matched well with the observed bathymetry 2 3 model setup and input data the boundary conditions for running w2 include time series of meteorological input inflow including discharge water temperature nutrients and outflow discharge the meteorological input data include wind speed air temperature wind direction shortwave radiation cloud cover fraction and dew point temperature the first four items were obtained from a monitoring buoy installed in the central part of the rappbode reservoir see rinke et al 2013 high frequency observations every 10 min were averaged to hourly values for driving the model the very few missing values were filled by measurements from a nearby monitoring station at the rappbode pre reservoir friese et al 2014 rinke et al 2013 cloud cover fraction data were taken from the harzgerode station of the german weather service 15 km away from the research area dew point temperatures were calculated from relative humidity and air temperature by the following equation bolton 1980 1 t d p λ ln r h 100 β t λ t β ln r h 100 β t λ t where t dp is the dew point temperature in c rh is the relative humidity in t is the air temperature in c and λ 237 7 c and β 17 27 are constants the daily inflow and outflow discharges were provided by the reservoir authority of the state of saxony anhalt talsperrenbetrieb sachsen anhalt inflow water temperatures were drawn from a ysi 6200 probe at the pre reservoirs and königshütte reservoir see rinke et al 2013 inflow nutrients nitrate ammonia orthophosphate silicate were measured at biweekly resolution by continuous flow photometry cfa skalar the netherlands at the upstream stations of the rappbode reservoir friese et al 2014 the minimum time step for the simulation was set to 1 s as recommended to keep numerical stability the output frequency of the simulation was 1 h to enable sub daily changes of hydrodynamic and water quality variables initial conditions water level water temperature nutrients algal and oxygen concentration for starting the simulation were taken from measurements conducted at the deepest point of the reservoir see wentzky et al 2018 since the simulation started during deep recirculation in winter a single vertical profile was used to initialize all horizontal segments 2 4 model calibration the model was run and calibrated from january 19th to december 31st in 2016 this period was selected because this year showed a clear metalimnetic oxygen minimum which was covered by high quality observational data for both stratification and water quality the field data used for calibration were measured close to the dam wall same location as for initial conditions including 1 daily water level provided by the reservoir authority 2 biweekly profiles of water temperature and dissolved oxygen measured by a hydrolab ds5 probe 3 biweekly profiles of nutrient concentration nitrate and silicate measured by accredited methods following german standards see wentzky et al 2018 4 biweekly profiles of algae concentration p rubescens and diatoms detected by a multi channel fluorescence probe fluoroprobe bbe moldaenke gmbh we separately determined the plankton composition by microscopic counts for more information about differentiating algal groups from the fluorescence probe see wentzky et al 2019 we did not calibrate ammonia or orthophosphate in the study since most measurements in 2016 were below the detection limit 0 01 mg l 1 for ammonia 0 003 mg l 1 for orthophosphate model adjustment and calibration was realized in three steps more details of the underlying procedures are given in the si step 1 water budget deviations in the water budget could always be attributed to inaccurate input data of bathymetry inflow and outflow discharge we closed the water budget by incorporating a distributed tributary as it was recommended in the manual of w2 a graphical illustration of this distributed inflow is given in fig s2 step 2 water temperatures we only calibrated the wind sheltering coefficient by minimizing rmse see table s1 in the si for further details and intentionally left all other internal hydrodynamics parameters unchanged because they have a solid empirical basis mi et al 2018 note that the background extinction coefficient was not calibrated but determined based on in situ measurements we set its value close to the minimum extinction coefficient that was observed in 2016 according to measurements of photosynthetically available radiation with two spherical licor li 193sa light sensors 0 45 m 1 see supplementary fig s4 step 3 water quality model we intentionally did not rely on computational optimization algorithms to parameterize the model in our experience such algorithms can produce a good model fit but can lead to over optimized parameterizations with low transferability to other systems biased results outside the optimized state space and less explanatory power for systems analysis fenocchi et al 2019 for instance we initially used a semi automated optimization procedure which yielded a low model error for oxygen and good spatial and temporal representation of the mom and chlorophyll concentration of diatoms and p rubescens however this was based on biologically unrealistic parameter combinations including very low pigment content and very high phosphorus affinity of p rubescens compared to diatoms combined with a low sediment oxygen demand in our experience as many parameters as possible should be determined a priori by expert knowledge and empirical evidence in order to incorporate ecological understanding of the important processes this produces a more robust transferable model even at the expense of a slightly higher model error the following empirical observations provided guidance for the specification of the ecological model i a strong growth of diatoms in the epilimnion after the onset of stratification ii subsequent full depletion of phosphate in the epilimnion and sedimentation of diatoms iii appearance and growth of p rubescens in the metalimnion and iv intense oxygen depletion in the metalimnion coinciding with the disappearance of p rubescens based on the different ecological niches that spring diatoms and p rubescens occupied in rappbode reservoir we parameterized spring diatoms as r strategists with high maximum growth rates and moderate light requirements whereas we characterized p rubescens as a k strategist with slow growth rate low mortality rate due to grazing resistance and an adaptation to low light and cold regimes posch et al 2012 walsby and jüttner 2006 by combination of literature values ecological expert knowledge and evaluation of historical data from rappbode reservoir we were able to a priori determine all parameters of the ecological model except the four key parameters ag 1 ag 2 asat 1 and asat 2 see table 1 which describe light dependent growth of both algal groups and required calibration the details of this calibration procedure as well as the description of the a priori parameterization are outlined in the si since the formation of a mom was sensitive to sediment oxygen demand sod we independently estimated sod in the hypolimnion from measured oxygen profiles using the model of livingstone and imboden 1996 see supplementary information and fig s5 for details the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to measure model performance these coefficients are widely used to evaluate model performance carraro et al 2012 mi et al 2018 we used packages tidyr metrics and hydrogof in r version 3 4 3 to organize simulation output data and for calculating rmse and nse 2 5 sensitivity analysis and model robustness we performed a local sensitivity analysis one by one parameter of the ecological model by changing each parameter value p in table 1 by 5 and 10 and calculated specific sensitivity coefficients ssc see rangel peraza et al 2016 for the minimum oxygen concentrations in the mom do min as s s c d o m i n m o d d o m i n r e f d o m i n r e f p m o d p r e f p r e f here the indices ref and mod stand for reference and modified parameter settings respectively after evaluating the four parameter changes for each parameter we averaged the ssc values in order to achieve an average sensitivity result at the local vicinity of each parameter value we defined do min as the global minimum do concentration in the top 35m of the reservoir the three parameters at1 ahssi 1 and sodk2 were not included because at1 for diatoms and ahssi 1 were 0 and it makes no sense to change them on a percentage scale and sodk2 in the reference simulation is 0 99 which is not allowed to be higher than 1 we used the same set of simulations for a robustness assessment and evaluated the characteristics of the mom under the various parameter perturbations in order to analyze the robustness of the mom phenomenon with respect to our parameterization for each simulation we analysed the value of do min 35m the depth of do min 35m as well as the difference in do concentration between the minimum and 8 m below and above taken at the day in which the minimum occurs 2 6 model system analysis we used the calibrated model to investigate the contributions of pelagic p rubescens and diatoms and benthic processes sod to the formation of the mom by hierarchical model experiments where different processes were turned off and compared to the reference simulation scenario a obtained with the calibrated model we firstly switched off only the module of p rubescens scenario b and then only the diatoms scenario c respectively to quantify the contribution of these two algal groups to the mom subsequently we switched off both algal modules simultaneously scenario d to check the total influence of pelagic processes on the mom in order to test the contribution of benthic processes to mom formation we turned off the sod module and left both algal groups active scenario e finally as a control treatment we run the model without algae and without sod 3 results 3 1 model performance and goodness of fit the parameters used in the calibrated model are shown in table 1 an additional distributed inflow with a small discharge yearly mean value of 0 05 m3 s 1 was incorporated into the simulation in order to close the water budget the simulated water level agreed well with the observations rmse 0 03 m r2 0 99 nse 0 99 see fig s3 the simulated water temperatures were also in excellent agreement with the measurements rmse 0 45 c r2 0 99 nse 0 99 fig 2 including the dynamics in thermocline depth indicating an accurate reproduction of the hydrodynamic processes in the reservoir the simulated timing of stratification onset and autumnal mixing also agreed well with the observed data fig 2 the model adequately captured the dynamics of the two algal groups see fig 3 the r2 values for both p rubescens and diatoms were above 0 5 table 2 and the model well reproduced the spring diatom bloom as well as the autumnal metalimnetic bloom of p rubescens see fig 3 although the model slightly underestimated the maximum concentration of p rubescens in summer it accurately captured the timing of the p rubescens bloom day 200 250 its vertical localization as well as the gradual decline of the bloom from late august due to decreasing irradiance the model satisfactorily captured the peak concentration 6 5 μg l 1 given as chlorophyll a of diatoms during spring but slightly underestimated the deep water concentrations in winter and spring the model also correctly predicted the nutrient concentrations table 2 figs 4 and 5 with better performance for silicate r2 0 84 than for nitrate r2 0 69 because of thermal stratification and strong depletion in the illuminated surface layers the observed nutrient concentrations were always higher in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion and the model reproduced this pattern the simulated nitrate concentrations were slightly but systematically lower than measurements resulting in a low value for nse although the vertical gradients were well reproduced fig 4 the modeled silicate concentrations at the surface from late summer to early winter were slightly higher than the measurements fig 5 the model accurately captured the observed oxygen dynamics r2 0 84 particularly the spatial and temporal extent of the mom in the sampling location figs 6 and 7 in accordance with the measurements the formation of the mom started at the end of july and the concentration decreased gradually to its lowest value in mid september both the modeled and observed oxygen concentrations showed that the oxygen minimum began to diminish in early october and totally disappeared in november under conditions of weakening stratification and intensifying mixing in conclusion goodness of fit estimates showed an excellent performance of w2 in rappbode reservoir with very precise predictions for the physical variables water level and temperature high accuracy for chemical variables oxygen and nutrients and also good accuracy for biological state variables diatoms and p rubescens these high model skills enable us to use the model for a process oriented systems analysis 3 2 sensitivity analysis and model robustness the analysis of parameter sensitivity identified a few highly sensitive parameters with respect to the minimum oxygen concentration within the mom which are either involved in diatom dynamics sediment oxygen demand or p rubescens dynamics see table 1 interestingly these most sensitive parameters were not centered around a specific state variable e g p rubescence but refer to pelagic as well as benthic components indicating that both pelagic and benthic processes can have a strong effect on the minimum oxygen concentration of the mom the phenomenon of mom appeared highly robust against the parameterization as perturbations of the parameters never produced oxygen dynamics without a mom the minimum concentration the depth location is varying slightly with parameter changes see si for a detailed description but the patterns of vertical do gradients remained similar the minimum oxygen concentration from the calibrated model for example was at 5 mg l 1 and in all simulations with perturbed parameters this value remained in the range of 4 3 5 7 mg l 1 fig s6 3 3 mechanistic understanding of mom formation the separate effect of pelagic p rubescens and diatoms and benthic processes sod on the metalimnetic do concentration is illustrated in fig 8 in the absence of p rubescens scenario b the diatom concentration in the metalimnion depth of 10 m during the summer day 180 250 increased slightly from 1 26 mg l 1 in the reference scenario a to 1 83 mg l 1 notably the mom was more pronounced in scenario b with an average do concentration of 6 28 mg l 1 in the autumn mom layer taken as the water layer between 10 and 20 m and from day 240 300 which was lower than the 6 75 mg l 1 in the reference simulation in scenario c the simulation without diatoms p rubescens bloomed one month earlier at the end of june than in the reference simulation at the end of july the metalimnetic algal concentration reached 20 μg l 1 in scenario c which was twice as high as in the reference simulation this in turn produced a local metalimnetic oxygen maximum in early summer that reached a concentration up to 14 mg l 1 although a weak mom was still present in scenario c from day 250 onwards the average do concentration in the autumn mom layer was 8 31 mg l 1 which was much higher than in the reference simulation 6 75 mg l 1 additionally the hypolimnetic do concentrations were higher in scenario c than in the reference simulation scenario c demonstrates that the presence of p rubescens postpones and weakens the mom because during the growth phase a net oxygen production occurs within the metalimnion and no oxygen consumption from diatom derived biomass reference scenario is taking place the most remarkable result from scenario d was that the mom was still present despite the absence of both diatoms and p rubescens with essentially no organic matter production in the water column the oxygen in the metalimnion in this scenario is consumed solely by the sediment resulting in a mom with an average do concentration of 8 52 mg l 1 oxygen depletion from metalimnetic sediments is higher than that from the deeper hypolimnetic sediments because of higher temperature at this depth compared to deeper layers this conclusion is further confirmed by the results in scenario e in which only the sod was turned off while the algae were still present this scenario clearly showed that only the activities from the two algal groups cannot trigger the mom finally the mom also disappeared completely in our control scenario f i e when all the pelagic processes were removed and sod was set to 0 in this case the do distribution in the water column was solely driven by temperature dependent oxygen solubility at the different depths and atmospheric equilibrium within the epilimnion in order to quantify the contributions from the different processes at play in the formation of the mom we extracted the oxygen production rates from photosynthesis and the consumption rates from organic matter decay and sediment oxygen demand out of the reference simulation oxygen production by photosynthesis reached 0 2 mg l 1 day 1 in the surface layer during the spring diatom bloom which began at the time of stratification onset around day 100 fig 9 a after the spring bloom diatoms continued to produce oxygen in the metalimnion at a lower rate between day 150 and 200 p rubescens replaced diatoms in the metalimnion the oxygen production rate was then lower than in spring and reached values around 0 1 mg l 1 day 1 the do consumption through decomposition of pelagic organic material derived from dead algae was high in spring in the surface layers day 100 160 fig 9b with maximum values of 0 08 mg l 1 day 1 afterwards do consumption remained relatively high in the metalimnion for another 2 months after day 220 do consumption by organic matter decreased in the metalimnion with an average rate of 0 009 mg l 1 day 1 in autumn within the mom layer the sediment consumed a large amount of oxygen in the bottom layers fig 9c due to the high ratio of sediment area to water volume given the strong temperature dependence of sediment oxygen consumption rate sediment oxygen consumption was also high in the warmer layers of the epilimnion and metalimnion fig 9c the average oxygen consumption rate in the autumn mom layer caused by sod was 0 015 mg l 1 day 1 taken together all the different oxygen production and consumption terms fig 9d about 60 of the total simulated consumption rate in the autumn mom layer i e 0 024 mg l 1 day 1 originated from benthic processes while the remaining 40 originated from pelagic mineralization of dead algal biomass in conclusion the mom is formed by both pelagic and benthic do depletion p rubescens delivers large parts of the pelagic organic matter that fuels pelagic do consumption but it also produces oxygen during the growth phase and therefore effectively postpones the mom formation 4 discussion in this study we used a well developed water quality model to identify and analyze the drivers of mom formation on the one hand our research confirms the previous conclusion from wentzky et al 2019 that the occurrence of p rubescens delivers an important contribution for the formation of the mom on the other hand this study also shows that the process chain is more complex and sod also significantly contributes to the phenomenon our study is innovative because we employed an ecosystem model not only to reproduce observations and quantitative patterns but also to identify and quantify processes and test hypotheses in a series of simulation experiments our model system combines the major physical e g vertical transport and thermodynamics biogeochemical e g nutrient and oxygen dynamics and ecological e g algal community dynamics resource limitation features of this complex ecosystem the simulation results were in good agreement with measurements for all variables and the rmse for the water temperature was lower than that obtained in other recent studies chong et al 2018 lee et al 2018 park et al 2018 based on a meta analysis of the performance of different water quality models by arhonditsis and brett 2004 the simulation accuracy of water temperature in this study can be regarded as top level furthermore the model accurately reproduced the dynamics of nutrients two main algal groups in the reservoir diatoms and p rubescens and dissolved oxygen particularly the temporal and spatial extent of the mom see figs 3 7 the r2 of 0 84 for oxygen is much higher than the median value of 0 70 calculated from 569 oxygen modelling studies shown in arhonditsis and brett 2004 using a 1d physical biological coupled model joehnk and umlauf 2001 and antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 also captured the mom in lake ammer and lake vegoritis respectively however these models only considered total chlorophyll a rather than the dynamics of different phytoplankton groups as suggested by joehnk and umlauf 2001 merely simulating the chlorophyll a is too general and accounting for specific algal properties can improve the accuracy of model simulations our work substantiates this statement as the ecological features of the different algal groups in our model play an important role in the mom formation however although our model is far more detailed than previous approaches we were also forced to apply simplications in terms of process formulations and state variables zooplankton grazing for example is only indirectly represented by algae mortality and bacterial respiration is integrated into degradation of organic matter the diverse phytoplankton community is reduced to two functional groups diatoms p rubescens which largely represent the photoautotrophic organisms but not mixotrophs which occur during late summer in rappbode reservoir to the best of our knowledge however this work is the first modelling research which systematically elucidates the mechanisms that trigger moms in inland waters in a process chain including biogeochemical and ecological dynamics a detailed evaluation of the model with respect to sensitivity and robostness corroborated with the findings from our simulation experiments in the respect that parameters for algal dynamics as well as sediment related parameters were highly sensitive this implies that both pelagic and benthic processes have a large influence on the mom our model findings were also robust against the parameterization the phenomenon of a mom was formed under all parameter perturbations and can be classified as a very robust feature of the rappbode reservoir model we interpret this outcome as an indicator that our conclusions are valid over a broad range of parametter values 4 1 processes driving formation of a metalimnetic oxygen minimum our results identify a chain of events leading to the formation of the mom that is more complex than the mechanism described in wentzky et al 2019 comparing scenario a and b see fig 8 showed that diatoms also contributed to the formation of mom since sinking organic matter originating from dead diatoms consumed do in the metalimnion in the reference simulation however this do consumption was not visible because the growing p rubescens replaced the dying diatoms and the do that p rubescens produced was utilized to break down the diatom biomass therefore do remained rather constant during this time although the turnover was high in the absence of diatoms in scenario c the earlier onset of p rubescens therefore triggered a metalimnetic oxygen maximum in late spring and delayed and decreased mom formation although decomposition of organic material from dead p rubescens ultimately transformed the metalimnetic oxygen maximum into a minimum moreover when p rubescens was excluded from the simulation in scenario b the mom formed earlier and attained a lower do concentration because organic matter degradation from diatoms and sod consumed oxygen from day 150 onwards in fact the occurrence of p rubescens delayed and slightly weakened the mom although its biomass ultimately induced the mom additonally a weak but clear oxygen minimum still formed in the metalimnion in scenario d which did not contain any algae fig 8 but sod as the sole do sink in order to assure that the value of sod in our model is within a reasonable empirical range we extracted sod values from other water bodies from literature si table s2 it turned out that our value of 3 go2 m 2 d 1 is a typical value that can also be found in other water bodies this indicates that benthic oxygen conspumtion can significantly influence metalimnetic oxygen dynamics in other lakes or reservoirs shapiro 1960 identified three factors that might lead to the formation of a mom 1 inflow with low oxygen content 2 in situ biological and chemical processes 3 sediment consumption in rappbode reservoir the first factor could be excluded since oxygen from the inflows was always saturated also the mom was captured at depths between 11 m and 13 m in front of the dam as illustrated in fig s7 during the period of the mom formation the inflows were much warmer than water at 11 m depth even during nocturnal cooling events in exceptionally cold summer nights only in mid october i e at the time of mom erosion inflow temperatures approached metalimnetic temperatures also high loads of sediments as an alternative process for deep inflow intrusions can be ruled out because almost all of the sediments from the inflow are efficiently retained in the upstream pre dams additionally the total inflow discharge during the occurrence of the mom i e from day 240 300 was very low always lower than 0 5 m3 s 1 see fig s8 in conclusion any influence of inflows on mom formation can be ruled out the remaining two factors from shapiro 1960 in situ biological chemical processes and sod appeared to contribute to the mom formation in rappbode reservoir as shown by our scenario analysis we further extracted and compared the simulated oxygen profiles at shallower sections in the reservoir at the same time of 2016 10th september as the measurements in 2015 from wentzky et al 2019 see fig s9 although we do not have the corresponding measured oxygen profiles in 2016 based on our knowledge of the reservoir the principal oxygen distribution patterns were similar in 2015 and 2016 and the oxygen patterns should be comparable we found that horizontal variablility of the simulated mom in 2016 was a little larger than that of the measurements in 2015 see their fig 3 this may be a sign that our model did not completely capture the contribution of benthic and pelagic oxygen depletion along the longitudinal axis the morphometry of rappbode reservoir is characterised by steep slopes that do not allow the formation of sustained sediment layers at many places we therefore speculate that the sod in the canyon shaped upstream parts is lower than that in the central basin where plankton growth and sedimentation of organic material is much higher hence we may have slightly overestimated the contribution of sod to the formation of the mom at these upstream sites however this should not change our conclusion that the sod plays an important role in the mom development besides these biogeochemical drivers the physical environment is decisive for the persistence of a mom the metalimnion is a region with low vertical mixing due to strong density gradients and this mixing refuge prevents the mom from being refilled with oxygen from above or below dong et al 2019 this low mixing refuge is clearly evident in the rappbode reservoir and a commmon feature of stably stratified lakes and reservoirs boehrer and schultze 2008 4 2 the role of temperature we believe that the oxygen uptake by the sediment contributes to the mom in the rappbode reservoir water temperature alone can change the sod rate by a factor of 10 within the range of 4 30 c pace and prairie 2005 which is in accordance with our calibrated sod temperature rate multipliers see table 1 the sediment oxygen consumption rate is therefore highly sensitive to water temperature terry et al 2017 in rappbode reservoir water temperature below 20 m depth is below 6 c the whole year round fig s10 the low water temperatures in these layers decrease oxygen consumption from the sediment in contrast the temperature in the upper 15 m e g metalimnion and epilimnion is always above 10 c in summer which leads to a relatively high sediment oxygen demand in the epilimnion atmospheric exchange can offset the sediment uptake in the metalimnion i e 10 m 15 m depth however the low vertical diffusivity caused by intense stratification strongly inhibits any flux of oxygen from above or below therefore the high sod rate which results from the warm temperature combined with the disconnection from the atmosphere is a significant factor causing the mom in the reservoir higher temperatures also significantly enhance algal biomass decay rates conover et al 2016 england et al 2015 concluded that compared to the beginning of the 21st century the global mean temperature at the end of the century will increase by nearly 5 c under high greenhouse gas emissions also surface water temperatures have increased globally by 0 34 c decade 1 in recent decades o reilly and sharma 2015 possibly higher water temperatures under strong climate warming may increase the mom in future in temperate climates this trend is further enhanced by an increasing stratification duration fang and stefan 2009 radbourne et al 2019 shatwell et al 2019 therefore further modelling scenarios should focus on how to optimize management practices e g artificial aeration different withdrawal depths to mitigate the negative influence caused by the increase in air temperatures the advanced water quality model in this study systematically explained the ecological processes related to the mom formation in rappbode reservoir we extended the findings of wentzky et al 2019 by showing that not only pelagic but also benthic processes contribute to mom formation where the strong temperature and density gradients in the metalimnion play a decisive role since moms are widespread in stratified lakes and reservoirs our model may be transferred to other systems to identify the drivers responsible for moms in different case studies a valuable next step would therefore be an application of this model in a multi lake comparison to better understand the mechanisms behind mom development at a large scale 5 conclusions in this study we used a well established water quality model ce qual w2 to illustrate the mechanism behind the formation of metalimnetic oxygen minima mom in rappbode reservoir the results showed that our model performed well in reproducing the physical e g water level and water temperature biogeochemical e g nutrient and oxygen dynamics and ecological e g algal community dynamics features of the reservoir particularly the spatial and temporal extent of the mom through a scenario analysis we found that growth of the cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens in the metalimnion postponed and weakened the mom through photosynthesis although the decomposition of its biomass ultimately induced the mom moreover the results showed that not only pelagic processes but also benthic processes e g sediment oxygen demand contributed to the formation of the mom besides these biogeochemical drivers the physical environment was demonstrated as a determinant for the persistence of a mom the high density gradient in the thermocline restricted downward transport of oxygen from surface waters yet the higher temperatures in the metalimnion relative to the hypolimnion caused locally increased oxygen consumption rates from the sediment and decaying organic matter which contributed to the formation of the mom since the global warming trend is supposed to increase the mom in future it is recommended in the further modelling scenarios to elucidate how to optimize the reservoir operation

18023,electroactive microorganisms eams can act as pseudocapacitor to store energy and discharge electrons on need while electromethanogens acting as receptor are able to utilize electrons protons and carbon dioxide for methanization however external energy is required to overcome thermodynamical barriers for electromethanogenesis herein electro driving power by solar light was established to accelerate conversion of waste organics to bioenergy the intermittent power supply modes were elucidated for favourable performances e g current density methane production rate energy recovery efficiencies and economic evaluation compared with the control driven by continuous applied voltage it was found that natural intermittent solar powered mode was more beneficial for microorganisms involved in electron transfer and energy recovery than manual sharp on off mode electrochemistry analysis unrevealed that a higher redox current and lower resistance were exhibited under the solar powered mode a high charge storage capacity and electron mobility were found through cytochrome c content and live cells ratio in the solar power assisted bioreactor the intermittent power driving modes can regulate electron transfer proteins with capacitive storage behavior in biomass which helps to understand the responses of functional communities on the stress of intermittent electric field these findings indicate a promising perspective of microbial biotechnology driven by solar power to boost bioenergy recovery from waste wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioenergy solar power intermittent electro drive capacitor cytochrome c 1 introduction energy crisis and environmental pollution are regarded to be prime inevitable issues due to rapidly global growing population and imminent developing industries the invention of new energy approaches accompanied with minimal environmental impact is critical to persistent economic growth and the maintenance of a green fit of inhabitation for human beings qian et al 2010 though bioenergy recovery from wastewater or biomass via anaerobic microbes is a widely acceptable and developed technology there are still promising potentials to promote microbial growth and biochemical reactions of microorganisms in a specific niche to some extent it has been ascertained that external energy can power microbes and microbial production lovley 2011 lovley and nevin 2013 microbial electrolysis cells mecs require a relatively low energy input 0 2 0 8 v to provoke renewable bioenergy recovery from wastewater or wastes and simultaneously dispose contaminants when coupled with anaerobic digestion ad system cai et al 2016 nonetheless the energy consumption is always evaluated through electricity input moreover the electricity delivery is restricted over long term operation in rural or remote areas zhang and angelidaki 2014 therefore renewable energy powering mecs is crucial to the widespread application katuri et al 2019 solar energy is regarded as one of the most feasible options to conform the energy demand worldwide kamat 2007 while cost effective technologies or feasible ways for solar energy storage or utilization will be critical to evade the intermittency of the solar resource jia et al 2016 lewis 2007 therefore solar powered energy as a day night intermittent power is supposed to be a limitation aspect when aiming to develop solar powered biological technologies for bioenergy or bioproducts production the application of direct electric current dc in mecs would affect cell growth and microbial metabolic behavior she et al 2006 most studies focus on the regulation of dc including voltage values ding et al 2016 electrode potential zhen et al 2015 biofilm community structure liu et al 2010 etc for example when an applied voltage of 0 8 v 3 d was applied on a two chambered cubic biofilm reactor with proton exchange membrane pem the methane production rate reached up the highest of 0 052 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d ding et al 2016 in another study cod removal rate reached maximum and was almost 1 2 fold higher than the control at applied voltage of 0 6 v in the mec coupling anaerobic membrane bioreactor system in contrast the membrane fouling rate of the system gradually slowed down with increased applied voltage ding et al 2018 it was found that hydrogen yield generally increased with increasing voltage from 0 1 to 1 0 v obtaining a maximum yield of 2 1 mol h2 mol acetate however the higher applied voltage implied higher anodic loss of electrons compared to that of cathodic loss chae et al 2008 on the aspect of functional communities it was found that the biofilm community changed in absence and presence of electrode potential while more abundant functional genes were potentially expressed at open circuit liu et al 2010 therefore these results hinted that continuous electrical energy input may provide exceeded energy over microbial metabolic activities for the redox reaction cho et al 2019 lately there have been a few studies on the intermittent mode operation in mecs it was observed that a higher and more stable phenol removal efficiency could be achieved with an intermittent dc application 1 day on 1 day off in single chambered bioelectrochemical reactors compared to continuous applied dc of 2 ma ailijiang et al 2016 hussain et al found that periodic power supply disconnection 2 sec on 2 sec off increased a long term performance of mecs hussain et al 2018 with internal resistance decrease with long term on off manipulation the intermittent voltage 60 sec on 15 sec off was also revealed to increase the overall gas production cho et al 2019 compared to the control with continuous voltage application setting anode potential of 0 2 v these results hint that intermittent power supply could extend mecs more sustainable and practicable however the intermittent impacts on electron transfer and capacitive storage behavior in biomass are not well understood especially on the limitation factors in electric field like ph gradient within biofilm and the evolution of electrode respiring bacteria erb a solar powered system is established to evaluate the efficiencies of organic conversion energy recovery and biogas yield under intermittent electro driving on off modes the influences of microbial community function on electron transfer and capacitive storage behavior involving in cytochrome c and community structure especially exoelectrogens and methanogens in biofilms will be fully investigated in differently regulated electricity fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor construction operation and sampling in mecs the methane generation pathway is contributed both through acetoclastic methanogenesis from acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis from cathodic products h2 or electrons liu et al 2016 the biofilm development of mecs is the most fundamental element to control relatively stable bioreactor performances to evaluate the influence of power supply modes on the working status of microbial communities twelve identical mec reactors were assembled and set up in the same way cai et al 2018 fig

measured using a gas chromatograph agilent 7892 usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a 1 5 m stainless steel column with nitrogen as the carrier gas 30 ml min the total amount of

performances of continuous batch operations cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were utilized to examine the biofilm electrochemical characteristics with an electrochemical workstation no chi660d chenhua instruments co ltd china ec lab v10 02 software cv tests were conducted with three electrode configuration with the work electrode as well as the counter

electrode the voltage range for the cv tests of the anode was 0 8 to 0 8 v at a scanning rate of 1 mv s and for the cathode the voltage range was from 1 2 to 0 v at the same scanning rate eis tests were conducted with two types of measurements with the operational potential in situ using the electrochemical workstation one using two electrode configuration for a whole cell and the other using a three electrode configuration with a ag agcl reference electrode for the anode and the cathode borole et al 2010 the whole cell of the eis measurement was carried out in the single chamber mec using the anode as the working electrode and the cathode as the reference and counter electrodes at the circuit voltage under an external resistance of 10 ω over the frequency range of 100 khz 0 01 hz with a 1 mv amplitude of the sinusoidal perturbation the three electrode configuration of the eis measurement was done for recording the impedance spectrum of the anode and the cathode at the same operating parameters except different set potentials depending on the potential of the anode and the cathode eis data was reported as nyquist plots and further fitted with equivalent circuit model ecm containing different impendence at two time constant model rs rctq1 rdq2 for the individual electrode the impendence of each anode and cathode electrode comprised the same ecm including the ohmic resistance rs the charge transfer resistance activation resistance rct and the finite diffusion resistance rd respectively fig s2a hence combined the ecms of the anode and cathode in series the impedance spectrum for the whole cell was obtained which was comprised of a parallel resistor rct or rd and a double layer capacitance or the constant phase angle elements q1 or o2 and rs fig s2b 2 3

methane production all reactors were operated over twelve months after inoculation and methane generation determined over ten month batch cycles when stable performances were achieved an anode potential via ag agcl reference electrode of below 200 mv indicated a successful inoculation and start up wang et al 2010 which was also considered that the electroactive biofilm was formed liu et al 2012 for each fed batch cycle once the electric current in the circuit was higher than 1 ma the mec reactor was regarded to be successfully started and recorded as startup time the parameters emphasis on the performances of mecs were shown in table 1 electric current is an important indicator of the rate at which electrons are transferred from the electrode to methanogens to reduce carbon dioxide to methane the variations in current for three driving force reactors were presented with respect to time fig 1 the maximum current of group b reactors solar energy was 12 17 ma with the volumetric current of 81 13 a m3 based on volume and the current density observed to be 17 39 a m2 based on cathode surface area which was followed by group a intermittent power on 8 31 ma 55 40 a m3 11 87 a m2 and group c no power off 5 55 ma 37 00 a m3 7 93 a m2 respectively it was noticeably observed that a sudden great current would rise rapidly to a maximum value and then immediately maintain a stable value once power supply of group a was manually cut and reconnected fig 1 this phenomenon has been also observed in the result of hussain et al 2018 which might be due to critical internal capacitance of the electroactive biofilm deeke et al 2013 houghton et al 2016 while in group b there was a gradual increase when the solar cell began to receive the sunlight the current slowly stretched to the maximum value compared to group a fig 1 therefore the driving force modes of group a and group b were different which could make a difference in the microbial system development under two intermittent modes as a result of the whole system cod removal efficiency showed a small difference that is group b achieved the maximum 96 08 followed by group a of 95 49 and group c of 93 86 accordingly importantly the further evaluated methane yield indicated that more electrons could flow from acetate to final products under the solar powered mode compared to the sudden switch on off mode the coulombs recovered in the end products and the relative coulombic efficiencies were further estimated the ce of group c attained the highest 91 47 followed by group a 77 37 and group b 51 13 respectively the ce for the intermittent driving modes was lower especially the solar powered mode because the substrate was not converted to electrons but to other organic molecules or was used for the growth of the microorganisms hamelers et al 2010 it is evident that electroactive microorganisms eams worked for the part time 12 h per day in group a and b compared to group c 24 h per day therefore the growth and acetate oxidation by electroactive bacteria are limiting as observed in low ce in intermittent modes compared to group a of the immediate power off mode solar powered group b had a pretty shorter time on its peak current but high peak value with the same steady applied voltage when the power was cut off namely discharge an excess of electrons stored in eams which can allow cells to maintain a certain metabolic activity and this process of accumulating superabundant electrons was also referred to charge at open circuit potential ocp alves et al 2016 bonanni et al 2012 esteve nunez et al 2008 schrott et al 2011 uria et al 2011 once eams were fully charged with electrons that is eams were repolarized the residual stored electrons would be immediately released as an abnormal transient current bonanni et al 2012 this process of releasing surplus electrons was also defined as discharge for readability bonanni et al 2012 and eams behaved like the pseudocapacitive viz a faradaic process distinguishing inherently in a double layer capacitance ren et al 2015 however it was not adequately understood on the principle reason that the further discrepancy occurred by group b responses compared to the situation of group a according to the consumed cod the theoretical ch4 yields were 0 0727 0 0798 and 0 0889 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d for group a b and c respectively when acetate was stoichiometrically converted to methane 1 mol ch4 mol acetate however group b attained the maximum y c h 4 of 0 0681 0 0007 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d accounting for 85 yield from consumed acetate and then group a with 0 0564 0 0009 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d 78 yield whereas the lowest y c h 4 of 0 0546 0 0010 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d was yielded in the control 61 yield the methane generation primarily consists of two parts one is based on the current the other is based on the substrate conversion depending on different intermittent power supplies the t v c h 4 c u r r e n t in group b was lower 0 0396 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d than in group a 0 0543 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d but t v c h 4 c u r r e n t of intermittent groups were lower than the actual y c h 4 indicating a substantial part of methane contribution from metabolic pathway without external power methane and hydrogen were both detected in group c with continuous applied voltage as a part of cathodic reclamined hydrogen collected into gas bag before metabolic utilization fig s3 more hydrogen was measured in group c which might be the interpretation that t v c h 4 c u r r e n t of group c was higher than y c h 4 beyond all doubt all the t v c h 4 a c e t a t e of group a b and c were higher than the actual y c h 4 which was due to all methane produced originating from the acetate oxidation according to the mass balance on the other hand a steady increase in methane production was observed due to the overpowering during the cut off period in group b fig s4 the rebounded production occurred repeatedly from power on time to cut off time which may reflect the competition between electrode respiring bacteria and acetotrophic methanogens on the substrate acetate liu et al 2018 it hinted that their growth balance substantially benefited the final methane yield in the whole system of intermittent modes compared to continuous power supplied mode furthermore it was detected that in the period of the power off cut off power indicated two means one was an artificial power outage the other was no sunlight carbon dioxide concentrations of the reactors in group a and b were lower than group c data not shown it was reasonable that electrode respiring bacteria worked for the part time 12 h in group a and b compared to group c 24 h leading to a slow acetate consumption rate as well as low ce in the intermittent modes compared to group c however a lower co2 concentration of biogas in the intermittent modes further connected to ph status in the solution the ph was tested during power cut phase showing accumulated protons with the ph of 6 89 0 01 6 83 0 02 7 08 0 04 in group a b c respectively it has been investigated that proton concentration is a limiting factor for electron transfer of electrode biofilm cai et al 2019 lusk et al 2018 and co2 concentration is also important to bioelectrochemical hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis cai et al 2018 the current density was significantly related in presence of a weak acid solution daniele et al 1996 chen et al found that when the cathode solution was pre sparged with co2 compared to pre sparging with n2 the current density was substantially increased with biofilm or without biofilm on the pt catalyzed electrode resulting from the h donating in a weak acid cheng et al 2009 in this aspect the function of the on and off applied voltage made a storage and utilization of accumulation protons and carbon dioxide in the system this mitigated fast substrate consumption inside the exoelectrogenic biofilm under the applied voltage resulting in a relatively high current peak after power supplied again to drive electron transfer feng et al 2018 in another aspect under no power off mode the continuous h2 produced by the cathode made a variety of mixture of hydrogen and methane to some extent however the extensive h2 could further support more side reactions by microorganisms attached to the electrodes leading to other various by products generated in the system lee et al 2009 sangeetha et al 2017 3 1 2 input energy recovery efficiency and economic assessment the introduction of three driving force modes on mecs has caused the methane production change to evaluate the efficiency of input energy recovery the cost of materials and equipment was not considered in economic analysis neither the cost of solar energy supply system in this present study apparently the intermittent power supplies group a and b have much less energy invested compared with the control group c group b can be considered as no cost energy input acetate conversion efficiency in group a and b were 69 84 and 85 23 respectively whereas acetate conversion efficiency in the control was 57 31 other performance indexes the recovery efficiencies of methane electrical energy and substrate energy exhibited a similar tendency as with the methane production rate indicating a profitable way for biogas yield and upgrading under intermittent power supplies when concerning the more specific economic revenue from the main product methane the increase of methane revenues of group a b were 0 0218 0 0263 m3 reactor d respectively compared with the control group c 0 0211 m3 reactor d both two types of intermittent electric fields can obtain more benefits especially solar powered supply which almost was 1 25 fold higher than that of group c and 1 21 fold higher than that of group a therefore the intermittent power supplies not only promote methane recovery but also reduce energy input thereby increasing economic benefit 3 2 effects of driving force modes on electrochemical properties of biofilms cyclic voltammetry cv is generally used to analyze the electrochemical activity and redox potential of the mature biofilm the cv profiles of group a b anodes and cathodes showed much higher redox current density normalized to the surface area of the anodes and cathodes especially group b than that of the control demonstrating that the electron transfer capability of mec reactors with the intermittent power supplies was greatly improved and faster reactions happened at the electrodes fig 2 a and b the first derivative curves dcvs of cyclic voltammetry current for the anodes were further analyzed which can reflect the change of current with the anode potential in dcvs of the anodes group b exhibited the broadest active peak peak width at peak and the highest peak and the activity range of anode potential covered from 0 50 v to 0 2 v fig s5a as with the cv test the control group c also performed the lowest in dcvs the high redox current density of the cvs and the high peak of the dcvs mean the high electron output capability of anodic microorganisms furthermore the wider active peak in the dcv indicated that anodic microorganisms can derivate electrons over a larger range of anode potentials therefore the results of both cvs and dcvs indicated that the bioelectrochemical activity of the anodic biofilm in group b was the highest followed by the biofilm of group a and the biofilm of group c was the lowest these results indicated that eams could perform higher activities on electron transfer under the solar powered mode than the sudden cut off mode though the higher the peak current density the more the generation of methane cheng et al 2009 furthermore a comprehensive positive effect occurred in the pathway of the discharge utilization in the view of electron balance higher conversion efficiency from acetate to methane was also contributed by the undetected electrons involved between electroactive bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens when external voltage disappeared the reason for the highest yield of methane in group b was further demonstrated eis was used to measure the components of the internal resistances of mecs activated losses ohmic losses and mass transfer losses are three main sources of electrode potential losses yin et al 2013 in general the first intersection of the nyquist plot of the whole cells and the x axis represents the ohmic resistance and the projected point of the intersection of the nyquist plot and x axis farthest from the origin is representative of the total impedance which is the same with the results of fitting the data with an equivalent circuit fig s2b both resistances of the anodes and cathodes were exhibited significant divergence as shown in figs s5b e group a and b brought a dramatic decrease of the impedances for the anodes and cathodes consequently for the whole cells as shown in fig 2c the total impedance of group b was 42 68 ω that nearly 1 14 times lower than that of group a 48 64 ω and 3 04 times lower than that of group c 129 74 ω it was further found that there was a dramatical difference of rd among three groups suggesting that transport limitation played the vital role in the performance of mecs with diverse driving power modes fig 2d 3 3 effects of driving force modes on biomass and viability of biofilms atp plays a vital role in the material and energy cycle which is used to provide energy for the metabolism of microorganisms and can reflect microbial growth and metabolism as an important energy storage in microorganisms ding et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 a the atp of the anodes in group a and b was 2 08 and 4 72 times higher than that in group c t test p 0 022 0 001 0 05 similarly the atp of the cathodes in group a and b was slightly 2 81 and 3 46 times higher than that in the control group p 0 036 0 011 0 05 higher cell activities have been triggered under the solar powered mode which was 2 23 times higher than group a on the anode atp detection and 1 23 times higher than group a of the cathode atp the amount of biofilm biomass was further quantified based on the total protein contents fig 3a and protein patterns fig s6 group b obtained the maximum protein contents which were 1 78 anode 1 91 cathode fold than these in the control p 1 418 10 5 1 441 10 5 0 01 followed by group a which were 1 43 anode 1 60 cathode fold than these in group c p 0 009 0 010 0 05 these results demonstrated that biofilms of reactors driven by intermittent power modes grew better than that of the continuous applied voltage mode resulting in high electron storage and transfer as well as ultimate methane production enhancement and solar powered group b grew the best p 0 05 furthermore the total amount of c type cytochromes can be directly related to electron transfer by eams normalized to the biomass protein content of the anodes and cathodes were the highest in group b which were 1 16 fold anode 1 24 fold cathode of group a and 1 45 fold anode 1 84 fold cathode of group c respectively fig 3b these results elucidated c type cytochrome expression could be significantly changed by switch off and on modes especially the solar powered mode performed more beneficial the c type cytochromes are responsible for charge storage in electrode biofilms malvankar et al 2012 most of these c type cytochromes possess more than one heme containing group methé et al 2003 in which c type cytochrome omcz was identified the essential function to optimal current production inoue et al 2011 but generally the observed large enhancement of capacitance in bioelectrochemical biofilms can be attributed to the charge storage ability of all detected c type cytochromes malvankar et al 2011 recently it was also mentioned a positive increase of c type cytochromes of detected electrode biomass when giving appropriate periodic polarizations zhang et al 2018 supporting that c type cytochromes can adapt to an enrichment strategy compared to the situation of continuous polarization in the previous case a potential enrichment of cytochrome c functional genes was also detected in open circuit with low electron transfer status compared to closed circuit with continuous electron transfer liu et al 2010 it hinted that an intermittent driving power can upregulate the synthesis of heme containing redox proteins in addition the protein patterns observed from different biofilms of three group reactors were similar suggesting that the intermittent driving power modes did not modify the nature of the c type cytochromes fig s6 though biofilm viability were not substantially changed by different modes the intermittent driven force modes improved the viability of microbial structure with abilities of electron transfer and methane production fig 3c fig s7 the ratios of live cells to total cells of the anode and the cathode in group c were 46 6 2 and 54 4 8 respectively fig 3d intermittent driven power supply into the electrodes enhanced the ratios of live cells to total cells of mature anode and cathode biofilm to 57 4 6 53 3 6 group a and 63 5 8 60 4 2 group b respectively solar powered mode will more benefit biofilm activities with respect to restored cytochrome expression compared to a sharp on off mode the microbial activities were also impacted by limited factors including ph change which was determined by proton consumption rate with a continuous stress or intermittent stress appropriate biofilm thickness and integrity imply the activity of bacteria which can increase the resistibility of microorganisms to harsh environments such as physical and chemical stresses limited nutrient availability and exchange toxic substances outside biofilm long term external electric field stress impacts the inside structure of the biofilm cai et al 2018 some studies have unravelled that the electrochemical activity of the outer layer cells will be collapsed by the dead inner layer resulting in an increase in charge transfer resistance even though the dead inner layer of the double layer structure has no inhibiting effect on transferring electrons from the live outer layer to the electrode sun et al 2015 which was pronounced as the results of eis in fact the external applied voltage was the exclusive introduction of energy for methane production conversely the microbial community should be the key factor in determining the methane generation cai et al 2019 therefore different technologies detecting biomass and viability of biofilms were employed to quantitative the biomass in order to appraise the effect of different driven forces on the microbial growth 3 4 responses of driving force modes on microbial community analysis 3 4 1 microbial diversity analysis the coverage of three group reactors for the observed operational taxonomic units otus was all 0 999 and the rarefaction curves showed clear asymptotes fig s8 which together implied a near complete sampling of the community namely numbers of sequences were enough to reach saturation all samples of anodes and cathodes were randomly resampled at 36419 and 39766 reads per each respectively with an average sequencing length of ca 256 bps after removing low quality sequences and chimeras according to the clustering method with a threshold of 97 more otus of all electrodes samples were detected in group a respective 237 and 177 for aanode and acathode and group b respective 261 and 188 for banode and bcathode compared with the control respective 224 and 173 for canode and ccathode table 2 in addition 167 otus of anodes and 112 otus of cathodes were shared among three group reactors fig s9 obviously the alpha diversity was measured by the index of shannon simpson chao and ace wang et al 2020 among these of intermittent power modes were higher than the control table 2 suggesting a significantly increase in the microbial richness the higher shannon values of samples aanode 2 45 p 0 013 0 05 and banode 2 43 p 0 156 and the lower simpson values of anode samples aanode 0 167 p 0 045 0 05 and banode 0 168 p 0 006 0 01 were all presented in comparison with group c however the diversity of cathode did not show significant difference of group a simpson p 0 168 and group b simpson p 0 076 compared to group c altogether these results illustrated that the abundance and diversity of microbial community in the anode and cathode biofilms could be shifted via intermittent driven modes hinting that a positive change of functional species related to bioenergy production furthermore two intermittent modes can impact the diversity of anode and cathode biofilms between group a and b which presented significant difference by the index of shannon p 0 036 0 05 and ace p 0 002 0 01 from the anode and by the index of shannon p 0 009 0 01 and simpson p 0 016 0 05 from the cathode principle coordinates analysis pcoa was executed according to the bray curtis distance matrix calculated using otus information from each group samples as shown in fig 4 a and b group a and b were clustered together and well separated from the control with continuous power supplied indicating that there were prominent differences in the microbial community composition among these three groups of reactors non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds also revealed that microbial communities of mecs driven by the intermittent power were relatively concentrated fig 4c and d and they were distinctly separated among group a b and group c demonstrating that driving power modes led to a shift in the microbial community structure 3 4 2 microbial community structure and composition analysis different driving power modes caused spatial separation among the anodes and cathodes in order to compare the differences in structure and composition of biofilm microbial communities in depth the heatmap analysis was performed based on the relative abundance of microbial community at genus level with the 50 most abundant which highlighted their relative distributions and abundances fig 5 a and b the microbial community classification ranking was only extended to genus level due to the limitation of the sequencing sensitivity in the core biofilm of the electrodes hydrogenotrophic methanogens and exoelectrogenic microbes which were responsible for methane generation and extracellular electron transfer achieved enrichment at the cathodes and anodes which formed pivotal functions as the core areas under the intermittent driving modes it was obvious that rhodopseudomonas were enriched at the anodes of group a and b reaching up to 18 72 18 82 respectively which were 2 89 fold and 6 52 fold of group c 6 48 rhodopseudomonas were the representative eams which were photo hetero trophic purple non sulfur bacteria xing et al 2008 acinetobacter belonging to pseudomonadales significantly enhanced on the anodes under the intermittent conditions accounting for 0 72 of group a and 1 98 of group b compared with only 0 19 at the control anode it was previously reported that acinetobacter can secrete a redox compound namely pyrroloquinoline quinone pqq as a prosthetic group for glucose dehydrogenase and a membrane spanning protein or periplasmic soluble protein sequentially facilitating extracellular electron transfer freguia et al 2010 there was no difference in geobacter in the anodes of three group reactors while a reverse distribution was displayed in the cathodes which accounted for 4 50 15 78 1 35 in group a b and c on the other hand methanobacterium a typical h2 utlizing methanogens responsible for interspecies hydrogen transfer showed a similar distribution in all samples of the cathodes methanobacterium in the cathodes of group a b and c respectively accounted for 79 20 76 25 and 74 55 of archaea 16s rrna gene sequences recovered in addition more detailed information about dominant phyla and classes for bacteria and archaea were described in si fig s10 further analysis of the overview specific functional genera distribution for both anodes and cathodes in group a b c reactors also supported the similar results fig 5c and d the otus from detected eams which have been reported from the literatures were selected and summed as an indicator factor to evaluate the effect of power supply modes there were slight differences in the detected eams on the anodes and cathodes in three group reactors the detected eams on the anodes of group a and b accounted for 23 23 27 98 respectively which were 1 42 fold and 1 71 fold of group c 16 38 additionally this value for the cathodes of group a and b was 4 67 15 83 respectively which was higher than the control 3 93 cathodic methanogens which were the dominant functional microbes to reduce carbon dioxide or directly harvest h2 diffused to form methane also shifted with intermittent driving modes the total abundance of methanogens adhesion on the cathodes of group a and b accounted for 80 73 80 23 whereas the corresponding value of the control was 75 05 specifically the abundances of hydrogenotrophic methanogens including methanobacterium methanobrevibacter methanospirillum occupied the dominant on the cathodes the dramatical decrease in methanosarcina on the cathodes under the condition of continuous power driven mode 0 15 compared to group a 1 40 and group b 2 76 indicating the growth of acetotrophic methanogens was challenged without substrates or electrons and the intermittent power supplies made more contribution to methane recovery efficiencies especially group b can be enriched more intriguingly homo acetogens of acetoanaerobium were enriched to 0 94 in the control cathodes compared with 0 34 0 06 for the cathodes of group a b respectively homo acetogens can compete with hydrogenotrophic methanogens for h2 or co2 to metabolize acetate 4 conclusions intermittent electro driving mecs especially driven by solar light emerges the extraordinary promise for bioenergy recovery from wastewater and organic waste removal simultaneously methane production rate energy recovery efficiencies were significantly increased in group a and b with the intermittent driving power modes compared to the control applied continuous electricity field economic assessment also demonstrated the intermittent solar electro driving mode can acquire more privileges the results of cv and eis also elucidated that the higher redox current density and the lower cell resistance particularly diffusion resistance were achieved in group a and b biomass and viability of biofilms using the indicators of atp protein and live dead cells interpreted that the intermittent driving modes can enhance the biofilm metabolism and upregulate the charge carrier of c type cytochrome generation in addition functional microbial community was further enriched under the condition of intermittent solar power in conclusion elevated performances of mecs open new horizons for accelerating mecs with the ability of charged capacitors to be sustainable and economically viable before field application furthermore other organic substrates and their effects on the microbial community under the solar powered driving mode are of specific interest for further research meanwhile more

18023,electroactive microorganisms eams can act as pseudocapacitor to store energy and discharge electrons on need while electromethanogens acting as receptor are able to utilize electrons protons and carbon dioxide for methanization however external energy is required to overcome thermodynamical barriers for electromethanogenesis herein electro driving power by solar light was established to accelerate conversion of waste organics to bioenergy the intermittent power supply modes were elucidated for favourable performances e g current density methane production rate energy recovery efficiencies and economic evaluation compared with the control driven by continuous applied voltage it was found that natural intermittent solar powered mode was more beneficial for microorganisms involved in electron transfer and energy recovery than manual sharp on off mode electrochemistry analysis unrevealed that a higher redox current and lower resistance were exhibited under the solar powered mode a high charge storage capacity and electron mobility were found through cytochrome c content and live cells ratio in the solar power assisted bioreactor the intermittent power driving modes can regulate electron transfer proteins with capacitive storage behavior in biomass which helps to understand the responses of functional communities on the stress of intermittent electric field these findings indicate a promising perspective of microbial biotechnology driven by solar power to boost bioenergy recovery from waste wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioenergy solar power intermittent electro drive capacitor cytochrome c 1 introduction energy crisis and environmental pollution are regarded to be prime inevitable issues due to rapidly global growing population and imminent developing industries the invention of new energy approaches accompanied with minimal environmental impact is critical to persistent economic growth and the maintenance of a green fit of inhabitation for human beings qian et al 2010 though bioenergy recovery from wastewater or biomass via anaerobic microbes is a widely acceptable and developed technology there are still promising potentials to promote microbial growth and biochemical reactions of microorganisms in a specific niche to some extent it has been ascertained that external energy can power microbes and microbial production lovley 2011 lovley and nevin 2013 microbial electrolysis cells mecs require a relatively low energy input 0 2 0 8 v to provoke renewable bioenergy recovery from wastewater or wastes and simultaneously dispose contaminants when coupled with anaerobic digestion ad system cai et al 2016 nonetheless the energy consumption is always evaluated through electricity input moreover the electricity delivery is restricted over long term operation in rural or remote areas zhang and angelidaki 2014 therefore renewable energy powering mecs is crucial to the widespread application katuri et al 2019 solar energy is regarded as one of the most feasible options to conform the energy demand worldwide kamat 2007 while cost effective technologies or feasible ways for solar energy storage or utilization will be critical to evade the intermittency of the solar resource jia et al 2016 lewis 2007 therefore solar powered energy as a day night intermittent power is supposed to be a limitation aspect when aiming to develop solar powered biological technologies for bioenergy or bioproducts production the application of direct electric current dc in mecs would affect cell growth and microbial metabolic behavior she et al 2006 most studies focus on the regulation of dc including voltage values ding et al 2016 electrode potential zhen et al 2015 biofilm community structure liu et al 2010 etc for example when an applied voltage of 0 8 v 3 d was applied on a two chambered cubic biofilm reactor with proton exchange membrane pem the methane production rate reached up the highest of 0 052 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d ding et al 2016 in another study cod removal rate reached maximum and was almost 1 2 fold higher than the control at applied voltage of 0 6 v in the mec coupling anaerobic membrane bioreactor system in contrast the membrane fouling rate of the system gradually slowed down with increased applied voltage ding et al 2018 it was found that hydrogen yield generally increased with increasing voltage from 0 1 to 1 0 v obtaining a maximum yield of 2 1 mol h2 mol acetate however the higher applied voltage implied higher anodic loss of electrons compared to that of cathodic loss chae et al 2008 on the aspect of functional communities it was found that the biofilm community changed in absence and presence of electrode potential while more abundant functional genes were potentially expressed at open circuit liu et al 2010 therefore these results hinted that continuous electrical energy input may provide exceeded energy over microbial metabolic activities for the redox reaction cho et al 2019 lately there have been a few studies on the intermittent mode operation in mecs it was observed that a higher and more stable phenol removal efficiency could be achieved with an intermittent dc application 1 day on 1 day off in single chambered bioelectrochemical reactors compared to continuous applied dc of 2 ma ailijiang et al 2016 hussain et al found that periodic power supply disconnection 2 sec on 2 sec off increased a long term performance of mecs hussain et al 2018 with internal resistance decrease with long term on off manipulation the intermittent voltage 60 sec on 15 sec off was also revealed to increase the overall gas production cho et al 2019 compared to the control with continuous voltage application setting anode potential of 0 2 v these results hint that intermittent power supply could extend mecs more sustainable and practicable however the intermittent impacts on electron transfer and capacitive storage behavior in biomass are not well understood especially on the limitation factors in electric field like ph gradient within biofilm and the evolution of electrode respiring bacteria erb a solar powered system is established to evaluate the efficiencies of organic conversion energy recovery and biogas yield under intermittent electro driving on off modes the influences of microbial community function on electron transfer and capacitive storage behavior involving in cytochrome c and community structure especially exoelectrogens and methanogens in biofilms will be fully investigated in differently regulated electricity fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor construction operation and sampling in mecs the methane generation pathway is contributed both through acetoclastic methanogenesis from acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis from cathodic products h2 or electrons liu et al 2016 the biofilm development of mecs is the most fundamental element to control relatively stable bioreactor performances to evaluate the influence of power supply modes on the working status of microbial communities twelve identical mec reactors were assembled and set up in the same way cai et al 2018 fig

measured using a gas chromatograph agilent 7892 usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a 1 5 m stainless steel column with nitrogen as the carrier gas 30 ml min the total amount of hydrogen and methane produced were calculated by multiplying by the hydrogen and methane content in a 100 ml gas sample normalized to per ml with the headspace volume of the single chamber mec 0 142 0

performances of continuous batch operations cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were utilized to examine the biofilm electrochemical characteristics with an electrochemical workstation no chi660d chenhua instruments co ltd china ec lab v10 02 software cv tests were conducted with three electrode configuration with the work electrode as well as the counter electrode under the condition of turnover residual electron donor acetate and an ag agcl electrode 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she saturated kcl no 013503 als co ltd japan as the reference electrode the voltage range for the cv tests of the anode was 0 8 to 0 8 v at a scanning rate of 1 mv s and for the cathode the voltage range was from 1 2 to 0 v at the same scanning rate eis tests were conducted with two types of measurements with the operational potential in situ using the electrochemical workstation one using two electrode configuration for a whole cell and the other using a three electrode configuration with a ag agcl reference electrode for the anode and the cathode borole et al 2010 the whole cell of the eis measurement was carried out in the single chamber mec using the anode as the working electrode and the cathode as the reference and counter electrodes at the circuit voltage under an external resistance of 10 ω over the frequency range of 100 khz 0 01 hz with a 1 mv amplitude of the sinusoidal perturbation the three electrode configuration of the eis measurement was done for recording the impedance spectrum of the anode and the cathode at the same operating parameters except different set potentials depending on the potential of the anode and the cathode eis data was reported as nyquist plots and further fitted with equivalent circuit model ecm containing different impendence at two time constant model rs rctq1 rdq2 for the individual electrode the impendence of each anode and cathode electrode comprised the same ecm including the ohmic

addition protein cytochrome c was further analyzed via sds page 15 gel stained for heme as previous described francis and becker 1984 zhang et al 2018 all samples should be weighed after atp and protein tests for normalization according to standard methods gilcreas 1966 the viability of the biofilms of the anodes and cathodes was stained using a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit no

methane production all reactors were operated over twelve months after inoculation and methane generation determined over ten month batch cycles when stable performances were achieved an anode potential via ag agcl reference electrode of below 200 mv indicated a successful inoculation and start up wang et al 2010 which was also considered that the electroactive biofilm was formed liu et al 2012 for each fed batch cycle once the electric current in the circuit was higher than 1 ma the mec reactor was regarded to be successfully started and recorded as startup time the parameters emphasis on the performances of mecs were shown in table 1 electric current is an important indicator of the rate at which electrons are transferred from the electrode to methanogens to reduce carbon dioxide to methane the variations in current for three driving force reactors were presented with respect to time fig 1 the maximum current of group b reactors solar energy was 12 17 ma with the volumetric current of 81 13 a m3 based on volume and the current density observed to be 17 39 a m2 based on cathode surface area which was followed by group a intermittent power on 8 31 ma 55 40 a m3 11 87 a m2 and group c no power off 5 55 ma 37 00 a m3 7 93 a m2 respectively it was noticeably observed that a sudden great current would rise rapidly to a maximum value and then immediately maintain a stable value once power supply of group a was manually cut and reconnected fig 1 this phenomenon has been also observed in the result of hussain et al 2018 which might be due to critical internal capacitance of the electroactive biofilm deeke et al 2013 houghton et al 2016 while in group b there was a gradual increase when the solar cell began to receive the sunlight the current slowly stretched to the maximum value compared to group a fig 1 therefore the driving force modes of group a and group b were different which could make a difference in the microbial system development under two intermittent modes as a result of the whole system cod removal efficiency showed a small difference that is group b achieved the maximum 96 08 followed by group a of 95 49 and group c of 93 86 accordingly importantly the further evaluated methane yield indicated that more electrons could flow from acetate to final products under the solar powered mode compared to the sudden switch on off mode the coulombs recovered in the end products and the relative coulombic efficiencies were further estimated the ce of group c attained the highest 91 47 followed by group a 77 37 and group b 51 13 respectively the ce for the intermittent driving modes was lower especially the solar powered mode because the substrate was not converted to electrons but to other organic molecules or was used for the growth of the microorganisms hamelers et al 2010 it is evident that electroactive microorganisms eams worked for the part time 12 h per day in group a and b compared to group c 24 h per day therefore the growth and acetate oxidation by electroactive bacteria are limiting as observed in low ce in intermittent modes compared to group a of the immediate power off mode solar powered group b had a pretty shorter time on its peak current but high peak value with the same steady applied voltage when the power was cut off namely discharge an excess of electrons stored in eams which can allow cells to maintain a certain metabolic activity and this process of accumulating superabundant electrons was also referred to charge at open circuit potential ocp alves et al 2016 bonanni et al 2012 esteve nunez et al 2008 schrott et al 2011 uria et al 2011 once eams were fully charged with electrons that is eams were repolarized the residual stored electrons would be immediately released as an abnormal transient current bonanni et al 2012 this process of releasing surplus electrons was also defined as discharge for readability bonanni et al 2012 and eams behaved like the pseudocapacitive viz a faradaic process distinguishing inherently in a double layer capacitance ren et al 2015 however it was not adequately understood on the principle reason that the further discrepancy occurred by group b responses compared to the situation of group a according to the consumed cod the theoretical ch4 yields were 0 0727 0 0798 and 0 0889 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d for group a b and c respectively when acetate was stoichiometrically converted to methane 1 mol ch4 mol acetate however group b attained the maximum y c h 4 of 0 0681 0 0007 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d accounting for 85 yield from consumed acetate and then group a with 0 0564 0 0009 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d 78 yield whereas the lowest y c h 4 of 0 0546 0 0010 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d was yielded in the control 61 yield the methane generation primarily consists of two parts one is based on the current the other is based on the substrate conversion depending on different intermittent power supplies the t v c h 4 c u r r e n t in group b was lower 0 0396 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d than in group a 0 0543 m3 ch4 m3 reactor d but t v c h 4 c u r r e n t of intermittent groups were lower than the actual y c h 4 indicating a substantial part of methane contribution from metabolic pathway without external power methane and hydrogen were both detected in group c with continuous applied voltage as a part of cathodic reclamined hydrogen collected into gas bag before metabolic utilization fig s3 more hydrogen was measured in group c which might be the interpretation that t v c h 4 c u r r e n t of group c was higher than y c h 4 beyond all doubt all the t v c h 4 a c e t a t e of group a b and c were higher than the actual y c h 4 which was due to all methane produced originating from the acetate oxidation according to the mass balance on the other hand a steady increase in methane production was observed due to the overpowering during the cut off period in group b fig s4 the rebounded production occurred repeatedly from power on time to cut off time which may reflect the competition between electrode respiring bacteria and acetotrophic methanogens on the substrate acetate liu et al 2018 it hinted that their growth balance substantially benefited the final methane yield in the whole system of intermittent modes compared to continuous power supplied mode furthermore it was detected that in the period of the power off cut off power indicated two means one was an artificial power outage the other was no sunlight carbon dioxide concentrations of the reactors in group a and b were lower than group c data not shown it was reasonable that electrode respiring bacteria worked for the part time 12 h in group a and b compared to group c 24 h leading to a slow acetate consumption rate as well as low ce in the intermittent modes compared to group c however a lower co2 concentration of biogas in the intermittent modes further connected to ph status in the solution the ph was tested during power cut phase showing accumulated protons with the ph of 6 89 0 01 6 83 0 02 7 08 0 04 in group a b c respectively it has been investigated that proton concentration is a limiting factor for electron transfer of electrode biofilm cai et al 2019 lusk et al 2018 and co2 concentration is also important to bioelectrochemical hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis cai et al 2018 the current density was significantly related in presence of a weak acid solution daniele et al 1996 chen et al found that when the cathode solution was pre sparged with co2 compared to pre sparging with n2 the current density was substantially increased with biofilm or without biofilm on the pt catalyzed electrode resulting from the h donating in a weak acid cheng et al 2009 in this aspect the function of the on and off applied voltage made a storage and utilization of accumulation protons and carbon dioxide in the system this mitigated fast substrate consumption inside the exoelectrogenic biofilm under the applied voltage resulting in a relatively high current peak after power supplied again to drive electron transfer feng et al 2018 in another aspect under no power off mode the continuous h2 produced by the cathode made a variety of mixture of hydrogen and methane to some extent however the extensive h2 could further support more side reactions by microorganisms attached to the electrodes leading to other various by products generated in the system lee et al 2009 sangeetha et al 2017 3 1 2 input energy recovery efficiency and economic assessment the introduction of three driving force modes on mecs has caused the methane production change to evaluate the efficiency of input energy recovery the cost of materials and equipment was not considered in economic analysis neither the cost of solar energy supply system in this present study apparently the intermittent power supplies group a and b have much less energy invested compared with the control group c group b can be considered as no cost energy input acetate conversion efficiency in group a and b were 69 84 and 85 23 respectively whereas acetate conversion efficiency in the control was 57 31 other performance indexes the recovery efficiencies of methane electrical energy and substrate energy exhibited a similar tendency as with the methane production rate indicating a profitable way for biogas yield and upgrading under intermittent power supplies when concerning the more specific economic revenue from the main product methane the increase of methane revenues of group a b were 0 0218 0 0263 m3 reactor d respectively compared with the control group c 0 0211 m3 reactor d both two types of intermittent electric fields can obtain more benefits especially solar powered supply which almost was 1 25 fold higher than that of group c and 1 21 fold higher than that of group a therefore the intermittent power supplies not only promote methane recovery but also reduce energy input thereby increasing economic benefit 3 2 effects of driving force modes on electrochemical properties of biofilms cyclic voltammetry cv is generally used to analyze the electrochemical activity and redox potential of the mature biofilm the cv profiles of group a b anodes and cathodes showed much higher redox current density normalized to the surface area of the anodes and cathodes especially group b than that of the control demonstrating that the electron transfer capability of mec reactors with the intermittent power supplies was greatly improved and faster reactions happened at the electrodes fig 2 a and b the first derivative curves dcvs of cyclic voltammetry current for the anodes were further analyzed which can reflect the change of current with the anode potential in dcvs of the anodes group b exhibited the broadest active peak peak width at peak and the highest peak and the activity range of anode potential covered from 0 50 v to 0 2 v fig s5a as with the cv test the control group c also performed the lowest in dcvs the high redox current density of the cvs and the high peak of the dcvs mean the high electron output capability of anodic microorganisms furthermore the wider active peak in the dcv indicated that anodic microorganisms can derivate electrons over a larger range of anode potentials therefore the results of both cvs and dcvs indicated that the bioelectrochemical activity of the anodic biofilm in group b was the highest followed by the biofilm of group a and the biofilm of group c was the lowest these results indicated that eams could perform higher activities on electron transfer under the solar powered mode than the sudden cut off mode though the higher the peak current density the more the generation of methane cheng et al 2009 furthermore a comprehensive positive effect occurred in the pathway of the discharge utilization in the view of electron balance higher conversion efficiency from acetate to methane was also contributed by the undetected electrons involved between electroactive bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens when external voltage disappeared the reason for the highest yield of methane in group b was further demonstrated eis was used to measure the components of the internal resistances of mecs activated losses ohmic losses and mass transfer losses are three main sources of electrode potential losses yin et al 2013 in general the first intersection of the nyquist plot of the whole cells and the x axis represents the ohmic resistance and the projected point of the intersection of the nyquist plot and x axis farthest from the origin is representative of the total impedance which is the same with the results of fitting the data with an equivalent circuit fig s2b both resistances of the anodes and cathodes were exhibited significant divergence as shown in figs s5b e group a and b brought a dramatic decrease of the impedances for the anodes and cathodes consequently for the whole cells as shown in fig 2c the total impedance of group b was 42 68 ω that nearly 1 14 times lower than that of group a 48 64 ω and 3 04 times lower than that of group c 129 74 ω it was further found that there was a dramatical difference of rd among three groups suggesting that transport limitation played the vital role in the performance of mecs with diverse driving power modes fig 2d 3 3 effects of driving force modes on biomass and viability of biofilms atp plays a vital role in the material and energy cycle which is used to provide energy for the metabolism of microorganisms and can reflect microbial growth and metabolism as an important energy storage in microorganisms ding et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 a the atp of the anodes in group a and b was 2 08 and 4 72 times higher than that in group c t test p 0 022 0 001 0 05 similarly the atp of the cathodes in group a and b was slightly 2 81 and 3 46 times higher than that in the control group p 0 036 0 011 0 05 higher cell activities have been triggered under the solar powered mode which was 2 23 times higher than group a on the anode atp detection and 1 23 times higher than group a of the cathode atp the amount of biofilm biomass was further quantified based on the total protein contents fig 3a and protein patterns fig s6 group b obtained the maximum protein contents which were 1 78 anode 1 91 cathode fold than these in the control p 1 418 10 5 1 441 10 5 0 01 followed by group a which were 1 43 anode 1 60 cathode fold than these in group c p 0 009 0 010 0 05 these results demonstrated that biofilms of reactors driven by intermittent power modes grew better than that of the continuous applied voltage mode resulting in high electron storage and transfer as well as ultimate methane production enhancement and solar powered group b grew the best p 0 05 furthermore the total amount of c type cytochromes can be directly related to electron transfer by eams normalized to the biomass protein content of the anodes and cathodes were the highest in group b which were 1 16 fold anode 1 24 fold cathode of group a and 1 45 fold anode 1 84 fold cathode of group c respectively fig 3b these results elucidated c type cytochrome expression could be significantly changed by switch off and on modes especially the solar powered mode performed more beneficial the c type cytochromes are responsible for charge storage in electrode biofilms malvankar et al 2012 most of these c type cytochromes possess more than one heme containing group methé et al 2003 in which c type cytochrome omcz was identified the essential function to optimal current production inoue et al 2011 but generally the observed large enhancement of capacitance in bioelectrochemical biofilms can be attributed to the charge storage ability of all detected c type cytochromes malvankar et al 2011 recently it was also mentioned a positive increase of c type cytochromes of detected electrode biomass when giving appropriate periodic polarizations zhang et al 2018 supporting that c type cytochromes can adapt to an enrichment strategy compared to the situation of continuous polarization in the previous case a potential enrichment of cytochrome c functional genes was also detected in open circuit with low electron transfer status compared to closed circuit with continuous electron transfer liu et al 2010 it hinted that an intermittent driving power can upregulate the synthesis of heme containing redox proteins in addition the protein patterns observed from different biofilms of three group reactors were similar suggesting that the intermittent driving power modes did not modify the nature of the c type cytochromes fig s6 though biofilm viability were not substantially changed by different modes the intermittent driven force modes improved the viability of microbial structure with abilities of electron transfer and methane production fig 3c fig s7 the ratios of live cells to total cells of the anode and the cathode in group c were 46 6 2 and 54 4 8 respectively fig 3d intermittent driven power supply into the electrodes enhanced the ratios of live cells to total cells of mature anode and cathode biofilm to 57 4 6 53 3 6 group a and 63 5 8 60 4 2 group b respectively solar powered mode will more benefit biofilm activities with respect to restored cytochrome expression compared to a sharp on off mode the microbial activities were also impacted by limited factors including ph change which was determined by proton consumption rate with a continuous stress or intermittent stress appropriate biofilm thickness and integrity imply the activity of bacteria which can increase the resistibility of microorganisms to harsh environments such as physical and chemical stresses limited nutrient availability and exchange toxic substances outside biofilm long term external electric field stress impacts the inside structure of the biofilm cai et al 2018 some studies have unravelled that the electrochemical activity of the outer layer cells will be collapsed by the dead inner layer resulting in an increase in charge transfer resistance even though the dead inner layer of the double layer structure has no inhibiting effect on transferring electrons from the live outer layer to the electrode sun et al 2015 which was pronounced as the results of eis in fact the external applied voltage was the exclusive introduction of energy for methane production conversely the microbial community should be the key factor in determining the methane generation cai et al 2019 therefore different technologies detecting biomass and viability of biofilms were employed to quantitative the biomass in order to appraise the effect of different driven forces on the microbial growth 3 4 responses of driving force modes on microbial community analysis 3 4 1 microbial diversity analysis the coverage of three group reactors for the observed operational taxonomic units otus was all 0 999 and the rarefaction curves showed clear asymptotes fig s8 which together implied a near complete sampling of the community namely numbers of sequences were enough to reach saturation all samples of anodes and cathodes were randomly resampled at 36419 and 39766 reads per each respectively with an average sequencing length of ca 256 bps after removing low quality sequences and chimeras according to the clustering method with a threshold of 97 more otus of all electrodes samples were detected in group a respective 237 and 177 for aanode and acathode and group b respective 261 and 188 for banode and bcathode compared with the control respective 224 and 173 for canode and ccathode table 2 in addition 167 otus of anodes and 112 otus of cathodes were shared among three group reactors fig s9 obviously the alpha diversity was measured by the index of shannon simpson chao and ace wang et al 2020 among these of intermittent power modes were higher than the control table 2 suggesting a significantly increase in the microbial richness the higher shannon values of samples aanode 2 45 p 0 013 0 05 and banode 2 43 p 0 156 and the lower simpson values of anode samples aanode 0 167 p 0 045 0 05 and banode 0 168 p 0 006 0 01 were all presented in comparison with group c however the diversity of cathode did not show significant difference of group a simpson p 0 168 and group b simpson p 0 076 compared to group c altogether these results illustrated that the abundance and diversity of microbial community in the anode and cathode biofilms could be shifted via intermittent driven modes hinting that a positive change of functional species related to bioenergy production furthermore two intermittent modes can impact the diversity of anode and cathode biofilms between group a and b which presented significant difference by the index of shannon p 0 036 0 05 and ace p 0 002 0 01 from the anode and by the index of shannon p 0 009 0 01 and simpson p 0 016 0 05 from the cathode principle coordinates analysis pcoa was executed according to the bray curtis distance matrix calculated using otus information from each group samples as shown in fig 4 a and b group a and b were clustered together and well separated from the control with continuous power supplied indicating that there were prominent differences in the microbial community composition among these three groups of reactors non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds also revealed that microbial communities of mecs driven by the intermittent power were relatively concentrated fig 4c and d and they were distinctly separated among group a b and group c demonstrating that driving power modes led to a shift in the microbial community structure 3 4 2 microbial community structure and composition analysis different driving power modes caused spatial separation among the anodes and cathodes in order to compare the differences in structure and composition of biofilm microbial communities in depth the heatmap analysis was performed based on the relative abundance of microbial community at genus level with the 50 most abundant which highlighted their relative distributions and abundances fig 5 a and b the microbial community classification ranking was only extended to genus level due to the limitation of the sequencing sensitivity in the core biofilm of the electrodes hydrogenotrophic methanogens and exoelectrogenic microbes which were responsible for methane generation and extracellular electron transfer achieved enrichment at the cathodes and anodes which formed pivotal functions as the core areas under the intermittent driving modes it was obvious that rhodopseudomonas were enriched at the anodes of group a and b reaching up to 18 72 18 82 respectively which were 2 89 fold and 6 52 fold of group c 6 48 rhodopseudomonas were the representative eams which were photo hetero trophic purple non sulfur bacteria xing et al 2008 acinetobacter belonging to pseudomonadales significantly enhanced on the anodes under the intermittent conditions accounting for 0 72 of group a and 1 98 of group b compared with only 0 19 at the control anode it was previously reported that acinetobacter can secrete a redox compound namely pyrroloquinoline quinone pqq as a prosthetic group for glucose dehydrogenase and a membrane spanning protein or periplasmic soluble protein sequentially facilitating extracellular electron transfer freguia et al 2010 there was no difference in geobacter in the anodes of three group reactors while a reverse distribution was displayed in the cathodes which accounted for 4 50 15 78 1 35 in group a b and c on the other hand methanobacterium a typical h2 utlizing methanogens responsible for interspecies hydrogen transfer showed a similar distribution in all samples of the cathodes methanobacterium in the cathodes of group a b and c respectively accounted for 79 20 76 25 and 74 55 of archaea 16s rrna gene sequences recovered in addition more detailed information about dominant phyla and classes for bacteria and archaea were described in si fig s10 further analysis of the overview specific functional genera distribution for both anodes and cathodes in group a b c reactors also supported the similar results fig 5c and d the otus from detected eams which have been reported from the literatures were selected and summed as an indicator factor to evaluate the effect of power supply modes there were slight differences in the detected eams on the anodes and cathodes in three group reactors the detected eams on the anodes of group a and b accounted for 23 23 27 98 respectively which were 1 42 fold and 1 71 fold of group c 16 38 additionally this value for the cathodes of group a and b was 4 67 15 83 respectively which was higher than the control 3 93 cathodic methanogens which were the dominant functional microbes to reduce carbon dioxide or directly harvest h2 diffused to form methane also shifted with intermittent driving modes the total abundance of methanogens adhesion on the cathodes of group a and b accounted for 80 73 80 23 whereas the corresponding value of the control was 75 05 specifically the abundances of hydrogenotrophic methanogens including methanobacterium methanobrevibacter methanospirillum occupied the dominant on the cathodes the dramatical decrease in methanosarcina on the cathodes under the condition of continuous power driven mode 0 15 compared to group a 1 40 and group b 2 76 indicating the growth of acetotrophic methanogens was challenged without substrates or electrons and the intermittent power supplies made more contribution to methane recovery efficiencies especially group b can be enriched more intriguingly homo acetogens of acetoanaerobium were enriched to 0 94 in the control cathodes compared with 0 34 0 06 for the cathodes of group a b respectively homo acetogens can compete with hydrogenotrophic methanogens for h2 or co2 to metabolize acetate 4 conclusions intermittent electro driving mecs especially driven by solar light emerges the extraordinary promise for bioenergy recovery from wastewater and organic waste removal simultaneously methane production rate energy recovery efficiencies were significantly increased in group a and b with the intermittent driving power modes compared to the control applied continuous electricity field economic assessment also demonstrated the intermittent solar electro driving mode can acquire more privileges the results of cv and eis also elucidated that the higher redox current density and the lower cell resistance particularly diffusion resistance were achieved in group a and b biomass and viability of biofilms using the indicators of atp protein and live dead cells interpreted that the intermittent driving modes can enhance the biofilm metabolism and upregulate the charge carrier of c type cytochrome generation in addition functional microbial community was further enriched under the condition of intermittent solar power in conclusion elevated performances of mecs open new horizons for accelerating mecs with the ability of charged capacitors to be sustainable and economically viable before field application furthermore other organic substrates and their effects on the microbial community under the solar powered driving mode are of specific interest for further research meanwhile more efforts need to be put on combining solar energy with bioelectrochemistry as well as continuous flow experiments and pilot full scale reactors declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18024,gravity driven membrane gdm filtration system is a promising process for decentralized drinking water treatment during the operation membrane relaxation and shear stress could be simply achieved by intermittent filtration and water disturbance created by occasionally shaking membrane model or stirring water in membrane tank respectively to better understand the impact of membrane relaxation and shear stress on the biofouling layer and stable flux in gdm system action of daily 60 min intermission daily flushing cross flow velocity 10 cm s 1 1 min and the combination of the two flushed right after the 60 min intermission were compared the results showed that membrane relaxation and shear stress lonely was ineffective in improving the stable flux while their combination enhanced the stable flux by 70 a more open and spatially heterogeneous biofouling layer with a low extracellular polymeric substance eps content and a high microbial activity was formed under the combination of membrane relaxation and shear stress in situ optical coherence tomography oct observation revealed that during intermission the absence of pushing force by water flow induced a reversible expansion of biofouling layer and the biofouling layer restored to its initial state soon after resuming filtration shear stress caused abrasion and erosion on the biofouling surface but it exerted little effect on the interior of biofouling layer under the combination however both the surface and interior of biofouling layer were disturbed because of 1 the water vortexes caused by rough biofouling layer surface and 2 the porous structure after 60 min intermission this disturbance in turn helped the biofouling layer maintain its roughness and porosity thereby improving the stable flux of gdm system graphical abstract image 1 keywords gdm system membrane relaxation shear stress biofouling layer stable flux 1 introduction gravity driven membrane gdm filtration system a type of ultrafiltration uf driven by hydrostatic pressure 100 cm water head is a novel membrane based decentralized drinking water treatment process peter varbanets et al 2010 2011a because of the activity of microorganisms the biofouling layer formed on the membrane surface can keep a loose structure with stable hydraulic resistances peter varbanets et al 2011b consequently the flux of gdm system could be stabilized for several months to years without any physical or chemical cleaning pronk et al 2019 however this stable flux is one order of magnitude lower than that in the typical uf process which is a major obstacle to the widespread application of gdm system in membrane based water treatment system the flux constant filtration mode could be readily enhanced by physical cleaning such as air sparging membrane relaxation and backwashing shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 considering the low maintenance of gdm system the maintenance intensive physical cleaning methods e g backwashing are generally unfavorable however some simple physical cleaning methods are still feasible in specific cases for example membrane relaxation can be simply realized by intermittent operation through opening and closing the outlet valve peter varbanets et al 2012 shear stress could be generated by draining filling of the membrane tank shaking of membrane module stirring of water in the membrane tank and even air sparging lee et al 2019 using manual bellows fig s1 therefore membrane relaxation and shear stress could be introduced into the gdm system without dramatically increasing its mechanical and operational complexity nor its capital cost and operating cost when applied intermittent filtration in membrane based systems such as membrane bioreactors membrane foulants would back transport to the bulk solution under concentration gradients hong et al 2002 shi et al 2014 and the biofouling layer has an expansion period van der marel et al 2009 thus alleviating membrane fouling tang et al 2016 shear stress can detach the foulants from the membrane surface choi and morgenroth 2003 ramasamy and zhang 2005 therefore it is acknowledged as an effective cleaning method however shear stress may also selectively detach the large particles and leave small particles on the membrane surface thus leading to a denser fouling layer ding et al 2016 paul et al 2012 biofouling layer is the decisive factor of the flux in the gdm system peter varbanets et al 2010 and has some unique features under ultra low pressure and ultra low flux conditions e g open and heterogeneous structure martin et al 2014 peter varbanets et al 2011a hence such a biofouling layer may have some different responses to intermittent filtration and shear stress previous studies reported that adding a standstill period prior to daily forward flushing peter varbanets et al 2012 air sparging oka et al 2017 and backwash fortunato et al 2020 significantly increased the stable flux of the gdm system nonetheless it is still unclear how the biofouling layer responds to membrane relaxation and shear force and their corresponding effects to stable flux optical coherence tomography oct is a powerful tool for in situ and noninvasive observation of biofouling layer and its formation fortunato et al 2019 gao et al 2014 based on the images acquired using oct the morphological parameters of biofouling layer such as thickness and roughness can be online monitored wagner and horn 2017 in previous studies the deformation of biofilm was observed under the varieties of transmembrane pressure tmp flux and shear stress desmond et al 2018a b jafari et al 2019 picioreanu et al 2018 therefore this technology is suitable to investigate the responses of biofouling layer to membrane relaxation and shear stress and establish the relationship between the performance and the characteristics of biofouling layer therefore this study compared the effect of membrane relaxation shear stress and membrane relaxation shear stress on the permeate flux and the properties of biofouling layers in the gdm system with the in situ visualization of biofouling layer using an oct we discussed the underlying mechanisms for the influences of membrane relaxation and shear stress this study intended to highlight that membrane relaxation and shear stress alone might not be effective in increasing the water production of the gdm system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 feed water raw water was periodically collected from the donghu lake from july to november 2019 the feed water was characterized by a total organic carbon toc of 6 1 7 1 mg l 1 an ultraviolet absorbance uv254 of 0 087 0 110 au cm 1 a turbidity of 0 5 3 0 ntu and an assimilable organic carbon aoc of 11 7 74 0 μg l 1 the water temperature was maintained at 20 2 c using an air conditioner 2 1 2 membrane and membrane module a flat sheet poly ethersulfone pes membrane with a molecular weight cut off of 150 kda was used microdyn nadir germany and its permeability was 9 78 0 48 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 at 20 c the membrane was soaked in 25 isopropanol solution for 12 h and then cleaned with pure water for 24 h before use membrane modules were made of plexiglass with a chamber dimension of 35 140 1 5 mm width length height the membrane was sandwiched between the two parts of membrane module and sealed with a silicon o ring the effective filtration area of the module was 42 2 cm2 2 2 system setup the gdm system had a feed water reservoir which placed at a suitable height to provide a driving force fig s2 a constant level tank distributed the feed water to every membrane module a tmp of 5 5 kpa was offered by the water head difference between the water levels of the constant level water tank and the permeate outlet valve 1 and valve 2 were equipped at the permeate outlet and the cross flow outlet respectively during the filtration valve 1 was open and valve 2 was closed while valve 1 was closed and valve 2 was open when flushing was carried on in the standstill period both two valves were closed the flushing flow was collected with a water tank and the water was pumped back to the feed water tank after flushing the gdm systems were operated in four modes one gdm system was operated continuously without flushing control one was operated intermittently without flushing inr one operated continuously with daily flushing flush the other operated intermittently with daily flushing at the end of the intermission inr flush for each mode two modules were operated in parallel the flushing was driven by gravitational pressures at a cross flow velocity of 10 cm s 1 with feed water which was selected based on the cross flow membrane filtration in previous studies lee et al 2001 wang and tang 2011 youm et al 1996 according to the formula used by desmond et al 2018a b the shear stress during flushing was 0 4 pa which was at the range of that generally applied in uf the cross flow lasted 1 min per day once while the intermittence lasted 60 min per day once which would neither cause much loss of throughput capacity nor increase the mechanical and operational complexity of the system oka et al 2017 the experimental results also indicated that the 60 min membrane relaxation had less than 5 impact on daily water production two types of permeate flux was used in this experiment real time flux and average flux in most cases flux represented average flux and real time flux was only used to calculate the flux recovery after physical cleaning the flux was calculated based on the weight changes of permeate bottles with time which was monitored using a balance with the accuracy of 0 01 g lq c30002 lucky china the average flux was calculated based on the weight change per day and the real time flux was calculated based on the weight change per 2 min 2 3 fouling resistance the relationship between permeate flux and hydraulic resistance is given by equation 1 based on darcy s law broeckmann et al 2006 foley 2013 lee et al 2019 1 j tmp μ r t where j is the permeate flux in m3 m 2 s 1 the tmp is the transmembrane pressure in pa μ is the dynamic viscosity of water in pa s 1 005 10 3 pa s r

measured using virgin membrane and pure water r r is the physically recoverable fouling resistance that can be removed by physical cleaning r ir is the physically irrecoverable fouling resistance that is resulted from membrane pore blocking and constriction r r and r ir were determined at the end of the experiment after the membrane was flushed with phosphate buffer saline until no biofouling layer was visible on the membrane surface 2 4 optical coherence tomography in situ images of the biofouling layer were non destructively performed using an oct gan210c1 thorlab usa in each observation twelve spots were evenly selected on the membrane surface to analyze the thickness and roughness of the biofouling layer to compare the morphology of biofouling layer before and after flushing and to observe its variation in the standstill period a fixed point was selected for observation by fixing the lens of oct and the location of the membrane and marking on the surface of the membrane module to prevent displacement while flushing the size of the monitored area was 3 2 1 5 mm for each system twelve oct images were acquired during every test the raw images were thresholded and binarized with imagej 1 50i nih usa the features of biofouling layer morphology were computed using a matlab code according to the equations reported in previous studies fortunato and leiknes 2017 wagner and horn 2017 2 5 composition analysis of biofouling layer to better understand the response of biofouling to membrane relaxation and shear stress the composition of the biofouling layer was characterized at the terminal of the experiment 2 5 1 microorganisms total active microorganisms in the biofouling layer were quantified using the content of total adenosine triphosphate atp hammes et al 2010 a luminometer glomax 20 20 promega usa and an enhanced atp assay kit beyotime biotechnology china were employed for the atp measurement before detection atp lysate was added by one tenth of the volume of the sample then the samples were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min sample preparation was done at 4 c or on ice 2 5 2 extracellular polymeric substance eps the eps were extracted by a heating method morgan et al 1990 the biofouling layer solution collected was first heated at 80 c for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min the supernatants obtained were collected for eps quantification the total content of eps in the extracts was represented by protein and polysaccharides jiang et al 2020 the bicinchoninic acid bca assay sangon biological engineering technology services co ltd shanghai china was used for protein measurement with bovine serum albumin as the standard polysaccharides quantification was carried out using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 with glucose as the standard 2 5 3 total solid ts and volatile solid vs ts was used to quantify the total accumulation of organic and inorganic matter on the membrane surface while vs was applied to represent the organic matter the biofouling layer solution collected in a crucible was first dried in an oven at the temperature of 105 c then burned in a muffle furnace at the temperature of 600 c the changes in the crucible weight were used to calculate the value of ts and vs 2 6 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation a two dimensional cfd numerical simulation was carried out to reveal the distribution of flow field on the surface of the biofouling layer when flushing the biofouling layer was simplified as a waterproof wall a pressure based solver in the cfd software ansys fluent was used to solve the governing equations the simple algorithm was used for pressure velocity coupling when the convergence criteria of all equations were smaller than 10 6 iterations were terminated 2 7 other measurements dissolved organic carbon doc was characterized using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100 jena germany uv254 was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer pgeneral china the fluorescence spectrum of water samples was determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan aoc which was used to assess the re growth potential of bacteria in water was measured based on the protocol reported in previous studies derlon et al 2014 shao et al 2020 to eliminate the influence of particles all the samples were pre filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose ester membranes microsoft excel software package microsoft co usa was used for the analysis of variance anova and linear regression on some measurement data and p value 0 05 was determined as the significance level while r 2 value was used as the measurement of the goodness of fit 3 results 3 1 overall performance of the gdm systems the permeate flux of all the gdm systems is plotted against time in fig 1 a although the gdm systems were operated with different physical cleaning the changes of flux in all the systems followed a two stage trend peter varbanets et al 2010 sharply deceased in the first several days and then stabilized after a 20 day operation according to the hydraulic resistance analysis at the end of the experiment fig s4 the cake fouling resistance accounted for 69 82 of the total fouling resistance which was consistent with previous studies derlon et al 2016 shao et al 2017 the high proportion of cake fouling resistance suggested that the composition and morphology of the cake layer was the key factor determining the flux of gdm systems employment of membrane relaxation or shear stress alone had an insignificant influence on the stable flux p 0 1 as evidenced by the overlapped flux curves fig 1a at the stage of flux decline the flux recovery after physical cleaning was monitored fig 1b right after standstill or flushing the instantaneous flux was moderately recovered however after resuming filtration for 30 min the instantaneous flux was equal or even lower than that before standstill or flushing this phenomenon also implied the limited improvement of flux by applying membrane relaxation or shear stress alone a previous study reported that a long intermittent interval could increase permeate flux peter varbanets et al 2012 we thus extended the intermittent interval to 6 days at days 85 91 and 16 days at days 41 57 and higher recovery of instantaneous flux was achieved however the flux quickly returned to its initial level after 2 7 days and the stable fluxes before and after the long term relaxation period were almost the same consequently the increase in permeate flux could not offset the decrease in water production in the intervals since the permeate flux stabilized again within one week after resuming operation no significant effect was found on the performance of gdm system a combination of shear stress and membrane relaxation significantly improved the flux of the gdm system with the stable flux increased by 70 compared with that in the control gdm system the decrease of instantaneous flux after the combined cleaning was also much slower fig 1b and more than 6 h was demanded for the flux decreasing to the stable level based on the analysis of hydraulic resistance the permeability enhancement is owing to the reduction of biofouling layer resistance whereas the physically irreversible resistance mainly caused by pore blocking or constriction of all the test systems had no significant difference the result shows that the joint action of membrane relaxation and shear stress enhanced the stable flux by changing the characteristics of the biofouling layer low or even negative removal efficiencies of organic substances were found in all gdm systems by comparing the concentration of doc uv254 aoc and fluorescent organic substances in feed water and permeate fig s5a b c in previous study a higher organic removal was found during stabilized filtration stage compared with initial stage as the biofouling layer developed wang et al 2017 shao et al 2018 especially for the removal of aoc wu et al 2017 chomiak et al 2015 however when the concentration of particulate organic matter is relatively high in the influent particulate organic matter transformed into dissolved organic matter in the biofouling layer resulting in the increased concentration of organics in the effluent shao et al 2017 in this study with daily flushing the removal of toc and uv254 comparatively increased this result could be explained by the fact that part of the organic matter rejected on the membrane surface was likely to be flushed away with the crossflow which reduced the transformation of particulate organic matter to dissolved organic matter the presence of an intermittent period might facilitate this effect of the shear stress resulting in higher removal of organic matter hong et al 2002 3 2 morphology of the biofouling layer from the morphology of the biofouling layer the system operated intermittently without shear stress showed little difference with the control system indicated by the similar thickness and roughness of the two fouling layers p 0 5 fig 2 a oct images of the two biofouling layers also suggested a similar morphology fig 2b1 b2 not just at the end of the experiment the thickness and roughness of the biofouling layer in the two gdm systems were almost the same at the whole filtration fig s6a b these results suggested that the 60 min intermission hardly affected the morphology of the biofouling layer resulting in the similar permeate flux in the presence of the shear stress alone the thickness and roughness of biofouling layers were lowered fig 2a so did the relative roughness ratio of roughness to thickness fig s7 according to the oct images fig 2b3 and the top view pictures fig s8c a relatively thinner and smoother biofouling layer was formed in the gdm system with the flush lower surface roughness may cause a higher hydraulic resistance of the biofouling layer wang et al 2017 but decreased biomass accumulation may not derlon et al 2013 therefore no evident reduction was observed in hydraulic resistance fig s4 since the structure of biofouling layer rather than the amount of biomass was the key factor to the hydraulic resistance the formation of a relatively smooth and spatially homogeneous fouling layer as observed in oct images fig 2b was adverse to the improvement of stable flux of gdm system derlon et al 2012 2013 fortunato et al 2020 a combination of shear stress and membrane relaxation led to a biofouling layer with similar thickness and roughness p 0 05 fig 2a but a larger relative roughness fig s7 compared with the control it was certified by the top view fig s8d that a mottled and heterogeneous biofouling layer was displayed via oct technique a more open and spatially heterogeneous biofouling was shown in such a system fig 2b4 which showed a tendency to detach from the membrane surface with the formation of cavities and channel networks near the membrane surface such heterogeneous structures and channel networks resulted in a significant decrease in resistance of the fouling layer over time peter varbanets et al 2011b 3 3 composition of the biofouling layer the contents of eps and atp in the fouling layer are shown in fig 3 a in the presence of membrane relaxation or shear stress solely a slight decrease of eps content was found decreased by 11 3 and 17 9 respectively while in combination a higher reduction was obtained decreased by 36 1 the eps contents in the biofouling layer fitted well with the corresponding hydraulic resistance r 2 0 953 indicating that eps might be a determining factor in the hydraulic resistance derlon et al 2016 also reported that eps matrix was the main constituent part of biofilms and was the primary cause of the hydraulic resistance the protein content of the four systems had no significant difference but as to the polysaccharide content the variation was considerable fig 3a especially for the system operated intermittently with flushing polysaccharide content of the fouling layer was only 30 3 of that of the control group desmond et al 2018a b have proposed that functional groups had a spatially heterogeneous distribution which limited electrostatic interactions and the formation of a compact homogeneous construction otherwise at lower polysaccharide concentrations therefore the low polysaccharide content was beneficial to the formation of the loose and heterogeneous biofouling layer in the gdm system operated intermittently with daily flushing with the daily influence of shear stress by flushing the content of eps decreased while that of atp increased fig 3a for the systems without flushing more eps excretion and lower microbial activity certified the aging of the fouling layer xu et al 2015 this result suggests that shear stress could improve microbial activity and more nutrient substances were consumed accordingly rochex et al 2008 also reported a tendency of slower maturation rate and maintaining young to the biofilm under the shear stress no evident difference was found for the ts content in the four gdm systems fig 3b the level of vs in the system operated intermittently with flushing was 34 2 lower than the control group showing a lower concentration of degradable organic matter because the deposition of inorganic particles is highly related to the total volume of filtered water v and the attachment detachment of particles ratio of inorganic matter mass ts vs in the fouling layer to v was used to quantify the deposition efficiency of the inorganic particles on the fouling layer shao et al 2019 in the presence of shear stress inorganic particles were less likely to deposit onto the membrane surface part of the particles on the surface of the fouling layer was prone to be washed away by flushing before the formation of strong bonds between the inorganic particles and macromolecules such as eps xu et al 2015 moreover higher microbial activity may cause the formation of cavities in the biofouling layer derlon et al 2012 thus decreasing the contact area between particles which facilitated the detachment 4 discussion 4 1 membrane relaxation did not increase the water production to better understand the effect of relaxation on the biofouling layer in situ oct observation was carried on several times at the fixed point during standstill periods in the no flux period the thickness of biofouling had a steep increase in the first 10 min and plateaued afterward fig 4 a in the three observations the biofouling layer thickness increased by 20 4 66 8 within 60 min intermission the increase of thickness arose from two reasons 1 the expansion of biofouling layer caused by reverse diffusion 2 the detachment of fouling layer which brought about the formation of cavities and channels inside the biofouling layer the expansion existed throughout the whole relaxation period while the detachment only distinct at the early stage by calculation the expansion of biofouling layer account for more than 70 of the increase of the thickness thusdominating the thickness increase different from previous studies hong et al 2002 tmp generated by water head difference always existed in this study including the standstill period when filtration was stopped the pushing force caused by water flow was disappeared and the biofouling layer would expand considering its elastic structure jafari et al 2019 besides without the pushing force a force imbalance on the top and bottom of the biofouling layer would be expected which might cause the formation of the cavities and channels however the thickness of the biofouling layer quickly restored to this initial level when resuming filtration for about 10 min the morphology of the fouling layer had no significant difference before and after intermittence through oct images fig 4b1 b3 this phenomenon shows that an intermission only caused a reversible deformation of the biofouling layer consequently a limited change of the morphology composition and hydraulic resistance of the biofouling layer figs 2a and 3a b and fig s4 when the intermittent interval was longer microbial activity in the biofouling layer resulted in a higher flux recovery fig s9 derlon et al 2012 2013 peter varbanets et al 2012 however after resuming filtration for several days the flux returned to the initial level with the accumulation of foulants and the change of biofouling layer structure the increased flux in the several days could not offset the decreased water production at the interval therefore membrane relaxation alone could not improve the water production of the gdm system 4 2 shear stress did not enhance the stable flux considering the low maintenance of gdm system the duration of flushing was relatively short in this study within such a short action time the relatively low shear stress τ 0 4 pa hardly affected the stable flux fig 1a although some changes occurred in the biofouling layer figs 2 3 through oct images analysis before and after flushing one time the morphology of the biofouling layer displayed no significant difference indicated by the similar thickness and roughness p 0 05 fig 5 a only some minor abrasion on the surface of the biofouling layer could be found fig 5b1 2 this can be confirmed by the result of ts vs v only decreased by 13 5 fig 3b during the long term operation the growth of thickness and surface roughness of the biofouling layer with shear stress alone was relatively slow fig s6 it is consistent with the result of a study by desmond et al 2018a b that erosion on the top of the biofouling layer only caused a slight decrease in hydraulic resistance besides during continuous filtration the biofouling layer was compressed by transmembrane pressure and water pushing force fig 4 and interaction between particles was strong therefore momentary flushing could only scour the biofouling surface but hardly affect the internal structure of the biofouling layer consequently a smooth biofouling layer with a compact internal structure was formed in the long term filtration derlon et al 2013 reported that permeate flux was strongly correlated with the structure of the biofilm rather than the biomass accumulation derlon et al 2012 desmond et al 2018a b also reported that the detachment of biofouling was influenced by its construction therefore under the action of shear force erosion on the top of the biofouling layer only caused a slight decrease in hydraulic resistance 4 3 membrane relaxation coupled with shear stress significantly enhanced the stable flux under the joint action of membrane relaxation and shear stress the surface roughness of the biofouling layer could be maintained the accumulation of foulants on the membrane decreased and stable flux significantly increased via oct observation just as membrane relaxation alone the thickness of the biofouling layer increased and cavities and channel networks formed within the standstill period fig 6a1 2 after flushing foulants on the membrane surface were partially washed away fig 6a3 the quantification of ts vs v also certified a higher foulant detachment efficiency 33 3 at the joint action of membrane relaxation and shear stress moreover because of the rough surface changes in the morphology of the biofouling layer in the valley could be found therefore in this case shear stress could not only scour the surface but also bring about an effect in deeper places of the biofouling layer cfd simulation was carried through to the cross flow process right after the 60 min interval in the chamber the surface of biofouling layer was simplified to a waterproof wall vortexes were found above the biofouling layer indicating the existence of the ununiformed flow field fig 6b1 2 owing to the rough surface of the biofouling layer in the presence of such an uneven flow field unbalanced and fluctuating forces on the biofouling layer would be expected considering the porous biofouling layer with cavities and channels these forces could disturb the interior of the biofouling layer the unbalanced force also caused uneven detachment of the foulants fig 6a2 3 which helped the biofouling layer maintain its surface roughness in conclude a biofouling layer with a rough surface and loose internal structure could intensify the flow disturbance caused by shear stress and its morphological characteristics could be preserved the formation of a more open and heterogeneous biofouling layer was beneficial to the improvement of the stable flux of the gdm system derlon et al 2013 5 conclusions this study investigated the effect of membrane relaxation shear stress and their combination on the stable flux and biofouling layer of the gravity driven membrane filtration system the following conclusions can be drawn the single action of membrane relaxation or shear stress could not significantly improve the stable flux of gdm system while the joint action of the two enhanced the stable flux by 70 in the absence of water pushing force during the standstill period the force imbalance induced a highly reversible deformation of the biofouling layer and alleviated the hydraulic resistance thus no evident change was found in the morphology or composition of biofouling layer with membrane relaxation the single action of shear stress within a short duration led to a thinner and smoother biofouling layer in the long run but it had little effect on the internal structure of biofouling layer therefore it was ineffective in markedly improving the stable permeate flux cross flow right after the membrane relaxation of membrane biofouling caused a higher reduction of foulants accumulation more importantly an uneven flow field would disturb the interior of the biofouling layer with cavities and channel networks the presence of flow perturbations on both the surface and interior of the biofouling layer helped maintain the surface roughness and spatially heterogeneous structure consequently increased the stable flux declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18024,gravity driven membrane gdm filtration system is a promising process for decentralized drinking water treatment during the operation membrane relaxation and shear stress could be simply achieved by intermittent filtration and water disturbance created by occasionally shaking membrane model or stirring water in membrane tank respectively to better understand the impact of membrane relaxation and shear stress on the biofouling layer and stable flux in gdm system action of daily 60 min intermission daily flushing cross flow velocity 10 cm s 1 1 min and the combination of the two flushed right after the 60 min intermission were compared the results showed that membrane relaxation and shear stress lonely was ineffective in improving the stable flux while their combination enhanced the stable flux by 70 a more open and spatially heterogeneous biofouling layer with a low extracellular polymeric substance eps content and a high microbial activity was formed under the combination of membrane relaxation and shear stress in situ optical coherence tomography oct observation revealed that during intermission the absence of pushing force by water flow induced a reversible expansion of biofouling layer and the biofouling layer restored to its initial state soon after resuming filtration shear stress caused abrasion and erosion on the biofouling surface but it exerted little effect on the interior of biofouling layer under the combination however both the surface and interior of biofouling layer were disturbed because of 1 the water vortexes caused by rough biofouling layer surface and 2 the porous structure after 60 min intermission this disturbance in turn helped the biofouling layer maintain its roughness and porosity thereby improving the stable flux of gdm system graphical abstract image 1 keywords gdm system membrane relaxation shear stress biofouling layer stable flux 1 introduction gravity driven membrane gdm filtration system a type of ultrafiltration uf driven by hydrostatic pressure 100 cm water head is a novel membrane based decentralized drinking water treatment process peter varbanets et al 2010 2011a because of the activity of microorganisms the biofouling layer formed on the membrane surface can keep a loose structure with stable hydraulic resistances peter varbanets et al 2011b consequently the flux of gdm system could be stabilized for several months to years without any physical or chemical cleaning pronk et al 2019 however this stable flux is one order of magnitude lower than that in the typical uf process which is a major obstacle to the widespread application of gdm system in membrane based water treatment system the flux constant filtration mode could be readily enhanced by physical cleaning such as air sparging membrane relaxation and backwashing shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 considering the low maintenance of gdm system the maintenance intensive physical cleaning methods e g backwashing are generally unfavorable however some simple physical cleaning methods are still feasible in specific cases for example membrane relaxation can be simply realized by intermittent operation through opening and closing the outlet valve peter varbanets et al 2012 shear stress could be generated by draining filling of the membrane tank shaking of membrane module stirring of water in the membrane tank and even air sparging lee et al 2019 using manual bellows fig s1 therefore membrane relaxation and shear stress could be introduced into the gdm system without dramatically increasing its mechanical and operational complexity nor its capital cost and operating cost when applied intermittent filtration in membrane based systems such as membrane bioreactors membrane foulants would back transport to the bulk solution under concentration gradients hong et al 2002 shi et al 2014 and the biofouling layer has an expansion period van der marel et al 2009 thus alleviating membrane fouling tang et al 2016 shear stress can detach the foulants from the membrane surface choi and morgenroth 2003 ramasamy and zhang 2005 therefore it is acknowledged as an effective cleaning method however shear stress may also selectively detach the large particles and leave small particles on the membrane surface thus leading to a denser fouling layer ding et al 2016 paul et al 2012 biofouling layer is the decisive factor of the flux in the gdm system peter varbanets et al 2010 and has some unique features under ultra low pressure and ultra low flux conditions e g open and heterogeneous structure martin et al 2014 peter varbanets et al 2011a hence such a biofouling layer may have some different responses to intermittent filtration and shear stress previous studies reported that adding a standstill period prior to daily forward flushing peter varbanets et al 2012 air sparging oka et al 2017 and backwash fortunato et al 2020 significantly increased the stable flux of the gdm system nonetheless it is still unclear how the biofouling layer responds to membrane relaxation and shear force and their corresponding effects to stable flux optical coherence tomography oct is a powerful tool for in situ and noninvasive observation of biofouling layer and its formation fortunato et al 2019 gao et al 2014 based on the images acquired using oct the morphological parameters of biofouling layer such as thickness and roughness can be online monitored wagner and horn 2017 in previous studies the deformation of biofilm was observed under the varieties of transmembrane pressure tmp flux and shear stress desmond et al 2018a b jafari et al 2019 picioreanu et al 2018 therefore this technology is suitable to investigate the responses of biofouling layer to membrane relaxation and shear stress and establish the relationship between the performance and the characteristics of biofouling layer therefore this study compared the effect of membrane relaxation shear stress and membrane relaxation shear stress on the permeate flux and the properties of biofouling layers in the gdm system with the in situ visualization of biofouling layer using an oct we discussed the underlying mechanisms for the influences of membrane relaxation and shear stress this study intended to highlight that membrane relaxation and shear stress alone might not be effective in increasing the water production of the gdm system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 feed water raw water was periodically collected from the donghu lake from july to november 2019 the feed water was characterized by a total organic carbon toc of 6 1 7 1 mg l 1 an ultraviolet absorbance uv254 of 0 087 0 110 au cm 1 a turbidity of 0 5 3 0 ntu and an assimilable organic carbon aoc of 11 7 74 0 μg l 1 the water temperature was maintained at 20 2 c using an air conditioner 2 1 2 membrane and membrane module a flat sheet poly ethersulfone pes membrane with a molecular weight cut off of 150 kda was used microdyn nadir germany and its permeability was 9 78 0 48 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 at 20 c the membrane was soaked in 25 isopropanol solution for 12 h and then cleaned with pure water for 24 h before use membrane modules were made of plexiglass with a chamber dimension of 35 140 1 5 mm width length height the membrane was sandwiched between the two parts of membrane module and sealed with a silicon o ring the effective filtration area of the module was 42 2 cm2 2 2 system setup the gdm system had a feed water reservoir which placed at a suitable height to provide a driving force fig s2 a constant level tank distributed the feed water to every membrane module a tmp of 5 5 kpa was offered by the water head difference between the water levels of the constant level water tank and the permeate outlet valve 1 and valve 2 were equipped at the permeate outlet and the cross flow outlet respectively during the filtration valve 1 was open and valve 2 was closed while valve 1 was closed and valve 2 was open when flushing was carried on in the standstill period both two valves were closed the flushing flow was collected with a water tank and the water was pumped back to the feed water tank after flushing the gdm systems were operated in four modes one gdm system was operated continuously without flushing control one was operated intermittently without flushing inr one operated continuously with daily flushing flush the other operated intermittently with daily flushing at the end of the intermission inr flush for each mode two modules were operated in parallel the flushing was driven by gravitational pressures at a cross flow velocity of 10 cm s 1 with feed water which was selected based on the cross flow membrane filtration in previous studies lee et al 2001 wang and tang 2011 youm et al 1996 according to the formula used by desmond et al 2018a b the shear stress during flushing was 0 4 pa which was at the range of that generally applied in uf the cross flow lasted 1 min per day once while the intermittence lasted 60 min per day once which would neither cause much loss of throughput capacity nor increase the mechanical and operational complexity of the system oka et al 2017 the experimental results also indicated that the 60 min membrane relaxation had less than 5 impact on daily water production two types of permeate flux was used in this experiment real time flux and average flux in most cases flux represented average flux and real time flux was only used to calculate the flux recovery after physical cleaning the flux was calculated based on the weight changes of permeate bottles with time which was monitored using a balance with the accuracy of 0 01 g lq c30002 lucky china the average flux was calculated based on the weight change per day and the real time flux was calculated based on the weight change per 2 min 2 3 fouling resistance the relationship between permeate flux and hydraulic resistance is given by equation 1 based on darcy s law broeckmann et al 2006 foley 2013 lee et al 2019 1 j tmp μ r t where j is the permeate flux in m3 m 2 s 1 the tmp is the transmembrane pressure in pa μ is the dynamic viscosity of water in pa s 1 005 10 3 pa s r t represents the total hydraulic resistance in m 1 the total resistance r t can be equal to the sum of individual resistances 2 r t r m r r r ir where r m is the pristine membrane resistance which was measured using virgin membrane and pure water r r is the physically recoverable fouling resistance that can be removed by physical cleaning r ir is the physically irrecoverable fouling resistance that is resulted from membrane pore blocking and constriction r r and r ir were determined at the end of the experiment after the membrane was flushed with phosphate buffer saline until no biofouling layer was visible on the membrane surface 2 4 optical coherence tomography in situ images of the biofouling layer were non destructively performed using an oct gan210c1 thorlab usa in each observation twelve spots were evenly selected on the membrane surface to analyze the thickness and roughness of the biofouling layer to compare the morphology of biofouling layer before and after flushing and to observe its variation in the standstill period a fixed point was selected for observation by fixing the lens of oct and the location of the membrane and marking on the surface of the membrane module to prevent displacement while flushing the size of the monitored area was 3 2 1 5 mm for each system twelve oct images were acquired during every test the raw images were thresholded and binarized with imagej 1 50i nih usa the features of biofouling layer morphology were computed using a matlab code according to the equations reported in previous studies fortunato and leiknes 2017 wagner and horn 2017 2 5 composition analysis of biofouling layer to better understand the response of biofouling to membrane relaxation and shear stress the composition of the biofouling layer was characterized

quantification the total content of eps in the extracts was represented by protein and polysaccharides jiang et al 2020 the bicinchoninic acid bca assay sangon biological engineering technology services co ltd shanghai china was used for protein measurement with bovine serum albumin as the standard polysaccharides quantification was carried out using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 with glucose as the standard 2 5 3 total solid ts and volatile solid vs ts was used to quantify the total accumulation of organic and inorganic matter on the membrane surface while vs was applied to represent the organic matter the biofouling layer solution collected in a crucible was first dried in an oven at the temperature of 105 c then burned in a muffle furnace at the temperature of 600 c the changes in the crucible weight were used to calculate the value of ts and vs 2 6 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation a two dimensional cfd numerical simulation was carried out to reveal the distribution of flow field on the surface of the biofouling layer when flushing the biofouling layer was simplified as a waterproof wall a pressure based solver in the cfd software ansys

against time in fig 1 a although the gdm systems were operated with different physical cleaning the changes of flux in all the systems followed a two stage trend peter varbanets et al 2010 sharply deceased in the first several days and then stabilized after a 20 day operation according to the hydraulic resistance analysis at the end of the experiment fig s4 the cake fouling resistance accounted for 69 82 of the total fouling resistance which was consistent with previous studies derlon et al 2016 shao et al 2017 the high proportion of cake fouling resistance suggested that the composition and morphology of the cake layer was the key factor determining the flux of gdm systems employment of membrane relaxation or shear stress alone had an insignificant influence on the stable flux p 0 1 as evidenced by the overlapped flux curves fig 1a at the stage of flux decline the flux recovery after physical cleaning was monitored fig 1b right after standstill or flushing the instantaneous flux was moderately recovered however after resuming filtration for 30 min the instantaneous flux was equal or even lower than that before standstill or flushing this phenomenon also implied the limited improvement of flux by applying membrane relaxation or shear stress alone a previous study reported that a long intermittent interval could increase permeate flux peter varbanets et al 2012 we thus extended the intermittent interval to 6 days at days 85 91 and 16 days at days 41 57 and higher recovery of instantaneous flux was achieved however the flux quickly returned to its initial level after 2 7 days and the stable fluxes before and after the long term relaxation period were almost the same consequently the increase in permeate flux could not offset the decrease in water production in the intervals since the permeate flux stabilized again within one week after resuming operation no significant effect was found on the performance of gdm system a combination of shear stress and membrane relaxation significantly improved the flux of the gdm system with the stable flux increased by 70 compared with that in the control gdm system the decrease of instantaneous flux after the combined cleaning was also much slower fig 1b and more than 6 h was demanded for the flux decreasing to the stable level based on the analysis of hydraulic resistance the permeability enhancement is owing to the reduction of biofouling layer resistance whereas the physically irreversible resistance mainly caused by pore blocking or constriction of all the test systems had no significant difference the result shows that the joint action of membrane relaxation and shear stress enhanced the stable flux by changing the characteristics of the biofouling layer low or even negative removal efficiencies of organic substances were found in all gdm systems by comparing the concentration of doc uv254 aoc and fluorescent organic substances in feed water and permeate fig s5a b c in previous study a higher organic removal was found during stabilized filtration stage compared with initial stage as the biofouling layer developed wang et al 2017 shao et al 2018 especially for the removal of aoc wu et al 2017 chomiak et al 2015 however when the concentration of particulate organic matter is relatively high in the influent particulate organic matter transformed into dissolved organic matter in the biofouling layer resulting in the increased concentration of organics in the effluent shao et al 2017 in this study with daily flushing the removal of toc and uv254 comparatively increased this result could be explained by the fact that part of the organic matter rejected on the membrane surface was likely to be flushed away with the crossflow which reduced the transformation of particulate organic matter to dissolved organic matter the presence of an intermittent period might facilitate this effect of the shear stress resulting in higher removal of organic matter hong et al 2002 3 2 morphology of the biofouling layer from the morphology of the biofouling layer the system operated intermittently without shear stress showed little difference with the control system indicated by the similar thickness and roughness of the two fouling layers p 0 5 fig 2 a oct images of the two biofouling layers also suggested a similar morphology fig 2b1 b2 not just at the end of the experiment the thickness and roughness of the biofouling layer in the two gdm systems were almost the same at the whole filtration fig s6a b these results suggested that the 60 min intermission hardly affected the morphology of the biofouling layer resulting in the similar permeate flux in the presence of the shear stress alone the thickness and roughness of biofouling layers were lowered fig 2a so did the relative roughness ratio of roughness to thickness fig s7 according to the oct images fig 2b3 and the top view pictures fig s8c a relatively thinner and smoother biofouling layer was formed in the gdm system with the flush lower surface roughness may cause a higher hydraulic resistance of the biofouling layer wang et al 2017 but decreased biomass accumulation may not derlon et al 2013 therefore no evident reduction was observed in hydraulic resistance fig s4 since the structure of biofouling layer rather than the amount of biomass was the key factor to the hydraulic resistance the formation of a relatively smooth and spatially homogeneous fouling layer as observed in oct images fig 2b was adverse to the improvement of stable flux of gdm system derlon et al 2012 2013 fortunato et al 2020 a combination of shear stress and membrane relaxation led to a biofouling layer with similar thickness and roughness p 0 05 fig 2a but a larger relative roughness fig s7 compared with the control it was certified by the top view fig s8d that a mottled and heterogeneous biofouling layer was displayed via oct technique a more open and spatially heterogeneous biofouling was shown in such a system fig 2b4 which showed a tendency to detach from the membrane surface with the formation of cavities and channel networks near the membrane surface such heterogeneous structures and channel networks resulted in a significant decrease in resistance of the fouling layer over time peter varbanets et al 2011b 3 3 composition of the biofouling layer the contents of eps and atp in the fouling layer are shown in fig 3 a in the presence of membrane relaxation or shear stress solely a slight decrease of eps content was found decreased by 11 3 and 17 9 respectively while in combination a higher reduction was obtained decreased by 36 1 the eps contents in the biofouling layer fitted well with the corresponding hydraulic resistance r 2 0 953 indicating that eps might be a determining factor in the hydraulic resistance derlon et al 2016 also reported that eps matrix was the main constituent part of biofilms and was the primary cause of the hydraulic resistance the protein content of the four systems had no significant difference but as to the polysaccharide content the variation was considerable fig 3a especially for the system operated intermittently with flushing polysaccharide content of the fouling layer was only 30 3 of that of the control group desmond et al 2018a b have proposed that functional groups had a spatially heterogeneous distribution which limited electrostatic interactions and the formation of a compact homogeneous construction otherwise at lower polysaccharide concentrations therefore the low polysaccharide content was beneficial to the formation of the loose and heterogeneous biofouling layer in the gdm system operated intermittently with daily flushing with the daily influence of shear stress by flushing the content of eps decreased while that of atp increased fig 3a for the systems without flushing more eps excretion and lower microbial activity certified the aging of the fouling layer xu et al 2015 this result suggests that shear stress could improve microbial activity and more nutrient substances were consumed accordingly rochex et al 2008 also reported a tendency of slower maturation rate and maintaining young to the biofilm under the shear stress no evident difference was found for the ts content in the four gdm systems fig 3b the level of vs in the system operated intermittently with flushing was 34 2 lower than the control group showing a lower concentration of degradable organic matter because the deposition of inorganic particles is highly related to the total volume of filtered water v and the attachment detachment of particles ratio of inorganic matter mass ts vs in the fouling layer to v was used to quantify the deposition efficiency of the inorganic particles on the fouling layer shao et al 2019 in the presence of shear stress inorganic particles were less likely to deposit onto the membrane surface part of the particles on the surface of the fouling layer was prone to be washed away by flushing before the formation of strong bonds between the inorganic particles and macromolecules such as eps xu et al 2015 moreover higher microbial activity may cause the formation of cavities in the biofouling layer derlon et al 2012 thus decreasing the contact area between particles which facilitated the detachment 4 discussion 4 1 membrane relaxation did not increase the water production to better understand the effect of relaxation on the biofouling layer in situ oct observation was carried on several times at the fixed point during standstill periods in the no flux period the thickness of biofouling had a steep increase in the first 10 min and plateaued afterward fig 4 a in the three observations the biofouling layer thickness increased by 20 4 66 8 within 60 min intermission the increase of thickness arose from two reasons 1 the expansion of biofouling layer caused by reverse diffusion 2 the detachment of fouling layer which brought about the formation of cavities and channels inside the biofouling layer the expansion existed throughout the whole relaxation period while the detachment only distinct at the early stage by calculation the expansion of biofouling layer account for more than 70 of the increase of the thickness thusdominating the thickness increase different from previous studies hong et al 2002 tmp generated by water head difference always existed in this study including the standstill period when filtration was stopped the pushing force caused by water flow was disappeared and the biofouling layer would expand considering its elastic structure jafari et al 2019 besides without the pushing force a force imbalance on the top and bottom of the biofouling layer would be expected which might cause the formation of the cavities and channels however the thickness of the biofouling layer quickly restored to this initial level when resuming filtration for about 10 min the morphology of the fouling layer had no significant difference before and after intermittence through oct images fig 4b1 b3 this phenomenon shows that an intermission only caused a reversible deformation of the biofouling layer consequently a limited change of the morphology composition and hydraulic resistance of the biofouling layer figs 2a and 3a b and fig s4 when the intermittent interval was longer microbial activity in the biofouling layer resulted in a higher flux recovery fig s9 derlon et al 2012 2013 peter varbanets et al 2012 however after resuming filtration for several days the flux returned to the initial level with the accumulation of foulants and the change of biofouling layer structure the increased flux in the several days could not offset the decreased water production at the interval therefore membrane relaxation alone could not improve the water production of the gdm system 4 2 shear stress did not enhance the stable flux considering the low maintenance of gdm system the duration of flushing was relatively short in this study within such a short action time the relatively low shear stress τ 0 4 pa hardly affected the stable flux fig 1a although some changes occurred in the biofouling layer figs 2 3 through oct images analysis before and after flushing one time the morphology of the biofouling layer displayed no significant difference indicated by the similar thickness and roughness p 0 05 fig 5 a only some minor abrasion on the surface of the biofouling layer could be found fig 5b1 2 this can be confirmed by the result of ts vs v only decreased by 13 5 fig 3b during the long term operation the growth of thickness and surface roughness of the biofouling layer with shear stress alone was relatively slow fig s6 it is consistent with the result of a study by desmond et al 2018a b that erosion on the top of the biofouling layer only caused a slight decrease in hydraulic resistance besides during continuous filtration the biofouling layer was compressed by transmembrane pressure and water pushing force fig 4 and interaction between particles was strong therefore momentary flushing could only scour the biofouling surface but hardly affect the internal structure of the biofouling layer consequently a smooth biofouling layer with a compact internal structure was formed in the long term filtration derlon et al 2013 reported that permeate flux was strongly correlated with the structure of the biofilm rather than the biomass accumulation derlon et al 2012 desmond et al 2018a b also reported that the detachment of biofouling was influenced by its construction therefore under the action of shear force erosion on the top of the biofouling layer only caused a slight decrease in hydraulic resistance 4 3 membrane relaxation coupled with shear stress significantly enhanced the stable flux under the joint action of membrane relaxation and shear stress the surface roughness of the biofouling layer could be maintained the accumulation of foulants on the membrane decreased and stable flux significantly increased via oct observation just as membrane relaxation alone the thickness of the biofouling layer increased and cavities and channel networks formed within the standstill period fig 6a1 2 after flushing foulants on the membrane surface were partially washed away fig 6a3 the quantification of ts vs v also certified a higher foulant detachment efficiency 33 3 at the joint action of membrane relaxation and shear stress moreover because of the rough surface changes in the morphology of the biofouling layer in the valley could be found therefore in this case shear stress could not only scour the surface but also bring about an effect in deeper places of the biofouling layer cfd simulation was carried through to the cross flow process right after the 60 min interval in the chamber the surface of biofouling layer was simplified to a waterproof wall vortexes were found above the biofouling layer indicating the existence of the ununiformed flow field fig 6b1 2 owing to the rough surface of the biofouling layer in the presence of such an uneven flow field unbalanced and fluctuating forces on the biofouling layer would be expected considering the porous biofouling layer with cavities and channels these forces could disturb the interior of the biofouling layer the unbalanced force also caused uneven detachment of the foulants fig 6a2 3 which helped the biofouling layer maintain its surface roughness in conclude a biofouling layer with a rough surface and loose internal structure could intensify the flow disturbance caused by shear stress and its morphological characteristics could be preserved the formation of a more open and heterogeneous biofouling layer was beneficial to the improvement of the stable flux of the gdm system derlon et al 2013 5 conclusions this study investigated the effect of membrane relaxation shear stress and their combination on the stable flux and biofouling layer of the gravity driven membrane filtration system the following conclusions can be drawn the single action of membrane relaxation or shear stress could not significantly improve the stable flux of gdm system while the joint action of the two enhanced the stable flux by 70 in the absence of water pushing force during the standstill period the force imbalance induced a highly reversible deformation of the biofouling layer and alleviated the hydraulic resistance thus no evident change was found in the morphology or composition of biofouling layer with membrane relaxation the single action of shear stress within a short duration led to a thinner and smoother biofouling layer in the long run but it had little effect on the internal structure of biofouling layer therefore it was ineffective in markedly improving the stable permeate flux cross flow right after the membrane relaxation of membrane biofouling caused a higher reduction of foulants accumulation more importantly an uneven flow field would disturb the interior of the biofouling layer with cavities and channel networks the presence of flow perturbations on both the surface and interior of the biofouling layer helped maintain the surface roughness and spatially heterogeneous structure consequently increased the stable flux declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
