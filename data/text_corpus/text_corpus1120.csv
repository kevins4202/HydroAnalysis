5600,mechanical removal of encroached juniper juniperus spp is a common practice to restore native grasslands however the hydrological responses to grassland restoration remain mostly unquantified for the climate transition zone in the southern great plains of the usa where ecosystem evapotranspiration is highly sensitive to the change of vegetation functional type we used a paired watershed approach to directly quantify the impact of mechanical removal of eastern redcedar juniperus virginiana l redcedar and restoration to native prairie or establishment of switchgrass panicum virgatum l on root zone soil moisture and event based runoff for eight years including three main phases calibration transition and restored grassland in north central oklahoma usa results showed that the root zone soil water storage on average increased 1 6 and 1 9 times for restored prairie and switchgrass respectively after juniper removal the regression model estimation based on the relationships established in the calibration phases between event based runoff from control watershed and the treatment watersheds found that the restored prairie and switchgrass production system increased annual runoff by 4 46 and 4 54 times respectively these results indicated that both soil moisture and runoff are highly responsive to land use change in the southern great plains reestablishment of herbaceous dominance by mechanically removing encroached woody species is closely followed by restoration of soil moisture dynamics and watershed runoff regime keywords eastern redcedar land use management switchgrass tallgrass prairie oklahoma 1 introduction change in land surface condition and increased climate variability impose a great challenge on sustainable management of watersheds and water resources in the climate transition zone of the southern and central great plains usa ojima et al 1999 sun et al 2008 an important land surface change in this region is associated with the transition from herbaceous plant dominance to woody plant dominance characterized by a juniper species juniperus virginiana l eastern redcedar or redcedar encroachment in the prairie and oak savannas of the central great plains briggs et al 2005 hoff et al 2018 this transition is associated mainly with a disruption of the historical fire regime and causes a decline or loss of prairie productivity norris et al 2001 ganguli et al 2016 plant biodiversity van els et al 2010 and avian and mammalian biodiversity horncastle et al 2004 importantly the soil moisture dynamics are substantially altered and water yield is reduced zou et al 2014 qiao et al 2017 acharya et al 2018 mechanical removal of juniper trees is an effective approach to quickly reclaim encroached land parcels morton et al 2010 however site disturbance associated with mechanical operations could cause excessive surface runoff and potential soil erosion if not appropriately managed also after juniper removal the watershed will revegetate and can restore to prairie naturally or be planted with species such as switchgrass panicum virgatum l for biomass production however it is unknown how the root zone soil moisture condition and runoff regime will differ between pre and post treatment conditions and between these two potential land use options that both restore herbaceous plant dominance due to reduced evapotranspiration reducing woody canopy can increase streamflow in the semiarid and subhumid regions in the usa zou et al 2010 madsen et al 2011 madsen et al 2012 roundy et al 2014 however there is a limitation regarding the vegetation induced change in evapotranspiration et the magnitude of vegetation induced change is likely the greatest where precipitation approximately equals potential evapotranspiration pet zhang et al 2001 huxman et al 2005 in wetter areas where precipitation exceeds pet vegetation change may have less effect because excess precipitation causes runoff while in drier areas a large deficit between precipitation and pet causes runoff events to be rare huxman et al 2005 in low precipitation regions several recent studies showed that woody canopy removal did not result in a measurable increase in streamflow guardiola claramonte et al 2011 biederman et al 2015 williams et al 2018 and that streamflow did not increase in most basins following the loss of tree canopy due to tree die off biederman et al 2015 the current consensus is that the effect of tree or brush removal on the streamflow is minimal where annual precipitation is 500 mm archer and predick 2014 in contrast deforestation in high precipitation regions has been a significant contributor of soil erosion and large scale deforestation in the cloud forest and tropical rainforest may even reduce runoff by suppressing the positive feedback between soil moisture and precipitation junkermann et al 2009 lawrence and vandecar 2015 consequently vegetation change should have maximal hydrological consequences in the forest and grassland transition zone such as the southern and central great plains of the usa encompassing a precipitation gradient from 500 mm to 1000 mm fig 1 a as the climate in the transition zone is becoming more variable and the demand for water continues to increase control of invasive and encroaching woody species to increase streamflow is an important consideration however the effectiveness of woody vegetation removal within the forest and grassland transition zone e g the southern and central great plains remains unknown for this region increases in the runoff after woody vegetation removal have been generally estimated through hydrological modeling afinowicz et al 2005 with few empirical data to verify modeling conclusions the impact and response of experiments measuring runoff after removing trees could be subject to three types of uncertainties failure to detect the change in runoff after tree removal could result from the mismatch in scale between the treatment area and the total area contributing to streamflow wilcox et al 2006 biederman et al 2015 mcdonald et al 2015 also how the woody vegetation regrowth or regeneration is managed after harvesting could affect the runoff response biederman et al 2015 if woody plants re sprout and reoccupy the same area the positive effects of tree removal on runoff could be transitory finally the trends and variability of climate particularly precipitation prior to and post treatment could confound the results however a paired watershed approach overcomes these shortfalls by building the potential difference of watershed behavior and climate variability during the calibration and treatment period into the analytical solution brown et al 2005 at the experimental watershed scale the land use can be experimentally controlled and its impact directly quantified providing opportunities to disentangle the impact immediately after disturbance and the altered land use bosch and hewlett 1982 clausen et al 1996 ali et al 2017 paired watershed designs have been widely used to determine the impacts of forest harvesting on the water yield bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 ochoa tocachi et al 2018 however their application for assessing the impact of woody encroachment and removal on hydrological processes is limited because multi year pre treatment runoff data to establish the calibration regression line are rarely available streamflow is usually a small component in the water budget and is highly variable in a water limited system however overland flow and streamflow regimes are closely associated with root zone soil moisture of which the temporal dynamic is greatly influenced by the plant functional type huxman et al 2005 liu et al 2017 improvement in root zone soil moisture is indicative of the increased runoff and recharge potential at the local scale dekker and ritsema 1994 doerr et al 2000 acharya et al 2018 an increase in soil water storage and recharge was documented after removing western juniper juniperus occidentalis in idaho seyfried and wilcox 2006 and a 20 greater over winter soil water accumulation after western juniper removal was reported in oregon mollnau et al 2014 ultimately the increase of root zone soil moisture may profoundly affect the responsiveness of the land surface to precipitation and increase the surface runoff coefficient sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 qiao et al 2017 for prairie lands that have been encroached by woody vegetation in the great plains the potential of recovery of streamflow depends on the re vegetation and land use after woody vegetation removal a common management approach is to leave the land to restore to native prairie for cattle grazing although it is subject to encroachment by woody plants again without subsequent management alternatively the land can be actively managed for hay and other biomass production switchgrass an herbaceous species has been promoted as a potential biofuel feedstock and is highly adapted to the southern united states switchgrass can be established by seeding with no till drilling techniques along with herbicide application under non drought conditions casler et al 2015 these two conditions i e native prairie and switchgrass production system may differ in runoff generation as they vary in factors such as plant composition or species diversity leaf area rooting depth and litter cover the overall goal of this study was to assess the hydrological response to mechanical removal of juniper followed by restoration to prairie or planted to switchgrass in the south central great plains using a paired watershed approach the specific objectives included i assess the state change in root zone soil water storage during the land use transition and restored grassland phase restored native prairie and established switchgrass ii quantify runoff responses during the transition phase and the restored grassland phase iii compare runoff between the juniper woodland converted to restored prairie and juniper converted to switchgrass production system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and land use history the study was conducted in the cross timbers research range cter which is managed by oklahoma state university fig 1 the study site is located 15 km southwest of stillwater payne county oklahoma usa 36 3 46 73 n 97 11 3 33 w the soils are well drained consisting predominately of the stephenville darnell complex coyle soil series and grainola lucien complex the average depth of soil is approximately 1 m underlain by sandstone substrates the site was previously cultivated and allowed to recover to prairie after agricultural abandonment in the 1950 s the land is currently being managed for research purposes related to prescribed fire grazing and watershed hydrology fire and grazing interactions through patch burning have been studied in parts of the research range since 1983 fuhlendorf and engle 2004 native tallgrass prairie has been maintained due to burning treatments whereas juniper was present in some areas before the prescribed fire and has heavily encroached many other areas of cter where burning has been excluded the site also contains areas of post oak quercus stellata dominated woodland as well as prairie lightly encroached by woody vegetation in this study we chose to use three previously established juniper encroached experimental watersheds which have been monitored since 2010 qiao et al 2015 these watersheds range from 1 34 to 3 79 ha table 1 fig 1 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 meteorological observations meteorological observations were continuous since 2011 a weather station was located approximately 5 m east of the h flume of watershed j sg fig 1 precipitation was measured with a tb3 siphoning tipping bucket rain gauge with 0 254 mm per tip hydrological services america lake worth fl usa air temperature and relative humidity were measured at 2 m using a vaisala temperature rh probe hmp50 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa with an rm young 6 plate radiation shield wind speed and direction rm young company wind sentry set traverse city mi usa and solar radiation apogee sp 110 apogee instruments inc logan ut usa were measured at 3 m height 2 2 2 root zone soil water root zone soil water for each watershed was measured using three soil moisture arrays established in 2010 and distributed at the upper middle and lower position of each watershed fig 1 each array was composed of one em50 datalogger and four ech2o ec 5 capacitance probes meter group inc pullman wa usa installed at depths of 50 200 450 and 800 mm to capture the mean condition of soil volumetric water content θ every 15 min for the soil layers of 0 100 100 300 300 600 and 600 1000 mm respectively ech2o probes measured the dielectric constant of the soil which was converted to volumetric water content using the manufacturer s calibration relationship the ec 5 sensors run at a high measurement frequency which allows a single calibration equation to be used for mineral soils of various textures and electrical conductivities the accumulated root zone soil water storage sws mm in the upper 1 m soil profile was calculated based on soil water in each soil layer zou et al 2014 the average of sws from the three arrays was used to represent the average root zone soil water storage for the watershed 2 2 3 runoff runoff from each watershed was gauged using a 0 9 m h flumes the stage level in the flume was measured at 5 minute intervals using an optical shaft encoder with a minimum stage reading and resolution of 3 0 mm 50386se 105 hydrolynx west sacramento ca usa stage level readings were converted to discharge values using the known stage discharge relationship for the given h flume and discharge was converted to runoff depth using the watershed areas annual runoff values treatment period values and event based values were generated by summing the 5 minute data for the period of interest two conditions were used to determine the end of runoff events most commonly event end was considered as the last flow record with no further flow reading for a minimum of 24 h in any of the watersheds for rare cases where the flow did not completely cease before the next precipitation event the end time of runoff was set as 5 min before the start of the next precipitation event to separate runoff events 2 3 treatment design paired watershed studies have been widely used to determine the impact of changes in land use or vegetation change on water yield bosch and hewlett 1982 hibbert 1983 brown et al 2005 neary 2016 ochoa tocachi et al 2018 this approach involves the use of two nearby watersheds similar in size topography soils and land use the quantitative relationship of runoff from these two similar paired watersheds established when the land use or land cover was relatively stable or unchanged for multiple years is considered the calibration phase one of the watersheds is subsequently subjected to a treatment i e land use change or land cover change and the other remains as a control this allows the yearly climatic variability to be accounted for in the analysis such that change in the quantitative runoff relationship between the paired watersheds is attributed to changes in land use or vegetation type brown et al 2005 during july 2015 all juniper trees in two adjacent watersheds south of the control watershed were cut using a skid steer equipped with a marshall tree saw tulsa ok usa table 2 cut trees were left to dry on site until january 2016 when they were ground and hauled off site grinding and removal were completed by the end of february 2016 one treatment watershed was left to revegetate without further treatment and assigned juniper to restored prairie watershed and abbreviated as j rp fig 1 the other cut watershed was further treated with glyphosate herbicide beginning in may 2016 to kill vegetation until may 2017 when an upland switchgrass variety alamo was seeded using a large drilling machine this watershed was assigned as juniper to switchgrass watershed and abbreviated as j sg fig 1 the treated watersheds were fenced to prevent cattle grazing and trampling the watershed north of the treatment watersheds was not treated and was used as the control juniper watershed and abbreviated as j fig 1 collectively there were two control vs treatment pairs j vs j rp and j vs j sg and the effects of the treatments were compared using the paired watershed approach in the pre treatment period j had the highest juniper basal area while j sg had the highest density table 1 the calibration phase was four years and nine months from oct 2010 through june 2015 with no management activities on any of the three watersheds table 2 to address our objectives the treatment period was further separated into a transition phase and a restored grassland phase the transition phase was defined as the period after juniper cutting and before the new vegetation cover was fully established the restored grassland phase includes restored prairie and established switchgrass the first year after cutting of the j rp may 2016 to april 2017 was assigned to the transition phase because of little vegetation cover and biomass growth in the first year of recovery as compared to the second year when more herbaceous vegetation occurred likewise the first year after juniper cutting for the j sg watershed was considered transition as switchgrass was not planted until the following spring 2 4 data analysis and statistics daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated based on local daily weather station data using the fao penman monteith method cai et al 2007 a generalized additive model gam was used as a scatterplot smoothing function for climate variables which gave a general idea of the trend for weather variables the mann kendall test was used to quantify the trend of climate variation during the study period mann 1945 mondal et al 2012 in the mann kendall test τ represented the measure of the strength of the trend of climate variation in a time series with a range from 1 to 1 this value represented the strength and direction of association that exists between climate and time series the larger absolute value means larger strength between time and climate a negative value stands for a decreasing trend while a positive value stands for an increasing trend we used α 0 05 in this research we used the time series of sws of treatment watersheds j rp and j sg minus that of the control watershed j to calculate the time series of δsws then change point detection cho and fryzlewicz 2015 was applied to check whether there was an increase or decrease in the time series of δsws following treatments both the mann kendall test and change point detection were performed in rstudio we determined the treatment impacts by testing whether the linear relationship of event based runoff depths between control watershed and the treatment watershed significantly changed in the transition phase and the restored grassland phase we tested the significance of changes in slope and intercept between the appropriate sets of regression lines in different phases runoff in our experimental watersheds was predominantly from stormflows some small rainfall events produced runoff for one watershed but not for the others for this analysis we dropped runoff events when there was zero runoff in any of the paired watersheds j vs j rp j vs j sg which allowed the square root transformation of the event based runoff data to satisfy the linear regression analysis assumptions the error terms are normally distributed and the paired data have equal variance impact of mechanical removal of juniper on runoff was calculated as the ratio of observed annual runoff to estimated annual runoff in the treatment phase clausen et al 1996 the estimated runoff for the manipulated watersheds was modeled based on the relationship of square root event based runoff established during the calibration phase assuming the juniper trees were not removed 3 results 3 1 climatic dynamics the mean annual precipitation was 832 143 mean standard deviation sd mm for the eight water years from october 2010 to september 2018 the highest daily precipitation of 112 mm occurred in may 2017 fig 2 the precipitation during the study trended up p 0 027 with a positive but small τ value there was no significant trend in the daily temperature p 0 18 the highest daily et0 of 11 mm occurred in may 2014 and the mean daily et0 was 3 46 2 16 mm for the study period the daily et0 trended down p 0 001 with a negative small τ value 3 2 root zone soil water storage the sws within the 1000 mm soil profile in the control watershed j was generally less than that in j rp and j sg for the entire study period during the calibration phase mean daily sws in j was 143 45 mm mean sd 267 55 mm in j rp and 216 52 mm in j sg fig 3 a1 and 3b1 in the transition and restored grassland phases mean daily sws was 163 42 mm in j 356 53 mm in j rp and 303 37 mm in j sg fig 3a1 and 3b1 the difference in sws δsws increased for both comparisons fig 3a2 and b2 for the j j rp pair a change point in the δsws was detected on august 22 2015 the δsws averaged 125 21 mm before august 22 2015 and increased to an average value of 195 40 mm after that date fig 3a2 for the j j sg pair a change point in the δsws was detected right after cutting of juniper it averaged 74 28 mm before july 6 2015 and increased to an average value of 141 36 mm after that date fig 3b2 there was no change point detected for δsws between the transition phases and the restored grassland phases 3 3 annual runoff and hydrograph annual runoff depth varied greatly among water years and the type of land use ranging from negligible 1 mm runoff in 2011 to over 150 mm in 2017 annual runoff depth in the control j was 21 12 mean sd mm 9 5 mm in j rp and 16 10 in j sg during the calibration phase 2011 2015 fig 4 after juniper cutting in july 2015 the runoff of the treated watersheds increased relative to the control and remained elevated throughout the tranistion and grassland recovery phases in 2016 2018 average annual runoff depth in j was 27 22 mm in j rp was 94 49 mm and in j sg was 131 73 mm for all time periods except the cut and drying phase for the j sg watershed the slopes of the relationship between the treated and control watersheds for event based runoff were signficant table 3 fig 5 during the calibration phase the regressions comparing j to j rp and j to j sg had strong linear relationships with high coefficients of determination r2 table 3 fig 5 for the comparisons between the j rp and j watersheds the slopes during the cut and drying recovery to prairie and restored prairie phases were all signifcantly greater than during the calibration phase indicating an increase in runoff depth with treatment table 4 fig 5a c e the greatest slope occurred during the recovery to prairie phase table 3 intercepts were signficantly greater for regressions during the the cut and drying and during the restored prairie phases than during the calibration phase table 4 for the j sg vs j comparison the slopes were greater during the herbicide and during the established switchgrass phases than during the calibration phase table 4 fig 5d and f the greatest slope occurred during the herbicide phase when vegetaion was absent table 3 intercepts were signficantly greater for regressions during the herbicide and the established switghgrass phases than during the calibration phase table 4 during the established grassland phases may 2017 through september 2018 the total runoff depth based on the regression model increased by 4 46 fold for the restored prairie and 4 54 fold for the switchgrass production systemcompared to the noncut control watershed during the calibration phase the hydrographs in all three watersheds resembled each other in terms of peak flow and runoff duration following a 62 mm storm for example event peak flow in j was the highest followed by j sg and j rp fig 6 a the flow duration was comparable and ranged from 35 to 45 h in the restored grassland phases the hydrographs of j pr and j sg diverged from that of j for example a storm event of 27 mm had a the peak flow in j that was the lowest and lasted for only 2 h while the peak flows and flow durations of j rp and j sg were much higher with much longer delayed flow fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 increase in soil moisture and runoff under transition phase cutting juniper reduces the tree transpiration component of the water budget although an increase in soil moisture after shrub and tree removal is often attributed to reduced canopy interception taucer et al 2008 the increase in soil moisture as observed in this study was likely primarily due to reduced transpiration since the cut trees were initially left on site and could continue to intercept rainfall caterina et al 2014 found that juniper can transpire almost all throughfall during a year of normal precipitation initially after cutting there was little herbaceous component as it had been previously suppressed by the tree canopies in addition prior to removal the cut juniper continued to shade the soil and suppress herbaceous plant development after february 2016 the removal of the dead juniper from the cut watersheds allowed existing grasses and herbaceous plants to expand and new plants to establish throughout the watershed which increased transpiration from may 2016 the j rp watershed started to recover to native prairie while herbicide was applied to the j sg watershed for this period the different dynamics of soil moisture for j rp and j sg reflected the transpiration induced soil moisture response suppression of transpiration by the herbicide in j sg resulted in a high and less variable root zone soil moisture storage while j rp experienced minimum root zone soil moisture in the late growing season corresponding to maximum leaf area of recovering vegetation overland flow is an important component of the annual runoff in this study region qiao et al 2017 therefore the antecedent soil water before and during the rainy season influences the total runoff depth for a year in the transition phases an apparent trend was that the root zone soil water storage more frequently approached the peak storage value leading to potentially higher overland flow application of herbicide to kill herbaceous plants in preparation of planting switchgrass is a common practice eliminating all vegetation by herbicide at hillslope and watershed scales always raises a great concern regarding soil erosion especially if application is followed by large rainfall events in our study the largest runoff depth for a single event for j sg during the herbicide period was 28 0 mm which was three times greater than 8 9 mm in j rp and 85 times higher than 0 3 mm in j for the same precipitation event it is important to take the potential rainfall condition into consideration when determining the timing of herbicide application for switchgrass planting 4 2 increase in root zone soil moisture and runoff under restored grassland phase in our study the state change in root zone soil moisture storage was detected only for juniper removal but no further change was detected due to prairie restoration or switchgrass establishment based on the statistical result the intercept of the linear regressions increased significantly following grassland restoration compared to the calibration phase which suggests the juniper woodland has a much higher precipitation threshold needed to produce runoff and that conversion from juniper to herbaceous vegetation decreases the precipitation threshold for runoff generation the increase in slope of the regression line during the transition and restored grassland phases means greater increase in runoff depth per unit increase in precipitation suggesting a quick and steady rise of runoff in restored grasslands relative to the pre treatment phase during the established grassland phase the total runoff depth for restored prairie and switchgrass production system increased by 4 46 and 4 54 fold respectively in the switchgrass production system the majority of aboveground biomass was removed following first frost in 2017 and 2018 leaving a site with less canopy cover during the dormant season even for the restored prairie change in species composition and management approaches will likely alter the runoff regime in the future 4 3 juniper removal and water recovery potential juniper has encroached into millions of hectares in oklahoma kansas and nebraska mckinley 2017 and it is getting worse however most encroached areas have very low canopy cover and the areas with high juniper density are still relatively small wang et al 2017 given its current status large scale or regional campaigns of juniper removal will not be effective solely for water recovery instead our results show that treating heavily encroached parcels can result in the localized increase in runoff which could be meaningful for increasing the water for retention ponds and upland reservoirs in the southern and central great plains those ponds and upland retention structures collect flow from the overland flow and intermittent streams in most cases juniper removal to regain space and restore soil moisture condition for enhancing grass production may be a more direct motivation for ranchers restoration of the runoff regime to sustain streams and refill reservoirs are added benefits a large swath of the great plains is climatically adapted for the cultivation of switchgrass although the planting and harvesting requirements prevent switchgrass application in many rangeland sites with rocky outcrops our results show that switchgrass production provides an alternative land use option which could provide a hydrological function similar to restored native prairie 5 conclusion our study concludes that the paired watershed approach is an effective method to detect the impacts of vegetation manipulation on hydrological processes such as the change in rooting zone soil moisture storage and runoff dynamics to address field scale issues on relatively flat rangeland watersheds however this method requires long term monitoring on the runoff and soil moisture data mechanical removal of juniper trees increases watershed soil moisture storage and decreases the threshold of precipitation to generate surface runoff converting juniper woodland to prairie resulted in a four to five fold increase in total runoff at the experimental watershed scale in the southcentral great plains the hydrograph analyses suggest more extensive and delayed flow in restored prairie than that of established switchgrass these observations and the conclusions are based on well defined small upland watersheds in the tallgrass prairie climate transition zone in the southern great plains of the united states further work should explore whether such results apply to the mixed prairie where woody encroachment is rapidly transitioning the landscape to a woody state credit authorship contribution statement yu zhong writing original draft

5600,mechanical removal of encroached juniper juniperus spp is a common practice to restore native grasslands however the hydrological responses to grassland restoration remain mostly unquantified for the climate transition zone in the southern great plains of the usa where ecosystem evapotranspiration is highly sensitive to the change of vegetation functional type we used a paired watershed approach to directly quantify the impact of mechanical removal of eastern redcedar juniperus virginiana l redcedar and restoration to native prairie or establishment of switchgrass panicum virgatum l on root zone soil moisture and event based runoff for eight years including three main phases calibration transition and restored grassland in north central oklahoma usa results showed that the root zone soil water storage on average increased 1 6 and 1 9 times for restored prairie and switchgrass respectively after juniper removal the regression model estimation based on the relationships established in the calibration phases between event based runoff from control watershed and the treatment watersheds found that the restored prairie and switchgrass production system increased annual runoff by 4 46 and 4 54 times respectively these results indicated that both soil moisture and runoff are highly responsive to land use change in the southern great plains reestablishment of

water resources in the climate transition zone of the southern and central great plains usa ojima et al 1999 sun et al 2008 an important land surface change in this region is associated with the transition from herbaceous plant dominance to woody plant dominance characterized by a juniper species juniperus virginiana l eastern redcedar or redcedar encroachment in the prairie and oak savannas of the central great plains briggs et al 2005 hoff et al 2018 this transition is associated mainly with a disruption of the historical fire regime and causes a decline or loss of prairie productivity

however site disturbance associated with mechanical operations could cause excessive surface runoff and potential soil erosion if not appropriately managed also after juniper removal the watershed will revegetate and can restore to prairie naturally or be planted with species such as switchgrass panicum virgatum l for biomass production however it is unknown how the root zone soil moisture

canopy due to tree die off biederman et al 2015 the current consensus is that the effect of tree or brush removal on the streamflow is minimal where annual precipitation is 500 mm archer and predick 2014 in contrast deforestation in high precipitation regions has been a significant contributor of soil erosion and large scale deforestation in the cloud forest and tropical rainforest may even reduce runoff by suppressing the positive feedback between soil moisture and precipitation junkermann et al 2009 lawrence and vandecar 2015 consequently vegetation change should have maximal

the climate in the transition zone is becoming more variable and the demand for water continues to increase control of invasive and encroaching woody species to increase streamflow is an important

managed after harvesting could affect the runoff response biederman et al 2015 if woody plants re sprout and reoccupy the same area the positive effects of tree removal on runoff could be transitory

establish the calibration regression line are rarely available streamflow is usually a small component in the water budget and is highly variable in a water limited system however overland flow and streamflow regimes are closely associated with root zone soil moisture of which the temporal dynamic is greatly influenced by the plant functional type huxman et al 2005 liu et al 2017 improvement in root zone soil moisture is indicative of the increased runoff and recharge potential at the local scale dekker and ritsema 1994 doerr et al 2000 acharya et al 2018 an increase in soil water storage and recharge was documented after removing western juniper juniperus occidentalis in idaho seyfried and wilcox 2006 and a 20 greater over winter soil water accumulation after western juniper removal was reported in oregon mollnau et al 2014 ultimately the increase of root zone soil moisture may profoundly affect the responsiveness of the land surface to precipitation and increase the surface runoff coefficient sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 qiao et al 2017 for prairie lands that have been encroached by woody vegetation in the great plains the potential of recovery of streamflow depends on the re vegetation and land use after woody vegetation removal a common management approach is to leave the land to restore to native prairie for cattle grazing although it is subject to encroachment by woody plants again without subsequent management alternatively the land can be actively managed for hay and other biomass production switchgrass an herbaceous species has been promoted as a potential biofuel feedstock and is highly adapted to the southern united states switchgrass can be established by seeding with no till drilling techniques along with herbicide application under non drought conditions casler et al 2015 these two conditions i e native prairie and switchgrass production system may differ in runoff generation as they vary in factors such as plant composition or species diversity leaf area rooting depth and litter cover the overall goal of this study was to assess the hydrological response to mechanical removal of juniper followed by restoration to prairie or planted to switchgrass in the south central great plains using a paired watershed approach the specific objectives included i assess the state change in root zone soil water storage during the land use transition and restored grassland phase restored native prairie and established switchgrass ii quantify runoff responses during the transition phase and the restored grassland phase iii compare runoff between the juniper woodland converted to restored prairie and juniper converted to switchgrass production system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and land use history the study was conducted in the cross timbers research range cter which is managed by oklahoma state university fig 1 the study site is located 15 km southwest of stillwater payne county oklahoma usa 36 3 46 73 n 97 11 3 33 w the soils are well drained consisting predominately of the stephenville darnell complex coyle soil series and grainola lucien complex the average depth of soil is approximately 1 m underlain by sandstone substrates the site was previously cultivated and allowed to recover to prairie after agricultural abandonment in the 1950 s the land is currently being managed for research purposes related to prescribed fire grazing and watershed hydrology fire and grazing interactions through patch burning have been studied in parts of the research range since 1983 fuhlendorf and engle 2004 native tallgrass prairie has been maintained due to burning treatments whereas juniper was present in some areas before the prescribed fire and has heavily encroached many other areas of cter where burning has been excluded the site also contains areas of post oak quercus stellata dominated woodland as well as prairie lightly encroached by woody vegetation in this study we chose to use three previously established juniper encroached experimental watersheds which have been monitored since 2010 qiao et al 2015 these watersheds range from 1 34 to 3 79 ha table 1 fig 1 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 meteorological observations meteorological observations were continuous since 2011 a weather station was located approximately 5 m east of the h flume of watershed j sg fig 1 precipitation was measured with a tb3 siphoning tipping bucket rain gauge with 0 254 mm per tip hydrological services america lake worth fl usa air temperature and relative humidity were measured at 2 m using a vaisala temperature rh probe hmp50 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa with an rm young 6 plate radiation shield wind speed and direction rm young company wind sentry set traverse city mi usa and solar radiation apogee sp 110 apogee instruments inc logan ut usa were measured at 3 m height 2 2 2 root zone soil water root zone soil water for each watershed was measured using three soil moisture arrays established in 2010 and distributed at the upper middle and lower position of each watershed fig 1 each array was composed of one em50 datalogger and four ech2o ec 5 capacitance probes meter group inc pullman wa usa installed at depths of 50 200 450 and 800 mm to capture the mean condition of soil volumetric water content θ every 15 min for the soil layers of 0 100 100 300 300 600 and 600 1000 mm respectively ech2o probes measured the dielectric constant of the soil which was converted to volumetric water content using the manufacturer s calibration relationship the ec 5 sensors run at a high measurement frequency which allows a single calibration equation to be used for mineral soils of various textures and electrical conductivities the accumulated root zone soil water storage sws mm in the upper 1 m soil profile was calculated based on soil water in each soil layer zou et al 2014 the average of sws from the three arrays was used to represent the average root zone soil water storage for the watershed 2 2 3 runoff runoff from each watershed was gauged using a 0 9 m h flumes the stage level in the flume was measured at 5 minute intervals using an optical shaft encoder with a minimum stage reading and resolution of 3 0 mm 50386se 105 hydrolynx west sacramento ca usa stage level readings were converted to discharge values using the known stage discharge relationship for the given h flume and discharge was converted to runoff depth using the watershed areas annual runoff values treatment period values and event based values were generated by summing the 5 minute data for the period of interest two conditions were used to determine the end of runoff events most commonly event end was considered as the last flow record with no further flow reading for a minimum of 24 h in any of the watersheds for rare cases where the flow did not completely cease before the next precipitation event the end time of runoff was set as 5 min before the start of the next precipitation event to separate runoff events 2 3 treatment design paired watershed studies have been widely used to determine the impact of changes in land use or vegetation change on water yield bosch and hewlett 1982 hibbert 1983 brown et al 2005 neary 2016 ochoa tocachi et al 2018 this approach involves the use of two nearby watersheds similar in size topography soils and land use the quantitative relationship of runoff from these two similar paired watersheds established when the land use or land cover was relatively stable or unchanged for multiple years is considered the calibration phase one of the watersheds is subsequently subjected to a treatment i e land use change or land cover change and the other remains as a control this allows the yearly climatic variability to be accounted for in the analysis such that change in the quantitative runoff relationship between the paired watersheds is attributed to changes in land use or vegetation type brown et al 2005 during july 2015 all juniper trees in two adjacent watersheds south of the control watershed were cut using a skid steer equipped with a marshall tree saw tulsa ok usa table 2 cut trees were left to dry on site until january 2016 when they were ground and hauled off site grinding and removal were completed by the end of february 2016 one treatment watershed was left to revegetate without further treatment and assigned juniper to restored prairie watershed and abbreviated as j rp fig 1 the other cut watershed was further treated with glyphosate herbicide beginning in may 2016 to kill vegetation until may 2017 when an upland switchgrass variety alamo was seeded using a large drilling machine this watershed was assigned as juniper to switchgrass watershed and abbreviated as j sg fig 1 the treated watersheds were fenced to prevent cattle grazing and trampling the watershed north of the treatment watersheds was not treated and was used as the control juniper watershed and abbreviated as j fig 1 collectively there were two control vs treatment pairs j vs j rp and j vs j sg and the effects of the treatments were compared using the paired watershed approach in the pre treatment period j had the highest juniper basal area while j sg had the highest density table 1 the calibration phase was four years and nine months from oct 2010 through june 2015 with no management activities on any of the three watersheds table 2 to address our objectives the treatment period was further separated into a transition phase and a restored grassland phase the transition phase was defined as the period after juniper cutting and before the new vegetation cover was fully established the restored grassland phase includes restored prairie and established switchgrass the first year after cutting of the j rp may 2016 to april 2017 was assigned to the transition phase because of little vegetation cover and biomass growth in the first year of recovery as compared to the second year when more herbaceous vegetation occurred likewise the first year after juniper cutting for the j sg watershed was considered transition as switchgrass was not planted until the following spring 2 4 data analysis and statistics daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated based on local daily weather station data using the fao penman monteith method cai et al 2007 a generalized additive model gam was used as a scatterplot smoothing function for climate variables which gave a general idea of the trend for weather variables the mann kendall test was used to quantify the trend of climate variation during the study period mann 1945 mondal et al 2012 in the mann kendall test τ represented the measure of the strength of the trend of climate variation in a time series with a range from 1 to 1 this value represented the strength and direction of association that exists between climate and time series the larger absolute value means larger strength between time and climate a negative value stands for a decreasing trend while a positive value stands for an increasing trend we used α 0 05 in this research we used the time series of sws of treatment watersheds j rp and j sg minus that of the control watershed j to calculate the time series of δsws then change point detection cho and fryzlewicz 2015 was applied to check whether there was an increase or decrease in the time series of δsws following treatments both the mann kendall test and change point detection were performed in rstudio we determined the treatment impacts by testing whether the linear relationship of event based runoff depths between control watershed and the treatment watershed significantly changed in the transition phase and the restored grassland phase we tested the significance of changes in slope and intercept between the appropriate sets of regression lines in different phases runoff in our experimental watersheds was predominantly from stormflows some small rainfall events produced runoff for one watershed but not for the others for this analysis we dropped runoff events when there was zero runoff in any of the paired watersheds j vs j rp j vs j sg which allowed the square root transformation of the event based runoff data to satisfy the linear regression analysis assumptions the error terms are normally distributed and the paired data have equal variance impact of mechanical removal of juniper on runoff was calculated as the ratio of observed annual runoff to estimated annual runoff in the treatment phase clausen et al 1996 the estimated runoff for the manipulated watersheds was modeled based on the relationship of square root event based runoff established during the calibration phase assuming the juniper trees were not removed 3 results 3 1 climatic dynamics the mean annual precipitation was 832 143 mean standard deviation sd mm for the eight water years from october 2010 to september 2018 the highest daily precipitation of 112 mm occurred in may 2017 fig 2 the precipitation during the study trended up p 0 027 with a positive but small τ value there was no significant trend in the daily temperature p 0 18 the highest daily et0 of 11 mm occurred in may 2014 and the mean daily et0 was 3 46 2 16 mm for the study period the daily et0 trended down p 0 001 with a negative small τ value 3 2 root zone soil water storage the sws within the 1000 mm soil profile in the control watershed j was generally less than that in j rp and j sg for the entire study period during the calibration phase mean daily sws in j was 143 45 mm mean sd 267 55 mm in j rp and 216 52 mm in j sg fig 3 a1 and 3b1 in the transition and restored grassland phases mean daily sws was 163 42 mm in j 356 53 mm in j rp and 303 37 mm in j sg fig 3a1 and 3b1 the difference in sws δsws increased for both comparisons fig 3a2 and b2 for the j j rp pair a change point in the δsws was detected on august 22 2015 the δsws averaged 125 21 mm before august 22 2015 and increased to an average value of 195 40 mm after that date fig 3a2 for the j j sg pair a change point in the δsws was detected right after cutting of juniper it averaged 74 28 mm before july 6 2015 and increased to an average value of 141 36 mm after that date fig 3b2 there was no change point detected for δsws between the transition phases and the restored grassland phases 3 3 annual runoff and hydrograph annual runoff depth varied greatly among water years and the type of land use ranging from negligible 1 mm runoff in 2011 to over 150 mm in 2017 annual runoff depth in the control j was 21 12 mean sd mm 9 5 mm in j rp and 16 10 in j sg during the calibration phase 2011 2015 fig 4 after juniper cutting in july 2015 the runoff of the treated watersheds increased relative to the control and remained elevated throughout the tranistion and grassland recovery phases in 2016 2018 average annual runoff depth in j was 27 22 mm in j rp was 94 49 mm and in j sg was 131 73 mm for all time periods except the cut and drying phase for the j sg watershed the slopes of the relationship between the treated and control watersheds for event based runoff were signficant table 3 fig 5 during the calibration phase the regressions comparing j to j rp and j to j sg had strong linear relationships with high coefficients of determination r2 table 3 fig 5 for the comparisons between the j rp and j watersheds the slopes during the cut and drying recovery to prairie and restored prairie phases were all signifcantly greater than during the calibration phase indicating an increase in runoff depth with treatment table 4 fig 5a c e the greatest slope occurred during the recovery to prairie phase table 3 intercepts were signficantly greater for regressions during the the cut and drying and during the restored prairie phases than during the calibration phase table 4 for the j sg vs j comparison the slopes were greater during the herbicide and during the established switchgrass phases than during the calibration phase table 4 fig 5d and f the greatest slope occurred during the herbicide phase when vegetaion was absent table 3 intercepts were signficantly greater for regressions during the herbicide and the established switghgrass phases than during the calibration phase table 4 during the established grassland phases may 2017 through september 2018 the total runoff depth based on the regression model increased by 4 46 fold for the restored prairie and 4 54 fold for the switchgrass production systemcompared to the noncut control watershed during the calibration phase the hydrographs in all three watersheds resembled each other in terms of peak flow and runoff duration following a 62 mm storm for example event peak flow in j was the highest followed by j sg and j rp fig 6 a the flow duration was comparable and ranged from 35 to 45 h in the restored grassland phases the hydrographs of j pr and j sg diverged from that of j for example a storm event of 27 mm had a the peak flow in j that was the lowest and lasted for only 2 h while the peak flows and flow durations of j rp and j sg were much higher with much longer delayed flow fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 increase in soil moisture and runoff under transition phase cutting juniper reduces the tree transpiration component of the water budget although an increase in soil moisture after shrub and tree removal is often attributed to reduced canopy interception taucer et al 2008 the increase in soil moisture as observed in this study was likely primarily due to reduced transpiration since the cut trees were initially left on site and could continue to intercept rainfall caterina et al 2014 found that juniper can transpire almost all throughfall during a year of normal precipitation initially after cutting there was little herbaceous component as it had been previously suppressed by the tree canopies in addition prior to removal the cut juniper continued to shade the soil and suppress herbaceous plant development after february 2016 the removal of the dead juniper from the cut watersheds allowed existing grasses and herbaceous plants to expand and new plants to establish throughout the watershed which increased transpiration from may 2016 the j rp watershed started to recover to native prairie while herbicide was applied to the j sg watershed for this period the different dynamics of soil moisture for j rp and j sg reflected the transpiration induced soil moisture response suppression of transpiration by the herbicide in j sg resulted in a high and less variable root zone soil moisture storage while j rp experienced minimum root zone soil moisture in the late growing season corresponding to maximum leaf area of recovering vegetation overland flow is an important component of the annual runoff in this study region qiao et al 2017 therefore the antecedent soil water before and during the rainy season influences the total runoff depth for a year in the transition phases an apparent trend was that the root zone soil water storage more frequently approached the peak storage value leading to potentially higher overland flow application of herbicide to kill herbaceous plants in preparation of planting switchgrass is a common practice eliminating all vegetation by herbicide at hillslope and watershed scales always raises a great concern regarding soil erosion especially if application is followed by large rainfall events in our study the largest runoff depth for a single event for j sg during the herbicide period was 28 0 mm which was three times greater than 8 9 mm in j rp and 85 times higher than 0 3 mm in j for the same precipitation event it is important to take the potential rainfall condition into consideration when determining the timing of herbicide application for switchgrass planting 4 2 increase in root zone soil moisture and runoff under restored grassland phase in our study the state change in root zone soil moisture storage was detected only for juniper removal but no further change was detected due to prairie restoration or switchgrass establishment based on the statistical result the intercept of the linear regressions increased significantly following grassland restoration compared to the calibration phase which suggests the juniper woodland has a much higher precipitation threshold needed to produce runoff and that conversion from juniper to herbaceous vegetation decreases the precipitation threshold for runoff generation the increase in slope of the regression line during the transition and restored grassland phases means greater increase in runoff depth per unit increase in precipitation suggesting a quick and steady rise of runoff in restored grasslands relative to the pre treatment phase during the established grassland phase the total runoff depth for restored prairie and switchgrass production system increased by 4 46 and 4 54 fold respectively in the switchgrass production system the majority of aboveground biomass was removed following first frost in 2017 and 2018 leaving a site with less canopy cover during the dormant season even for the restored prairie change in species composition and management approaches will likely alter the runoff regime in the future 4 3 juniper removal and water recovery potential juniper has encroached into millions of hectares in oklahoma kansas and nebraska mckinley 2017 and it is getting worse however most encroached areas have very low canopy cover and the areas with high juniper density are still relatively small wang et al 2017 given its current status large scale or regional campaigns of juniper removal will not be effective solely for water recovery instead our results show that treating heavily encroached parcels can result in the localized increase in runoff which could be meaningful for increasing the water for retention ponds and upland reservoirs in the southern and central great plains those ponds and upland retention structures collect flow from the overland flow and intermittent streams in most cases juniper removal to regain space and restore soil moisture condition for enhancing grass production may be a more direct motivation for ranchers restoration of the runoff regime to sustain streams and refill reservoirs are added benefits a large swath of the great plains is climatically adapted for the cultivation of switchgrass although the planting and harvesting requirements prevent switchgrass application in many rangeland sites with rocky outcrops our results show that switchgrass production provides an alternative land use option which could provide a hydrological function similar to restored native prairie 5 conclusion our study concludes that the paired watershed approach is an effective method to detect the impacts of vegetation manipulation on hydrological processes such as the change in rooting zone soil moisture storage and runoff dynamics to address field scale issues on relatively flat rangeland watersheds however this method requires long term monitoring on the runoff and soil moisture data mechanical removal of juniper trees increases watershed soil moisture storage and decreases the threshold of precipitation to generate surface runoff converting juniper woodland to prairie resulted in a four to five fold increase in total runoff at the experimental watershed scale in the southcentral great plains the hydrograph analyses suggest more extensive and delayed flow in restored prairie than that of established switchgrass these observations and the conclusions are based on well defined small upland watersheds in the tallgrass prairie climate transition zone in the southern great plains of the united states further work should explore whether such results apply to the mixed prairie where woody encroachment is rapidly transitioning the landscape to a woody state credit authorship contribution statement yu zhong writing original draft

5601,improving water quality and ecological status is an important foundation for sustainability development increasing human activity and the corresponding land use change lead to the deterioration of river water quality wq and water ecology we but the pathway is complex especially in dam dominated basins with the altered streamflow by the joint regulation of multiple dams and sluices that leads to changes in wq seasonally however the research on this issue is inadequate and it is urgently needed since a large number of dams and sluices have been built worldwide for socioeconomic benefits putting the basin s wq and we under pressure based on water ecological experiment a framework was proposed to assess the impact of land use lu and urbanization on wq and we in different scenarios derived from human activities low and intense and seasonality winter and summer in a dam dominated basin the framework was applied to the shaying river basin located in the central china as a case study the remote sensing of landsat 8 oli tirs images and geographic information system gis were combined by using the support vector machine classification method to extract the land use patterns and to map the spatial distribution diagrams of wq and we indicators based on in situ experimental data a canonical correlation analysis method and pearson correlation testing were adopted to evaluate the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we in the basin results showed that lu and urbanization had a great impact on we compared to wq due to the slow reaction of ecosystem in the basin because the former was resulted by long term regulation of dams and sluices and the latter was related to the short term changes of river environment moreover the former was attributed to the latter largely lu and urbanization impact on wq had a significant seasonality with higher impact in winter than in summer and the seasonality of the impact was weakened as the disturbance of lu and urbanization increased the seasonal variation of we indicators was almost not significant in our study due to their adaptability to surrounding environment our results provide insights to water resources

kolmogorov smirnov sweq surface water environmental quality standard wqi water quality index wei water ecological index 1 introduction land use lu change directly reflects the important influence of human activity on river water quality wq and water ecology we gu et al 2019 different categories of lu affect the transmission of runoff into surface water bodies in different ways block or accelerate which in turn affect the exchange of pollutions from land to surface water bodies kändler et al 2017 the changed surface water quality will form a new ecological environment that is different from the original one resulting in a direct biological screening based on the adaptability of aquatic organisms to the newly formed environment urbanization accompanied by the production of pollutions is a special pattern of lu and highly reflects human activities having dramatic effects on aquatic ecosystems increases in urban land have been described as one of the greatest contributors to the increase of pollutions in freshwater ecosystems worldwide mello et al 2018 it is considered that urbanization is no doubt a key factor affecting the future of water quality in urbanized watersheds salerno et al 2018 in this regard we must consider that globally the number of people living in urban areas is increasing each year with urban populations projected to account for 66 of the total global population by 2050 un desa 2014 salerno et al 2018 as urbanization increases urban populations and pollutants point and diffuse pollutions will increase significantly in addition the natural landscapes will be fragmented and converted into impervious surfaces resulting in increasing peak flows and increasing volumes of runoff liu et al 2018 pollutions that were not treated by urban sewage system will enter receiving water bodies with runoff at a faster speed and with a higher probability however it is worth noting that the interaction between lu and river system is more complex in high human disturbed basins with multiple dams and sluices the joint regulation of dams and sluices results in the altered streamflow and self purification capacity of rivers zhao et al 2019 pollutions will be retained in the river for long time and affect river ecosystem prolongedly compared to basins without dams and sluices the seasonal impact of wq and we may become more significant in this kind of basins unfortunately according to lehner et al 2011 and zarfl et al 2015 the number of dams in the world is estimated to be 16 million with a total storage of approximately 8000 km3 and dam construction is expected to continue in the future according to zhang et al 2017 millions of sluices with storage capacity 0 10 million m3 had been constructed globally by 2005 meaning that wq and we in many basins worldwide suffer from impact of dams and sluices therefore studying the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we in dam dominated basins would greatly increase our understanding about changes in wq and we affected by dams and sluices this knowledge will help decision making for sustainable water resources management in literature although many efforts have been made to improve wq and we in the world including the european water framework directive eu wfd for improving the overall status of waterbodies and the clean water act cwa in the united states for reducing surface water pollution from specific kinds of sources water quality and ecology are still serious issues worldwide mostert 2003 pander and geist 2013 raff and earnhart 2019 for example according to european environment agency 2018 good ecological status is currently not achieved in 59 of river and 48 of lake water bodies mainly due to diffuse pollution and hydromorphological degradation mack et al 2019 numerous studies have been carried out on the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we mainly focusing on 1 the response relationship of wq to different lu patterns and urbanization karmakar et al 2019 wijesiri et al 2018 2 the impact of lu in multiple spatial scales and different pollution sources point and diffuse pollutions on wq and we giri et al 2018 wan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 and 3 the impact of lu and urbanization on seasonal variation of wq mello et al 2018 shi et al 2017 these studies revealed the spatial and temporal variability of the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we which are critical for appropriate management strategies in basins without dam or sluice construction however the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we are more complicated under the impact of dams and sluices in particular joint regulation of dams and sluices may cause the seasonal variation of wq and we some studies have implied that the changes in lu and urbanization impacted the rivers aquatic biota and had adverse effects on functions and management of water resources notably in dam dominated basins frémion et al 2016 therefore more attentions should be paid to the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we in dam dominated basins due to the large number of dams and sluices worldwide and their increasing tendency in future lehner et al 2011 zarfl et al 2015 unfortunately to the best of our knowledge the impact of luu on wq and we has not been investigated in high human disturbed watersheds with multiple dams and sluices in different seasons and this motivates our current research in our previous research we studied the human affected evolution connotation and assessment method of river ecosystem luo et al 2018a and then a multi indicator and distance based method with advantages of solving system impact problems under limited data conditions to study the impact of socioeconomic system on the river system luo et al 2019 however lu and urbanization indicators were not considered in our previous studies moreover the seasonal variation of wq and we due to the joint regulation of multiple dams and sluices which alters streamflow greatly were not investigated in our previous studies this paper focuses mainly on the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we and their seasonal variation due to regulation of dams and sluices a framework was formed in different scenarios derived from human activities low and intense and seasonality winter and summer for the purpose the shaying river basin srb which is located in central china and is the main grain production base of henan province is used as a case study since 1950s many dams and sluices have been built in the basin to alleviate water shortages resulting in many segmented sections in the main stream of the basin pollutions were difficult to degrade in rivers when dams and sluices were built due to reduced water mobility leading to serious river pollution and ecological degradation it is necessary to study the impact of lu and urbanization that are main sources of pollution on wq and we for the environmental and ecological restoration as well as sustainable basin development the paper is organized as follows the study area and data collection and processing are given in the next section followed by the determination of assessment indicators and scales of data and then a framework for assessing the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we the assessment of the status and seasonal variation of wq and we was given in sections 3 1 3 4 and the impact of lu and urbanization and influence of regulation of dams and sluices on wq and we in different scenarios were given in sections 3 5 and 3 6 the results for the srb as the case study were given for providing important insights to water resources management and ecological restoration of the basin and similar basins with dense dams and sluices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area shaying river which is the largest and the most polluted tributary of the huaihe river in china was selected as a case study see the upper left panel in fig 1 the length of the river is 621 20 km and the basin area is 39075 30 km2 it is densely populated with a population density of 877 98 heads km2 in 2016 the mean annual temperature varies between 14 c and 16 c and the average annual precipitation ranges from 407 7 mm to 1295 8 mm many dams and sluices were built to alleviate the shortage of water resources and control floods in the basin luo et al 2018a because the main land use patterns in the basin were residential land and cultivated land accounting for 17 25 and 50 59 of the total basin area respectively the key pollutions of the basin were total nitrogen total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen li and zhao 2010 which were caused by both urban point and agricultural diffuse pollutions rapid urban development and large scale cultivated and residential land expansion were main contributors to wq pollution and we degradation in the basin 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 land use and urbanization landsat 8 oli tirs provided by geospatial data cloud site http www gscloud cn in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 were used to extract lu patterns using the remote sensing based supervise classification methods four main lu patterns were interpreted in the basin including forest land fl cultivated land cl residential land rl urban and rural and water bodies wb therefore the lu mainly refers to the four lu patterns based on the characteristics of density population rapid economic development and urbanization processes in the srb it is difficult to represent the impact of urbanization on wq and we using only changes in residential land area therefore per capita gross domestic product gdp was selected to represent the development level of social economy urbanization rate ur was employed as an integrated indicator to reflect the size and level of urban economic development that is urbanization mainly refers to per

among them sp1 sp2 and sp3 were located in the upper reaches of the river while sp4 and sp5 were located in the middle reaches of the river and sp6 and sp7 were located in the lower reaches of the river water samples were collected in july and december each year from july 2013 to december 2016 monitored wq indicators included total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp permanganate index codmn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and dissolved oxygen do based on the standard of water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods therefore the wq mainly refers to these monitored chemical indicators in our study monitored we indicators included phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos according to freshwater animals survey technical specification no db43 t 432 2009 the shannon wiener diversity index of phytoplankton p swi zooplankton z swi and zoobenthos b swi were then calculated therefore the we mainly refers to diversity of phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos in rivers in our study if the monitored value of indicators was lower than the detection level we replaced them with the minimum detection level pinto and maheshwari 2011 the details of specific sample monitoring and processing methods were described in luo et al 2018a due to the complexity of on site riparian environment there are many challenges in the monitoring experiment causing experimental errors that are difficult to control such as riparian hardening and riparian habitat changes with seasonality and regulation of dams and sluices first the riparian hardening makes it difficult to keep the same location for sampling every year and the length and area of sampling are difficult to meet requirements of monitoring standards these increased the uncertainty of the experiment we try to avoid this kind of errors by setting sps in areas where riparian hardening is not serious second riparian inundation areas change with seasonality and regulation of dams and sluices therefore the shallow riparian areas are not necessarily long term habitats for aquatic organisms leading to sampling errors we can do almost nothing to this kind of errors caused by natural and uncontrollable human activity factors certainly there are also experimental errors caused by man made and climatic factors such as irregular experimental operations rainfall and temperature 2 3 assessment flowchart and methods fig 2 gives the flowchart of our study equations in the flowchart were listed in table 1 first data were collected and processed including remote sensing statistical data and water ecological experiment data see section 2 2 for detailed data sources among them digital elevation model dem provided by the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn and location of sps used as the outlets were used to delineate sub basins that reflect different levels of human activities using gis technology second assessment indicators were determined and data was processed at temporal and spatial scales variance inflation factors vif was used to test the multicollinearity of selected indicators to avoid the overlapping of information between indicators according to katrutsa and strijov 2017 indicators with the vif value of greater than five were deleted because of a large multicollinearity problem as the indicators of urbanization were calculated at the spatial scale of administrative regions and the indicators of wq and we were collected at the point scale of sps these indicators need to be converted to a sub basin scale for the calculation as below area percentage of administrative regions and sub basins were used to convert the indicators of urbanization from administrative regions to sub basins the values of each wq and we indicator at different sps located in a same sub basin were averaged as the corresponding indicator value of the sub basin third the levels of wq and we and their differences at different sps were assessed using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce method and the one way analysis of variance anova with the significance level of p 0 05 zhang et al 2019 respectively the fce method has the advantages of easy implementation and directly reflecting the relationship between indicators and corresponding evaluation criteria in the surface water environmental quality standard sweq of china state environmental protection administration of china and general administration of quality supervision and inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china 2002 in our previous research we assigned each indicator of wq and we into one of five categories according to the sweq namely the worst worse normal better and optimal see luo et al 2018a for detail water quality index wqi with the value between 0 and 1 was used to reflect the status of river wq the larger the wqi value is the better the river water quality is similar to wqi the water ecological index wei also with the value between 0 and 1 was used to reflect the status of river we the larger the wei value is the better the river we is fourth the effects of lu and urbanization on wq and we were assessed in different scenarios of seasonality winter and summer and human activities sub1 with a low human intervention and sub2 with a high human intervention see the upper left panel in fig 1 using canonical correlation analysis cca method the cca method which has the advantage of dealing with the correlation between one set of indicators and another set of indicators was integrated with a distance based impact assessment method to study the effect of lu and urbanization on wq and we the cca method was used to extract the consistent changing trend of lu and urbanization indicators and wq and we indicators and then the integrated influence of lu and urbanization on wq and we can be quantified based on the extracted consistent information in trends of their indicators weights the measured wq and we values and their upper and lower limits we used kolmogorov smirnov k s test cho and choi 2014 to examine the normality of data to ensure properness of using the one way anova and the cca methods the core steps and processes of the cca and the distance based impact assessment method can be simplified as the calculations of 1 the influence degree of each wq and we indicator using the distance based impact assessment method 2 the correlation between lu and urbanization indicators and wq and we indicators using the cca method 3 the influence degree of each lu and urbanization indicator on wq and we based on eigenvalues for calculating the weights of lu and urbanization indicators and eigenvectors for calculating the linear coefficients of wq and urbanization indicators calculated in step two with the cca method and 4 the influence degree of lu and urbanization on wq and we through the weighted summation of influence degrees of lu and urbanization indicator on wq and we calculated in step three detailed description can be found in luo et al 2019 the influence degree was divided into five levels with the intervals of 0 2 for ease of analysis that is no impact less than 0 2 low impact between 0 2 and 0 4 moderate impact between 0 4 and 0 6 high impact between 0 6 and 0 8 and extreme impact greater than 0 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of land use and urbanization map processing and spatial analysis were performed in software of arcgis 10 2 using the gis technology esri environmental systems research institute the results of lu classification based on the landsat 8 oli tirs images showed that the srb mainly consisted of four lu patterns as forest land cultivated land residential land and water bodies see the right panel in fig 1 and table 2 among them cultivated land and residential land accounting for about 50 59 and 17 25 of the total area of the srb respectively were the main lu patterns indicating the high intensity human activities the results of the markov transition matrix in table 3 showed that the forest land water bodies and residential land were transferred mainly to cultivated land while cultivated land was transferred mainly to residential land however in term of the magnitude of lu pattern change the area of residential land transferred to cultivated land with the value of 923 80 km2 was much smaller than the area in which cultivated land transferred to residential land with the value of 3447 16 km2 this further indicated the rapid urban expansion and intense human activity in the srb fig 3 is the statistical results of per capita gdp and urbanization rate it can be seen from the figure that the average of per capita gdp from 2013 to 2016 was 34325 90 rmb chinese yuan in the basin which was lower than the national average level of 48810 25 rmb national bureau of statistics of china http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj the average of urbanization rate during the same period was 43 27 which was also lower than the national average level of 55 49 compared to sub1 see the upper left panel in fig 1 with the average of per capita gdp of 30510 57 rmb and urbanization rate of 40 09 the level of urbanization in sub2 see the upper left panel in fig 1 was greater with the average of per capita gdp of 35690 05 rmb and urbanization rate of 44 46 showing that the sub2 had a higher human activity intensity compared to that in sub1 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of water quality and ecological indicators according to results of the vif test the largest vif value for wq and we indicators was 2 39 and 1 02 respectively both of which were smaller than the empirical threshold value of 5 indicating that the tested data has no serious information overlapping problems therefore the selected indicators were considered meaningful the monitored wq and we indicators in the srb were given in fig 1 see the lower left panel from which it can be seen that the tn concentration changed between 0 36 mg l and 8 83 mg l with the average of 3 34 mg l according to the sweq when the tn concentration is more than 2 mg l the wq is particularly poor a total of five classes are defined according to concentrations of surface wq indicators in the sweq which higher grade value indicating worse surface wq therefore tn pollution in the srb was very serious compared to sub2 with the average value of 4 58 mg l the average concentration of the tn in sub1 was 1 69 mg l indicating that the tn pollution in sub2 was more serious than sub1 in addition to tn indicators of tp codmn and nh4 n also had high concentration values in the srb most of them belonged to a pollution level of class iv of the sweq the class of water was designated as general industrial and recreational water use as there is no direct contact with human bodies however in some river sections of the basin the concentrations of some wq indicators such as nh4 n exceeded the class v according to our monitoring results especially in zhoukou station and huaidian station located in the middle reaches of the basin therefore tn tp codmn and nh4 n were main pollutions in the srb 3 3 analysis of variance homogeneity of variance test and the k s test were performed before one way anova the results of the k s test indicated that significances of indicators of tn tp codmn nh4 n do p swi z swi and b swi with values of 0 239 0 076 0 603 0 051 0 174 0 783 0 686 and 0 779 were all greater than 0 05 suggesting that the selected data were accepted as normal distributions the results of homogeneity of variance test showed that significances of statistics of wq and we indicators with values of 0 052 tn 0 063 tp 0 414 codmn 0 062 nh4 n 0 756 do 0 398 p swi 0 366 z swi and 0 674 b swi which were greater than 0 05 least significant difference passed a significance level of 0 05 after one way anova of each wq and we indicator one by one with a total of 8 the number of indicators with significant differences between each sp and the remaining sps were counted and listed in table 4 from which it can be seen that sp1 located in the upper reaches of the srb had an obvious difference from sp4 sp5 sp6 and sp7 the number of indicators with significant differences were 5 5 4 and 4 respectively accounting for 62 5 62 5 50 0 and 50 0 of the total number of 8 indicators sp2 located in the upper reaches of the srb was obviously different from sp4 sp5 and sp6 the number of indicators with significant differences were 4 4 and 4 respectively all accounting for 50 0 of the total number of 8 indicators similarly sp3 located in the upper reaches of the srb was obviously different from sp4 sp5 and sp6 the percentage of difference was 50 0 50 0 and 37 5 respectively indicating that sp3 was also obviously different from sp4 sp5 and sp6 in summary wq and we in sp1 sp2 and sp3 located in the upper reaches of the srb were obviously different from that in sp4 sp5 and sp6 located in the middle and lower reaches of the srb 3 4 assessment of water quality and ecology fig 4 depicts the results of wq and we assessment at sps from sp1 to sp7 and sub basins of sub1 and sub2 according to fig 4 a b the wqi changed from 0 26 to 0 93 in the srb indicating a large spatial difference in wq in the basin in summer july the wqi with the average of 0 66 showed a decreasing trend from sp1 to sp7 however in winter the decreasing trend of wqi with the average of 0 58 was not obvious instead it showed a v shaped spatial trend which decreased first and then increased from the upper to the lower reaches of the srb indicating the poor wq status in the middle reaches of the srb and a seasonal variation of wq status with better quality in summer than that in winter the mean wqis in sub1 with the value of 0 84 and 0 71 in summer and winter respectively and sub2 with the value of 0 71 and 0 49 in summer and winter respectively also showed a better water quality in summer than that in winter fig 4 c d showed the results of wei that changed from 0 25 to 0 68 with the average of 0 44 in summer and changed from 0 12 to 0 70 with the average of 0 46 in winter showing that the difference of wei between summer and winter was not significant there is also no significant difference in aquatic biodiversity between summer and winter indicating that aquatic organisms had no significant seasonal changes in the basin it can be seen from fig 4 e that the sp1 sp2 sp3 and sp4 had a greater distance between upper and lower quartiles in corresponding wqi box plots compared to sp5 sp6 and sp7 sub1 low human interference also had a greater degree of dispersion than sub2 high human interference in wqi according to fig 4 f the dispersion of wei was not obvious compared to wqi therefore wq had a more significant dispersion than we in the basin and the dispersion of wq indicators was greater in low human disturbed regions than that in the high human disturbed regions water storage and regulation of dams and sluices may be important factors causing a greater dispersion of wq indicators in upper reaches of the srb on the one hand water storage in upstream sections of the srb was much less than that in its midstream and downstream meaning that rivers in upstream of the basin were more sensitive to water pollution due to limited pollution acceptance and self purification capacity on the other hand water shortage was serious in the srb due to uneven precipitation distribution over time and a lot of household agricultural and industrial water demand regulation of dams and sluices for alleviating water shortages altered flow regime in rivers causing large fluctuations in wq indicators 3 5 effects of land use on river water quality and ecology the impact degree of lu on wq and we in fig 5 showed that lu had a greater impact on we with the impact degree changed between 0 31 and 0 60 with the average of 0 48 than wq with the impact degree changed between 0 03 and 0 41 with the average of 0 22 we speculate that this was caused by the overlaying impact of the alteration of aquatic habitat environment due to the regulation of dams and sluices mainly referring to river hydrological conditions and water quality and the adaptive capacity of aquatic organisms to their surrounding environment because residential land and agricultural land were main lu patterns as well as the main source of pollution in the basin the regulation of dams and sluices was highly related to water demand of residential and agricultural production which led to the alteration of hydrological conditions and the weakening of dilution and degradation of pollutants in rivers the altered hydrological conditions and wq created an oriented screening of aquatic organisms that polluted sensitive species were gradually eliminated gradually leading to a simplified ecosystem however the affected ecosystems were difficult to repair in the short time in addition water pollution was more closely related to short term human activities these may be the main reason why we was more seriously affected by lu than wq in our study in order to support our speculation about the alteration of hydrological conditions and wq due to the regulation of dams and sluices a dam baiguishan built in 1966 located in upstream of the basin and two sluices huaidian and fuyang built in 1975 and 1963 respectively located in midstream and downstream of the basin respectively were selected and the change of their monthly average discharge flow before and after construction of the dam and sluices were plotted in fig 6 from which it can be seen that before the dam and sluices were built see fig 6a c and e the stream flow showed no obvious change characteristics because it was strongly correlated with weather conditions especially precipitation however the flow curve became smooth and the peak flow was reduced after the dam and sluices were built see fig 6b d and f the discharge flow was concentrated in months from june to september due to the large opening proportion of gates of dams and sluices it was small in the rest months due to the small opening proportion of gates of dams and sluices more importantly the peak flow in months from june to september was severely reduced that is the flow curve showed a regularity therefore regulation of dams and sluices that makes the flow curve smooth the discharge flow concentrated and the peak flow reduced has great impact of river hydrological conditions which in turn impact river water quality and ecology the hydrological impact of dams and sluices was also proved by the change of water level reflecting stream water storage as given in fig 7 from which it can be seen that the change in water levels was small from january to december after they were built compared to that before dams and sluices were built reflecting the small change of water storage in rivers due to regulation of dams and sluices in order to illustrate the impact of regulation of dams and sluices on wq zhoukou station located in midstream of shaying river the largest tributary of huai river jialuhe station located in the downstream of jialu river the most polluted tributary of shaying river used as a verify of our result in the same basin and huangqiao station located in the downstream of kui river another tributary of huai river used as a verify of our result in the adjacent dam dominated basin were selected and nh4 n and codmn were used as representative indicators based on data availability see fig 8 it can be seen that water quality showed a significant downward trend with may to july as a turning point water quality in months from january to may was poor however the water quality was improved after july according to fig 6 stream flow was small in months from january to june due to the small opening proportion of gates of most dams and sluices for water storage pollutions from residents and agricultural cultivation lu and urbanization in our paper were not easily diluted and degraded resulting in more serious pollution compared to that after the may with great stream flow for peak flow regulation therefore the regulation of dams and sluices made seasonal variation on wq that the dry season was more polluted than the rainy season in srb according to fig 5 a b the impact degree of lu on wq in sub1 varied between 0 and 0 3 with the average of 0 14 in winter which was greater than that in summer with the value changed between 0 and 0 1 with the average of 0 05 therefore the impact of lu on wq showed a seasonal variation with higher impact in winter than that in summer in sub1 the same seasonal variation was also found in sub2 with the impact degrees varied between 0 13 and 0 45 with the average of 0 35 in summer and varied between 0 16 and 0 52 with the average of 0 33 in winter however the seasonal variation of the impact degree was not obvious in sub2 compared to that in sub1 therefore we concluded that the impact of lu on wq had a significant seasonality with higher impact in winter than that in summer and the seasonal variation of wq was smaller as the disturbance of lu increased it can be explained as following it is cold and dry in winter with little rainfall and weaken river mobility but is warm and wet in summer accompanied by frequent storms that cause large water flow and strong degradation of pollutants zhang et al 2015 more importantly as we found in fig 8 the seasonal variation of water quality was seriously affected by regulation of dams and sluices which made water pollution worsen in the dry season than in the rainy season in the srb however dams and sluices are less frequently regulated in low human disturbed areas than high human disturbed areas due to less agricultural and urban residential water demand which reduces the seasonality of wq in addition the faster in low human disturbed areas reduces the less the seasonality of water quality changes xu et al 2019 in literature many studies had verified the impact of lu on wq ferreira marmontel et al 2018 salerno et al 2018 some of them concluded the same seasonal variation results in wq in basins with construction of dams and sluices for example brainwood et al 2004 suggested that the concentrations of wq indicators may increase slightly during periods of low runoff flow and decrease during summer due to high rainfall events however some studies have reached the opposite conclusion nthunya et al 2019 this may be related to the factors such as scheduling rules and the number of dams and sluices land use types climate and human activity intensity in the basin however since the number of dams and sluices did not change during our study period and will not change in the near future in the srb the regulation of dams and sluice in the basin can be considered to be stable every year therefore our findings in the impact of lu on wq in the srb were meaningful for water resources and ecological management of the basin according to fig 5 c d the seasonal variation of we influenced by lu was not significant in the srb the impacts of lu on we in sub1 varied between 0 38 and 0 61 with the average of 0 47 in summer and between 0 32 and 0 59 with the average of 0 44 in winter the impact degrees in sub2 varied between 0 45 and 0 52 with the average of 0 49 in summer and between 0 37 and 0 55 with the average of 0 50 in winter moreover the correlation between the proportion of lu patterns and we indicators was not significant and none of them passed the significant level test of 0 05 table 5 our results in we were consistent with many studies powilleit and kube 1999 zhou et al 2009 luo et al 2018b revealing that seasonal changes in biological community compositions were not observed this is the biological indices between wet and dry seasons were not significantly different it may be due to different feature between water quality and ecological indicators the change of wq indicators was susceptible to the surrounding environment and had a nature of abrupt change while we indicators showed that aquatic organisms had a stable community structure and had the ability to adapt and improve their surrounding environment therefore the stable community structure of river aquatic organisms formed by long term environmental screening was difficult to change in the short term in addition the surrounding environment such as lu patterns impervious area and water pollution had a serious time lag effect on we due to environmental adaptability of aquatic organisms such as phytoplankton and macrobenthos even though many studies have revealed the lag effect of land use on we quantitatively amiri et al 2019 recknagel et al 2013 these studies are limited to some statistical methods such as regression analysis and wavelet analysis without the consideration of the interaction mechanism between aquatic organisms and their surrounding environment this is also the dilemma facing in our research and needs more rich experimental data support however since aquatic communities that were formed by long term environmental screening were difficult to change in the short term four years of monitoring data may be sufficient for we in our study a longer data series may improve the results overall the impact of lu on we is very complex and the long in depth research with the support of long series monitoring data should improve our understanding for the purpose of sustainable development of human and nature for individual land use patterns table 5 and fig 5 a b forest land had a significant negative correlation with negative wq indicators such as tn tp nh4 n and codmn and a positive correlation with positive wq indicator such as do cultivated and residential lands showed an inverse correlation with wq indicators compared to forest land this is they showed positive correlations with negative wq indicators and negative correlations with positive wq indicators therefore forest land had a positive impact on wq and the cultivated land and residential land that had a negative impact on wq in our study 3 6 effects of urbanization on water quality and ecology urban expansion accompanied by population growth and increasing human activity is an important factor driving the deterioration of wq and we the srb was undergoing a stable urban expansion according to statistical yearbook of henan province and anhui province the population in the basin increased by 15 33 from 2000 to 2016 with the average annual growth rate of 0 67 according to fig 5 urbanization had a small impact on wq in sub1 the impact degrees of wq indicators varied between 0 02 and 0 24 with the average of 0 09 in sub1 and showed a seasonal variation that the impact degrees in winter were slightly greater than that in summer the impact degrees of wq in sub2 varied between 0 30 and 0 45 with the average of 0 34 also showed a similar seasonal variation of wq to sub1 this further illustrated the seasonal impact of regulation of dams and sluices on wq it can be seen from fig 9 that the indexes of wqi and wei in the basin showed an overall deteriorating trend with increasing or decreasing fluctuations in some years it also showed an increasing trend of the impact of urbanization on wq and we in the basin we conducted a significant test on the trend of the indexes of wqi and wei and impact degrees of wq and we using manner kendall non parametric test the results of wei and the impact degree of we passed the 90 and 95 significance test with the z statistics of 1 48 and 2 10 respectively the absolute value of z for the significance levels of 90 and 95 are 1 28 and 1 64 respectively therefore the increase of urbanization and the deterioration of ecology kept the same trend in the srb even though it was not obvious in some sps however wqi did not show significant trends this may be related to significant seasonal changes in water quality due to regulation of dams and sluices as we discussed above 4 conclusions the primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we in different seasonal and human activity scenarios in a dam dominated basin based on water ecological experiment a framework was formed to illustrate the process of impact assessment and clarify the logical relationship of methods used for this purpose the fce and one way anova were used to assess the level and spatial difference of wq and we respectively the cca method which has the advantage of dealing with the relationship between two sets of variables was employed to assess the overall impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we our results show that wq had a strong relationship with lu compared to urbanization indicating that wq was more likely affected by lu one way anova of wqe among sps showed a spatial distribution of decreasing from upstream to downstream in the srb with more polluted in middle and lower streams than the upstream the impact of lu on wq showed a significant seasonal variation with slightly higher degree of impact in winter than that in summer in the low human disturbed sub basin however the feature became unobvious in the high human disturbed sub basin the impact of urbanization on wq showed the same seasonal variation characteristic as lu lu and urbanization had a complex impact on we with no significant seasonal variation in the srb moreover our results showed a more serious level of we influenced by lu and urbanization compared to wq in the basin due to the long term impact and screening of damaged environment on aquatic organisms the findings may be useful in other similar basins in summary our findings in the dam dominated basin were concluded as follows 1 lu and urbanization had a significant seasonal impact on wq with higher impact in winter than that in summer and the seasonal variation of the impact was weakened as the disturbance of lu and urbanization increased 2 the impact of lu and urbanization on we had no significant seasonal variation in the srb 3 lu and urbanization had a greater impact on we compared to wq in the srb 4 wq had a more significant dispersion than we in the basin and the dispersion in low human disturbed regions was greater than that in the high human disturbed regions 5 the main pollutions in the srb were tn tp codmn and nh4 n declaration of competing interest the authors

5601,improving water quality and ecological status is an important foundation for sustainability development increasing human activity and the corresponding land use change lead to the deterioration of river water quality wq and water ecology we but the pathway is complex especially in dam dominated basins with the altered streamflow by the joint regulation of multiple dams and sluices that leads to changes in wq seasonally however the research on this issue is inadequate and it is urgently needed since a large number of dams and sluices have been built worldwide for socioeconomic benefits putting the basin s wq and we under pressure based on water ecological experiment a framework was proposed to assess the impact of land use lu and urbanization on wq and we in different scenarios derived from human activities low and intense and seasonality winter and summer in a dam dominated basin the framework was applied to the shaying river basin located in the central china as a case study the remote sensing of landsat 8 oli tirs images and geographic information system gis were combined by using the support vector machine classification method to extract the land use patterns and to map the spatial distribution diagrams of wq and we indicators based on in situ experimental data a canonical correlation analysis method and pearson correlation testing were adopted to evaluate the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we in the basin results showed that lu and urbanization had a great impact on we compared to wq due to the slow reaction of ecosystem in the basin because the former was resulted by long term regulation of dams and sluices and the latter was related to the short term changes of river environment moreover the former was attributed to the latter largely lu and urbanization impact on wq had a significant seasonality with higher impact in winter than in summer and the seasonality of the impact was weakened as the disturbance of lu and urbanization increased the seasonal variation of we indicators was almost not significant in our study due to their adaptability to surrounding environment our results provide insights to water resources

kolmogorov smirnov sweq surface water environmental quality standard wqi water quality index wei water ecological index 1 introduction land use lu change directly reflects the important influence of human activity on river water quality wq and water ecology we gu et al 2019 different categories of lu affect the transmission of runoff into surface water bodies in different ways block or accelerate which in turn affect the exchange of pollutions from land to surface water bodies kändler et al 2017 the changed surface water quality will form a new ecological environment that is different from the original one resulting in a direct biological screening based on the adaptability of aquatic organisms to the newly formed environment urbanization accompanied by the production of pollutions is a special pattern of lu and highly reflects human activities having dramatic effects on aquatic ecosystems increases in urban land have been described as one of the greatest contributors to the increase of pollutions in freshwater ecosystems worldwide mello et al 2018 it is considered that urbanization is no doubt a key factor affecting the future of water quality in urbanized watersheds salerno et al 2018 in this regard we must consider that globally the number of people living in urban areas is increasing each year with urban populations projected to account for 66 of the total global population by 2050 un desa 2014 salerno et al 2018 as urbanization increases urban populations and pollutants point and diffuse pollutions will increase significantly in addition the natural landscapes will be fragmented and converted into impervious surfaces resulting in increasing peak flows and increasing volumes of runoff liu et al 2018 pollutions that were not treated by urban sewage system will enter receiving water bodies with runoff at a faster speed and with a higher probability however it is worth noting that the interaction between lu and river system is more complex in high human disturbed basins with multiple dams and sluices the joint regulation of dams and sluices results in the altered streamflow and self purification capacity of rivers zhao et al 2019 pollutions will be retained in the river for long time and affect river ecosystem prolongedly compared to basins without dams and sluices the seasonal impact of wq and we may become more significant in this kind of basins unfortunately according to lehner et al 2011 and zarfl et al 2015 the number of dams in the world is estimated to be 16 million with a total storage of approximately 8000 km3 and dam construction is expected to continue in the future according to zhang et al 2017 millions of sluices with storage capacity 0 10 million m3 had been constructed globally by 2005 meaning that wq and we in many basins worldwide suffer from impact of dams and sluices therefore studying the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we in dam dominated basins would greatly increase our understanding about changes in wq and we affected by dams and sluices this knowledge will help decision making for sustainable water resources management in literature although many efforts have been made to improve wq and we in the world including the european water framework directive eu wfd for improving the overall status of waterbodies and the clean water act cwa in the united states for reducing surface water pollution from specific kinds of sources water quality and ecology are still serious issues worldwide mostert 2003 pander and geist 2013 raff and earnhart 2019 for example according to european environment agency 2018 good ecological status is currently not achieved in 59 of river and 48 of lake water bodies mainly due to diffuse pollution and hydromorphological degradation mack et al 2019 numerous studies have been carried out on the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we mainly focusing on 1 the response relationship of wq to different lu patterns and urbanization karmakar et al 2019 wijesiri et al 2018 2 the impact of lu in multiple spatial scales and different pollution sources point and diffuse pollutions on wq and we giri et al 2018 wan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 and 3 the impact of lu and urbanization on seasonal variation of wq mello et al 2018 shi et al 2017 these studies revealed the spatial and temporal variability of the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we which are critical for appropriate management strategies in basins without dam or sluice construction however the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we are more complicated under the impact of dams and sluices in particular joint regulation of dams and sluices may cause the seasonal variation of wq and we some studies have implied that the changes in lu and urbanization impacted the rivers aquatic biota and had adverse effects on functions and management of water resources notably in dam dominated basins frémion et al 2016 therefore more attentions should be paid to the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we in dam dominated basins due to the large number of dams and sluices worldwide and their increasing tendency in future lehner et al 2011 zarfl et al 2015 unfortunately to the best of our knowledge the impact of luu on wq and we has not been investigated in high human disturbed watersheds with multiple dams and sluices in different seasons and this motivates our current research in our previous research we studied the human affected evolution connotation and assessment method of river ecosystem luo et al 2018a and then a multi indicator and distance based method with advantages of solving system impact problems under limited data conditions to study the impact of socioeconomic system on the river system luo et al 2019 however lu and urbanization indicators were not considered in our previous studies moreover the seasonal variation of wq and we due to the joint regulation of multiple dams and sluices which alters streamflow greatly were not investigated in our previous studies this paper focuses mainly on the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we and their seasonal variation due to regulation of dams and sluices a framework was formed in different scenarios derived from human activities low and intense and seasonality winter and summer for the purpose the shaying river basin srb which is located in central china and is the main grain production base of henan province is used as a case study since 1950s many dams and sluices have been built in the basin to alleviate water shortages resulting in many segmented sections in the main stream of the basin pollutions were difficult to degrade in rivers when dams and sluices were built due to reduced water mobility leading to serious river pollution and ecological degradation it is necessary to study the impact of lu and urbanization that are main sources of pollution on wq and we for the environmental and ecological restoration as well as sustainable basin development the paper is organized as follows the study area and data collection and processing are given in the next section followed by the determination of assessment indicators and scales of data and then a framework for assessing the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we the assessment of the status and seasonal variation of wq and we was given in sections 3 1 3 4 and the impact of lu and urbanization and influence of regulation of dams and sluices on wq and we in different scenarios were given in sections 3 5 and 3 6 the results for the srb as the case study were given for providing important insights to water resources management and ecological restoration of the basin and similar basins with dense dams and sluices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area shaying river which is the largest and the most polluted tributary of the huaihe river in china was selected as a case study see the upper left panel in fig 1 the length of the river is 621 20 km and the basin area is 39075 30 km2 it is densely populated with a population density of 877 98 heads km2 in 2016 the mean annual temperature varies between 14 c and 16 c and the average annual precipitation ranges from 407 7 mm to 1295 8 mm many dams and sluices were built to alleviate the shortage of water resources and control floods in the basin luo et al 2018a because the main land use patterns in the basin were residential land and cultivated land accounting for 17 25 and 50 59 of the total basin area respectively the key pollutions of the basin were total nitrogen total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen li and zhao 2010 which were caused by both urban point and agricultural diffuse pollutions rapid urban development and large scale cultivated and residential land expansion were main contributors to wq pollution and we degradation in the basin 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 land use and urbanization landsat 8 oli tirs provided by geospatial data cloud site http www gscloud cn in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 were used to extract lu patterns using the remote sensing based supervise classification methods four main lu patterns were interpreted in the basin including forest land fl cultivated land cl residential land rl urban and rural and water bodies wb therefore the lu mainly refers to the four lu patterns based on the characteristics of density population rapid economic development and urbanization processes in the srb it is difficult to represent the impact of urbanization on wq and we using only changes in residential land area therefore per capita gross domestic product gdp was selected to represent the development level of social economy urbanization rate ur was employed as an integrated indicator to reflect the size and level of urban economic development that is urbanization mainly refers to per capita gdp and ur in our study the data of per capita gdp and ur were provided by the henan statistical yearbook http www ha stats gov cn sitesources hntj page pc index html and anhui statistical yearbook http www ahtjj gov cn tjjweb web index jsp 2 2 2 water ecological experiment the data of wq and we were collected from water ecological experiment carried out in the srb seven sampling points sp at zhaopingtai sp1 baiguishan sp2 luohe sp3 zhoukou sp4 huaidian sp5 fuyang sp6 and yingshang sp7 stations were set along with the mainstream of shaying river see the upper left panel in fig 1 among them sp1 sp2 and sp3 were located in the upper reaches of the river while sp4 and sp5 were located in the middle reaches of the river and sp6 and sp7 were located in the lower reaches of the river water samples were collected in july and december each year from july 2013 to december 2016 monitored wq indicators included total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp permanganate index codmn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and dissolved oxygen do based on the standard of water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods therefore the wq mainly refers to these monitored chemical indicators in our study monitored we indicators included phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos according to freshwater animals survey technical specification no db43 t 432 2009 the shannon wiener diversity index of phytoplankton p swi zooplankton z swi and zoobenthos b swi were then calculated therefore the we mainly refers to diversity of phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos in rivers in our study if the monitored value of indicators was lower than the detection level we replaced them with the minimum detection level pinto and maheshwari 2011 the details of specific sample monitoring and processing methods were described in luo et al 2018a due to the complexity of on site riparian environment there are many challenges in the monitoring experiment causing experimental errors that are difficult to control such as riparian hardening and riparian habitat changes with seasonality and regulation of dams and sluices first the riparian hardening makes it difficult to keep the same location for sampling every year and the length and area of sampling are difficult to meet requirements of monitoring standards these increased the uncertainty of the experiment we try to avoid this kind of errors by setting sps in areas where riparian hardening is not serious second riparian inundation areas change with seasonality and regulation of dams and sluices therefore the shallow riparian areas are not necessarily long term habitats for aquatic organisms leading to sampling errors we can do almost nothing to this kind of errors caused by natural and uncontrollable human activity factors certainly there are also experimental errors caused by man made and climatic factors such as irregular experimental operations rainfall and temperature 2 3 assessment flowchart and methods fig 2 gives the flowchart of our study equations in the flowchart were listed in table 1 first data were collected and processed including remote sensing statistical data and water ecological experiment data see section 2 2 for detailed data sources among them digital elevation model dem provided by the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn and location of sps used as the outlets were used to delineate sub basins that reflect different levels of human activities using gis technology second assessment indicators were determined and data was processed at temporal and spatial scales variance inflation factors vif was used to test the multicollinearity of selected indicators to avoid the overlapping of information between indicators according to katrutsa and strijov 2017 indicators with the vif value of greater than five were deleted because of a large multicollinearity problem as the indicators of urbanization were calculated at the spatial scale of administrative regions and the indicators of wq and we were collected at the point scale of sps these indicators need to be converted to a sub basin scale for the calculation as below area percentage of administrative regions and sub basins were used to convert the indicators of urbanization from administrative regions to sub basins the values of each wq and we indicator at different sps located in a same sub basin were averaged as the corresponding indicator value of the sub basin third the levels of wq and we and their differences at different sps were assessed using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce method and the one way analysis of variance anova with the significance level of p 0 05 zhang et al 2019 respectively the fce method has the advantages of easy implementation and directly reflecting the relationship between indicators and corresponding evaluation criteria in the surface water environmental quality standard sweq of china state environmental protection administration of china and general administration of quality supervision and inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china 2002 in our previous research we assigned each indicator of wq and we into one of five categories according to the sweq namely the worst worse normal better and optimal see luo et al 2018a for detail water quality index wqi with the value between 0 and 1 was used to reflect the status of river wq the larger the wqi value is the better the river water quality is similar to wqi the water ecological index wei also with the value between 0 and 1 was used to reflect the status of river we the larger the wei value is the better the river we is fourth the effects of lu and urbanization on wq and we were assessed in different scenarios of seasonality winter and summer and human activities sub1 with a low human intervention and sub2 with a high human intervention see the upper left panel in fig 1 using canonical correlation analysis cca method the cca method which has the advantage of dealing with the correlation between one set of indicators and another set of indicators was integrated with a distance based impact assessment method to study the effect of lu and urbanization on wq and we the cca method was used to extract the consistent changing trend of lu and urbanization indicators and wq and we indicators and then the integrated influence of lu and urbanization on wq and we can be quantified based on the extracted consistent information in trends of their indicators weights the measured wq and we values and their upper and lower limits we used kolmogorov smirnov k s test cho and choi 2014 to examine the normality of data to ensure properness of using the one way anova and the cca methods the core steps and processes of the cca and the distance based impact assessment method can be simplified as the calculations of 1 the influence degree of each wq and we indicator using the distance based impact assessment method 2 the correlation between lu and urbanization indicators and wq and we indicators using the cca method 3 the influence degree of each lu and urbanization indicator on wq and we based on eigenvalues for calculating the weights of lu and urbanization indicators and eigenvectors for calculating the linear coefficients of wq and urbanization indicators calculated in step two with the cca method and 4 the influence degree of lu and urbanization on wq and we through the weighted summation of influence degrees of lu and urbanization indicator on wq and we calculated in step three detailed description can be found in luo et al 2019 the influence degree was divided into five levels with the intervals of 0 2 for ease of analysis that is no impact less than 0 2 low impact between 0 2 and 0 4 moderate impact between 0 4 and 0 6 high impact between 0 6 and 0 8 and extreme impact greater than 0 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of land use and urbanization map processing and spatial analysis were performed in software of arcgis 10 2 using the gis technology esri environmental systems research institute the results of lu classification based on the landsat 8 oli tirs images showed that the srb mainly consisted of four lu patterns as forest land cultivated land residential land and water bodies see the right panel in fig 1 and table 2 among them cultivated land and residential land accounting for about 50 59 and 17 25 of the total area of the srb respectively were the main lu patterns indicating the high intensity human activities the results of the markov transition matrix in table 3 showed that the forest land water bodies and residential land were transferred mainly to cultivated land while cultivated land was transferred mainly to residential land however in term of the magnitude of lu pattern change the area of residential land transferred to cultivated land with the value of 923 80 km2 was much smaller than the area in which cultivated land transferred to residential land with the value of 3447 16 km2 this further indicated the rapid urban expansion and intense human activity in the srb fig 3 is the statistical results of per capita gdp and urbanization rate it can be seen from the figure that the average of per capita gdp from 2013 to 2016 was 34325 90 rmb chinese yuan in the basin which was lower than the national average level of 48810 25 rmb national bureau of statistics of china http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj the average of urbanization rate during the same period was 43 27 which was also lower than the national average level of 55 49 compared to sub1 see the upper left panel in fig 1 with the average of per capita gdp of 30510 57 rmb and urbanization rate of 40 09 the level of urbanization in sub2 see the upper left panel in fig 1 was greater with the average of per capita gdp of 35690 05 rmb and urbanization rate of 44 46 showing that the sub2 had a higher human activity intensity compared to that in sub1 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of water quality and ecological indicators according to results of the vif test the largest vif value for wq and we indicators was 2 39 and 1 02 respectively both of which were smaller than the empirical threshold value of 5 indicating that the tested data has no serious information overlapping problems therefore the selected indicators were considered meaningful the monitored wq and we indicators in the srb were given in fig 1 see the lower left panel from which it can be seen that the tn concentration changed between 0 36 mg l and 8 83 mg l with the average of 3 34 mg l according to the sweq when the tn concentration is more than 2 mg l the wq is particularly poor a total of five classes are defined according to concentrations of surface wq indicators in the sweq which higher grade value indicating worse surface wq therefore tn pollution in the srb was very serious compared to sub2 with the average value of 4 58 mg l the average concentration of the tn in sub1 was 1 69 mg l indicating that the tn pollution in sub2 was more serious than sub1 in addition to tn indicators of tp codmn and nh4 n also had high concentration values in the srb most of them belonged to a pollution level of class iv of the sweq the class of water was designated as general industrial and recreational water use as there is no direct contact with human bodies however in some river sections of the basin the concentrations of some wq indicators such as nh4 n exceeded the class v according to our monitoring results especially in zhoukou station and huaidian station located in the middle reaches of the basin therefore tn tp codmn and nh4 n were main pollutions in the srb 3 3 analysis of variance homogeneity of variance test and the k s test were performed before one way anova the results of the k s test indicated that significances of indicators of tn tp codmn nh4 n do p swi z swi and b swi with values of 0 239 0 076 0 603 0 051 0 174 0 783 0 686 and 0 779 were all greater than 0 05 suggesting that the selected data were accepted as normal distributions the results of homogeneity of variance test showed that significances of statistics of wq and we indicators with values of 0 052 tn 0 063 tp 0 414 codmn 0 062 nh4 n 0 756 do 0 398 p swi 0 366 z swi and 0 674 b swi which were greater than 0 05 least significant difference passed a significance level of 0 05 after one way anova of each wq and we indicator one by one with a total of 8 the number of indicators with significant differences between each sp and the remaining sps were counted and listed in table 4 from which it can be seen that sp1 located in the upper reaches of the srb had an obvious difference from sp4 sp5 sp6 and sp7 the number of indicators with significant differences were 5 5 4 and 4 respectively accounting for 62 5 62 5 50 0 and 50 0 of the total number of 8 indicators sp2 located in the upper reaches of the srb was obviously different from sp4 sp5 and sp6 the number of indicators with significant differences were 4 4 and 4 respectively all accounting for 50 0 of the total number of 8 indicators similarly sp3 located in the upper reaches of the srb was obviously different from sp4 sp5 and sp6 the percentage of difference was 50 0 50 0 and 37 5 respectively indicating that sp3 was also obviously different from sp4 sp5 and sp6 in summary wq and we in sp1 sp2 and sp3 located in the upper reaches of the srb were obviously different from that in sp4 sp5 and sp6 located in the middle and lower reaches of the srb 3 4 assessment of water quality and ecology fig 4 depicts the results of wq and we assessment at sps from sp1 to sp7 and sub basins of sub1 and sub2 according to fig 4 a b the wqi changed from 0 26 to 0 93 in the srb indicating a large spatial difference in wq in the basin in summer july the wqi with the average of 0 66 showed a decreasing trend from sp1 to sp7 however in winter the decreasing trend of wqi with the average of 0 58 was not obvious instead it showed a v shaped spatial trend which decreased first and then increased from the upper to the lower reaches of the srb indicating the poor wq status in the middle reaches of the srb and a seasonal variation of wq status with better quality in summer than that in winter the mean wqis in sub1 with the value of 0 84 and 0 71 in summer and winter respectively and sub2 with the value of 0 71 and 0 49 in summer and winter respectively also showed a better water quality in summer than that in winter fig 4 c d showed the results of wei that changed from 0 25 to 0 68 with the average of 0 44 in summer and changed from 0 12 to 0 70 with the average of 0 46 in winter showing that the difference of wei between summer and winter was not significant there is also no significant difference in aquatic biodiversity between summer and winter indicating that aquatic organisms had no significant seasonal changes in the basin it can be seen from fig 4 e that the sp1 sp2 sp3 and sp4 had a greater distance between upper and lower quartiles in corresponding wqi box plots compared to sp5 sp6 and sp7 sub1 low human interference also had a greater degree of dispersion than sub2 high human interference in wqi according to fig 4 f the dispersion of wei was not obvious compared to wqi therefore wq had a more significant dispersion than we in the basin and the dispersion of wq indicators was greater in low human disturbed regions than that in the high human disturbed regions water storage and regulation of dams and sluices may be important factors causing a greater dispersion of wq indicators in upper reaches of the srb on the one hand water storage in upstream sections of the srb was much less than that in its midstream and downstream meaning that rivers in upstream of the basin were more sensitive to water pollution due to limited pollution acceptance and self purification capacity on the other hand water shortage was serious in the srb due to uneven precipitation distribution over time and a lot of household agricultural and industrial water demand regulation of dams and sluices for alleviating water shortages altered flow regime in rivers causing large fluctuations in wq indicators 3 5 effects of land use on river water quality and ecology the impact degree of lu on wq and we in fig 5 showed that lu had a greater impact on we with the impact degree changed between 0 31 and 0 60 with the average of 0 48 than wq with the impact degree changed between 0 03 and 0 41 with the average of 0 22 we speculate that this was caused by the overlaying impact of the alteration of aquatic habitat environment due to the regulation of dams and sluices mainly referring to river hydrological conditions and water quality and the adaptive capacity of aquatic organisms to their surrounding environment because residential land and agricultural land were main lu patterns as well as the main source of pollution in the basin the regulation of dams and sluices was highly related to water demand of residential and agricultural production which led to the alteration of hydrological conditions and the weakening of dilution and degradation of pollutants in rivers the altered hydrological conditions and wq created an oriented screening of aquatic organisms that polluted sensitive species were gradually eliminated gradually leading to a simplified ecosystem however the affected ecosystems were difficult to repair in the short time in addition water pollution was more closely related to short term human activities these may be the main reason why we was more seriously affected by lu than wq in our study in order to support our speculation about the alteration of hydrological conditions and wq due to the regulation of dams and sluices a dam baiguishan built in 1966 located in upstream of the basin and two sluices huaidian and fuyang built in 1975 and 1963 respectively located in midstream and downstream of the basin respectively were selected and the change of their monthly average discharge flow before and after construction of the dam and sluices were plotted in fig 6 from which it can be seen that before the dam and sluices were built see fig 6a c and e the stream flow showed no obvious change characteristics because it was strongly correlated with weather conditions especially precipitation however the flow curve became smooth and the peak flow was reduced after the dam and sluices were built see fig 6b d and f the discharge flow was concentrated in months from june to september due to the large opening proportion of gates of dams and sluices it was small in the rest months due to the small opening proportion of gates of dams and sluices more importantly the peak flow in months from june to september was severely reduced that is the flow curve showed a regularity therefore regulation of dams and sluices that makes the flow curve smooth the discharge flow concentrated and the peak flow reduced has great impact of river hydrological conditions which in turn impact river water quality and ecology the hydrological impact of dams and sluices was also proved by the change of water level reflecting stream water storage as given in fig 7 from which it can be seen that the change in water levels was small from january to december after they were built compared to that before dams and sluices were built reflecting the small change of water storage in rivers due to regulation of dams and sluices in order to illustrate the impact of regulation of dams and sluices on wq zhoukou station located in midstream of shaying river the largest tributary of huai river jialuhe station located in the downstream of jialu river the most polluted tributary of shaying river used as a verify of our result in the same basin and huangqiao station located in the downstream of kui river another tributary of huai river used as a verify of our result in the adjacent dam dominated basin were selected and nh4 n and codmn were used as representative indicators based on data availability see fig 8 it can be seen that water quality showed a significant downward trend with may to july as a turning point water quality in months from january to may was poor however the water quality was improved after july according to fig 6 stream flow was small in months from january to june due to the small opening proportion of gates of most dams and sluices for water storage pollutions from residents and agricultural cultivation lu and urbanization in our paper were not easily diluted and degraded resulting in more serious pollution compared to that after the may with great stream flow for peak flow regulation therefore the regulation of dams and sluices made seasonal variation on wq that the dry season was more polluted than the rainy season in srb according to fig 5 a b the impact degree of lu on wq in sub1 varied between 0 and 0 3 with the average of 0 14 in winter which was greater than that in summer with the value changed between 0 and 0 1 with the average of 0 05 therefore the impact of lu on wq showed a seasonal variation with higher impact in winter than that in summer in sub1 the same seasonal variation was also found in sub2 with the impact degrees varied between 0 13 and 0 45 with the average of 0 35 in summer and varied between 0 16 and 0 52 with the average of 0 33 in winter however the seasonal variation of the impact degree was not obvious in sub2 compared to that in sub1 therefore we concluded that the impact of lu on wq had a significant seasonality with higher impact in winter than that in summer and the seasonal variation of wq was smaller as the disturbance of lu increased it can be explained as following it is cold and dry in winter with little rainfall and weaken river mobility but is warm and wet in summer accompanied by frequent storms that cause large water flow and strong degradation of pollutants zhang et al 2015 more importantly as we found in fig 8 the seasonal variation of water quality was seriously affected by regulation of dams and sluices which made water pollution worsen in the dry season than in the rainy season in the srb however dams and sluices are less frequently regulated in low human disturbed areas than high human disturbed areas due to less agricultural and urban residential water demand which reduces the seasonality of wq in addition the faster in low human disturbed areas reduces the less the seasonality of water quality changes xu et al 2019 in literature many studies had verified the impact of lu on wq ferreira marmontel et al 2018 salerno et al 2018 some of them concluded the same seasonal variation results in wq in basins with construction of dams and sluices for example brainwood et al 2004 suggested that the concentrations of wq indicators may increase slightly during periods of low runoff flow and decrease during summer due to high rainfall events however some studies have reached the opposite conclusion nthunya et al 2019 this may be related to the factors such as scheduling rules and the number of dams and sluices land use types climate and human activity intensity in the basin however since the number of dams and sluices did not change during our study period and will not change in the near future in the srb the regulation of dams and sluice in the basin can be considered to be stable every year therefore our findings in the impact of lu on wq in the srb were meaningful for water resources and ecological management of the basin according to fig 5 c d the seasonal variation of we influenced by lu was not significant in the srb the impacts of lu on we in sub1 varied between 0 38 and 0 61 with the average of 0 47 in summer and between 0 32 and 0 59 with the average of 0 44 in winter the impact degrees in sub2 varied between 0 45 and 0 52 with the average of 0 49 in summer and between 0 37 and 0 55 with the average of 0 50 in winter moreover the correlation between the proportion of lu patterns and we indicators was not significant and none of them passed the significant level test of 0 05 table 5 our results in we were consistent with many studies powilleit and kube 1999 zhou et al 2009 luo et al 2018b revealing that seasonal changes in biological community compositions were not observed this is the biological indices between wet and dry seasons were not significantly different it may be due to different feature between water quality and ecological indicators the change of wq indicators was susceptible to the surrounding environment and had a nature of abrupt change while we indicators showed that aquatic organisms had a stable community structure and had the ability to adapt and improve their surrounding environment therefore the stable community structure of river aquatic organisms formed by long term environmental screening was difficult to change in the short term in addition the surrounding environment such as lu patterns impervious area and water pollution had a serious time lag effect on we due to environmental adaptability of aquatic organisms such as phytoplankton and macrobenthos even though many studies have revealed the lag effect of land use on we quantitatively amiri et al 2019 recknagel et al 2013 these studies are limited to some statistical methods such as regression analysis and wavelet analysis without the consideration of the interaction mechanism between aquatic organisms and their surrounding environment this is also the dilemma facing in our research and needs more rich experimental data support however since aquatic communities that were formed by long term environmental screening were difficult to change in the short term four years of monitoring data may be sufficient for we in our study a longer data series may improve the results overall the impact of lu on we is very complex and the long in depth research with the support of long series monitoring data should improve our understanding for the purpose of sustainable development of human and nature for individual land use patterns table 5 and fig 5 a b forest land had a significant negative correlation with negative wq indicators such as tn tp nh4 n and codmn and a positive correlation with positive wq indicator such as do cultivated and residential lands showed an inverse correlation with wq indicators compared to forest land this is they showed positive correlations with negative wq indicators and negative correlations with positive wq indicators therefore forest land had a positive impact on wq and the cultivated land and residential land that had a negative impact on wq in our study 3 6 effects of urbanization on water quality and ecology urban expansion accompanied by population growth and increasing human activity is an important factor driving the deterioration of wq and we the srb was undergoing a stable urban expansion according to statistical yearbook of henan province and anhui province the population in the basin increased by 15 33 from 2000 to 2016 with the average annual growth rate of 0 67 according to fig 5 urbanization had a small impact on wq in sub1 the impact degrees of wq indicators varied between 0 02 and 0 24 with the average of 0 09 in sub1 and showed a seasonal variation that the impact degrees in winter were slightly greater than that in summer the impact degrees of wq in sub2 varied between 0 30 and 0 45 with the average of 0 34 also showed a similar seasonal variation of wq to sub1 this further illustrated the seasonal impact of regulation of dams and sluices on wq it can be seen from fig 9 that the indexes of wqi and wei in the basin showed an overall deteriorating trend with increasing or decreasing fluctuations in some years it also showed an increasing trend of the impact of urbanization on wq and we in the basin we conducted a significant test on the trend of the indexes of wqi and wei and impact degrees of wq and we using manner kendall non parametric test the results of wei and the impact degree of we passed the 90 and 95 significance test with the z statistics of 1 48 and 2 10 respectively the absolute value of z for the significance levels of 90 and 95 are 1 28 and 1 64 respectively therefore the increase of urbanization and the deterioration of ecology kept the same trend in the srb even though it was not obvious in some sps however wqi did not show significant trends this may be related to significant seasonal changes in water quality due to regulation of dams and sluices as we discussed above 4 conclusions the primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we in different seasonal and human activity scenarios in a dam dominated basin based on water ecological experiment a framework was formed to illustrate the process of impact assessment and clarify the logical relationship of methods used for this purpose the fce and one way anova were used to assess the level and spatial difference of wq and we respectively the cca method which has the advantage of dealing with the relationship between two sets of variables was employed to assess the overall impact of lu and urbanization on wq and we our results show that wq had a strong relationship with lu compared to urbanization indicating that wq was more likely affected by lu one way anova of wqe among sps showed a spatial distribution of decreasing from upstream to downstream in the srb with more polluted in middle and lower streams than the upstream the impact of lu on wq showed a significant seasonal variation with slightly higher degree of impact in winter than that in summer in the low human disturbed sub basin however the feature became unobvious in the high human disturbed sub basin the impact of urbanization on wq showed the same seasonal variation characteristic as lu lu and urbanization had a complex impact on we with no significant seasonal variation in the srb moreover our results showed a more serious level of we influenced by lu and urbanization compared to wq in the basin due to the long term impact and screening of damaged environment on aquatic organisms the findings may be useful in other similar basins in summary our findings in the dam dominated basin were concluded as follows 1 lu and urbanization had a significant seasonal impact on wq with higher impact in winter than that in summer and the seasonal variation of the impact was weakened as the disturbance of lu and urbanization increased 2 the impact of lu and urbanization on we had no significant seasonal variation in the srb 3 lu and urbanization had a greater impact on we compared to wq in the srb 4 wq had a more significant dispersion than we in the basin and the dispersion

5602,this study explored the sensitivity of ecologically relevant flows to individual and combined impacts of climate and land use cover lulc change as well as to their synergistic impacts combined effect minus sum of individual effects in a rapidly urbanizing watershed in alabama usa the soil and water assessment tool swat was first calibrated 1988 1993 and validated 2008 2013 at daily time scale for streamflow then bias corrected and downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate data from 2035 to 2060 with eleven climate models under two different representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 were fed into swat to quantify the effects of future climate watershed lulc change was represented in swat via a future projected dataset developed by the united states geological survey usgs past present and future potential streamflow responses to lulc and climate changes were analyzed for various ecologically relevant flow parameters a total of 38 key flow parameters known to have significant impacts on aquatic flora and fauna were examined including high low and median flows as well as flashiness increased summer temperature and decreased fall precipitation are expected in the study region accompanied by rapid urbanization climate change is expected to increase maximum monthly streamflows especially in june september potentially altering habitat availability for aquatic organisms when climate change was combined with lulc change more frequent drought and flood events are expected which may negatively affect many fish species significant shifts in the timing of annual extreme streamflow conditions were also predicted in the future which may adversely impact the life cycle of various aquatic species keywords climate change land use cover change swat cmip5 ecologically relevant flow flow alteration 1 introduction understanding the impacts of climate and land use cover lulc change on hydrologic processes is crucial for sustainability of limited water resources mostly due to anthropogenic activities dramatic changes have taken place in climate and land use patterns at a global scale oreskes 2004 rosenzweig et al 2008 diffenbaugh et al 2015 the effects of such changes on ecosystems and the associated social and economic development have gained considerable attention vorosmarty et al 2000 yang et al 2008 li et al 2009 ma et al 2009 impacts on hydrological processes such as infiltration recharge of groundwater runoff generation etc may substantially affect corresponding environmental conditions within different ecosystems while the timing and magnitude of peak flows may be altered by varying climate conditions prowse 2006 changes in lulc can also alter flood frequency brath et al 2006 baseflow wang et al 2006 and average annual discharge costa et al 2003 therefore a comprehensive environmental assessment at the watershed scale is crucial for understanding the impacts of climate and lulc change on streamflow regimes especially ecologically relevant flows increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and global warming are likely responsible for changes observed in global climatic patterns ipcc 2007 xu et al 2011 reductions in water availability are expected to be a significant consequence of climate change ipcc 2007 kingston and taylor 2010 apart from climate change human activities also play important roles in hydrology and the availability of water resources the impacts of urbanization on watershed hydrology have been known since the late 1960s leopold 1968 human induced land use change can affect the hydrologic cycle and the spatio temporal distribution of water resources freshwater systems are under increasing stress due to population growth urbanizing landscapes and an increase in water demand for domestic industrial and agricultural uses multiple studies have identified the combined impacts of lulc and climate change on water quantity li et al 2010 sample et al 2012 kim et al 2013 most studies utilize a calibrated hydrologic model with future climate predictions and lulc projections for this purpose for instance pervez and henebry 2015 used the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 to determine the sensitivity of freshwater availability to projected lulc and climate changes in the brahmaputra basin in south asia they found that streamflow and groundwater recharge were sensitive to changes in precipitation while average annual et was sensitive to changes in co2 concentration and temperature they also predicted strong increasing trends in groundwater recharge and streamflow an increased likelihood of flooding during august october and decreased occurrence of severe droughts during may july periods using the swat model in a coastal watershed in alabama usa wang et al 2014 found lulc change caused higher surface runoff but did not have a significant effect on monthly mean streamflow however they predicted that the combined impacts of lulc and climate change may lead to dramatic increases in monthly average streamflows especially during the fall season using the arcview generalized watershed loading function avgwlf model evans et al 2001 chang 2003 investigated the combined impacts of urbanization and future climate change on the conestoga river streamflow in pennsylvania usa compared to climate change effects mean annual flow at the basin outlet was not sensitive to urbanization however greater impacts were estimated in subbasins with higher impervious surfaces montenegro and ragab 2010 employed the dicasm model ragab and bromley 2010 to study lulc and climate change effects on regional hydrology in northeast brazil they forecasted a 34 77 reduction in both groundwater recharge and streamflow under a future climate change scenario replacing caatinga type of shrub growing in deserts with castor bean was predicted to increase groundwater recharge and streamflow which could mitigate the negative effects of climate change mango et al 2011 and guo et al 2008 using the swat model showed that deforestation urbanization and climate change strongly influenced seasonal variations in streamflow they found that lulc and climate change could reduce dry season flows and intensify peak flows while increasing temperature and precipitation may have relatively more predictable effects on the water balance components and discharge as mentioned the primary focus in most of these studies was on the effects of lulc and climate change on basic hydrologic characteristics such as mean annual monthly flows high low flows baseflow surface runoff partitioning etc however the ecological implications of hydrologic alterations due to climate and lulc change have not received as much attention cui et al 2009 piao et al 2007 tomer and schilling 2009 wang and kalin 2017 most analyses of climate impacts on river ecosystems focus on the effects of temperature change fischlin et al 2007 and few studies explored impacts of changes in average precipitation lasalle and rochard 2009 dyer et al 2013 used ecologically relevant flow parameters to determine the effects of climate change and regulation on rivers in the upper murrumbidgee river catchment australia results showed that many ecologically relevant flow characteristics were sensitive to 1 to 2 c rise in temperature but not to flow regulation in studying reservoir regulations in the east river basin china zhang et al 2015 suggested that water storage in reservoirs may enhance the magnitude and frequency of low flows but decrease the magnitude and frequency of high flows the significance of flow regimes for river ecosystems has been well documented richter et al 2003 according to dudgeon et al 2006 aquatic biodiversity in rivers is affected by excessive low flow events that restrict overall habitat availability and quality while high flow events can affect river channel morphology and allow access to disconnected floodplain habitats many characteristics of the flow regime especially seasonality interannual variability and timing of specific flow events may influence life history patterns of many species such as recruiting and spawning dudgeon et al 2006 although literature is replete with studies exploring the individual and combined impacts of lulc and climate change on basic streamflow characteristics the effects on ecologically relevant flow characteristics are less studied which may serve to complement environmental assessment studies such as the conservation effects assessment project ceap in the usa usda nrcs 2011 johnson et al 2015 yen et al 2016 the primary goal of this study is to demonstrate the sensitivity of various ecologically relevant flow parameters to climate and lulc change in addition to the individual impacts of lulc and climate change the combined and synergistic effects combined effect minus sum of individual effects of these changes were also evaluated this study was conducted in an urbanizing watershed known for its aquatic diversity the upper cahaba river watershed in alabama usa the two specific objectives of this study were to i explore how the hydrologic regime of the upper cahaba river responds to climate and lulc mainly urbanization changes and ii examine how changes in flow in the upper cahaba river system will affect or have affected ecologically relevant flow parameters a calibrated swat model was utilized to generate daily streamflow time series corresponding to past current and future climate and lulc conditions scenarios the generated streamflow time series were fed into the indicators of hydrologic alterations software iha to assess the alterations in various ecologically relevant flow parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the cahaba river is the third largest and the longest tributary of the alabama river which drains into the mobile bay it is also the longest free flowing river in the state of alabama with a watershed area of 4727 km2 the headwaters of cahaba river are within the alabama ridge and valley physiographic zone and eventually flow southwest within the east gulf coastal plain this is the only point within the 48 contiguous states where the geological landscape changes suddenly from mountainous regions directly to a coastal plain this accounts for the unique landscape and aesthetic beauty in the watershed as well as its well known biodiversity adem upper cahaba river watershed tmdl 2013 elevations within the watershed range from nearly 440 m above sea level to 30 m at the confluence with the alabama river the cahaba river watershed has more fish species 131 than any river its size in north america and it supports 69 rare and imperiled species master et al 1998 making it one of the most diverse aquatic ecosystems in the united states amongst them the most well known is the cahaba lily hymenocallis coronaria once abundant in the southeast cahaba lilies have been wiped out from many areas due to flow fluctuations and can only be found now in certain regions davenport 1996 bibb county al not only shelters the largest known stand of cahaba lillies it is also home to a unique terrestrial plant community the bibb county glades master et al 1998 in 1992 botanist jim allison counted eight new species of plants on limestone outcrops along the cahaba s banks master et al 1998 the endangered cahaba shiner notropis cahabae first described in 1989 is endemic to cahaba river and is confined to the main stem only the cahaba river and its tributaries also have many fresh water mussel and snail species including pearly mussels like the critically imperiled orangenacre mucket lampsilis perovalis however their numbers have sharply declined from historical numbers master et al 1998 although threats in the upper cahaba river watershed are growing the lower half of the watershed is somewhat healthier the primary focus of this study is the upper portion of the watershed fig 1 which since the 1990 s has been rapidly urbanizing adem upper cahaba river watershed tmdl 2013 the 1 416 km2 watershed drains a large part of the city of birmingham al according to the united states census bureau http www census gov population of the city has decreased from 260 602 1992 to 211 985 2011 however due to expansion of the metropolitan area urban cover within the watershed has increased from 9 4 1992 national land cover dataset nlcd homer et al 2012 to 35 7 2011 nlcd table 1 based on the usgs eros projected future land cover data http landcover modeling cr usgs gov projects php accessed on 8 20 2015 urban cover is expected to increase by another 12 2 over the next 35 years table 1 the average soil texture in the watershed is 67 sand 18 clay and 15 silt table 2 the climate is mainly humid with a mean annual rainfall of 143 cm mean rainfall is typically higher during spring and winter and slightly lower in summer and fall mean annual minimum and maximum temperatures range from 10 4 c to 23 4 c respectively national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 1950 2014 there are 15 usgs streamflow gauges within the watershed and 6 weather stations inside and around the watershed fig 1 streamflow data from usgs site 02423500 fig 1 were used for swat calibration and validation 2 2 watershed model swat is a process based continuous time watershed scale model used in simulating water quality and quantity it has been developed for predicting impacts of land use land management practices and climate change on water sediment and chemical yields in heterogeneous watersheds with varying lulc soils and management conditions arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 swat is typically run at a daily time step and is capable of continuous simulations over long periods of time arnold et al 2015 it can simulate surface runoff infiltration percolation evapotranspiration et subsurface stormflow deep and shallow aquifer flow and channel flow arnold et al 1998 arcswat winchell et al 2013 which runs on arcgis was used for preparing and processing swat inputs and outputs respectively a swat literature database https www card iastate edu swat articles accessed on 8 9 2019 lists 273 and 403 peer reviewed journal articles under the categories land use change and climate change respectively swat models the effects of lulc through many processes including rainfall interception et penman monteith has land cover related parameters plant growth leaf area index affects et runoff generation and infiltration cn is function of lulc in the scs cn method and overland flow routing through manning s roughness arcswat has built in databases for model parameterization as a function of lulc urban land cover in swat is partitioned into impervious and pervious areas there are 9 urban categories in swat low low medium medium and high density residential commercial industrial transportation institutional and residential swat assigns different imperviousness percentages to them as well as fraction of impervious areas that are hydraulically connected a weighted cn is calculated accordingly 2 3 model setup and input data the input data used in parameterizing the swat model and the input forcings are summarized in table 3 the watershed was subdivided into 45 subbasins in arcswat using a threshold area of 600 ha the 1992 and 2011 national land cover database nlcd publicly available at 30 meter resolution was used in this study the 250 meter usgs eros projected future land cover map for special report on emission scenario sres a1b was used for the future scenarios sohl et al 2014 the a1b scenario a scenario in a1 family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth global population that peaks in mid century and declines thereafter and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies ipcc 2007 sohl et al 2014 reported considerable challenges in downscaling land use assumptions of the global scale ipcc sres to the scale of their assessment they had to use a suite of data sources and assumptions in producing future lulc projections details of how this dataset was generated can be found in sohl et al 2014 note that the ipcc 5th assessment adapted the representative concentration pathways rcp which superseded sres used in the ipcc 4th assessment a key difference between the two is that rcps ignore the carbon cycle by focusing on concentrations of greenhouse gases not greenhouse gas inputs therefore direct comparison between sres and rcp is not plausible to further characterize the subbasins for dominant soil types and lulc they were divided into 557 540 and 604 hydrologic response units hrus for the 1992 nlcd the 2011 nlcd and the 2045 usgs eros lulc datasets respectively these hrus were defined using the threshold values of 8 8 and 10 for the dominant land use soil and slope of individual subbasin areas respectively 2 3 1 climate data swat requires daily precipitation maximum minimum max min air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity as climatic variables all of which except rainfall are used to calculate potential et by the penman monteith method monteith 1965 daily precipitation and max min air temperature data were downloaded from the highest quality spatial climate gridded dataset 4 km cell size of prism prism climate group oregon state university http prism oregonstate edu accessed on 8 20 2015 other input data solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr databases http rda ucar edu accessed on 8 21 2015 for the future period i e 2035 2060 downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate projections were used for daily precipitation and max min air temperature data downloaded and accessed on 8 25 2015 from http gdo dcp ucllnl org downscaled cmip projections dcpinterface html data from 11 climate models with 2 emission scenarios representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 and 8 5 were collected 22 ensembles total representative concentration pathways represent pathways of radiative forcing rcp 2 6 low emissions and 8 5 high emissions lead to a radiative forcing of 2 6 and 8 5 w m2 by 2100 respectively rcp8 5 represents the 90th percentile of the reference emissions range while rcp2 6 represents pathways below the 10th percentile of mitigation scenarios moss et al 2010 table a1 represents the cmip5 global climate models gcms used in this study comparison of simulated historic gcm outputs of precipitation and max min air temperature to observed data often reveals bias in gcm outputs hence gcm outputs are typically adjusted to remove any bias maraun 2012 cannon et al 2015 we used the quantile mapping technique wood et al 2004 in this study for bias correction to that end the following three various datasets were downloaded prepared 1 observed historical data for precipitation and min max air temperatures from a noaa land based climatic station at birmingham airport al us id usw00013876 from 1950 to 1999 this was the nearest climatic station with long term historical data 2 gcm simulated historical conditions which comes under the name 1 8 observed data 1950 1999 and 3 gcm simulated future projections 2035 2060 the period 1950 1999 is commonly used for bias identification of cmip5 projections reclamation 2013 the identified bias in dataset 2 based on dataset 1 was used to guide bias correction of dataset 3 for a given variable and in a given month all the daily observations over the 50 year period were lumped into one pool and a cumulative distribution function cdf was created for that month the same procedure was carried out for all historical values generated by gcms dataset 2 hence we created paired cdfs which were combined to construct a quantile map where at each rank probability the bias between dataset 1 and 2 can be discerned for each month a 3rd order polynomial function was fit to the plot of historical gcm data versus the biases these functions were then used to estimate and remove the bias in future gcm outputs dataset 3 this approach assumes that the structure of the bias for the future gcm outputs is the same as that for their historical ones note that this method requires removal of any trends before bias corrections and then reimposing them afterward which was the case for daily min max air temperature wood et al 2004 swat calculates actual et from potential et pet in this study the penman monteith method was selected to estimate pet for the future period climatic variables of solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were individually generated by the stochastic weather generator wxgen in swat sharpley and williams 1990 this stochastic weather generator is widely used for climate change studies ficklin et al 2009 min and shibata 2015 cousino et al 2015 we used the historical statistics obtained from ncep and nfsr data to run wxgen therefore stationarity was assumed in solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed 2 4 calibration validation and evaluation of model performance hydrological models usually have at least some parameters that cannot be determined directly from field measurements therefore identification of the most sensitive parameters can enhance the efficiency of the calibration process in this study the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation were conducted using the swat calibration and uncertainty program abbaspour et al 2007 swat cup where the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2007 was adopted with a total of 16 swat parameters table a2 in sufi 2 parameter uncertainty accounts for all sources of uncertainties such as uncertainty in model structure parameters input forcing e g precipitation and measured data e g observed flow abbaspour et al 2007 the calibrated model parameters were selected based on literature review preliminary sensitivity analysis study area conditions and their known role on hydrologic processes luo et al 2008 statistical measures such as the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr and modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mns are commonly used to evaluate model performance moriasi et al 2007 eckhardt and arnold 2001 krause et al 2005 due to the insensitivity of nse to low flows krause et al 2005 both nse and mns were considered for model performance evaluation since one of the objectives of this study is to estimate changes in flow for the entire range of flow conditions it is necessary to include a statistical measure covering low flow conditions detailed information about statistical measures can be found in supplemental materials the strategy during the calibration process was to have high model performance and most of the measured data fall within the 95 prediction uncertainty band mean daily streamflow data from the usgs station 02423500 fig 1 were used to calibrate and validate swat the period 1 1 1988 12 31 1993 was used for calibration and 1 1 2008 12 31 2013 was used for validation both calibration and validation periods were preceded with a 3 year spin up period the 1992 and 2011 nlcds were used as the lulc data sources during model calibration and validation respectively 2 5 ecologically relevant flow parameters rivers are a primary source of water for agriculture municipalities and industrial purposes in addition river flow regimes are crucial parts of the ecological integrity of river systems poff et al 1997 hart and finelli 1999 changes in streamflow regimes are well recognized by ecologists as the primary driver of many major ecological processes in riverine ecosystem function and structure poff et al 1997 therefore understanding the effects of climate and lulc changes on ecologically relevant hydrologic characteristics is needed for holistic management of watersheds the nature conservancy tnc 2009 has developed the indicators of hydrologic alterations iha software based on richter et al 1996 that calculates 67 statistical parameters from daily flow time series to compare and assess natural discharge characteristics flow regime and environmental flow components these parameters are subdivided into two general categories 1 iha and 2 environmental flow component efc there are 33 iha and 34 efc parameters in this study a subset of 38 26 iha and 12 efc of these 67 parameters were selected to characterize the ecologically relevant flow regime changes in the upper cahaba river watershed the parameters were selected based on their ecological relevance and their use in published ecological studies the 38 key indices can be divided into five groups 1 magnitude of monthly discharge 12 parameters 2 magnitude of annual extreme streamflow under various durations 10 parameters 3 timing of annual extreme discharge 2 parameters 4 rate and frequency of discharge changes 2 parameters and 5 efc monthly low flows 12 parameters the list of groups the hydrologic parameters and their ecosystem influences are provided in table 4 the nature conservancy 2009 swat generated daily streamflow time series were fed into the iha software to calculate each of these parameters 2 6 model experiment setup beyond the baseline period three experiments were set up to assess the individual and combined impacts of lulc change and climate variability on hydrological processes two 25 year time periods baseline period 1988 2013 and future period 2035 2060 were selected the simulated streamflow for the baseline period under each scenario was compared to the corresponding values for the future period to assess climate change impacts on discharge future lulc was assumed to be the same as the baseline period lulc 2011 nlcd eleven gcm outputs under two representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 and 8 5 table a1 for the future period were applied to 2011 lulc to analyze lulc change effects on streamflow the climate in the future period was assumed to be the same as that in the baseline period 1988 2013 the model was simulated under projected future lulc 2045 a1b with historical climate data 1988 2013 to evaluate the combined impacts of lulc and climate change swat simulations were performed using the projected lulc 2045 a1b with eleven gcm outputs 2035 2060 under two representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 and 8 5 table 5 the swat generated daily flow time series from these scenarios were fed into the iha software package to assess the changes in ecologically relevant flow parameters from the 46 swat model outputs table 5 the following is the summary of the experiments conducted 1 baseline period the calibrated and validated model parameters see section 2 4 were used to run swat with the 2011 nlcd and historical climate data 1988 2013 2 only climate change the lulc map for the year 2011 and bias corrected downscaled eleven future climate model under two different rcps 11 rcp 2 6 and 11 rcp8 5 scenarios were considered 1 lulc map 22 climate model 22 scenarios and 3 only lulc change projected 2045 a1b lulc map with historical climate data 1988 2013 were considered 1 lulc map 1 climate data 1 scenario and 4 combined impact of lulc and climate change projected 2045 a1b lulc map with eleven future climate model under two rcps 11 rcp 2 6 and 11 rcp 8 5 scenarios were considered 1 lulc map 22 climate model 22 scenarios 5 synergistic impact the combined effect resulting from the interaction of lulc and climate most likely is not a simple sum of each individual effect in other words there could be a strong synergistic effect when both lulc and climate changes are considered a good example to synergistic effect is the drug synergism which is defined by the us national institute of health nih as an interaction between two or more drugs that causes the total effect of the drugs to be greater than the sum of the individual effects of each drug a synergistic effect can be beneficial or harmful understanding the possible synergism between lulc and climate change on their effect on ecological relevant flow parameters can help in better management of resources the synergistic impact of lulc and climate on changes on parameter x can be calculated as follows δ x synergistic δ x combined δ x climate δ x lulc 3 results and discussions 3 1 changes in precipitation and temperature fig 2 shows the trends in observed annual mean daily streamflow annual precipitation and annual mean daily average temperature during the baseline period 1988 2013 all three exhibit positive trends however only temperature has a statistically significant slope p 0 012 although increase in precipitation will lead to increase in streamflow higher temperatures can reduce this effect through increased et note that anything that is non impervious in the metro birmingham area is most likely vegetated mostly trees meanwhile the city of birmingham gets most of its water from the cahaba river the shades mountain water treatment plant as of year 2015 treats an average of 2 4 m3 s and nearly 3 5 m3 s in the summer there are also point sources discharging to the cahaba river such as wastewater treatment plants unfortunately we did not have data showing how much water is actually withdrawn from or released back to the cahaba river over the years clearly there is a big uncertainty with these data and it is extremely hard to attribute sources of trends in real data fig 3 demonstrates the projected changes in seasonal and annual temperature δ c and precipitation in the future 2035 2060 with respect to the baseline period 1988 2013 at the upper cahaba river watershed the blue and red crosses in each panel correspond to 11 gcm results under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios respectively both variables are expected to increase in spring summer and winter under both rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios ensemble mean from the 22 climate models average annual temperatures are estimated to increase by 1 9 c 0 7 to 2 8 c rcp 2 6 emission scenarios and 3 3 c 1 8 to 4 5 c rcp 8 5 emission scenarios by the 2050 s relative to the baseline period 1988 2013 annual average precipitation is projected to increase ensemble mean from 22 climate models between 1 9 2 7 6 9 rcp 2 6 and 2 3 1 5 3 7 rcp 8 5 by the 2050 s all the models predicted rising trends in temperature for all seasons for winter and spring the range was from 0 7 to 3 7 c on the contrary the range in summer and fall was from 0 6 to 6 9 c for seasonal changes in precipitation there was no clear trend of increase or decrease for example 5 of the 22 climate projections showed a decrease in precipitation spring with an average of 3 4 while the other 17 climate projections showed an increase of about 5 7 moreover 16 of the 22 climate projections showed a decreasing trend in precipitation for fall season by approximately 4 4 in general the upper cahaba river watershed will more likely experience increased temperature especially in summer and fall precipitation was also expected to increase in spring summer and winter therefore the upper cahaba river watershed could experience moderate to significant changes in climate by 2050s especially under rcp 8 5 scenarios 3 2 changes in lulc historical and future lulc maps for each scenario are shown in fig 1 according to 2011 nlcd more than 50 of the area was covered by forest while urban and agriculture land accounted for 35 and 10 of the whole area table 1 compared to the baseline lulc map 2011 there was a trend of urban sprawl in the future based on the projected future lulc map 2045 usgs eros a1b the percentage of urban cover within the watershed will increase from 35 to 47 in 30 years growth of urban area coincided with a reduction of other lulc types water forest agriculture and wetland for instance forest cover was predicted to be 5 smaller in 2045 45 4 than in 2011 50 3 similar trends were projected in areas covered with water agriculture and wetland table 1 3 3 results of model calibration and validation sensitivity analysis with swat cup revealed cn2 initial curve number for moisture condition ii as the most sensitive parameter for the upper cahaba river watershed at daily time step the maximum canopy storage canmx was ranked 2nd saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k and ground water delay gw delay were also found to be highly sensitive rankings of the sensitivity of the other parameters can be found in table a2 observed and simulated mean monthly streamflows and daily flow duration curves fdc based on the lulc maps for the calibration 1992 lulc and validation 2011 lulc periods are shown in fig 4 values of the statistical measures for the model performance at daily time scale are shown in table a3 during the calibration period the nse and pbias values were 0 71 and 6 5 respectively according to the criteria developed by moriasi et al 2007 for monthly simulations this is a good very good performance model performance during the validation period was similar with nse and pbias values of 0 65 and 9 3 the calibrated swat model was used to explore the impacts of various climate lulc scenarios in the following sections 3 4 impacts of climate change on iha parameters simulated streamflows obtained by running swat with each of the 22 climate predictions 11 rcp 2 6 and 11 rcp 8 5 were compared to the corresponding streamflows from the baseline period the projected annual average daily streamflow for the future period was 8 97 and 8 79 m3 s under the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios respectively compared to the average daily streamflow in the baseline period 8 04 m3 s annual average streamflow will increase by 11 rcp2 6 and 9 rcp 8 5 in the future the differences of the mean values for each iha parameters table 4 between the two rcp scenarios are discussed in the following sections 3 4 1 group 1 on average the magnitudes of mean monthly flows under future climate scenarios were higher than the baseline period particularly from may to september fig 5 shows the relative changes in monthly streamflows as box and whisker plots for each scenario relative to the baseline period 1988 2013 the sensitivity of monthly streamflow to climate change differed between the emission scenarios the relative changes in monthly streamflow in june and july had greater uncertainty than those in other months the changes in monthly median streamflow for the future rcp 2 6 and 8 5 climate change scenarios were predicted to decrease in october 13 and november 11 for rcp 2 6 and april 9 and may 5 for rcp 8 5 this finding indicated a significant decrease in flow during fall under the rcp 2 6 scenario on the contrary significant increases were estimated in may september and june september periods under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios although some variations occurred among the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 results the general pattern indicated increases in june september flow particularly in july the increase in streamflow under the climate change scenario was expected for the entire flow range with monthly median flow expected to increase by 55 under rcp 2 6 and 74 under rcp 8 5 these changes in streamflow were mainly driven by changes in precipitation 3 4 2 group 2 magnitudes of extreme min max annual water conditions of various durations ranging from daily 1 3 7 days to seasonal 30 90 days were assessed by the 10 parameters in this group as shown in fig 6 substantial variations were found in the 1 to 90 day average annual minimum maximum flows under future climate scenarios results of rcp 2 6 scenarios indicated that 1 3 7 day mean annual minima were expected to increase about 7 and the 30 90 day mean annual minima were expected to increase about 30 and 42 respectively moreover the 1 3 7 30 and 90 day mean annual maxima were expected to increase about 69 49 43 34 and 15 respectively rcp 8 5 results had similar patterns except for 1 3 and 7 day minima which were expected to decrease by about 8 3 4 3 group 3 the two parameters in group 3 are critical for the seasonal features of the hydrological conditions they measure the julian date of the annual 1 day maximum and minimum water conditions for example reproduction which is a key life cycle phase maybe linked to the timing of annual flow extremes changes in the timing of these events may cause reproductive stress or failure the timing of the annual extreme flows for rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 were similar to the baseline period as shown in fig 7 the julian date of annual 1 day maximum flow was predicted to be 9 days later for rcp 2 6 and 7 days later for rcp 8 5 compared to the baseline period whereas the julian dates of 1 day minimums are predicted to be 10 days and 6 days earlier for rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 respectively 3 4 4 group 4 the two parameters in this group measure the mean rate and number for both negative and positive changes in water conditions as shown in fig 8 streamflow was expected to rise and fall at much faster rates under future climate conditions for instance the change in median of the rise rate for both rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios were 14 and 9 respectively similarly the change in median of the fall rate for both rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios were about 15 respectively 3 4 5 group 5 impacts of 22 climate change scenarios on monthly low flows are shown in fig 9 under rcp 8 5 scenario monthly low flows were predicted to decrease more often than increase the monthly median low flows were predicted to increase in july 18 august 13 september 22 and october 9 and decrease in other months about 2 14 on the contrary the monthly low flows were predicted to increase between may and october under the rcp 2 6 emission scenario by 5 to 19 this group is very important for aquatic plants for example if the monthly low flows were extremely low during the growing season the water temperature and water chemistry would probably be affected significantly and lead to more frequent plant stress 3 5 impacts of lulc change on iha parameters 3 5 1 group 1 lulc change impacts on the hydrologic regime of the upper cahaba river watershed were analyzed by using 2045 usgs eros a1b lulc map with historical climate data 1988 2013 an increasing trend was found in mean annual streamflow under future lulc conditions compared to the results obtained with 2011 lulc the projected future mean annual flow increased from 8 04 m3 s to 8 75 m3 s with 2045 lulc this can be explained by the projected development and urban growth in the watershed monthly mean streamflows simulated by swat under future lulc are shown in fig 10 monthly streamflows would decrease from april to july about 5 but increase in other months about 17 based on this projected future lulc the largest percent increase and decrease were expected in october at 27 and in june at 8 respectively thus lulc change had a relatively smaller impact on streamflow compared to climate change scenarios 3 5 2 group 2 the annual minimum and maximum daily averages are presented in fig 11 due to projected increase in urbanization considerable changes were expected in daily minimum flows the 1 3 7 and 30 day minimum daily flows decreased approximately 60 under the 2045 lulc scenario on the other hand approximately 21 increase was predicted for extreme high flows compared to the climate change only impacts magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions appeared to be more sensitive to lulc changes than to the projected changes in climate 3 5 3 group 3 and 4 as shown in fig 7 julian dates of annual 1 day maximum and minimum varied substantially under lulc changes in particular annual 1 day minimum flow was expect to happen 28 days earlier compared to the baseline period whereas 1 day maximum was expected to happen 23 days later fig 7 the mean values of fall and rise rates were predicted to increase about 45 and 35 respectively fig 8 and both were higher than the values obtained for climate change 3 5 4 group 5 the impact of only lulc change on monthly low flows can be seen in fig 12 results indicate that monthly low flows decreased in all months due to urbanization and the ranges of change were between 24 in february to 54 in june it is clear from fig 12 that urbanization is the primary driving force of low streamflow conditions 3 6 combined impacts of lulc and climate change on iha parameters in addition to the assessment of the individual impacts of lulc and climate change the combined and synergistic effects of these changes on the ecologically relevant flow parameters were also evaluated the following sections describe the changes in each iha group 3 6 1 group 1 changes in monthly hydrological conditions for the period of january through december are presented in fig 5 average streamflow noticeably increased from july to september by approximately 63 under rcp 2 6 and 42 under rcp 8 5 the ranges of changes from october to may were 1 to 16 for rcp 2 6 and 32 to 3 for rcp 8 5 fig 5 the mean streamflow only decreased in april and may under rcp 8 5 decrease in streamflow ranged from 32 to 17 under rcp 8 5 it is also worth noting that the ranges of relative changes in monthly streamflow for the future periods were substantially larger in june and july than in other months these results indicate that aquatic ecosystem habitat would be affected in the future especially in summer streamflow in the upper cahaba river watershed appeared to be more sensitive to future climate change than to lulc change 3 6 2 group 2 the magnitudes and durations of annual extreme water conditions under future lulc and climate change are presented in fig 6 important variations were found in the annual minimum maximum flows under future rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios the magnitudes of annual minimum flows decreased in rcp 2 6 ranging from 56 to 21 the magnitudes of annual maximum and 90 day minimum flows increased under future conditions ranging from 26 to 55 on the contrary the annual minimums significantly decreased in rcp 8 5 ranging from 87 to 65 similar to rcp 2 6 annual maximum and 90 day minimum flows showed an increasing trend in rcp 8 5 ranging from 7 to 69 fig 6 3 6 3 group 3 as shown in fig 7 julian dates of annual 1 day maximum and minimum changed substantially in both rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios in particular annual 1 day minimum flow was expected to happen 51 rcp2 6 and 40 rcp8 5 days earlier compared to the baseline period whereas 1 day maximum flow was expected to be delayed 34 rcp 2 6 and 48 rcp 8 5 days when compared to the baseline period 3 6 4 group 4 the rise and fall rates were expected to be much higher under combined impacts of future lulc and climate conditions fig 8 for instance median of the percent change of the rise rate for rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios were 24 and 33 respectively similarly median percent change of fall rate for rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios were respectively 49 and 45 3 6 5 group 5 combined impacts of lulc change and 22 climate change scenarios on monthly low flows are shown in fig 9 monthly low flows were predicted to decrease in all months under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios ranging from 3 to 61 most dramatic decrease was expected in march june period 3 7 synergistic impacts of lulc and climate change on iha parameters as shown in fig 10 the synergistic impact on change in mean monthly flow is very strong from may through august in rcp 2 6 scenario when both changes happen the magnitudes of percent increase in monthly flows were magnified in those months due to synergistic effects interestingly synergistic effects were less pronounced in summer months in rcp 8 5 scenario further during months where synergistic effects were more noticeable it has an opposite direction i e the impact of both changes occurring simultaneously was less than the sum of individual impacts in addition to monthly flows substantial synergistic impacts were also detected on the magnitude and duration of annual extreme flow conditions and monthly low flows fig 11 demonstrates the relative importance of lulc and climate impact on the magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions synergistic impacts of lulc and climate change were strong for 1 3 and 90 day minimum flows and 1 3 and 7 day maximum flows under rcp 2 6 scenarios similarly strong synergistic effects were seen for all minimum and maximum flows under the rcp 8 5 scenario in this emission scenario the synergistic effect was highest in 30 day flow which showed no interaction effect with rcp 2 6 the results for rcp 8 5 maximum flows are similar to rcp 2 6 results for efc monthly low flows fig 12 lulc was the leading driver while climate change slightly impacted monthly low flows important synergistic impacts were detected in all months under rcp 2 6 15 20 discernable synergistic impacts were only observed during the fall september december under the rcp 8 5 scenario fig 12 the synergistic effect had an increasing trend from april to december the potential implications of having significant synergistic effects can be illustrated by taking average july streamflow as an example lulc change was expected to cause a small reduction 4 in average july streamflow and climate change was predicted to increase it around 55 when they act together the expected increase in average july streamflow was around 85 which is much greater than the sum of individual effects therefore even if by itself lulc change was not expected to have an impact on average july streamflow if one wants to limit the increase in average july flow due to climate change controlling lulc impacts can help such as by implementing low impact design practices or green infrastructures 4 summary and conclusions in this study individual and combined impacts of lulc and climate change on ecologically relevant flow parameters were explored for the upper cahaba river watershed which is known for its aquatic diversity but is under stress due to urbanization a total of 46 experiments was set up and daily streamflow under each experiment were simulated by a calibrated and validated swat model daily streamflow estimates from each experiment were fed into the iha software to analyze the hydrological responses under changing lulc and climate and more importantly the sensitivity of ecologically relevant flow parameters to these changes the study results revealed that lulc and climate change will have substantial impacts on ecologically relevant flows of the upper cahaba river watershed for example climate change was expected to increase maximum monthly streamflow especially in june september period this increase was mainly driven by the change in the precipitation patterns increased summer maximum flow may change habitat availability for aquatic organisms for example cahaba lilies which is an endangered species in alabama requiring shallow water to flourish results suggest that 1 3 7 and 30 day maximum flows will be significantly affected by future climate conditions on the other hand future lulc will cause considerable decreases in 1 3 7 and 30 day minimum flows and increases in the rise and fall rates of streamflow the combined effects of changing lulc and climate caused decreased low flow and increased high flow indicating a potential for more frequent hydrological drought and flood events decreased flow volume for small events is considered detrimental for most fish species liu et al 2005 increased summer temperature and decreased flow will increase water temperatures and reduce dissolved oxygen causing possible hypoxia or anoxia more flashy flow on the other hand will increase soil erosion and degradation during sediment transport making streamflow muddy and reduce benthos and other aquatic habitats gascón et al 2007 another important impact of lulc change was the timing of annual extreme water conditions such as annual 1 day maximum and minimum water conditions the timing of 1 day maximum flow was predicted to shift by approximately 23 days towards the end of the year altered flow regime will affect the life history of aquatic species such as their access to special habitats for reproduction or avoiding predation liao 2007 lulc change did not have substantial impact on monthly mean streamflows however increasing trends were identified for the september january period therefore when lulc change was combined with climate change the amount of streamflow increased in all months except in april furthermore more dramatic decreasing trends in 1 3 7 and 30 day minimum flows monthly low flows and increasing trend for timing of 1 day maximum flow 48 days late were identified for combined lulc and climate change impacts especially under the rcp 8 5 scenario there were quite noticeable synergistic effects in ecologically relevant flows when changing climate and lulc were combined unlike climate change which is a global issue with more uncertainties local stake holders should put emphasis on alleviating lulc change effects on regional water resources such as making science based development plans or applying management alternatives to mitigate the negative impacts of lulc change from both hydrological and ecological aspects major findings of this study can be very useful for the future policy making processes by local engineers and other decision makers the methodology used in this study to assess lulc and climate change impacts on ecological relevant flows can be easily extended to other systems which might be quite different from the cahaba river watershed in physical properties climate conditions and geographic locations we acknowledge that the predicted percent changes in the ecologically relevant flow parameters might have been slightly different if we were to use another process based watershed model however the predicted trends such as the increase in streamflow rise fall rates or delay in timing of maximum flows etc should be similar to what we found declaration of competing interest the

scale for streamflow then bias corrected and downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate data from 2035 to 2060 with eleven climate models under two different representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 were fed into swat to quantify the effects of future climate watershed lulc change was represented in swat via a future projected dataset developed by the united states geological survey usgs past present and future potential streamflow responses to lulc and climate changes were analyzed for various ecologically relevant flow parameters a total of 38 key flow parameters known to have significant impacts on aquatic flora and fauna were examined including high low and median flows as well as flashiness increased summer temperature and decreased fall precipitation are expected in the study region accompanied by rapid urbanization climate change is expected to increase maximum monthly streamflows especially in june september potentially altering habitat availability for aquatic organisms when climate change was combined with lulc change more frequent drought and flood events are expected which may negatively affect many fish species significant shifts in the timing of annual extreme streamflow conditions were also predicted in the future which may adversely impact the life cycle of various aquatic species keywords climate change land use cover change swat cmip5 ecologically relevant flow flow alteration 1 introduction understanding the impacts of climate and land use cover lulc change on hydrologic processes is crucial for sustainability of limited water resources mostly due to anthropogenic activities dramatic changes have taken place in climate and land use patterns at a global scale oreskes 2004 rosenzweig et al 2008 diffenbaugh et al 2015 the effects of such changes on ecosystems and the associated social and economic development have gained considerable attention vorosmarty et al 2000 yang et al 2008 li et al 2009 ma et al 2009 impacts on hydrological processes such as infiltration recharge of groundwater runoff generation etc may substantially affect corresponding environmental conditions within different ecosystems while the timing and magnitude of peak flows may be altered by varying climate conditions prowse 2006 changes in lulc can also alter flood frequency brath et al 2006 baseflow wang et al 2006 and average annual discharge costa et al 2003 therefore a comprehensive environmental assessment at the watershed scale is crucial for understanding the impacts of climate and lulc change on streamflow regimes especially ecologically relevant flows increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and global warming are likely responsible for changes observed in global climatic patterns ipcc 2007 xu et al 2011 reductions in water availability are expected to be a significant consequence of climate change ipcc 2007 kingston and taylor 2010 apart from climate change human activities also play important roles in hydrology and the availability of water resources the impacts of urbanization on watershed hydrology have been known since the late 1960s leopold 1968 human induced land use change can affect the hydrologic cycle and the spatio temporal distribution of water resources freshwater systems are under increasing stress due to population growth urbanizing landscapes and an increase in water demand for domestic industrial and agricultural uses multiple studies have identified the combined impacts of lulc and climate change on water quantity li et al 2010 sample et al 2012 kim et al 2013 most studies utilize a calibrated hydrologic model with future climate predictions and lulc projections for this purpose for instance pervez and henebry 2015 used the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 to determine the sensitivity of freshwater availability to projected lulc and climate changes in the brahmaputra basin in south asia they found that streamflow and groundwater recharge were sensitive to changes in precipitation while average annual et was sensitive to changes in co2 concentration and temperature they also predicted strong increasing trends in groundwater recharge and streamflow an increased likelihood of flooding during august october and decreased occurrence of severe droughts during may july periods using the swat model in a coastal watershed in alabama usa wang et al 2014 found lulc change caused higher surface runoff but did not have a significant effect on monthly mean streamflow however they predicted that the combined impacts of lulc and climate change may lead to dramatic increases in monthly average streamflows especially during the fall season using the arcview generalized watershed loading function avgwlf model evans et al 2001 chang 2003 investigated the combined impacts of urbanization and future climate change on the conestoga river streamflow in pennsylvania usa compared to climate change effects mean annual flow at the basin outlet was not sensitive to urbanization however greater impacts were estimated in subbasins with higher impervious surfaces montenegro and ragab 2010 employed the dicasm model ragab and bromley 2010 to study lulc and climate change effects on regional hydrology in northeast brazil they forecasted a 34 77 reduction in both groundwater recharge and streamflow under a future climate change scenario replacing caatinga type of shrub growing in deserts with castor bean was predicted to increase groundwater recharge and streamflow which could mitigate the negative effects of climate change mango et al 2011 and guo et al 2008 using the swat model showed that deforestation urbanization and climate change strongly influenced seasonal variations in streamflow they found that lulc and climate change could reduce dry season flows and intensify peak flows while increasing temperature and precipitation may have relatively more predictable effects on the water balance components and discharge as mentioned the primary focus in most of these studies was on the effects of lulc and climate change on basic hydrologic characteristics such as mean annual monthly flows high low flows baseflow surface runoff partitioning etc however the ecological implications of hydrologic alterations due to climate and lulc change have not received as much attention cui et al 2009 piao et al 2007 tomer and schilling 2009 wang and kalin 2017 most analyses of climate impacts on river ecosystems focus on the effects of temperature change fischlin et al 2007 and few studies explored impacts of changes in average precipitation lasalle and rochard 2009 dyer et al 2013 used ecologically relevant flow parameters to determine the effects of climate change and regulation on rivers in the upper murrumbidgee river catchment australia results showed that many ecologically relevant flow characteristics were sensitive to 1 to 2 c rise in temperature but not to flow regulation in studying reservoir regulations in the east river basin china zhang et al 2015 suggested that water storage in reservoirs may enhance the magnitude and frequency of low flows but decrease the magnitude and frequency of high flows the significance of flow regimes for river ecosystems has been well documented richter et al 2003 according to dudgeon et al 2006 aquatic biodiversity in rivers is affected by excessive low flow events that restrict overall habitat availability and quality while high flow events can affect river channel morphology and allow access to disconnected floodplain habitats many characteristics of the flow regime especially seasonality interannual variability and timing of specific flow events may influence life history patterns of many species such as recruiting and spawning dudgeon et al 2006 although literature is replete with studies exploring the individual and combined impacts of lulc and climate change on basic streamflow characteristics the effects on ecologically relevant flow characteristics are less studied which may serve to complement environmental assessment studies such as the conservation effects assessment project ceap in the usa usda nrcs 2011 johnson et al 2015 yen et al 2016 the primary goal of this study is to demonstrate the sensitivity of various ecologically relevant flow parameters to climate and lulc change in addition to the individual impacts of lulc and climate change the combined and synergistic effects combined effect minus sum of individual effects of these changes were also evaluated this study was conducted in an urbanizing watershed known for its aquatic diversity the upper cahaba river watershed in alabama usa the two specific objectives of this study were to i explore how the hydrologic regime of the upper cahaba river responds to climate and lulc mainly urbanization changes and ii examine how changes in flow in the upper cahaba river system will affect or have affected ecologically relevant flow parameters a calibrated swat model was utilized to generate daily streamflow time series corresponding to past current and future climate and lulc conditions scenarios the generated streamflow time series were fed into the indicators of hydrologic alterations software iha to assess the alterations in various ecologically relevant flow parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the cahaba river is the third largest and the longest tributary of the alabama river which drains into the mobile bay it is also the longest free flowing river in the state of alabama with a watershed area of 4727 km2 the headwaters of cahaba river are within the alabama ridge and valley physiographic zone and eventually flow southwest within the east gulf coastal plain this is the only point within the 48 contiguous states where the geological landscape changes suddenly from mountainous regions directly to a coastal plain this accounts for the unique landscape and aesthetic beauty in the watershed as well as its well known biodiversity adem upper cahaba river watershed tmdl 2013 elevations within the watershed range from nearly 440 m above sea level to 30 m at the confluence with the alabama river the cahaba river watershed has more fish species 131 than any river its size in north america and it supports 69 rare and imperiled species master et al 1998 making it one of the most diverse aquatic ecosystems in the united states amongst them the most well known is the cahaba lily hymenocallis coronaria once abundant in the southeast cahaba lilies have been wiped out from many areas due to flow fluctuations and can only be found now in certain regions davenport 1996 bibb county al not only shelters the largest known stand of cahaba lillies it is also home to a unique terrestrial plant community the bibb county glades master et al 1998 in 1992 botanist jim allison counted eight new species of plants on limestone outcrops along the cahaba s banks master et al 1998 the endangered cahaba shiner notropis cahabae first described in 1989 is endemic to cahaba river and is confined to the main stem only the cahaba river and its tributaries also have many fresh water mussel and snail species including pearly mussels like the critically imperiled orangenacre mucket lampsilis perovalis however their numbers have sharply declined from historical numbers master et al 1998 although threats in the upper cahaba river watershed are growing the lower half of the watershed is somewhat healthier the primary focus of this study is the upper portion of the watershed fig 1 which since the 1990 s has been rapidly urbanizing adem upper cahaba river watershed tmdl 2013 the 1 416 km2 watershed drains a large part of the city of birmingham al according to the united states census bureau http www census gov population of the city has decreased from 260 602 1992 to 211 985 2011 however due to expansion of the metropolitan area urban cover within the watershed has increased from 9 4 1992 national land cover dataset nlcd homer et al 2012 to 35 7 2011 nlcd table 1 based on the usgs eros projected future land

watershed is 67 sand 18 clay and 15 silt table 2 the climate is mainly humid with a mean annual rainfall of 143 cm mean rainfall is typically higher during spring and winter and slightly lower in summer and fall mean annual minimum and maximum temperatures range from 10 4 c to 23 4 c respectively national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 1950 2014 there are 15 usgs streamflow gauges within the watershed and 6 weather stations inside and around the watershed fig 1 streamflow data from usgs site 02423500 fig 1 were used for swat calibration and validation 2 2 watershed model swat is a process based continuous time watershed scale model used in simulating water quality and quantity it has been developed for predicting impacts of land use land management practices and climate change on water sediment and chemical yields in heterogeneous watersheds with varying lulc soils and management conditions arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 swat is typically run at a daily time step and is capable of continuous simulations over long periods of time arnold et al 2015 it can simulate surface runoff infiltration percolation evapotranspiration et subsurface stormflow deep and shallow aquifer flow and channel flow arnold et al 1998 arcswat winchell et al 2013 which runs on arcgis was used for preparing and processing swat inputs and outputs respectively a swat literature database https www card iastate edu swat articles accessed on 8 9 2019 lists 273 and 403 peer reviewed journal articles under the categories land use change and climate change respectively swat models the effects of lulc through many processes including rainfall interception et penman monteith has land cover related parameters plant growth leaf area index affects et runoff generation and infiltration cn is function of lulc in the scs cn method and overland flow routing through manning s roughness arcswat has built in databases for model parameterization as a function of lulc urban land cover in swat is partitioned into impervious and pervious areas there are 9 urban categories in swat low low medium medium and high density residential commercial industrial transportation institutional and residential swat assigns different imperviousness percentages to them as well as fraction of impervious areas that are hydraulically connected a weighted cn is calculated accordingly 2 3 model setup and input data the input data used in parameterizing the swat model and the input forcings are summarized in table 3 the watershed was subdivided into 45 subbasins in arcswat using a threshold area of 600 ha the 1992 and 2011 national land cover database nlcd publicly available at 30 meter resolution was used in this study the 250 meter usgs eros projected future land cover map for special report on emission scenario sres a1b was used for the future scenarios sohl et al 2014 the a1b scenario a scenario in a1 family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth global population that peaks in mid century and declines thereafter and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies ipcc 2007 sohl et al 2014 reported considerable challenges in downscaling land use assumptions of the global scale ipcc sres to the scale of their assessment they had to use a suite of data sources and assumptions in producing future lulc projections details of how this dataset was generated can be found in sohl et al 2014 note that the ipcc 5th assessment adapted the representative concentration pathways rcp which superseded sres used in the ipcc 4th assessment a key difference between the two is that rcps ignore the carbon cycle by focusing on concentrations of greenhouse gases not greenhouse gas inputs therefore direct comparison between sres and rcp is not plausible to further characterize the subbasins for dominant soil types and lulc they were divided into 557 540 and 604 hydrologic response units hrus for the 1992 nlcd the 2011 nlcd and the 2045 usgs eros lulc datasets respectively these hrus were defined using the threshold values of 8 8 and 10 for the dominant land use soil and slope of individual subbasin areas respectively 2 3 1 climate data swat requires daily precipitation maximum minimum max min air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity as climatic variables all of which except rainfall are used to calculate potential et by the penman monteith method monteith 1965 daily precipitation and max min air temperature data were downloaded from the highest quality spatial climate gridded dataset 4 km

downscaled cmip projections dcpinterface html data from 11 climate models with 2 emission scenarios representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 and 8 5 were collected 22 ensembles total representative concentration pathways represent pathways of radiative forcing rcp 2 6 low emissions and 8 5 high emissions lead to a radiative forcing of 2 6 and 8 5 w m2 by 2100 respectively rcp8 5 represents the 90th percentile of the reference emissions range while rcp2 6 represents pathways below the 10th percentile of mitigation scenarios moss et al 2010 table a1 represents the cmip5 global climate models gcms used in this study comparison of simulated historic gcm outputs of precipitation and max min air temperature to observed data often reveals bias in gcm outputs hence gcm outputs are typically adjusted to remove any bias maraun 2012 cannon et al 2015 we used the quantile mapping technique wood et al 2004 in this study for bias correction to that end the following three various datasets were downloaded prepared 1 observed historical data for precipitation and min max air temperatures from a noaa land based climatic station at birmingham airport al us id usw00013876 from 1950 to 1999 this was the nearest climatic station with long term historical data 2 gcm simulated historical conditions which comes under the name 1 8 observed data 1950 1999 and 3 gcm simulated future projections 2035 2060 the period 1950 1999 is commonly used for bias identification of cmip5 projections reclamation 2013 the identified bias in dataset 2 based on dataset 1 was used to guide bias correction of dataset 3 for a given variable and in a given month all the daily observations over the 50 year period were lumped into one pool and a cumulative distribution function cdf was created for that month the same procedure was carried out for all historical values generated by gcms dataset 2 hence we created paired cdfs which were combined to construct a quantile map where at each rank probability the bias between dataset 1 and 2 can be discerned for each month a 3rd order polynomial function was fit to the plot of historical gcm data versus the biases these functions were then used to estimate and remove the bias in future gcm outputs dataset 3 this approach assumes that the structure of the bias for the future gcm outputs is the same as that for their historical ones note that this method requires removal of any trends before bias corrections and then reimposing them afterward which was the case for daily min max air temperature wood et al 2004 swat calculates actual et from potential et pet in this study the penman monteith method was selected to estimate pet for the future period climatic variables of solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were individually generated by the stochastic weather generator wxgen in swat sharpley and williams 1990 this stochastic weather generator is widely used for climate change studies ficklin et al 2009 min and shibata 2015 cousino et al 2015 we used the historical statistics obtained from ncep and nfsr data to run wxgen therefore stationarity was assumed in solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed 2 4 calibration validation and evaluation of model performance hydrological models usually have at least some parameters that cannot be determined directly from field measurements therefore identification of the most sensitive parameters can enhance the efficiency of the calibration process in this study the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation were conducted using the swat calibration and uncertainty program abbaspour et al 2007 swat cup where the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2007 was adopted with a total of 16 swat parameters table a2 in sufi 2 parameter uncertainty accounts for all sources of uncertainties such as uncertainty in model structure parameters input forcing e g precipitation and measured data e g observed flow abbaspour et al 2007 the calibrated model parameters were selected based on literature review preliminary sensitivity analysis study area conditions and their known role on hydrologic processes luo et al 2008 statistical measures such as the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr and modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mns are commonly used to evaluate model performance moriasi et al 2007 eckhardt and arnold 2001 krause et al 2005 due to the insensitivity of nse to low flows krause et al 2005 both nse and mns were considered for model performance evaluation since one of the objectives of this study is to estimate changes in flow for the entire range of flow conditions it is necessary to include a statistical measure covering low flow conditions detailed information about statistical measures can be found in supplemental materials the strategy during the calibration process was to have high model performance and most of the measured data fall within the 95 prediction uncertainty band mean daily streamflow data from the usgs station 02423500 fig 1 were used to calibrate and validate swat the period 1 1 1988 12 31 1993 was used for calibration and 1 1 2008 12 31 2013 was used for validation both calibration and validation periods were preceded with a 3 year spin up period the 1992 and 2011 nlcds were used as the lulc data sources during model calibration and validation respectively 2 5 ecologically relevant flow parameters rivers are a primary source of water for agriculture municipalities and industrial purposes in addition river flow regimes are crucial parts of the ecological integrity of river systems poff et al 1997 hart and finelli 1999 changes in streamflow regimes are well recognized by ecologists as the primary driver of many major ecological processes in riverine ecosystem function and structure poff et al 1997 therefore understanding the effects of climate and lulc changes on ecologically relevant hydrologic characteristics is needed for holistic management of watersheds the nature conservancy tnc 2009 has developed the indicators of hydrologic alterations iha software based on richter et al 1996 that calculates 67 statistical parameters from daily flow time series to compare and assess natural discharge characteristics flow regime and environmental flow components these parameters are subdivided into two general categories 1 iha and 2 environmental flow component efc there are 33 iha and 34 efc parameters in this study a subset of 38 26 iha and 12 efc of these 67 parameters were selected to characterize the ecologically relevant flow regime changes in the upper cahaba river watershed the parameters were selected based on their ecological relevance and their use in published ecological studies the 38 key indices can be divided into five groups 1 magnitude of monthly discharge 12 parameters 2 magnitude of annual extreme streamflow under various durations 10 parameters 3 timing of annual extreme discharge 2 parameters 4 rate and frequency of discharge changes 2 parameters and 5 efc monthly low flows 12 parameters the list of groups the hydrologic parameters and their ecosystem influences are provided in table 4 the nature conservancy 2009 swat generated daily streamflow time series were fed into the iha software to calculate each of these parameters 2 6 model experiment setup beyond the baseline period three experiments were set up to assess the individual and combined impacts of lulc change and climate variability on hydrological processes two 25 year time periods baseline period 1988 2013 and future period 2035 2060 were selected the simulated streamflow for the baseline period under each scenario was compared to the corresponding values for the future period to assess climate change impacts on discharge future lulc was assumed to be the same as the baseline period lulc 2011 nlcd eleven gcm outputs under two representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 and 8 5 table a1 for the future period were applied to 2011 lulc to analyze lulc change effects on streamflow the climate in the future period was assumed to be the same as that in the baseline period 1988 2013 the model was simulated under projected future lulc 2045 a1b with historical climate data 1988 2013 to evaluate the combined impacts of lulc and climate change swat simulations were performed using the projected lulc 2045 a1b with eleven gcm outputs 2035 2060 under two representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 and 8 5 table 5 the swat generated daily flow time series from these scenarios were fed into the iha software package to assess the changes in ecologically relevant flow parameters from the 46 swat model outputs table 5 the following is the summary of the experiments conducted 1 baseline period the calibrated and validated model parameters see section 2 4 were used to run swat with the 2011 nlcd and historical climate data 1988 2013 2 only climate change the lulc map for the year 2011 and bias corrected downscaled eleven future climate model under two different rcps 11 rcp 2 6 and 11 rcp8 5 scenarios were considered 1 lulc map 22 climate model 22 scenarios and 3 only lulc change projected 2045 a1b lulc map with historical climate data 1988 2013 were considered 1 lulc map 1 climate data 1 scenario and 4 combined impact of lulc and climate change projected 2045 a1b lulc map with eleven future climate model under two rcps 11 rcp 2 6 and 11 rcp 8 5 scenarios were considered 1 lulc map 22 climate model 22 scenarios 5 synergistic impact the combined effect resulting from the interaction of lulc and climate most likely is not a simple sum of each individual effect in other words there could be a strong synergistic effect when both lulc and climate changes are considered a good example to synergistic effect is the drug synergism which is defined by the us national institute of health nih as an interaction between two or more drugs that causes the total effect of the drugs to be greater than the sum of the individual effects of each drug a synergistic effect can be beneficial or harmful understanding the possible synergism between lulc and climate change on their effect on ecological relevant flow parameters can help in better management of resources the synergistic impact of lulc and climate on changes on parameter x can be calculated as follows δ x synergistic δ x combined δ x climate δ x lulc 3 results and discussions 3 1 changes in precipitation and temperature fig 2 shows the trends in observed annual mean daily streamflow annual precipitation and annual mean daily average temperature during the baseline period 1988 2013 all three exhibit positive trends however only temperature has a statistically significant slope p 0 012 although increase in precipitation will lead to increase in streamflow higher temperatures can reduce this effect through increased et note that anything that is non impervious in the metro birmingham area is most likely vegetated mostly trees meanwhile the city of birmingham gets most of its water from the cahaba river the shades mountain water treatment plant as of year 2015 treats an average of 2 4 m3 s and nearly 3 5 m3 s in the summer there are also point sources discharging to the cahaba river such as wastewater treatment plants unfortunately we did not have data showing how much water is actually withdrawn from or released back to the cahaba river over the years clearly there is a big uncertainty with these data and it is extremely hard to attribute sources of trends in real data fig 3 demonstrates the projected changes in seasonal and annual temperature δ c and precipitation in the future 2035 2060 with respect to the baseline period 1988 2013 at the upper cahaba river watershed the blue and red crosses in each panel correspond to 11 gcm results under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios respectively both variables are expected to increase in spring summer and winter under both rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios ensemble mean from the 22 climate models average annual temperatures are estimated to increase by 1 9 c 0 7 to 2 8 c rcp 2 6 emission scenarios and 3 3 c 1 8 to 4 5 c rcp 8 5 emission scenarios by the 2050 s relative to the baseline period 1988 2013 annual average precipitation is projected to increase ensemble mean from 22 climate models between 1 9 2 7 6 9 rcp 2 6 and 2 3 1 5 3 7 rcp 8 5 by the 2050 s all the models predicted rising trends in temperature for all seasons for winter and spring the range was from 0 7 to 3 7 c on the contrary the range in summer and fall was from 0 6 to 6 9 c for seasonal changes in precipitation there was no clear trend of increase or decrease for example 5 of the 22 climate projections showed a decrease in precipitation spring with an average of 3 4 while the other 17 climate projections showed an increase of about 5 7 moreover 16 of the 22 climate projections showed a decreasing trend in precipitation for fall season by approximately 4 4 in general the upper cahaba river watershed will more likely experience increased temperature especially in summer and fall precipitation was also expected to increase in spring summer and winter therefore the upper cahaba river watershed could experience moderate to significant changes in climate by 2050s especially under rcp 8 5 scenarios 3 2 changes in lulc historical and future lulc maps for each scenario are shown in fig 1 according to 2011 nlcd more than 50 of the area was covered by forest while urban and agriculture land accounted for 35 and 10 of the whole area table 1 compared to the baseline lulc map 2011 there was a trend of urban sprawl in the future based on the projected future lulc map 2045 usgs eros a1b the percentage of urban cover within the watershed will increase from 35 to 47 in 30 years growth of urban area coincided with a reduction of other lulc types water forest agriculture and wetland for instance forest cover was predicted to be 5 smaller in 2045 45 4 than in 2011 50 3 similar trends were projected in areas covered with water agriculture and wetland table 1 3 3 results of model calibration and validation sensitivity analysis with swat cup revealed cn2 initial curve number for moisture condition ii as the most sensitive parameter for the upper cahaba river watershed at daily time step the maximum canopy storage canmx was ranked 2nd saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k and ground water delay gw delay were also found to be highly sensitive rankings of the sensitivity of the other parameters can be found in table a2 observed and simulated mean monthly streamflows and daily flow duration curves fdc based on the lulc maps for the calibration 1992 lulc and validation 2011 lulc periods are shown in fig 4 values of the statistical measures for the model performance at daily time scale are shown in table a3 during the calibration period the nse and pbias values were 0 71 and 6 5 respectively according to the criteria developed by moriasi et al 2007 for monthly simulations this is a good very good performance model performance during the validation period was similar with nse and pbias values of 0 65 and 9 3 the calibrated swat model was used to explore the impacts of various climate lulc scenarios in the following sections 3 4 impacts of climate change on iha parameters simulated streamflows obtained by running swat with each of the 22 climate predictions 11 rcp 2 6 and 11 rcp 8 5 were compared to the corresponding streamflows from the baseline period the projected annual average daily streamflow for the future period was 8 97 and 8 79 m3 s under the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios respectively compared to the average daily streamflow in the baseline period 8 04 m3 s annual average streamflow will increase by 11 rcp2 6 and 9 rcp 8 5 in the future the differences of the mean values for each iha parameters table 4 between the two rcp scenarios are discussed in the following sections 3 4 1 group 1 on average the magnitudes of mean monthly flows under future climate scenarios were higher than the baseline period particularly from may to september fig 5 shows the relative changes in monthly streamflows as box and whisker plots for each scenario relative to the baseline period 1988 2013 the sensitivity of monthly streamflow to climate change differed between the emission scenarios the relative changes in monthly streamflow in june and july had greater uncertainty than those in other months the changes in monthly median streamflow for the future rcp 2 6 and 8 5 climate change scenarios were predicted to decrease in october 13 and november 11 for rcp 2 6 and april 9 and may 5 for rcp 8 5 this finding indicated a significant decrease in flow during fall under the rcp 2 6 scenario on the contrary significant increases were estimated in may september and june september periods under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios although some variations occurred among the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 results the general pattern indicated increases in june september flow particularly in july the increase in streamflow under the climate change scenario was expected for the entire flow range with monthly median flow expected to increase by 55 under rcp 2 6 and 74 under rcp 8 5 these changes in streamflow were mainly driven by changes in precipitation 3 4 2 group 2 magnitudes of extreme min max annual water conditions of various durations ranging from daily 1 3 7 days to seasonal 30 90 days were assessed by the 10 parameters in this group as shown in fig 6 substantial variations were found in the 1 to 90 day average annual minimum maximum flows under future climate scenarios results of rcp 2 6 scenarios indicated that 1 3 7 day mean annual minima were expected to increase about 7 and the 30 90 day mean annual minima were expected to increase about 30 and 42 respectively moreover the 1 3 7 30 and 90 day mean annual maxima were expected to increase about 69 49 43 34 and 15 respectively rcp 8 5 results had similar patterns except for 1 3 and 7 day minima which were expected to decrease by about 8 3 4 3 group 3 the two parameters in group 3 are critical for the seasonal features of the hydrological conditions they measure the julian date of the annual 1 day maximum and minimum water conditions for example reproduction which is a key life cycle phase maybe linked to the timing of annual flow extremes changes in the timing of these events may cause reproductive stress or failure the timing of the annual extreme flows for rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 were similar to the baseline period as shown in fig 7 the julian date of annual 1 day maximum flow was predicted to be 9 days later for rcp 2 6 and 7 days later for rcp 8 5 compared to the baseline period whereas the julian dates of 1 day minimums are predicted to be 10 days and 6 days earlier for rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 respectively 3 4 4 group 4 the two parameters in this group measure the mean rate and number for both negative and positive changes in water conditions as shown in fig 8 streamflow was expected to rise and fall at much faster rates under future climate conditions for instance the change in median of the rise rate for both rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios were 14 and 9 respectively similarly the change in median of the fall rate for both rcp 2 6 and 8 5 emission scenarios were about 15 respectively 3 4 5 group 5 impacts of 22 climate change scenarios on monthly low flows are shown in fig 9 under rcp 8 5 scenario monthly low flows were predicted to decrease more often than increase the monthly median low flows were predicted to increase in july 18 august 13 september 22 and october 9 and decrease in other months about 2 14 on the contrary the monthly low flows were predicted to increase between may and october under the rcp 2 6 emission scenario by 5 to 19 this group is very important for aquatic plants for example if the monthly low flows were extremely low during the growing season the water temperature and water chemistry would probably be affected significantly and lead to more frequent plant stress 3 5 impacts of lulc change on iha parameters 3 5 1 group 1 lulc change impacts on the hydrologic regime of the upper cahaba river watershed were analyzed by using 2045 usgs eros a1b lulc map with historical climate data 1988 2013 an increasing trend was found in mean annual streamflow under future lulc conditions compared to the results obtained with 2011 lulc the projected future mean annual flow increased from 8 04 m3 s to 8 75 m3 s with 2045 lulc this can be explained by the projected development and urban growth in the watershed monthly mean streamflows simulated by swat under future lulc are shown in fig 10 monthly streamflows would decrease from april to july about 5 but increase in other months about 17 based on this projected future lulc the largest percent increase and decrease were expected in october at 27 and in june at 8 respectively thus lulc change had a relatively smaller impact on streamflow compared to climate change scenarios 3 5 2 group 2 the annual minimum and maximum daily averages are presented in fig 11 due to projected increase in urbanization considerable changes were expected in daily minimum flows the 1 3 7 and 30 day minimum daily flows decreased approximately 60 under the 2045 lulc scenario on the other hand approximately 21 increase was predicted for extreme high flows compared to the climate change only impacts magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions appeared to be more sensitive to lulc changes than to the projected changes in climate 3 5 3 group 3 and 4 as shown in fig 7 julian dates of annual 1 day maximum and minimum varied substantially under lulc changes in particular annual 1 day minimum flow was expect to happen 28 days earlier compared to the baseline period whereas 1 day maximum was expected to happen 23 days later fig 7 the mean values of fall and rise rates were predicted to increase about 45 and 35 respectively fig 8 and both were higher than the values obtained for climate change 3 5 4 group 5 the impact of only lulc change on monthly low flows can be seen in fig 12 results indicate that monthly low flows decreased in all months due to urbanization and the ranges of change were between 24 in february to 54 in june it is clear from fig 12 that urbanization is the primary driving force of low streamflow conditions 3 6 combined impacts of lulc and climate change on iha parameters in addition to the assessment of the individual impacts of lulc and climate change the combined and synergistic effects of these changes on the ecologically relevant flow parameters were also evaluated the following sections describe the changes in each iha group 3 6 1 group 1 changes in monthly hydrological conditions for the period of january through december are presented in fig 5 average streamflow noticeably increased from july to september by approximately 63 under rcp 2 6 and 42 under rcp 8 5 the ranges of changes from october to may were 1 to 16 for rcp 2 6 and 32 to 3 for rcp 8 5 fig 5 the mean streamflow only decreased in april and may under rcp 8 5 decrease in streamflow ranged from 32 to 17 under rcp 8 5 it is also worth noting that the ranges of relative changes in monthly streamflow for the future periods were substantially larger in june and july than in other months these results indicate that aquatic ecosystem habitat would be affected in the future especially in summer streamflow in the upper cahaba river watershed appeared to be more sensitive to future climate change than to lulc change 3 6 2 group 2 the magnitudes and durations of annual extreme water conditions under future lulc and climate change are presented in fig 6 important variations were found in the annual minimum maximum flows under future rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios the magnitudes of annual minimum flows decreased in rcp 2 6 ranging from 56 to 21 the magnitudes of annual maximum and 90 day minimum flows increased under future conditions ranging from 26 to 55 on the contrary the annual minimums significantly decreased in rcp 8 5 ranging from 87 to 65 similar to rcp 2 6 annual maximum and 90 day minimum flows showed an increasing trend in rcp 8 5 ranging from 7 to 69 fig 6 3 6 3 group 3 as shown in fig 7 julian dates of annual 1 day maximum and minimum changed substantially in both rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios in particular annual 1 day minimum flow was expected to happen 51 rcp2 6 and 40 rcp8 5 days earlier compared to the baseline period whereas 1 day maximum flow was expected to be delayed 34 rcp 2 6 and 48 rcp 8 5 days when compared to the baseline period 3 6 4 group 4 the rise and fall rates were expected to be much higher under combined impacts of future lulc and climate conditions fig 8 for instance median of the percent change of the rise rate for rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios were 24 and 33 respectively similarly median percent change of fall rate for rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios were respectively 49 and 45 3 6 5 group 5 combined impacts of lulc change and 22 climate change scenarios on monthly low flows are shown in fig 9 monthly low flows were predicted to decrease in all months under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios ranging from 3 to 61 most dramatic decrease was expected in march june period 3 7 synergistic impacts of lulc and climate change on iha parameters as shown in fig 10 the synergistic impact on change in mean monthly flow is very strong from may through august in rcp 2 6 scenario when both changes happen the magnitudes of percent increase in monthly flows were magnified in those months due to synergistic effects interestingly synergistic effects were less pronounced in summer months in rcp 8 5 scenario further during months where synergistic effects were more noticeable it has an opposite direction i e the impact of both changes occurring simultaneously was less than the sum of individual impacts in addition to monthly flows substantial synergistic impacts were also detected on the magnitude and duration of annual extreme flow conditions and monthly low flows fig 11 demonstrates the relative importance of lulc and climate impact on the magnitude and duration of annual extreme water conditions synergistic impacts of lulc and climate change were strong for 1 3 and 90 day minimum flows and 1 3 and 7 day maximum flows under rcp 2 6 scenarios similarly strong synergistic effects were seen for all minimum and maximum flows under the rcp 8 5 scenario in this emission scenario the synergistic effect was highest in 30 day flow which showed no interaction effect with rcp 2 6 the results for rcp 8 5 maximum flows are similar to rcp 2 6 results for efc monthly low flows fig 12 lulc was the leading driver while climate change slightly impacted monthly low flows important synergistic impacts were detected in all months under rcp 2 6 15 20 discernable synergistic impacts were only observed during the fall september december under the rcp 8 5 scenario fig 12 the synergistic effect had an increasing trend from april to december the potential implications of having significant synergistic effects can be illustrated by taking average july streamflow as an example lulc change was expected to cause a small reduction 4 in average july streamflow and climate change was predicted to increase it around 55 when they act together the expected increase in average july streamflow was around 85 which is much greater than the sum of individual effects therefore even if by itself lulc change was not expected to have an impact on average july streamflow if one wants to limit the increase in average july flow due to climate change controlling lulc impacts can help such as by implementing low impact design practices or green infrastructures 4 summary and conclusions in this study individual and combined impacts of lulc and climate change on ecologically relevant flow parameters were explored for the upper cahaba river watershed which is known for its aquatic diversity but is under stress due to urbanization a total of 46 experiments was set up and daily streamflow under each experiment were simulated by a calibrated and validated swat model daily streamflow estimates from each experiment were fed into the iha software to analyze the hydrological responses under changing lulc and climate and more importantly the sensitivity of ecologically relevant flow parameters to these changes the study results revealed that lulc and climate change will have substantial impacts on ecologically relevant flows of the upper cahaba river watershed for example climate change was expected to increase maximum monthly streamflow especially in june september period this increase was mainly driven by the change in the precipitation patterns increased summer maximum flow may change habitat availability for aquatic organisms for example cahaba lilies which is an endangered species in alabama requiring shallow water to flourish results suggest that 1 3 7 and 30 day maximum flows will be significantly affected by future climate conditions on the other hand future lulc will cause considerable decreases in 1 3 7 and 30 day minimum flows and increases in the rise and fall rates of streamflow the combined effects of changing lulc and climate caused decreased low flow and increased high flow indicating a potential for more frequent hydrological drought and flood events decreased flow volume for small events is considered detrimental for most fish species liu et al 2005 increased summer temperature and decreased flow will increase water temperatures and reduce dissolved oxygen causing possible hypoxia or anoxia more flashy flow on the other hand will increase soil erosion and degradation during sediment transport making streamflow muddy and reduce benthos and other aquatic habitats gascón et al 2007 another important impact of lulc change was the timing of annual extreme water conditions such as annual 1 day maximum and minimum water conditions the timing of 1 day maximum flow was predicted to shift by approximately 23 days towards the end of the year altered flow regime will affect the life history of aquatic species such as their access to special habitats for reproduction or avoiding predation liao 2007 lulc change did not have substantial impact on monthly mean streamflows however increasing trends were identified for the september january period therefore when lulc change was combined with climate change the amount of streamflow increased in all months except in april furthermore more dramatic decreasing trends in 1 3 7 and 30 day minimum flows monthly low flows and increasing trend for timing of 1 day maximum flow 48 days late were identified for combined lulc and climate change impacts especially under the rcp 8 5 scenario there were quite noticeable synergistic effects in ecologically relevant flows when changing climate and lulc were combined unlike climate change which is a global issue with more uncertainties local stake holders should put emphasis on alleviating lulc change effects on regional water resources such as making science based development plans or applying management alternatives to mitigate the negative impacts of lulc change from both hydrological and ecological aspects major findings of this study can be very useful for the future policy making processes by local engineers and other decision makers the methodology used in this study to assess lulc and climate change impacts on ecological relevant flows can be easily extended to other systems which might be quite different from the cahaba river watershed in physical properties climate conditions and geographic locations we acknowledge that the predicted percent changes in the ecologically relevant flow parameters might have been slightly different if we were to use another process based watershed model however the predicted trends such as the increase in streamflow rise fall rates or delay in timing of maximum flows etc should be similar to what we found declaration of competing interest the

5603,the eastern part of india experiences a rapid reduction in rainfall in the past 20 years 1997 2017 which has several implications to the livelihood of the people and the ecosystems of the region stable isotopic analysis of precipitation along with extensive backward trajectory modelling was conducted in this drying region to understand the factors controlling the stable isotopic composition of precipitation and source and origin of atmospheric moisture for precipitation during the indian summer monsoon ism the drivers responsible for the isotopic variations in precipitation were evaluated using their statistical relations with temperature amount of rainfall and relative humidity rh additionally outgoing longwave radiation olr data from noaa satellites were used to evaluate the effect of convective activities on isotopic variations in precipitation the pathways of moisture transport for each rain event were derived using backward trajectory model hysplit4 0 based on ncep data and the atmospheric circulation patterns were evaluated using ncar reanalysis data major sources of moisture causing rainfall during the ism period in the drying region were evaluated using cluster analysis of the backward wind trajectories the isotopic content in precipitation showed a weak temperature and amount effects however a moderate correlation was observed with relative humidity of the region it is inferred that the relatively high isotopic depletion observed in the monsoon rains was not related to the amount of rainfall but rather to large scale convective processes it is found that the rainwater isotopic content during the ism appears to be controlled by the dynamics of moisture rather than the hydrometeorological conditions of the individual precipitation events a local meteoric water line δ2h 7 86 δ18o 8 81 was developed for eastern india using the isotopic data of rainwater samples backward air mass trajectory modelling cluster analysis of wind trajectories atmospheric circulation patterns and lower d excess suggest that the origin of moisture in the drying region of eastern india was predominantly from the arabian sea and the contribution from the bay of bengal was insignificant keywords precipitation stable isotope indian summer monsoon hysplit convective processes eastern india 1 introduction the indian summer monsoon ism is the most important and energetic component of the indian sub continent s climate system it starts due to the development of the cross equatorial low level jet and serves as a primary conduit for the transportation of moisture across the indian ocean and the arabian sea onto the indian sub continent joseph and sijikumar 2004 the warming of the indian sub continent relative to the indian ocean creates a low pressure over asia that pulls moisture from the indian ocean the arabian sea and the bay of bengal are the two major sources of moisture for the ism identification of leading moisture sources is important for understanding the climate dynamics of the indian sub continent the back trajectories analysis along with the use of environmental stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o of precipitation gives valuable information about the moisture sources and atmospheric circulation patterns that give rise to the rainfall and is an effective means for investigating complex hydrological processes dutton et al 2005 liu et al 2008 saranya et al 2018 currently the development of sophisticated numerical models incorporating water isotope tracers has accelerated further advances in the understanding of the isotopic response to climate variability on various temporal and spatial scales hughes and crawford 2013 balagizi et al 2018 wei et al 2018 precipitation which is the primary source to the hydrological system e g surface water and groundwater has a unique isotopic signature which is controlled by isotopic fractionation processes cappa et al 2003 and is primarily influenced by i hydrometeorological parameters such as amount of precipitation temperature relative humidity rh convective processes rain vapor interactions and rainout effects dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 kumar et al 2010a b kong et al 2013 guo et al 2017 hollins et al 2018 and ii geographical parameters such as latitude altitude moisture sources atmospheric transport processes local water recycling mechanisms rain droplet re evaporation and residence time of atmospheric moisture craig 1961 aggarwal et al 2004 deshpande et al 2010 risi et al 2010 aggarwal et al 2012 yu et al 2017 hence stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h in precipitation are extremely sensitive to climate changes additionally these isotopes also record the essential information about the evolution of the hydrological cycle eg paleoclimatic conditions the precipitation is an important part of the hydrological cycle of a region and a minor isotopic variation in it may reflect on the isotopic composition of various components of the water cycle hence stable isotopic composition of precipitation is an important tool for evaluating regional climate change and the associated hydrological processes numerous research conducted in the recent past have well established the stable isotopic characteristics of precipitation such as altitude effect amount effect seasonal effect temperature effect continental effect etc jouzel and merlivat 1984 kohn and welker 2005 kumar et al 2010a b aggarwal et al 2016 noble and ansari 2019 a number of studies show that the isotopic composition of precipitation can provide in depth knowledge on the meteorological and hydrological condition of a region schmidt et al 2005 ansari et al 2018 raymo et al 2018 lone et al 2019 δ18o and δ2h content of rain water shows a distinct empirical relationship described by the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 as the majority of δ2h and δ18o values of precipitation fall close to this line this relation was first established by craig 1961 comparing the isotope data of precipitation of a region with the gmwl helps to understand the precipitation pathways of the region however several effects such as source water evaporation and moisture re cycling can lead to deviations of rainwater isotopes of a given location from the gmwl breitenbach et al 2010 hence δ18o δ2h relationship need to be described locally by a local meteoric water line lmwl dansgaard 1964 further described the δ18o and δ2h relationship by another parameter namely deuterium excess d excess and defined as 1 d excess δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o the deuterium excess is used as a measure for kinetic fractionation occurring under non equilibrium conditions such as evaporation above the sea surface pfahl and sodemann 2014 and it depends on climatic conditions in the source region such as relative humidity temperature and wind speed although it is also affected by local processes risi et al 2008 it can also be used for the identification of vapor sources and moisture recycling over the continents gat 2000 and the sea surface temperature that cannot be obtained from δ18o or δ2h alone cappa et al 2003 pfahl and sodemann 2014 rahul et al 2018 during evaporation in dry climatic conditions the kinetic fractionation becomes stronger and thereby the residual water has low d excess whereas the resultant vapour has high d excess values and precipitation from such a vapor also has high d excess clark and fritz 1997 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 during light precipitation events falling raindrops undergo evaporation which results in lower d excess in precipitation samples gupta and deshpande 2005 therefore deuterium excess in the precipitation has shown specific potential in climate studies for tracing the evaporation and precipitation processes froehlich et al 2002 the average d excess of precipitation is about 10 on the global scale dansgaard 1964 balagizi et al 2018 the study areas of this research are located in the eastern part of india near to the bay of bengal fig 1 during the past century 1901 2012 eastern india has witnessed a weakening of the ism rainfall guhathakurta and rajeevan 2008 with a reduction of about 10 to 20 roxy et al 2015 however a rapid reduction in rainfall has been observed in the past 20 years i e from 1997 to 2017 data source indian water portal and noaa fig 2 for instance in 2003 the region experienced more than 1794 mm of rain while the rainfall was only 989 mm in 2017 over this period there was a reduction of about 34 5 mm per year in rainfall in this drying region of eastern india which indicated that it is turning to a drought prone area this has caused several social and economical consequences as the majority of the agricultural activity in the region is rain fed roxy et al 2015 observed that rapid warming of western part of the indian ocean along with the warming of the indian sub continent has weakened the land sea thermal gradient which consequently dampens the monsoonal hadley circulation and thereby reducing the precipitation over the region however paul et al 2016 opined that this reduction in ism rainfall is because of the large scale changes in land use and land cover pattern in the east central region of india this paper evaluates the stable isotope δ18o δ2h and d excess variability in rainfall and their relationships with hydrometeorological conditions in the drying region of a part of eastern india additionally the dominant sources of moisture causing the rainfall and moisture transport processes over the drying region during the ism were evaluated 2 location and climatic condition the study areas are situated about 150 200 km away from the bay of bengal and far away from the arabian sea about 1400 1500 km and experience a tropical monsoon climate with a mild winter and hot summer fig 1 the average summer temperature goes up to 40 c and in winter it goes down to 14 c the relative humidity during the ism varies from 83 5 to 98 9 wind velocity is low to moderate with slight increase in speed during summer and monsoon months during the ism the wind velocity ranges from 0 6 to 13 7 km h the mean annual wind speed is 6 8 km h during the investigation period in 2016 the region experienced only 70 days of rainfall in the three months period i e from july to september and the daily average rainfall ranged from 0 5 to 106 mm majority of the rainfall event days 50 had below 10 mm rainfall and it was more than 50 mm only on a few occasions 6 days see in supplementary material s1 there was no rainfall in the study area during the month of june 3 methodology 3 1 daily rainwater sampling and isotopic analysis daily rainwater samples and hydrometeorological parameters were collected from the two different locations viz rgs 1 60 m amsl and rgs 2 62 m amsl of the study area during the ism period june to september for isotopic analysis fig 1 total of 102 numbers of rainwater samples were collected using rain sampling device installed at two different locations the rain collection setup consists of a a plastic container volume 5 l fitted with a funnel having a plastic tube which extended up to the bottom of the container and a long narrow tube length 6 m and diameter 1 cm attached at the top to equalise the pressure groning et al 2012 at the end of each rain event the samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles 30 ml and analyzed for environmental isotopes δ2h and δ18o using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime 100 the co2 h2o equilibration method was used for δ18o measurement epstein and mayeda 1953 while δ2h was measured using pyrolysis method in elemental analyzer coupled to the isotope ratio mass spectrometer the results are reported in the standard δ notation craig 1961 and defined in relation to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow as given by the following equation 2 δ 2 h or δ 18 o r sample r standard r standard 10 3 where rsample represents the isotope ratio of a sample 2h 1h and 18o 16o and r standard represents the corresponding ratio in a standard clark and fritz 1997 the δ values are expressed in parts per thousand permil the precision of measurement of δ2h is 0 5 and that of δ18o is 0 2 at 1σ criterion 3 2 backward trajectory modelling hysplit and cluster analyses lagrangian wind trajectory analyses were performed to understand the source and origin of moisture for precipitation occurring in the study site and compared the same with the stable isotopic content of rainwater using the framework of the hybrid single particles lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit4 0 model provided by noaa http ready arl noaa gov hysplit php and global reanalysis datasets from the national centre for environmental prediction ncep the air mass trajectories for 48 h before the precipitation event were simulated the height of the initiation of each trajectory was selected as 500 1000 and 2000 m above ground level agl because 70 of the total rainfall occurring in the region during the ism is contributed by stratiform low level clouds and their height cloud base generally varies from 1000 to 2000 m agl aggarwal et al 2004 daily back trajectories of air masses were calculated for the ism period july september and cluster analysis was further applied to group these back trajectories according to their direction speed the separation for the same was done based on their centroids length cluster mean trajectories to identify the dominant source of moisture coming to the region the changes in rh of the air parcel along the trajectory path were evaluated to understand the precipitation and evaporation processes additionally large scale circulation patterns showing the relative humidity and wind vector fields were derived from ncar reanalysis data http www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded reanalysis 3 3 outgoing longwave radiation olr analysis the spatial pattern of monthly mean outgoing longwave radiation olr data for july august and september for the 0 30 n 50 120 e sector from noaa satellite were used as proxies of convection patterns the olr data was used for understanding the cloudiness and rainfall originating from deep circulation over the tropics as it is negatively correlated with the intensity of convection risi et al 2008 guo et al 2017 lower the olr value the deeper will be the convective cloud 4 results and discussion 4 1 variation of stable isotopic compositions in rainwater the daily δ18o and δ2h data of rainwater collected at the two stations rgs 1 and rgs 2 are shown in the supplementary material s2 and s12 it is seen that during the study period july to september the δ18o values of rainwater ranged from 11 2 to 5 2 while the δ2h values ranged from 83 8 to 35 7 the trend of stable isotopic variability during the ism period is presented as the weekly weighted δ18o and δ2h of two stations in fig 3 the enriched isotopic values were found in the beginning of july and depleted values were found from the end of july till september overall the isotopic values were found to be enriched during the onset of ism and comparatively depleted during the late monsoon period august september this typical distribution of isotopic content in rainwater during the ism is not restricted to the present study site but it is also observed over the entire indian sub continent viz new delhi bhattacharya et al 2003 ahmedabad western india deshpande et al 2010 and andaman islands bay of bengal chakeraborty et al 2016 the depletion in isotopic content during the mid and recession periods of ism is a regional phenomenon and is not because of the local effects a possible reason for this isotopic depletion is explained below the air above the land surface is generally saturated with the water during the monsoon period water is available everywhere on the surface rivers lakes reservoirs agriculture lands wetlands soil etc over the large part of the indian sub continent consequently the lower atmosphere over the region is filled with large amount of water vapor loaded with moisture gadgil 2003 this results in an unstable air column and consequently increases the convergence in the monsoonal current and its speed so the probability of convective activities increases and the rainfall is caused by vertical uplifting and cooling of moist air masses as the monsoon progresses this dynamic and mechanical uplifting of air masses increases and it could cause depletion in isotopic content of daily rainfall during the recession of ism jeelani et al 2018 the d excess of rainwater fluctuates largely during the monsoon and varied from 2 2 to 8 1 which is lower than the average global value 10 implying high humid air masses over the oceanic source region and convection along the trajectory it was observed that the relatively higher d excess values are found in the beginning of july and slightly lower values are observed from end of july to august and early september overall the d excess was higher during the onset and receding period of ism this variation of d excess may be due to the monsoonal break high rh intensive convective activity and changes in moisture source marine and continental 4 2 local meteoric water line lmwl the regression line between δ18o and δ2h of meteoric water for a region is generally termed as local meteoric water line lmwl it reflects the hydrometeorological and natural geographical condition of that region and thus can be used to study the climate change kumar et al 2010a reported the meteoric water line for india 3 δ 2 h 7 93 δ 18 o 9 94 based on the δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater collected from the study area and those reported from a nearby location namely kolkata 150 km away by sinha et al 2019 a local meteoric water line lmwl for the east india was developed using the least square fitting method which is described as 4 δ 2 h 7 86 δ 18 o 8 81 r 2 0 96 n 146 it is compared with the lmwl of another station in the region namely thailand eastern part of bay of bengal wei et al 2018 and port blair sinha et al 2019 the equation to the lmwl of thailand is given by 5 δ 2 h 8 0 δ 18 o 9 4 and for port blair is given by 6 δ 2 h 7 7 δ 18 o 8 83 it is seen that the slope and y intercept of the lmwl developed in the present study are more or less similar to that of thailand and port blair also it has almost similar slope compared to that of the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 fig 4 the slope of the lmwl is also similar to that of indian meteoric water line imwl developed by kumar et al 2010a however y intercept is slightly lower normally lower slope and y intercept of the lmwl for any region is due to secondary sub cloud evaporation which is the evaporation of rain droplets after condensation clark and fritz 1997 in our case the slope of the lmwl was almost similar to that of gmwl slope which suggests that secondary evaporation is not prominent at this site plata 1994 jeelani et al 2018 and lone et al 2019 have observed that decrease in rainfall increase in air temperature decrease in vapor pressure and lower relative humidity would reduce the slope and y intercept this is mainly due to the isotopic fractionation triggered by secondary evaporation during the descent of raindrops but in our study site rh was relatively high from lower level of the atmosphere to higher level up to cloud base see in supplementary material s3 wind speed was low mean 4 7 km h air temperature was low and convective activity was more prominent during most of the rain events in the ism period hence slope was not much affected the slight deviation of intercept compared to the gmwl may be due to the high rh in the moisture source area datta et al 1991 and changes in the sources of moisture lmwl is found to be parallel to the gmwl and placed to the right hand side of it fig 4 suggesting a humid climate at the moisture source region physical factors such as temperature relative humidity air circulation and intensity of rainfall influences the isotopic composition of rainwater and therefore the influence of these parameters on the isotopic content of rainwater were evaluated and discussed in the succeeding section 4 3 local hydrometeorological influence in our investigation the temporal relationship between δ18o values of rainwater and the average temperature were evaluated fig 3 the result shows that the temperature was fluctuating with time however the δ18o was more or less constant during the ism period july to september hence on a daily scale no clear correlation was observed between them to understand it in a better way a pearson correlation analysis was performed between δ18o values of precipitation and average daily temperatures and the results show an overall weak positive correlation fig 5 furthermore the amount effect in the study site was evaluated and it is observed that the amount of rainfall was randomly varying during ism but the isotopic content of rainwater was more or less constant fig 3 the pearson correlation analysis between the δ18o values of rainwater and the amount of rainfall also shows a poor correlation fig 5 in order to determine the influence of rh on δ18o of the precipitation a time series plot and pearson correlation analysis between δ18o values of precipitation and rh were performed fig 3 and fig 5 the results show that they are not closely correlated with each other from the above discussion it is inferred that the stable isotopic composition of precipitation in the study area is neither controlled by temperature nor by the amount of rainfall however a moderate correlation is observed between rh and the stable isotopic content of rainfall this corroborate our finding that the well established isotopic effects such as temperature effect and amount effect are not prominent in the indian subcontinent during the monsoon as reported by other researchers chakraborty et al 2016 he and richards 2016 jeelani et al 2018 4 4 relationships between convective processes olr and stable isotopic content in rainwater convective processes in the atmosphere can be thought as another factor that may influence the stable isotopic composition of precipitation occurring in the tropical regions gao et al 2013 guo et al 2017 olr data of the region was analysed to understand the role of convective processes in controlling the stable isotopic content of precipitation occurring in the study area since many years the satellite derived olr data are being used as a proxy for detecting the tropical deep convection matsumoto and murakami 2000 sandeep and stordal 2013 olr is the total amount of thermal radiation emitted from the earth to the interplanetary space lower value of olr near the low latitude regions indicates presence of high cirrus clouds as the radiation from the low temperature cloud top is weaker than that from the earth surface zhang 1993 the high cirrus clouds are produced by deep convection and can t persist in the long term without the convective processes matsumoto and murakami 2000 hence low olr is often used to identify tropical convection and the onset of monsoon precipitation susskind et al 2012 sandeep and stordal 2013 noaa interpolated olr data with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 source liebmann and smith 1996 was used to identify the extent of clouds and convective processes in the region olr values less than 240 w m2 and sea surface temperature 27 5 c are indicative of large scale convection gadgil 2003 sandeep and stordal 2013 convective activities are of two types the organized large scale widely triggered and the isolated small scale triggered locally stable isotopic composition of precipitation would be relatively more depleted in regional scale organized events than in local or isolated events risi et al 2008 the spatial pattern of monthly mean olr during the months of july august and september for the 0 30 n 50 120 e sector was analysed to understand the relationship between large scale organized convection and stable isotopic composition of precipitation see in supplementary material s4 the results show that the eastern and western parts of india as well as the bay of bengal were having lower olr value 210 w m2 in july it was observed that the olr value was spatially decreasing from southeast and from northwest direction during august the convective processes prevailed strongly over the bay of bengal and approximately 85 of the indian sub continent it gets weakened at northwestern part of india during september 250 w m2 however in eastern india i e the study site it was still prominent 230 w m2 comparison of the spatial pattern of olr data for july august and september indicated a notable decrease in olr during july and august only therefore it can be deduced that more intensive monsoonal convection occurred along the trajectories that originated from the arabian sea and inland areas a good correlation between stable isotopic composition of rainwater and convective processes using olr as a proxy was observed by many researchers risi et al 2008 lekshmy et al 2014 guo et al 2017 lekshmy et al 2014 opined that the presence of large scale cloud bands i e convective processes during ism causes stable isotopic depletion in the ism rains hence it is felt that convection can be one of the major processes that bring variation in stable isotopic composition of precipitation occurring in the tropical regions in the present study the relationship between the stable isotopic content of rainwater and olr data was examined and it is seen that during intensive monsoon convection i e olr 220 w m2 the stable isotopic δ18o content of rainwater was depleted and remained almost constant although there was a large variation in daily rainfall 1 8 to 106 mm during this period this indicates that the isotopic depletion was caused by convective processes rather than the amount of rainfall the pearson correlation plot also shows a good positive correlation between the stable isotopic composition of rainwater and convective processes i e olr fig 5 hovmoller diagram i e latitude versus time plot of olr averaged over 70 100 e shows anomaly in the olr data during the ism period and it is used to evaluate the role of convective activities in fractionating the stable isotopes of precipitation see in supplementary material s5 it is observed that on 26 july there was a large scale intensive convective activity olr 180 w m2 in the region which persisted until 08 september and then weakened thereafter most of the depleted stable isotopic values are observed only during this period it was also seen that rh was more than 94 and intensity of rainfall varied largely during this period normally strong and intensive convection occurs with strong mid tropospheric convergence of moist air and therefore the vertical velocity can also be used as a proxy for the convective activities lekshmy et al 2014 observed that upward moving air masses cause lower δ18o while downward or horizontal wind motion causes higher δ18o during the ism from the back trajectory analysis it is observed that upward moving air masses during 26 july 13 august 08 28 september had lower δ values whereas downward and horizontal moving air masses during 13 17 july had higher δ values see in supplementary material s6 it is also seen that altitude of the trajectory for the upward moving air masses was below 1 5 km and this allowed the air parcel to pick up additional moisture from the sub cloud layer before uplifting over the study site 4 5 moisture sources analysis the air masses are responsible for the transport of moisture dispersion and accumulation of aerosols therefore a backward trajectory model hysplit draxler and rolph 2014 was used to evaluate the pathway and origin of air masses to the study area from the back trajectory analysis see in supplementary material s7 it was found that the pattern of trajectories on 13 21 august was identical for the altitude of 1000 m and 2000 m agl however minor deviations are noticed in the lower altitude trajectory 500 m agl when compared to the higher altitude trajectory which may be because of the influence of surface topography during the rest of the rain events the trajectories of 500 m 1000 m and 2000 m agl altitude behave differently the results of back trajectory analysis indicated two possible vapor source regions one from the arabian sea and another from the inland areas the moisture source for rain during 07 13 july was coming from the inland areas of central india whereas it originated from the arabian sea for the rain events on 06 13 21 august the trajectory pattern on 08 september behaved differently and was in circular pattern when compared to the other days indicating upward lifting of air masses hence the rainfall on 08 september might be caused by high altitude clouds the back trajectory for the rain event on 28 september showed multiple sources of vapor some of the wind trajectories such as 500 1000 m agl were originated from the sub himalayas and 2000 m agl back trajectory was originated from a distant location i e bay of bengal additionally daily pattern of air masses trajectories during the ism period was evaluated to identify the dominant sources of moisture coming to the eastern india for this back trajectories of 48 h period were computed for each day during the monsoon for an altitude of 1500 m agl about 324 daily back trajectories were generated using hysplit and clustered using trajectory cluster analysis in the hysplit software the 324 trajectories were classified into four clusters according to the changes in total spatial variance tsv kumar et al 2011 see in supplementary material s8 the back trajectories of the centroid i e cluster mean trajectories and the frequency of their occurrence during the ism period is shown in fig 6 the results show that the trajectories of cluster ii and cluster iv were originating from the arabian sea and they together constitute 51 of the total back trajectories whereas the trajectories of cluster i was originating from the inland areas of central india and constitute 27 of the total back trajectories the cluster iii which constitute 21 of the total back trajectories were originating from both the bay of bengal and from inland areas the number of back trajectories in each cluster and their pattern of occurrence are shown in fig 7 from the pattern and number of trajectories in each cluster it is observed that the dominant trajectories 168 during the ism period were those originating from the arabian sea only 89 trajectories were coming from the inland areas of central india and 67 were from the bay of bengal and inland areas of eastern india cluster analysis of back trajectories clearly shows that the contribution of moisture from the arabian sea was maximum in the region while it was minimal from the bay of bengal although the study area is located near to the bay of bengal contributions of moisture from the continental and local areas are not prominent the rh along the trajectories for the rainfall days on 13 17 july showed that air masses brought moderate amount of moisture rh 55 to 80 from the inland areas however on 13 21 august and 08 september the rh of the air mass along the trajectories were high rh 70 to 97 irrespective of the altitude of the trajectories it shows constant supply of moisture from the arabian sea and inland areas that cause copious amount of rainfall 106 mm on these days over eastern india see in supplementary material s9 4 6 relationships between moisture sources and isotopic values in rainwater the moisture sources and circulation of air masses influence the isotopic composition of rainwater aggarwal et al 2004 balagizi et al 2018 therefore the variability in δ18o and d excess were interpreted along with the back trajectories of the air masses for this back trajectory analyses were performed for the rainy days on which the isotopic value of rainwater was relatively enriched and for the days on which it was relatively depleted results show that the moisture for the rain event with relatively enriched stable isotopic values δ18o 5 2 d excess 5 9 that occurred on 13 17 july originated from the inland areas of central india the results of the back trajectory analyses explain the relatively higher d excess values as the moisture from the surface water bodies and soil of the local inland areas cause significant increase in the d excess values of precipitation rather than because of any other local meteorological factors the back trajectory analyses indicated that the vapor for the rain events with depleted stable isotopic contents which occurred on 06 13 and 21 august were originated from the arabian sea see in supplementary material s7 this explains the lower d excess values of the rainwater which is due to the high rh over the arabian sea lone et al 2019 the convective processes and continental effect may also be responsible for the depletion of heavy isotopic content in precipitation which occurred during these days on 08 september convective process was prominent and the air masses were lifted upwards consequently the rain comes from high altitude clouds therefore their isotopic content was depleted however on 28 september there were multiple sources of vapor from the sub himalayan region and bay of bengal and the rainfall from these sources were having depleted isotopic content the monthly back trajectories analysis of air masses see in supplementary material s10 shows that the moisture from the continental areas were dominating in the region during july and therefore the isotopic values in the rain during july were comparatively enriched however in august majority of moisture was coming from the arabian sea and the contributions from the bay of bengal and inland areas were insignificant hence the isotopic value of precipitation was depleted during august the pattern of trajectories in september was distinct when compared to other months it was more or less in circular pattern and was originating from multiple locations hence the moisture recycling was prominent during this month which resulted in the relatively high values of d excess in precipitation in the absence of long term stable isotopic data of precipitation in this region the δ18o of shallow 20 80 m deep groundwater n 62 collected from the study area was used as a proxy for the long term average of δ18o of precipitation in order to evaluate the variability in the source of moisture for precipitation in the past the relatively enriched δ18o of groundwater compared to those of the present day precipitation and it s similarity with the δ18o data of port blair precipitation fig 4 may be an indication of the dominance of moisture from the bay of bengal in the past as the study area is located near to the bay of bengal continental effect 4 7 relationship between d excess of precipitation and local climate d excess is an important parameter that provides complementary information to those obtained from δ18o and δ2h values in precipitation it is strongly affected by rh temperature and wind speed over the moisture source regions as well as interaction or mixing of moisture along the air mass trajectory dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 other local processes such as moisture recycling and sub cloud evaporation of raindrops may also alter the d excess values hence it can be used as a tool for the refinement of atmospheric circulation merlivat and jouzel 1979 d excess along with ncep ncar reanalysis dataset was used to understand the origin and dynamics of the moisture over the indian subcontinent in general and rainfall sampling site in particular ncep ncar reanalysis dataset were used to calculate the wind vector and rh fields and their spatial variations over the entire region during the ism see in supplementary material s11 it is observed from the wind vector analysis that majority of the regional scale moisture was originating from both the arabian sea and the bay of bengal while majority of moisture at the sampling locations in a local scale was coming from the arabian sea the air mass trajectory model hysplit 4 0 used for identifying the origin of the moisture was also showing that the arabian sea was the dominant supplier of moisture to the study area this is also reflected by the lower d excess values of precipitation liu et al 2008 and chakraborty et al 2016 also reported that the lower d excess value in rainfall is related to warm and humid moisture transport from the indian ocean the spatial distribution of rh shows that it was high over the arabian sea bay of bengal at the sampling locations and almost entire india during the ism period see in supplementary material s11 the relationship between rh and d excess values was studied to understand the effect of rh on rainwater evaporation i e secondary evaporation generally the evaporation of rain droplets shows an inverse correlation between δ18o and d excess a poor correlation r2 0 001 is observed between δ18o and d excess of precipitation in the study area this is because of higher relative humidity see in supplementary material s3 and lower wind speed mean 4 7 km hr at the sampling locations normally strong winds and lower rh favors raindrop evaporation hence δ18o and d excess would show strong inverse correlation chakraborty et al 2016 also a poor inverse correlation r 2 0 12 is observed between d excess and rh this clearly shows that secondary or sub cloud evaporation is not prominent in the region however it indicate that large scale processes such as convection origin of air masses and continental recycling and air mass trajectories determine the isotopic evolution of rainwater 5 conclusions the factors controlling the isotopic composition of precipitation during the ism in the drying region of eastern part of india were investigated using isotopic analysis of precipitation and hydrometrological data based on the analyses of δ18o δ2h and d excess values of precipitation along with air mass backward trajectory modelling and atmospheric circulation patterns associated with rainfall in the region valuable information on the origin of atmospheric moisture for precipitation during the ism were obtained controls of large scale atmospheric circulation and local hydrometeorological conditions in evolving the stable isotopic signatures of precipitation were evaluated the statistical relationships of stable isotopic content of precipitation with temperature amount of rainfall relative humidity were studied outgoing longwave radiation olr data from noaa satellites were also used to evaluate the effect of convective activities on stable isotopic content of precipitation in the region it is observed that the temperature effect and amount effect in stable isotopic composition of individual precipitation events occurring in the region were weak this shows that the local hydrometrological parameters play an insignificant role in determining the isotopic content of precipitation however it is deduced that stable isotopic signature of precipitation in this region is controlled by the large scale convective activity this is further confirmed based on the analyses of spatial pattern of clouds using olr data it is found that the intense cloud activity its large spatial extent as well as the convergence of highly moist air might be responsible for the observed relatively high depletion of stable isotopic content of precipitation in the region analysis of backward trajectories of the air mass vertical wind velocity and olr proxies for convective processes indicates intense convection and moisture convergence in the eastern india the local meteoric water line and the temporal variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation provide insight into the climatological and hydrological regime of the eastern india during the ism the air mass trajectory modelling cluster analysis of back trajectories atmospheric circulation pattern and the lower d excess values suggest that the source of moisture for the precipitation is predominantly originated from the arabian sea rather than the bay of bengal although the

5603,the eastern part of india experiences a rapid reduction in rainfall in the past 20 years 1997 2017 which has several implications to the livelihood of the people and the ecosystems of the region stable isotopic analysis of precipitation along with extensive backward trajectory modelling was conducted in this drying region to understand the factors controlling the stable isotopic composition of precipitation and source and origin of atmospheric moisture for precipitation during the indian summer monsoon ism the drivers responsible for the isotopic variations in precipitation were evaluated using their statistical relations with temperature amount of rainfall and relative humidity rh additionally outgoing longwave radiation olr data from noaa satellites were used to evaluate the effect of convective activities on isotopic variations in precipitation the pathways of moisture transport for each rain event were derived using backward trajectory model hysplit4 0 based on ncep data and the atmospheric circulation patterns were evaluated using ncar reanalysis data major sources of moisture causing rainfall during the ism period in the drying region were evaluated using cluster analysis of the backward wind trajectories the isotopic content in precipitation showed a weak temperature and amount effects however a moderate correlation was observed with relative humidity of the region it is inferred that the relatively high isotopic depletion observed in the monsoon rains was not related to the amount of rainfall but rather to large scale convective processes it is found that the rainwater isotopic content during the ism appears to be controlled by the dynamics of moisture rather than the hydrometeorological conditions of the individual precipitation events a local meteoric water line δ2h 7 86 δ18o 8 81 was developed for eastern india using the isotopic data of rainwater samples backward air mass trajectory modelling cluster analysis of wind trajectories atmospheric circulation patterns and lower d excess suggest that the origin of moisture in the drying region of eastern india was predominantly from the arabian sea and the contribution from the bay of bengal was insignificant keywords precipitation stable isotope indian summer monsoon hysplit convective processes eastern india 1 introduction the indian summer monsoon ism is the most important and energetic component of the indian sub continent s climate system it starts due to the development of the cross equatorial low level jet and serves as a primary conduit for the transportation of moisture across the indian ocean and the arabian sea onto the indian sub continent joseph and sijikumar 2004 the warming of the indian sub continent relative to the indian ocean creates a low pressure over asia that pulls moisture from the indian ocean the arabian sea and the bay of bengal are the two major sources of moisture for the ism identification of leading moisture sources is important for understanding the climate dynamics of the indian sub continent the back trajectories analysis along with the use of environmental stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o of precipitation gives valuable information about the moisture sources and atmospheric circulation patterns that give rise to the rainfall and is an effective means for investigating complex hydrological processes dutton et al 2005

evaporation and residence time of atmospheric moisture craig 1961 aggarwal et al 2004 deshpande et al 2010 risi et al 2010 aggarwal et al 2012 yu et al 2017 hence stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h in precipitation are extremely sensitive to climate changes additionally these isotopes also record the essential information about the evolution of the hydrological cycle eg paleoclimatic conditions the precipitation is an important part of the hydrological cycle of a region and a minor isotopic variation in it may reflect on the isotopic composition of various components of the water cycle hence stable isotopic composition of precipitation is an important tool for evaluating regional climate change and the associated hydrological processes numerous research conducted in the recent past have well established the stable isotopic characteristics of precipitation such as altitude effect amount effect seasonal effect temperature effect continental effect etc jouzel and merlivat 1984 kohn and welker 2005 kumar et al 2010a b aggarwal et al 2016 noble and ansari 2019 a number of studies show that the isotopic composition of precipitation can provide in depth knowledge on the meteorological and hydrological condition of a region schmidt et al 2005 ansari et al 2018 raymo et al 2018 lone et al 2019 δ18o and δ2h content of rain water shows a distinct empirical relationship described by the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 as the majority of δ2h and δ18o values of precipitation fall close to this line this relation was first established by craig 1961 comparing the isotope data of precipitation of a region with the gmwl helps to understand the precipitation pathways of the region however several effects such as source water evaporation and moisture re cycling can lead to deviations of rainwater isotopes of a given location from the gmwl breitenbach et al 2010 hence δ18o δ2h relationship need to be described locally by a local meteoric water line lmwl dansgaard 1964 further described the δ18o and δ2h relationship by another parameter namely deuterium excess d excess and defined as 1 d excess δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o the deuterium excess is used as a measure for kinetic fractionation occurring under non equilibrium conditions such as evaporation above the sea surface pfahl and sodemann 2014 and it depends on climatic conditions in the source region such as relative humidity temperature and wind speed although it is also affected by local processes risi et al 2008 it can also be used for the identification of vapor sources and moisture recycling over the continents gat 2000 and the sea surface temperature that cannot be obtained from δ18o or δ2h alone cappa et al 2003 pfahl and sodemann 2014 rahul et al 2018 during evaporation in dry climatic conditions the kinetic fractionation becomes stronger and thereby the residual water has low d excess whereas the resultant vapour has high d excess values and precipitation from such a vapor also has high d excess clark and fritz 1997 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 during light precipitation events falling raindrops undergo evaporation which results in lower d excess in precipitation samples gupta and deshpande 2005 therefore deuterium excess in the precipitation has shown specific potential in climate studies for tracing the evaporation and precipitation processes froehlich et al 2002 the average d excess of precipitation is about 10 on the global scale dansgaard 1964 balagizi et al 2018 the study areas of this research are located in the eastern part of india near to the bay of bengal fig 1 during the past century 1901 2012 eastern india has witnessed a weakening of the ism rainfall guhathakurta and rajeevan 2008 with a reduction of about 10 to 20 roxy et al 2015 however a rapid reduction in rainfall has been observed in the past 20 years i e from 1997 to 2017 data source indian water portal and noaa fig 2 for instance in 2003 the region experienced more than 1794 mm of rain while the rainfall was only 989 mm in 2017 over this period there was a reduction of about 34 5 mm per year in rainfall in this drying region of eastern india which indicated that it is turning to a drought prone area this has caused several social and economical consequences as the majority of the agricultural activity in the region is rain fed roxy et al 2015 observed that rapid warming of western part of the indian ocean along with the warming of the indian sub continent has weakened the land sea thermal gradient which consequently dampens the monsoonal hadley circulation and thereby reducing the precipitation over the region however paul et al 2016 opined that this reduction in ism rainfall is because of the large scale changes in land use and land cover pattern in the east central region of india this paper evaluates the stable isotope δ18o δ2h and d excess variability in rainfall and their relationships with hydrometeorological conditions in the drying region of a part of eastern india additionally the dominant sources of moisture causing the rainfall and moisture transport processes over the drying region during the ism were evaluated 2 location and climatic condition the study areas are situated about 150 200 km away from the bay of bengal and far away from the arabian sea about 1400 1500 km and experience a tropical monsoon climate with a mild winter and hot summer fig 1 the average summer temperature goes up to 40 c and in winter it goes down to 14 c the relative humidity during the ism varies from 83 5 to 98 9 wind velocity is low to moderate with slight increase in speed during summer and monsoon months during the ism the wind velocity ranges from 0 6 to 13 7 km h the mean annual wind speed is 6 8 km h during the investigation period in 2016 the region experienced only 70 days of rainfall in the three months period i e from july to september and the daily average rainfall ranged from 0 5 to 106 mm majority of the rainfall event days 50 had below 10 mm rainfall and it was more than 50 mm only on a few occasions 6 days see in supplementary material s1 there was no rainfall in the study area during the month of june 3 methodology 3 1 daily rainwater sampling and isotopic analysis daily rainwater samples and hydrometeorological parameters were collected from the two different locations viz rgs 1 60 m amsl and rgs 2 62 m amsl of the study area during the ism period june to september for isotopic analysis fig 1 total of 102 numbers of rainwater samples were collected using rain sampling device installed at two different locations the rain collection setup consists of a a plastic container volume 5 l fitted with a funnel having a plastic tube which extended up to the bottom of the container and a long narrow tube length 6 m and diameter 1 cm attached at the top to equalise the pressure groning et al 2012 at the end of each rain event the samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles 30 ml and analyzed for environmental isotopes δ2h and δ18o using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime 100 the co2 h2o equilibration method was used for δ18o measurement epstein and mayeda 1953 while δ2h was measured using pyrolysis method in elemental analyzer coupled to the isotope ratio mass spectrometer the results are reported in the standard δ notation craig 1961 and defined in relation to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow as given by the following equation 2 δ 2 h or δ 18 o r sample r standard r standard 10 3 where rsample represents the isotope ratio of a sample 2h 1h and 18o 16o and r standard represents the corresponding ratio in a standard clark and fritz 1997 the δ values are expressed in parts per thousand permil the precision of measurement of δ2h is 0 5 and that of δ18o is 0 2 at 1σ criterion 3 2 backward trajectory modelling hysplit and cluster analyses lagrangian wind trajectory analyses were performed to understand the source and origin of moisture for precipitation occurring in the study site and compared the same with the stable isotopic content of rainwater using the framework of the hybrid single particles lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit4 0 model provided by noaa http ready arl noaa gov hysplit php and global reanalysis datasets from the national centre for environmental prediction ncep the air mass trajectories for 48 h before the precipitation event were simulated the height of the initiation of each trajectory was selected as 500 1000 and 2000 m above ground level agl because 70 of the total rainfall occurring in the region during the ism is contributed by stratiform low level clouds and their height cloud base generally varies from 1000 to 2000 m agl aggarwal et al 2004 daily back trajectories of air masses were calculated for the ism period july september and cluster analysis was further applied to group these back trajectories according to their direction speed the separation for the same was done based on their centroids length cluster mean trajectories to identify the dominant source of moisture coming to the region the changes in rh of the air parcel along the trajectory path were evaluated to understand the precipitation and evaporation processes additionally large scale circulation patterns showing the relative humidity and wind vector fields were derived from ncar reanalysis data http www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded reanalysis 3 3 outgoing longwave radiation olr analysis the spatial pattern of monthly mean outgoing longwave radiation olr data for july august and september for the 0 30 n 50 120 e sector from noaa satellite were used as proxies of convection patterns the olr data was used for understanding the cloudiness and rainfall originating from deep circulation over the tropics as it is negatively correlated with the intensity of convection risi et al 2008 guo et al 2017 lower the olr value the deeper will be the convective cloud 4 results and discussion 4 1 variation of stable isotopic compositions in rainwater the daily δ18o and δ2h data of rainwater collected at the two stations rgs 1 and rgs 2 are shown in the supplementary material s2 and s12 it is seen that during the study period july to september the δ18o values of rainwater ranged from 11 2 to 5 2 while the δ2h values ranged from 83 8 to 35 7 the trend of stable isotopic variability during the ism period is presented as the weekly weighted δ18o and δ2h of two stations in fig 3 the enriched isotopic values were found in the beginning of july and depleted values were found from the end of july till september overall the isotopic values were found to be enriched during the onset of ism and comparatively depleted during the late monsoon period august september this typical distribution of isotopic content in rainwater during the ism is not restricted to the present study site but it is also observed over the entire indian sub continent viz new delhi bhattacharya et al 2003 ahmedabad western india deshpande et al 2010 and andaman islands bay of bengal chakeraborty et al 2016 the depletion in isotopic content during the mid and recession periods of ism is a regional phenomenon and is not because of the local effects a possible reason for this isotopic depletion is explained below the air above the land surface is generally saturated with the water during the monsoon period water is available everywhere on the surface rivers lakes reservoirs agriculture lands wetlands soil etc over the large part of the indian sub continent consequently the lower atmosphere over the region is filled with large amount of water vapor loaded with moisture gadgil 2003 this results in an unstable air column and consequently increases the convergence in the monsoonal current and its speed so the probability of convective activities increases and the rainfall is caused by vertical uplifting and cooling of moist air masses as the monsoon progresses this dynamic and mechanical uplifting of air masses increases and it could cause depletion in isotopic content of daily rainfall during the recession of ism jeelani et al 2018 the d excess of rainwater fluctuates largely during the monsoon and varied from 2 2 to 8 1 which is lower than the average global value 10 implying high humid air masses over the oceanic source region and convection along the trajectory it was observed that the relatively higher d excess values are found in the beginning of july and slightly lower values are observed from end of july to august and early september overall the d excess was higher during the onset and receding period of ism this variation of d excess may be due to the monsoonal break high rh intensive convective activity and changes in moisture source marine and continental 4 2 local meteoric water line lmwl the regression line between δ18o and δ2h of meteoric water for a region is generally termed as local meteoric water line lmwl it reflects the hydrometeorological and natural geographical condition of that region and thus can be used to study the climate change kumar et al 2010a reported the meteoric water line for india 3 δ 2 h 7 93 δ 18 o 9 94 based on the δ18o and δ2h values of rainwater collected from the study area and those reported from a nearby location namely kolkata 150 km away by sinha et al 2019 a local meteoric water line lmwl for the east india was developed using the least square fitting method which is described as 4 δ 2 h 7 86 δ 18 o 8 81 r 2 0 96 n 146 it is compared with the lmwl of another station in the region namely thailand eastern part of bay of bengal wei et al 2018 and port blair sinha et al 2019 the equation to the lmwl of thailand is given by 5 δ 2 h 8 0 δ 18 o 9 4 and for port blair is given by 6 δ 2 h 7 7 δ 18 o 8 83 it is seen that the slope and y intercept of the lmwl developed in the present study are more or less similar to that of thailand and port blair also it has almost similar slope compared to that of the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 fig 4 the slope of the lmwl is also similar to that of indian meteoric water line imwl developed by kumar et al 2010a however y intercept is slightly lower normally lower slope and y intercept of the lmwl for any region is due to secondary sub cloud evaporation which is the evaporation of rain droplets after condensation clark and fritz 1997 in our case the slope of the lmwl was almost similar to that of gmwl slope which suggests that secondary evaporation is not prominent at this site plata 1994 jeelani et al 2018 and lone et al 2019 have observed that decrease in rainfall increase in air temperature decrease in vapor pressure and lower relative humidity would reduce the slope and y intercept this is mainly due to the isotopic fractionation triggered by secondary evaporation during the descent of raindrops but in our study site rh was relatively high from lower level of the atmosphere to higher level up to cloud base see in supplementary material s3 wind speed was low mean 4 7 km h air temperature was low and convective activity was more prominent during most of the rain events in the ism period hence slope was not much affected the slight deviation of intercept compared to the gmwl may be due to the high rh in the moisture source area datta et al 1991 and changes in the sources of moisture lmwl is found to be parallel to the gmwl and placed to the right hand side of it fig 4 suggesting a humid climate at the moisture source region physical factors such as temperature relative humidity air circulation and intensity of rainfall influences the isotopic composition of rainwater and therefore the influence of these parameters on the isotopic content of rainwater were evaluated and discussed in the succeeding section 4 3 local hydrometeorological influence in our investigation the temporal relationship between δ18o values of rainwater and the average temperature were evaluated fig 3 the result shows that the temperature was fluctuating with time however the δ18o was more or less constant during the ism period july to september hence on a daily scale no clear correlation was observed between them to understand it in a better way a pearson correlation analysis was performed between δ18o values of precipitation and average daily temperatures and the results show an overall weak positive correlation fig 5 furthermore the amount effect in the study site was evaluated and it is observed that the amount of rainfall was randomly varying during ism but the isotopic content of rainwater was more or less constant fig 3 the pearson correlation analysis between the δ18o values of rainwater and the amount of rainfall also shows a poor correlation fig 5 in order to determine the influence of rh on δ18o of the precipitation a time series plot and pearson correlation analysis between δ18o values of precipitation and rh were performed fig 3 and fig 5 the results show that they are not closely correlated with each other from the above discussion it is inferred that the stable isotopic composition of precipitation in the study area is neither controlled by temperature nor by the amount of rainfall however a moderate correlation is observed between rh and the stable isotopic content of rainfall this corroborate our finding that the well established isotopic effects such as temperature effect and amount effect are not prominent in the indian subcontinent during the monsoon as reported by other researchers chakraborty et al 2016 he and richards 2016 jeelani et al 2018 4 4 relationships between convective processes olr and stable isotopic content in rainwater convective processes in the atmosphere can be thought as another factor that may influence the stable isotopic composition of precipitation occurring in the tropical regions gao et al 2013 guo et al 2017 olr data of the region was analysed to understand the role of convective processes in controlling the stable isotopic content of precipitation occurring in the study area since many years the satellite derived olr data are being used as a proxy for detecting the tropical deep convection matsumoto and murakami 2000 sandeep and stordal 2013 olr is the total amount of thermal radiation emitted from the earth to the interplanetary space lower value of olr near the low latitude regions indicates presence of high cirrus clouds as the radiation from the low temperature cloud top is weaker than that from the earth surface zhang 1993 the high cirrus clouds are produced by deep convection and can t persist in the long term without the convective processes matsumoto and murakami 2000 hence low olr is often used to identify tropical convection and the onset of monsoon precipitation susskind et al 2012 sandeep and stordal 2013 noaa interpolated olr data with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 source liebmann and smith 1996 was used to identify the extent of clouds and convective processes in the region olr values less than 240 w m2 and sea surface temperature 27 5 c are indicative of large scale convection gadgil 2003 sandeep and stordal 2013 convective activities are of two types the organized large scale widely triggered and the isolated small scale triggered locally stable isotopic composition of precipitation would be relatively more depleted in regional scale organized events than in local or isolated events risi et al 2008 the spatial pattern of monthly mean olr during the months of july august and september for the 0 30 n 50 120 e sector was analysed to understand the relationship between large scale organized convection and stable isotopic composition of precipitation see in supplementary material s4 the results show that the eastern and western parts of india as well as the bay of bengal were having lower olr value 210 w m2 in july it was observed that the olr value was spatially decreasing from southeast and from northwest direction during august the convective processes prevailed strongly over the bay of bengal and approximately 85 of the indian sub continent it gets weakened at northwestern part of india during september 250 w m2 however in eastern india i e the study site it was still prominent 230 w m2 comparison of the spatial pattern of olr data for july august and september indicated a notable decrease in olr during july and august only therefore it can be deduced that more intensive monsoonal convection occurred along the trajectories that originated from the arabian sea and inland areas a good correlation between stable isotopic composition of rainwater and convective processes using olr as a proxy was observed by many researchers risi et al 2008 lekshmy et al 2014 guo et al 2017 lekshmy et al 2014 opined that the presence of large scale cloud bands i e convective processes during ism causes stable isotopic depletion in the ism rains hence it is felt that convection can be one of the major processes that bring variation in stable isotopic composition of precipitation occurring in the tropical regions in the present study the relationship between the stable isotopic content of rainwater and olr data was examined and it is seen that during intensive monsoon convection i e olr 220 w m2 the stable isotopic δ18o content of rainwater was depleted and remained almost constant although there was a large variation in daily rainfall 1 8 to 106 mm during this period this indicates that the isotopic depletion was caused by convective processes rather than the amount of rainfall the pearson correlation plot also shows a good positive correlation between the stable isotopic composition of rainwater and convective processes i e olr fig 5 hovmoller diagram i e latitude versus time plot of olr averaged over 70 100 e shows anomaly in the olr data during the ism period and it is used to evaluate the role of convective activities in fractionating the stable isotopes of precipitation see in supplementary material s5 it is observed that on 26 july there was a large scale intensive convective activity olr 180 w m2 in the region which persisted until 08 september and then weakened thereafter most of the depleted stable isotopic values are observed only during this period it was also seen that rh was more than 94 and intensity of rainfall varied largely during this period normally strong and intensive convection occurs with strong mid tropospheric convergence of moist air and therefore the vertical velocity can also be used as a proxy for the convective activities lekshmy et al 2014 observed that upward moving air masses cause lower δ18o while downward or horizontal wind motion causes higher δ18o during the ism from the back trajectory analysis it is observed that upward moving air masses during 26 july 13 august 08 28 september had lower δ values whereas downward and horizontal moving air masses during 13 17 july had higher δ values see in supplementary material s6 it is also seen that altitude of the trajectory for the upward moving air masses was below 1 5 km and this allowed the air parcel to pick up additional moisture from the sub cloud layer before uplifting over the study site 4 5 moisture sources analysis the air masses are responsible for the transport of moisture dispersion and accumulation of aerosols therefore a backward trajectory model hysplit draxler and rolph 2014 was used to evaluate the pathway and origin of air masses to the study area from the back trajectory analysis see in supplementary material s7 it was found that the pattern of trajectories on 13 21 august was identical for the altitude of 1000 m and 2000 m agl however minor deviations are noticed in the lower altitude trajectory 500 m agl when compared to the higher altitude trajectory which may be because of the influence of surface topography during the rest of the rain events the trajectories of 500 m 1000 m and 2000 m agl altitude behave differently the results of back trajectory analysis indicated two possible vapor source regions one from the arabian sea and another from the inland areas the moisture source for rain during 07 13 july was coming from the inland areas of central india whereas it originated from the arabian sea for the rain events on 06 13 21 august the trajectory pattern on 08 september behaved differently and was in circular pattern when compared to the other days indicating upward lifting of air masses hence the rainfall on 08 september might be caused by high altitude clouds the back trajectory for the rain event on 28 september showed multiple sources of vapor some of the wind trajectories such as 500 1000 m agl were originated from the sub himalayas and 2000 m agl back trajectory was originated from a distant location i e bay of bengal additionally daily pattern of air masses trajectories during the ism period was evaluated to identify the dominant sources of moisture coming to the eastern india for this back trajectories of 48 h period were computed for each day during the monsoon for an altitude of 1500 m agl about 324 daily back trajectories were generated using hysplit and clustered using trajectory cluster analysis in the hysplit software the 324 trajectories were classified into four clusters according to the changes in total spatial variance tsv kumar et al 2011 see in supplementary material s8 the back trajectories of the centroid i e cluster mean trajectories and the frequency of their occurrence during the ism period is shown in fig 6 the results show that the trajectories of cluster ii and cluster iv were originating from the arabian sea and they together constitute 51 of the total back trajectories whereas the trajectories of cluster i was originating from the inland areas of central india and constitute 27 of the total back trajectories the cluster iii which constitute 21 of the total back trajectories were originating from both the bay of bengal and from inland areas the number of back trajectories in each cluster and their pattern of occurrence are shown in fig 7 from the pattern and number of trajectories in each cluster it is observed that the dominant trajectories 168 during the ism period were those originating from the arabian sea only 89 trajectories were coming from the inland areas of central india and 67 were from the bay of bengal and inland areas of eastern india cluster analysis of back trajectories clearly shows that the contribution of moisture from the arabian sea was maximum in the region while it was minimal from the bay of bengal although the study area is located near to the bay of bengal contributions of moisture from the continental and local areas are not prominent the rh along the trajectories for the rainfall days on 13 17 july showed that air masses brought moderate amount of moisture rh 55 to 80 from the inland areas however on 13 21 august and 08 september the rh of the air mass along the trajectories were high rh 70 to 97 irrespective of the altitude of the trajectories it shows constant supply of moisture from the arabian sea and inland areas that cause copious amount of rainfall 106 mm on these days over eastern india see in supplementary material s9 4 6 relationships between moisture sources and isotopic values in rainwater the moisture sources and circulation of air masses influence the isotopic composition of rainwater aggarwal et al 2004 balagizi et al 2018 therefore the variability in δ18o and d excess were interpreted along with the back trajectories of the air masses for this back trajectory analyses were performed for the rainy days on which the isotopic value of rainwater was relatively enriched and for the days on which it was relatively depleted results show that the moisture for the rain event with relatively enriched stable isotopic values δ18o 5 2 d excess 5 9 that occurred on 13 17 july originated from the inland areas of central india the results of the back trajectory analyses explain the relatively higher d excess values as the moisture from the surface water bodies and soil of the local inland areas cause significant increase in the d excess values of precipitation rather than because of any other local meteorological factors the back trajectory analyses indicated that the vapor for the rain events with depleted stable isotopic contents which occurred on 06 13 and 21 august were originated from the arabian sea see in supplementary material s7 this explains the lower d excess values of the rainwater which is due to the high rh over the arabian sea lone et al 2019 the convective processes and continental effect may also be responsible for the depletion of heavy isotopic content in precipitation which occurred during these days on 08 september convective process was prominent and the air masses were lifted upwards consequently the rain comes from high altitude clouds therefore their isotopic content was depleted however on 28 september there were multiple sources of vapor from the sub himalayan region and bay of bengal and the rainfall from these sources were having depleted isotopic content the monthly back trajectories analysis of air masses see in supplementary material s10 shows that the moisture from the continental areas were dominating in the region during july and therefore the isotopic values in the rain during july were comparatively enriched however in august majority of moisture was coming from the arabian sea and the contributions from the bay of bengal and inland areas were insignificant hence the isotopic value of precipitation was depleted during august the pattern of trajectories in september was distinct when compared to other months it was more or less in circular pattern and was originating from multiple locations hence the moisture recycling was prominent during this month which resulted in the relatively high values of d excess in precipitation in the absence of long term stable isotopic data of precipitation in this region the δ18o of shallow 20 80 m deep groundwater n 62 collected from the study area was used as a proxy for the long term average of δ18o of precipitation in order to evaluate the variability in the source of moisture for precipitation in the past the relatively enriched δ18o of groundwater compared to those of the present day precipitation and it s similarity with the δ18o data of port blair precipitation fig 4 may be an indication of the dominance of moisture from the bay of bengal in the past as the study area is located near to the bay of bengal continental effect 4 7 relationship between d excess of precipitation and local climate d excess is an important parameter that provides complementary information to those obtained from δ18o and δ2h values in precipitation it is strongly affected by rh temperature and wind speed over the moisture source regions as well as interaction or mixing of moisture along the air mass trajectory dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 other local processes such as moisture recycling and sub cloud evaporation of raindrops may also alter the d excess values hence it can be used as a tool for the refinement of atmospheric circulation merlivat and jouzel 1979 d excess along with ncep ncar reanalysis dataset was used to understand the origin and dynamics of the moisture over the indian subcontinent in general and rainfall sampling site in particular ncep ncar reanalysis dataset were used to calculate the wind vector and rh fields and their spatial variations over the entire region during the ism see in supplementary material s11 it is observed from the wind vector analysis that majority of the regional scale moisture was originating from both the arabian sea and the bay of bengal while majority of moisture at the sampling locations in a local scale was coming from the arabian sea the air mass trajectory model hysplit 4 0 used for identifying the origin of the moisture was also showing that the arabian sea was the dominant supplier of moisture to the study area this is also reflected by the lower d excess values of precipitation liu et al 2008 and chakraborty et al 2016 also reported that the lower d excess value in rainfall is related to warm and humid moisture transport from the indian ocean the spatial distribution of rh shows that it was high over the arabian sea bay of bengal at the sampling locations and almost entire india during the ism period see in supplementary material s11 the relationship between rh and d excess values was studied to understand the effect of rh on rainwater evaporation i e secondary evaporation generally the evaporation of rain droplets shows an inverse correlation between δ18o and d excess a poor correlation r2 0 001 is observed between δ18o and d excess of precipitation in the study area this is because of higher relative humidity see in supplementary material s3 and lower wind speed mean 4 7 km hr at the sampling locations normally strong winds and lower rh favors raindrop evaporation hence δ18o and d excess would show strong inverse correlation chakraborty et al 2016 also a poor inverse correlation r 2 0 12 is observed between d excess and rh this clearly shows that secondary or sub cloud evaporation is not prominent in the region however it indicate that large scale processes such as convection origin of air masses and continental recycling and air mass trajectories determine the isotopic evolution of rainwater 5 conclusions the factors controlling the isotopic composition of precipitation during the ism in the drying region of eastern part of india were investigated using isotopic analysis of precipitation and hydrometrological data based on the analyses of δ18o δ2h and d excess values of precipitation along with air mass backward trajectory modelling and atmospheric circulation patterns associated with rainfall in the region valuable information on the origin of atmospheric moisture for precipitation during the ism were obtained controls of large scale atmospheric circulation and local hydrometeorological conditions in evolving the stable isotopic signatures of precipitation were evaluated the statistical relationships of stable isotopic content of precipitation with temperature amount of rainfall relative humidity were studied outgoing longwave radiation olr data from noaa satellites were also used to evaluate the effect of convective activities on stable isotopic content of precipitation in the region it is observed that the temperature effect and amount effect in stable isotopic composition of individual precipitation events occurring in the region were weak this shows that the local hydrometrological parameters play an insignificant role in determining the isotopic content of precipitation however it is deduced that stable isotopic signature of precipitation in this region is controlled by the large scale convective activity this is further confirmed based on the analyses of spatial pattern of clouds using olr data it is found that the intense cloud activity its large spatial extent as well as the convergence of highly moist air might be responsible for the observed relatively high depletion of stable isotopic content of precipitation in the region analysis of backward trajectories of the air mass vertical wind velocity and olr proxies for convective processes indicates intense convection and moisture convergence in the eastern india the local meteoric water line and the temporal variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation provide insight into the climatological and hydrological regime of the eastern india during the ism the air mass trajectory modelling cluster analysis of back trajectories atmospheric circulation pattern and the lower d excess values suggest that the source of moisture for the precipitation is predominantly originated from the arabian sea rather than the bay of bengal although the

human impact this paper shows the importance of regional division based on the knowledge of geology hydrogeology and anthropogenic activities on the assessment of nbls in the study the guanzhong basin situated in central china with an area of 20 035 km2 was divided into ten groundwater environmental units geus based on hydrogeological structures and groundwater flow systems a total of 509 shallow groundwater samples were collected throughout the basin based on samples from each geu nbls of na ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl f cr6 th and tds were evaluated by using iterative 2 δ technique 2 δ calculated distribution function cdf and grubbs test the results indicate the distinct characteristics of nbls for the various geus nbls of na so4 2 cl hco3 f and tds north of the wei river obviously exceeded those in the south nbls of most ions for geu v and geu x were highest north and south of the wei river respectively through detailed analyses of the natural and anthropogenic influences on nbls we found that the outcrops of tertiary rocks in the li mountains determine the highest nbls of chemical components for geu x south of the wei river long term irrigation is responsible for the highest nbls of tds na mg2 hco3 so4 2 and cl for geu v rapid urbanization in xi an geu viii slows down the accumulation of chemical components e g tds in shallow groundwater by reducing evaporation and mixing of shallow water with deep water through ground fissures assessment of nbls on a regional scale lays the basis for identification of groundwater pollution and is helpful for the reasonable management and effective protection of groundwater resources keywords natural background level iterative 2 δ technique calculated distribution function grubbs test guanzhong basin regional scale 1 introduction groundwater accounting for one third of fresh withdrawals in the world falkenmark 2005 li et al 2018a wang et al 2018 is the primary source for drinking water in some cities and spacious rural areas koh et al 2009 sufficient and safe water resources are indispensable for human life however rapid economic development in recent decades not only consumed large amounts of water but also generated huge amounts of pollution falkenmark 2005 with an eye towards alleviating ground water crises interest has gradually focused on groundwater quality problems especially trends in groundwater pollution and changes in groundwater quality the eu water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec stressed the need for member states to identify significant and sustained upward trends of contaminant concentrations to determine the starting points for reversing these trends knowledge of natural background levels nbls of ions contained in groundwater is a prerequisite for identifying trends in drinking water contamination by anthropogenic sources and for proposing reasonable countermeasures for water protection gunnarsdottir et al 2015 gao et al 2019 in this context the assessment of nbls for chemical components is of practical significance background level is defined as the concentration of a hazardous substance that provides a defensible reference point that can be used to evaluate whether or not a release from the site has occurred usepa 1995 natural background level nbl for groundwater is defined by edmunds et al 2003 as the concentration of a given element species or chemical substance present in solution which is derived from natural geogenic biological or atmospheric sources however it is argued that such pristine nbls no longer exist due to frequent and intense human activities mikkonen et al 2018b sellerino et al 2019 groundwaters in highly urbanized and irrigation intensive areas are particularly impacted by long term anthropogenic influence due to pollution from agricultural practices and wastewaters de caro et al 2017 moreover insufficient groundwater quality surveys or incomplete missing historical records makes it extremely difficult to directly evaluate local nbls free from human influence in 1993 the term geochemical baseline was officially introduced in the context of the international geological correlation programme igcp 360 project global geochemical baselines nakic et al 2007 salminen and tarvainen 1997 this term was used to describe a no longer pristine natural background or a modified background in an area due to human activities ducci et al 2016 reimann and garrett 2005 afterward nbl is considered as an indicator or a synonym for a geochemical baseline to describe natural variations in component concentrations in the surficial environment bech et al 2005 elvira hernández garcía and custodio 2004 nakic et al 2007 salminen and tarvainen 1997 generally nbl of a certain element is incorrectly evaluated as a unique value matschullat et al 2000 nakic et al 2007 by definition natural geogenic hydrological biological and atmospheric processes affect nbl assessment in fact water chemistry changes from the moment water comes into contact with rocks and enters the groundwater flow system through rainfall surface water sewage or other sources until it leaves through runoff evaporation or withdrawal de caro et al 2017 vázquez suñé et al 2004 therefore chemical components in groundwater are determined by both natural factors lithology precipitation evaporation and runoff and anthropogenic factors sewage pumping irrigation or other activities the spatial variability of these factors as well as the migration of chemical components can lead to regional groundwater variances thus it is more realistic to regard groundwater nbl as a range rather than an absolute value nakic et al 2007 moreover nbl of groundwater should be evaluated regionally by considering the corresponding characteristics of a particular region e g geology and hydrogeology to reflect the local variation of environmental conditions the technical problems associated with the assessment of nbl can ultimately be attributed to how to separate relatively pristine samples with samples significantly influenced by human activities beygi and jalali 2018 biddau et al 2017 cruz and andrade 2015 statistical methods can derive nbl effectively based on monitoring data these methods generally include both non parameter and parameter approaches de caro et al 2017 the former determines nbl by identifying a fixed percentile value 90th 95th or 97th of data distribution such as relative cumulative frequency analysis matschullat et al 2000 or pre selection ps approach ducci et al 2016 parrone et al 2019 the ps approach subjectively excludes anthropogenic data from data set by using some special chemical indicators such as cl so4 2 no2 no3 or some toxicological index the residual data represents samples with little or no influence by human activities the nbl is determined by distribution of the residual data ducci et al 2016 ducci and sellerino 2012 preziosi et al 2014 wendland et al 2008 this approach requires expert knowledge about the geochemical behavior under the prevailing environmental conditions and generally addresses a fixed value without consideration of natural variability matschullat et al 2000 different from non parameter approaches most parameter approaches evaluate nbl under the assumption that the data distribution obeys a normal or log normal distribution such as 4δ outlier test 2 δ or cdf these approaches obtain a clean data collection through detecting and eliminating the positive anomalies which disturb the normal data distribution different confidence intervals of the normal or log normal distribution e g 95 confidence interval or mean 2δ are evaluated as the nbl gałuszka 2006 matschullat et al 2000 nakic et al 2007 however due to the homogenized variance in the 4δ outlier test very few samples are eliminated resulting in an overestimation of natural background upper limits according to research on the applicability of those three approaches 4δ outlier test 2 δ and cdf conducted by matschullat et al 2000 both 2 δ and cdf present more realistic data for natural backgrounds in different data sets however successful application of both methods 2 δ and cdf requires a relatively large data set n 30 for smaller data sets n 30 grubbs test is usually applied to discard abnormal values based on data distribution the objective of this study is to regionally evaluate nbls of major groundwater ions in a large basin guanzhong basin china we accomplish this objective by using 2 δ cdf and grubbs test to obtain reliable ranges for natural background levels of groundwater ions in various regions because groundwater flow systems comprehensively reflect hydrogeological and atmospheric processes and are crucial to groundwater chemistry the basin was divided into several units based on groundwater flow systems and hydrogeological structures the nbls for each unit were evaluated and factors determining regional variations are discussed in detail to the best of our knowledge this study is the first assessment for nbls on a regional scale based on groundwater flow systems in a large basin the paper provides a comprehensive understanding of nbls as well as their influencing factors in the guanzhong basin china 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the guanzhong basin is one of the larger basins in the yellow river catchment with an area of 20 035 km2 it stretches from baoji in the west to the yellow river in the east and borders the qinling mountains in the south and bei mountains in the north the area is dominated by a warm sub humid continental climate with an average annual evaporation of 900 1200 mm a and an average annual precipitation of 543 6 863 0 mm a wu et al 2017 the aridity index the ratio of evaporation and precipitation in the basin is higher than 1 25 so it is a typical semi arid area the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river traverses the center of the guanzhong basin from west to east the topography of the basin is high in the west low in the east and shows the ladder like distribution from the mountains to the wei river which turns from floodplains to loess tablelands and river terraces wang et al 2018 geologically guanzhong basin is a typical cenozoic faulted basin formed by the joint action of deep formation uprising and region extension during the archean proterozoic period due to the frequent tectonic activity guanzhong basin had experienced long term evolutionary processes of cracking and splicing and formed several faults in ew ne and nw directions during the proterozoic period areas located in the south of weihe fault kept in the state of uplift and denudation for a long time meanwhile areas located in the north of weihe fault depressed and occurred transgression resulting in extremely thick clastic and carbonate formation of the cambrian ordovician until the period of hercynian indo china and yanshan movement due to the strong tectonic and magmatic activity the qinling mountains and beishan mountains rose successively forming a near east west compression zone and depression in the guanzhong area during the early tertiary period the neotectonic activities of the weihe graben continuously strengthened and the range gradually expanded due to the differential vertical movement of deep and large faults in each stage the uplift and sag with great height difference were formed which controlled the range and thickness of the sedimentary deposits of the cenozoic in the basin the cenozoic with a maximum thickness of 7000 m in guanzhong basin is still in a state of continuous extension settlement and deposition the overlying loose quaternary deposits with thickness more than 1000 m are widely distributed in the guanzhong basin and formed the main aquifers the high permeability of these deposits and the low lying terrain are beneficial for the accumulation and transportation of groundwater hydrogeologically according to the burial characteristics aquifers in the guanzhong basin can be divided into phreatic aquifers shallow confined aquifers and deep confined aquifers based on aquifer characteristics phreatic water which exists between 1 and 100 m includes pore water in the interbedding of diluvial boulder gravel and silty clay pore water in alluvial gravel and pebble stratum and eolian loess pore fissure water pore water in alluvial plain with shallow water table level 2 30 m is mainly distributed in the river terraces of wei river or its large tributaries pore water in diluvial plain or fan with slightly deep groundwater levels 5 40 m is mainly distributed in the piedmont zone of qinling mountains and beishan mountain around the edge of basin however due to the fine grain of sediment the large amount of mud and thick clay in diluvial fan of beishan mountains the water abundance is relatively poorer in north of wei river than in south of wei river pore fissure water in loess is mainly distributed in the loess plateau and high terraces and its water table level is buried deeply 20 80 m the phreatic water flows from the qinling and bei mountains to the center of the basin following the local topography fig 1 a and b rainfall infiltration from irrigation leakage of rivers and the lateral flow from the mountains recharge the groundwater runoff evaporation and artificial exploitation are the main ways of discharge the main cities in the guanzhong basin include xi an xianyang weinan and baoji fig 1b xi an located in the center of the basin is the capital of shaanxi province and the largest city in northwest china with a population more than 10 million people the population density of xi an city is 31 190 per square kilometer which is the largest density in the basin and the entire shaanxi province this density is due to rapid economic development and urbanization in xi an the region located north of the wei river and east of the jing river mainly consists of irrigation districts namely the jinghuiqu and jiaokou irrigation districts fig 1b the jinghuiqu irrigation district is a historical area irrigated with surface water for more than 2250 years liu et al 2012 2013 2 2 division of the groundwater environmental units geus groundwater environmental unit geu refers to an area with the same or similar environmental factors at a certain time and within a certain region rational division of geus is crucial for figuring out the characteristics and objective law of nbls the guanzhong basin sandwiched between the northern shaanxi plateau and qinling mountains is a faulted zone formed during the himalayan movement it is bordered by mountains in the north south and west although the hydraulic connection between mountains and the basin is weak there is groundwater flowing into the basin so these borders north south and west can be treated as given flux boundary wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2005 the yellow river which flows from north to south is located along the eastern border of the basin and can be generalized as a discharge boundary the wei river which runs through the basin from west to east can be regarded as discharge boundary in the interior of the basin therefore the whole basin acts as an independent and integrated groundwater aquifer system based on aquifer media zhang et al 2005 further partitioned the groundwater aquifer system of the guanzhong basin into five subsystems porous fractured aquifer system at the loess table porous aquifer system in the alluvial plain porous aquifer system at the pluvial fan of the mountains karst water system north of the wei river and the bedrock fractured aquifer system because the object of this study is shallow groundwater the division of the geus is only done for the phreatic water in the basin groundwater flow system as an ideal tool to study the spatiotemporal evolution of water quality zhang et al 2011 is a comprehensive embodiment of geology hydrogeology landform and atmospheric conditions due to the separation of the wei river jing river qishui river ba river as well as chan river there are weak hydraulic connections in shallow groundwater between the banks of these rivers as shown by the contours of the water table in fig 1 therefore based on the divisions proposed by zhang et al 2005 and in full consideration of new needs e g the continuity of the groundwater flow system for nbl assessment we divided the basin into ten groundwater environmental units geus as shown in fig 2 6 geus i to vi are in the north of the wei river and the other 4 geus vii to x are in the south of the wei river overall the divided geus of the guanzhong basin have an integrated hydrogeological structure and a relatively independent aquifer flow system 2 3 data data set 509 samples in total for evaluating nbls in guanzhong basin were obtained from hydrogeochemical surveys carried out by chang an university from 2016 to 2018 all samples were collected from 509 separate wells sample collection storage transport and analysis were all undertaken with strict adherence to the standard methods ministry of health of prc standardization administration of prc 2006 to ensure data quality chen et al 2020 groundwater samples were collected and stored in polyethylene bottles 2 5 l after pumping for 10 15 min temperature ph and ec were measured on site using a portable multi parameter water quality meter samples were stored at 4 c until analyses were conducted major ions na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 minor elements f cr6 total dissolved solid tds and total hardness th were analyzed in the laboratory of the shaanxi bureau of geology and mineral charge balance error cbe was calculated to ensure the accuracy and reliability of groundwater chemical analysis chen et al 2019 li et al 2018c results for all samples recorded cbe 5 indicating results from all analyses were accurate and reliable 2 4 methodology for assessing nbls the 2 δ and cdf which belong to model based objective methods define the background and threshold values by processing the data i e removing outliers until a normal distribution is obtained nakic et al 2007 the data removed represents contaminated groundwater or non background values data that remained in the normal distribution represents background values for large datasets n 30 2 δ and cdf were used to calculate geochemical background levels of chemical parameters both methods remove outlier data until a normal distribution is obtained and then the fit of background data to a normal distribution is tested by lilliefors test lilliefors 1967 only the remained data background data passed lilliefors test was used to assess the nbls if background data obtained by 2 δ and cdf both obey a normal distribution the data with a smaller variation coefficient is used to assess the background ranges calculation methods are reviewed in detail by nakic et al 2007 a visual basic macro background developed by nakic et al 2007 was applied to automatically process geochemical data and generate the background ranges for chemical parameters fig 3 for a relatively small dataset n 30 grubbs test α 0 01 analytical methods committee 2015 li et al 2018b was used to reject abnormal values of each geu if one geochemical sample is abnormal the measured data is rejected but the corresponding sample is not removed from the dataset then the types of probability distribution for each chemical parameter are judged using kolmogorov smirnov k s test and shapiro wilk tests α 0 05 with the help of spss software the datasets may be approximately subordinate to normal or lognormal density function or skewed distribution finally based on the distribution of geochemical components nbls were calculated using different statistical methods as follows structure for calculation is shown in fig 3 1 arithmetic mean method is applicable to normal cumulative distribution x 0 x s x i 1 n x i n s i 1 n x i x n 1 cv s x 2 geometric mean method is applicable to the log normal distribution x 0 x s x i 1 n x i 1 n s ln x i 1 n ln x ln x i n 1 s e s ln x cv e s ln x 2 1 3 cumulative frequency analysis is applicable to the skewed distribution x 0 x s x md x 0 5 s x 0 841 x 0 5 cv s md where x0 is the range of background values xi is the measured data n is the number of samples x is the mean s is the standard deviation md is the median x 0 5 is the value corresponding to a cumulative frequency of 50 x 0 841 is the value corresponding to a cumulative frequency of 84 1 cvis the coefficient of variation 3 results 3 1 nbls assessment appropriate methods were selected to process the data set according to the amount of groundwater samples in various geus table 1 the nbls of geus ii vi and ix were calculated by grubbs test and the results are shown in table 2 the nbls of other geus were calculated based on 2 δ and cdf methods and those results appear in tables 3 and 4 nbls of groundwater chemical parameters in geus with samples 30 geu ⅰ iii iv v vii viii and ⅹ were calculated by 2 δ and the cdf those results showed that most chemical components of groundwater in each geu formed a normal distribution and both methods gave similar results for background values tables 3 and 4 however there were also some obvious distinctions between some nbls calculated by these two methods in the alluvial plain located west of the jing river and north of the wei river iv geu the upper limit of nbl for th total hardness calculated by cdf was much higher than 2 δ table 3 and fig 4 whereas the test statistic t in 2 δ is greater than the critical value of the lilliefors test statistic tcrit indicating it fails to pass the lilliefors test as shown in fig 4 the dispersion degree of distribution for the remaining values was relatively large according to nakic et al 2007 the purpose of 2 δ is to construct a normal distribution but the background range will be overestimated or underestimated when the distribution is polymodal additionally the cdf method is more suitable for an overlapping polymodal distribution if lower values in the original data set distribution are dominant fig 4b shows t in the cdf method was lower than tcrit indicating the nbl identified fitted the normal distribution well and the results were satisfactory hence the nbls of th in iv geu should also be identified by the cdf method cl in the alluvial plain located west of the chan river and south of the wei river geu viii shows a similar polymodal distribution so the nbls of cl in geu viii should also be identified by the cdf method fig 5 shows the range of background values for cl in geu v identified by 2 δ was from 0 to 614 0 mg l while the range obtained by the cdf method was from 0 to 730 9 mg l indicating a difference between the results of the two methods it is worth noting that only the results of 2 δ successfully passed the lilliefors test moreover an advantage of 2 δ is its ability to omit outliers below the lower limit of normal background fluctuation nakic et al 2007 because low values as well as high values usually reflect anomalies e g low values of dissolved oxygen may be an indicator of extreme oxygen consumption in aquifers 2 δ leads to more realistic and plausible approximations for background values mg2 at the alluvial plain located east of the jing river and north of the wei river geu v and at the pluvial fan of the qinling mountains geu vii show similar results so the nbls of mg2 in geu v and geu vii should also be identified by 2 δ the nbls of hco3 at the alluvial plain located east of the chan river and south of the wei river geu x should also be identified by 2 δ 3 2 the spatial characteristics of nbls controlled by natural geogenic processes and anthropogenic influence nbl values for chemical components sodium calcium magnesium chloride sulfate bicarbonate fluoride chromium total hardness and tds differed significantly in spatial distribution fig 6 as mentioned in the division of the geus the wei river is considered as a discharge boundary for the basin interior so geus i x can be classified into two systems one is located north of the wei river consisting of geus i vi the other is located south of the wei river with geus vii x zhang et al 2005 obviously as shown in fig 6 the nbls of most parameters especially na mg2 so4 2 cl hco3 f and tds north of the wei river are collectively higher than those south of the wei river only ca2 and th south of the wei river are higher than those in the north taken as a whole groundwater south of the wei river is dominated by ca hco3 type but na hco3 na mg hco3 types are dominant north of the wei river the differences could be attributed to well developed rivers large hydraulic gradients and excellent water circulation south of the wei river tds is an index synthetically reflecting dissolved components in groundwater so it is used to identify overall hydrochemistry trends south of the wei river the nbls of tds increase from geu ix to x and from geu vii to viii fig 6j which are consistent with groundwater flow direction north of the wei river the nbls of tds increase from geu ii i to iii and iv and from geu vi to v indicating the accumulation of chemical components along the groundwater flow direction south of the wei river nbls of some parameters na cl so4 2 and tds for geu viii and geu x were higher than the other two geus the upper limits of tds for geus viii and x were 958 0 and 1237 9 mg l table 4 which are almost two times higher than the adjacent geus geus vii and ix respectively and approximately equal to or greater than the drinking water standard limit 1000 mg l geu x is mainly located in the narrow terrace of the wei river where the water table is shallow moreover the lithology in the li mountains differs significantly from other places fig 1b hence high concentrations could be attributed to intensive evaporation and geology geu viii is mainly located in the urban area of xi an so the relatively poor water quality could be attributed to urbanization and human activities as shown in fig 6 the concentrations of na mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and tds in geu v are obviously much higher than other geus geu v is located north of the wei river and east of the jing river it is an alluvial plain with an irrigation history of approximately 2250 years mainly consists of jinghuiqu and jiaokou irrigation districts fig 1b irrigation in this arid semi arid area is responsible for soil salinization and ion enrichment due to hydrogeological condition changes and extensive evaporation huang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b for f fig 6g shows that the nbls of f north of the wei river are generally high and surpass the accepted drinking water limit of 1 0 mg l 4 discussion to better understand the main factors affecting nbls for various geus the spatial characteristics of natural factors including geology precipitation topography and evaporation and anthropogenic factors mainly irrigation and urbanization were analyzed and compared with the nbls of various geus in detail 4 1 natural factors 4 1 1 geology geology or hydrogeology is a crucial factor determining the chemical components dissolved in groundwater anders et al 2014 reimann and de caritat 2005 the guanzhong basin is widely covered by quaternary deposits especially loess of different thicknesses and different geological times fig 1b shows that pleistocene loess is mainly distributed in the north of the wei river while holocene loess is widely distributed south of the wei river according to loessology studies zhang 1958 yan 1960 holocene soil consists of alluvial gravel sand and clay so it possesses relatively good permeability fig 7 and fig 8 are the profiles showing the terrain and hydrogeological conditions in the west i i and the center ii ii iii iii of the guanzhong basin compared with conditions south of the wei river the loess thickness is larger in the north of the wei river due to the poor permeability of pleistocene loess less than 1 10 5 cm s gao et al 2018 hydrologic cycles are slow and residence times for groundwater are relatively long which result in higher concentrations of various components north of the wei river in addition groundwater north of the wei river is mainly recharged from bei mountain or cuo e mountain which is characterized by paleozoic rocks ordovician or cambrian consisting of dolomite limestone or marlite zhang 1991 while proterozoic rocks with abundant quartzite are mainly distributed in the qinling mountains fig 7 thus the distribution of different lithological rocks in the recharge area also results in higher concentrations of chemical components north of the wei river south of the wei river tds of geu x is higher than geu viii likely a consequence of different lithological rocks as shown in fig 8 groundwater recharge of geu x comes from the li mountain with a wide distribution and outcrops of archean and tertiary rocks ar and n in fig 8 the li mountain belongs to the qinling mountains but it is formed by faults in the guanzhong basin since the cenozoic era 65 million years ago the rock strata buried deeply underground gradually lifted upward along the fault plane which resulted in a difference of lithology and strata within the qinling mountains zhang 1991 cheng 2018 due to higher soluble salt contents of tertiary rocks chemical component concentrations in groundwater recharge areas the li mountain are higher thus with the dissolution of minerals along the flow path the concentrations of various components increased so the tds of geu x is the greatest south of the wei river 4 1 2 precipitation precipitation as the dominant recharge source and the dynamic factor of groundwater smerdon 2017 wu et al 2017 is crucial to the concentrations of each chemical component abundant rainfall is beneficial for accelerating the water cycle and the dissolution of soluble materials in rocks long term dissolution results in lower tds values and the dominance of insoluble ions hco3 ca2 mg2 while groundwater in regions with light rainfall is usually rich in the soluble ions cl na precipitation in the guanzhong basin varies extensively fig 9 a due to large area of the basin range 360 km from west to east and differences in geomorphology the maximum annual average precipitation is 860 3 mm 1 6 times larger than the minimum 543 6 mm wu et al 2017 as shown in fig 9a the precipitation obviously increases from north to south and from east to west maximum precipitation falls in the southeast and minimum in the northeast the spatial distribution of precipitation is consistent with tds and hco3 trends indicating the influence of precipitation on nbls 4 1 3 topography the terrain slope is consistent with the hydraulic gradient of shallow groundwater and determines the speed of groundwater runoff and the water cycle wu et al 2017 soluble components readily migrate with a high speed water cycle thus slope is a principal factor impacting dissolution and hydrogeochemistry the terrain slope fig 9b of the guanzhong basin shows that steep slopes are located along the edge of the basin geu i ii vi ix the relatively lower concentrations of tds and soluble components na cl along the edge of the basin geu i ii and vi in the north geu vii and ix in the south relative to the center geu iii iv and v in the north geu viii and x in the south coordinated well with regional slope moreover the qinling mountains are the main recharge area for shallow groundwaters south of the wei river the slopes of those mountains are much steeper than the bei mountains fig 1a 4 1 4 evaporation evaporation affects the concentrations of chemical components in groundwater which usually occurs in groundwater discharge areas low lying areas of basins or plains and especially in arid semi arid areas the water evaporates and the salts are left behind resulting in high concentration of solute components in groundwater additionally the more intense the evaporation the higher the concentration of solute components hence hydrochemical characteristics and nbls of groundwater vary from region to region due to differences between the local evaporation as shown in fig 9c evaporation in the guanzhong basin varies from 84 3 to 1015 3 mm a maximum evaporation rates occur in the basin center especially in geus v and x minimum rates occur in the northwest region of the basin mainly in the geu vi in fig 6 the nbls of tds for geu v and x are much higher than other geus north and south of the wei river respectively which are consistent with the distribution of maximum evaporation rates however the nbl of tds for geu vi is not the lowest but the second highest in the north of the wei river which is inconsistent with minimum evaporation this can be explained by the light precipitation fig 9a poor infiltration and slow groundwater refresh rates fig 9b in the loess tableland 4 2 anthropogenic factors 4 2 1 irrigation irrigation usually transports large amount of water through channels or rivers to a wider range of surface and redistributes groundwater and surface water resource therefore irrigation is one of the most important human activities that utilizes water resources and alters the delicate natural balance han et al 2017 wang et al 2017a ten irrigation districts are widely distributed in the guanzhong basin and occupies about 60 of the total area most of these irrigation districts were built in 1970s except for jinghuiqu jinghuiqu located in geu v was first built in 246 bce and then was repaired and modernized in 1932 it is a historical irrigation district with a roughly 2250 years history of human irrigation regionally the arable land in the guanzhong basin is under irrigation either from surface water or groundwater sometimes groundwater as a supplementary source of irrigation water during periods of surface water shortage wang et al 2018 in the jinghui irrigation district the jing river primarily provides irrigation water especially prior to the 1970s large amounts of surface water recharged groundwater through the vadose zone and resulted in an upraise of the shallow groundwater table according historical data the water table levels in jinghuiqu were 15 30 m before 1932 but it increased rapidly by rates of 0 7 1 4 m a and 0 3 1 0 m a during the period of 1932 1944 and 1944 1954 respectively ye et al 1991 the percent of total areas with water table depth less than 3 m increased from 19 5 in 1954 to 60 in 1965 due to the poor drainage fig 10 ye et al 1991 as discussed in part 4 1 precipitation amounts in geu v are low and evaporation is strong thus the obvious and massive rise of the water table leads to accumulation of chemical components and salinization in this geu historical records and local chronicles show that soil salinization has been frequently observed in the jinghuiqu irrigation district for nearly 1400 years since 655 ac http www sxjhj cn 7 19 8 list aspx due to flooding irrigation and tds of groundwater in this irrigation district had been up to 2 72 g l in 1962 ye et al 1991 although groundwater level tends to fall since well irrigation and drainage were developed and promoted after 1965 water table depth in the whole irrigation district is even deeper than 3 m after 1994 soil and groundwater salinization are still extremely serious in jinghuiqu in which average nbl of tds in groundwater 1639 3 mg l is almost two times higher than others fig 6j therefore long term irrigation certainly would cause the fluctuation of groundwater levels and the change of hydraulic condition influenced by intense evaporation and low precipitation in this semi arid area hydrochemical components of groundwater keep enriching and eventually result in the highest nbl concentrations of various ions in geu v 4 2 2 urbanization urbanization is another important human factor influencing the natural hydrogeological conditions and hydrogeochemistry de caro et al 2017 han et al 2017 mikkonen et al 2018a with economic development and urbanization in the guanzhong basin abundant groundwater has been exploited in cities since the 1970s resulting in a series of environmental hydrogeological problems such as increasingly declining groundwater levels and even ground fissures howard and zhou 2019 declining groundwater levels weaken intensive evaporation of groundwater and ground fissures may become channels connecting phreatic and confined groundwater xi an as the capital of shaanxi province is rapidly developing in recent decades in the urban areas of xi an groundwater levels have dropped more than 10 m since the 1970s which induced the development of ground fissures according to related research fourteen ground fissures with different scales have been found in xi an howard and zhou 2019 peng et al 2017 2016 thus confined groundwater can recharge shallow groundwater through water conducted channel ground fissures which may reduce the concentrations of chemical components in shallow groundwater additionally due to declining groundwater level and impervious surfaces in urban area the influence of evaporation on groundwater could be less and it will contribute to decreasing the concentration of solute components population density serves as an indirect proxy for urbanization and areas with high urbanization levels generally have a relatively large population to identify the influence of urbanization on nbls population density of the whole study area is plotted in fig 9d urban area of xi an which is the main region of geu viii is characterized by the highest population density fig 9d suppose there is no anthropogenic influence the residence time of groundwater in geu x should be shorter than geu viii by considering the narrower range of geu x relative to geu viii fig 2 thus tds should increase more slowly along the water flow path of geu ix to x than from geu vii to viii however according to tables 2 and 4 nbl of tds for geu viii average value increases by just 90 mg l relative to geu vii while for geu x it increases by 270 mg l relative to geu ix the smaller change of tds from geu vii to geu viii indicates slower accumulation of chemical components and it may be attributed to weak evaporation and recharge from the confined aquifer induced by rapid urbanization in xi an city geu viii therefore urbanization has had an important influence on groundwater mineralization additionally the nbl of f for geu viii is the lowest south of the wei river based on a comprehensive literature review borzi et al 2015 brahman et al 2013 mikkonen et al 2018b fluoride in groundwater readily concentrates in areas with shallow groundwater tables slow groundwater runoff and intensive evaporation however urbanization in geu viii not only weakens the evaporation intensity but also accelerates water cycle by exploiting groundwater which therefore may weaken fluorine enrichment 4 3 recommendations for water management groundwater quality in this basin is controlled by both natural processes and human activities determination of nbls is the basis for identifying the degree of contamination and for taking reasonable measures to protect groundwater resources due to the special geological meteorological characteristics and long term human influence in some areas the concentrations of some chemical parameters may accumulate or differ from other areas but these data sometimes may be abandoned or regraded directly as samples disturbed by human activities additionally assessment or evaluation of groundwater pollution in many countries or regions are conducted only by considering drinking water standards as baseline values or setting the nbl or baseline value as one fixed value for an entire region thus the degree of contamination will be better understood if the influence of natural and human activities on the inter regional nbls is considered therefore nbls should be calculated regionally by carefully considering the characteristics of local natural conditions as well as anthropological activities groundwater quality and pollution trends should also be evaluated regionally based on the local calculated nbls in this way it benefits decision makers or the government to assist in the proposal of reasonable countermeasures for water protection for example because of the combined effects of natural factors and long term irrigation the nbls of most parameters in geu v are much higher than accepted drinking water limits thus local governments should pay attention to prevent salinization and endemic disease in geu v and some measures should be taken based on factor analyses such as planting enough salt enduring plants to slow the evaporation properly pumping groundwater to maintain reasonable water tables diverting water to cities and towns or purifying water supplied for drinking to ensure drinking water safety additionally it should be noted that the nbls of f north of the wei river are generally higher than the accepted drinking water limit of 1 0 mg l defluoridation such as coagulation and sedimentation as well as filter layer adsorption processes should be advanced to improve water quality and prevent endemic fluorosis 5 conclusions to identify groundwater quality and pollution trends natural background levels nbls need to be determined the guanzhong basin is a large basin with an area of 20 035 km2 due to the obvious differences in geological geomorphologic hydrogeological and atmospheric characteristics it is not reasonable to assess nbls as fixed values for the entire basin therefore the basin was divided into ten geus mainly based on the characteristics of hydrogeological structures and groundwater flow system regional nbls for each geu for na ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl f cr6 th and tds were evaluated by using a combination of iterative 2 δ technique 2 δ calculated distribution function cdf and grubbs test limited by the amount of groundwater samples the grubbs test was applied in geu ii vi and ix n 30 background data for other geus n 30 were calculated by both 2 δ and cdf methods final nbls were determined by the lilliefors test and variable coefficients of background data results show that both 2 δ and cdf methods gave similar results for background values but some differences were also observed due to the differences of data distribution the 2 δ method was not suitable to evaluate polymodal distributions geus in the guanzhong basin can be classified into two bigger groundwater flow systems namely north and south of the wei river results showed that the nbls of na so4 2 cl hco3 f and tds north of the wei river were obviously higher than those in the south additionally groundwater north of the wei river was dominated by na hco3 na mg hco3 types but ca hco3 type was dominant south of the wei river consistent with groundwater flow direction the nbls of tds increased from the geus geu i ii and vi in the north geu vii and ix in the south at the foot of mountains to geus geu iii iv and v in the north geu viii and x in the south near the two banks of the wei river the natural and anthropogenic factors affecting nbls were discussed in detail south of the wei river outcrops of tertiary rocks in the li mountains resulted in higher nbls for most ions na ca2 so4 2 cl hco3 th and tds in geu x than in geu viii precipitation clearly increases from north to south and from east to west which is consistent with tds and hco3 trends the lower tds along the edge of the basin compared to the center are related to the flow direction and faster flow speed in the marginal areas maximum evaporation occurs in the center of basin especially in geus v and is responsible for the highest nbls for this region anthropogenic factors include irrigation and urbanization with historical irrigation records dating back more than 2250 years in geu v the nbls of most parameters were higher than any other region in the basin moreover rapid urbanization in xi an geu viii led to a decline in the groundwater table the occurrence of ground fissures and reduced evaporation deep tectonic origins of ground fissures may be a conduit for deep groundwater to flow up and mix with shallow groundwater which slows down the accumulation of chemical components leading to lower tds nbls in geu viii relative to geu x by evaluating nbls for each geu a focused analysis at regional scales is helpful for decision

5604,natural background level nbl is a prerequisite for identifying groundwater pollution and for the evaluation of pollution control effectiveness however due to regional differences of natural geogenic hydrogeological biological and atmospheric processes together with long term intense anthropogenic activities it is no longer reasonable to assess nbl as a single value without including human impact this paper shows the importance of regional division based on the knowledge of geology hydrogeology and anthropogenic activities on the assessment of nbls in the study the guanzhong basin situated in central china with an area of 20 035 km2 was divided into ten groundwater environmental units geus based on hydrogeological structures and groundwater flow systems a total of 509 shallow groundwater samples were collected throughout the basin based on samples from each geu nbls of na ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl f cr6 th and tds were evaluated by using iterative 2 δ technique 2 δ calculated distribution function cdf and grubbs test the results indicate the distinct characteristics of nbls for the various geus nbls of na so4 2 cl hco3 f and tds north of the wei river obviously exceeded those in the south nbls of most ions for geu v and geu x were highest north and south of the wei river respectively through detailed analyses of the natural and anthropogenic influences on nbls we found that the outcrops of tertiary rocks in the li mountains determine the highest nbls of chemical components for geu x south of the wei river long term irrigation is responsible for the highest nbls of tds na mg2 hco3 so4 2 and cl for geu v rapid urbanization in xi an geu viii slows down the accumulation of chemical components e g tds in shallow groundwater by reducing evaporation and mixing of shallow water with deep water through ground fissures assessment of nbls on a regional scale lays the basis for identification of groundwater pollution and is helpful for the reasonable management and effective protection of groundwater resources keywords natural background level iterative 2 δ technique calculated distribution function grubbs test guanzhong basin regional scale 1 introduction groundwater accounting for one third of fresh withdrawals in the world falkenmark 2005 li et al 2018a wang et al 2018 is the primary source for drinking water in some cities and spacious rural areas koh et al 2009 sufficient and safe water resources are indispensable for human life however rapid economic development in recent decades not only consumed large amounts of water but also generated huge amounts of pollution falkenmark 2005 with an eye towards alleviating ground water crises interest has gradually focused on groundwater quality problems especially trends in groundwater pollution and changes in groundwater quality the eu water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec stressed the need for member states to identify significant and sustained upward trends of contaminant concentrations to determine the starting points for reversing these trends knowledge of natural background levels nbls of ions contained in groundwater is a prerequisite for identifying trends in drinking water contamination by anthropogenic sources and for proposing reasonable countermeasures for water protection gunnarsdottir et al 2015 gao et al 2019 in this context the assessment of nbls for chemical components is of practical significance background level is defined as the concentration of a hazardous substance that provides a defensible reference point that can be used to evaluate whether or not a release from the site has occurred usepa 1995 natural background level nbl for groundwater is defined by edmunds et al 2003 as the concentration of a given element species or chemical substance present in solution which is derived from natural geogenic biological or atmospheric sources however it is argued that such pristine nbls no longer exist due to frequent and intense human activities mikkonen et al 2018b sellerino et al 2019 groundwaters in highly urbanized and irrigation intensive areas are particularly impacted by long term anthropogenic influence due to pollution from agricultural practices and wastewaters de caro et al 2017 moreover insufficient groundwater quality surveys or incomplete missing historical records makes it extremely difficult to directly evaluate local nbls free from human influence in 1993 the term geochemical baseline was officially introduced in the context of the international geological correlation programme igcp 360 project global geochemical baselines nakic et al 2007 salminen and tarvainen 1997 this term was used to describe a no longer pristine natural background or a modified background in an area due to human activities ducci et al 2016 reimann and garrett 2005 afterward nbl is considered as an indicator or a synonym for a geochemical baseline to describe natural variations in component concentrations in the surficial environment bech et al 2005 elvira hernández garcía and custodio 2004 nakic et al 2007 salminen and tarvainen 1997 generally nbl of a certain element is incorrectly evaluated as a unique value matschullat et al 2000 nakic et al 2007 by definition natural geogenic hydrological biological and atmospheric processes affect nbl assessment in fact water chemistry changes from the moment water comes into contact with rocks and enters the groundwater flow system through rainfall surface water sewage or other sources until it leaves through runoff evaporation or withdrawal de caro et al 2017 vázquez suñé et al 2004 therefore chemical components in groundwater are determined by both natural factors lithology precipitation evaporation and runoff and anthropogenic factors sewage pumping irrigation or other activities the spatial variability of these factors as well as the migration of chemical components can lead to regional groundwater variances thus it is more realistic to regard groundwater nbl as a range rather than an absolute value nakic et al 2007 moreover nbl of groundwater should be evaluated regionally by considering the corresponding characteristics of a particular region e g geology and hydrogeology to reflect the local variation of environmental conditions the technical problems associated with the assessment of nbl can ultimately be attributed to how to separate relatively pristine samples with samples significantly influenced by human activities beygi and jalali 2018 biddau et al 2017 cruz and andrade 2015 statistical methods can derive nbl effectively based on monitoring data these methods generally include both non parameter and parameter approaches de caro et al 2017 the former determines nbl by identifying a fixed percentile value 90th 95th or 97th of data distribution such as relative cumulative frequency analysis matschullat et al 2000 or pre selection ps approach ducci et al 2016 parrone et al 2019 the ps approach subjectively excludes anthropogenic data from data set by using some special chemical indicators such as cl so4 2 no2 no3 or some toxicological index the residual data represents samples with little or no influence by human activities the nbl is determined by distribution of the residual data ducci et al 2016 ducci and sellerino 2012 preziosi et al 2014 wendland et al 2008 this approach requires expert knowledge about the geochemical behavior under the prevailing environmental conditions and generally addresses a fixed value without consideration of natural variability matschullat et al 2000 different from non parameter approaches most parameter approaches evaluate nbl under the assumption that the data distribution obeys a normal or log normal distribution such as 4δ outlier test 2 δ or cdf these approaches obtain a clean data collection through detecting and eliminating the positive anomalies which disturb the normal data distribution different confidence intervals of the normal or log normal distribution e g 95 confidence interval or mean 2δ are evaluated as the nbl gałuszka 2006 matschullat et al 2000 nakic et al 2007 however due to the homogenized variance in the 4δ outlier test very few samples are eliminated resulting in an overestimation of natural background upper limits according to research on the applicability of those three approaches 4δ outlier test 2 δ and cdf conducted by matschullat et al 2000 both 2 δ and cdf present more realistic data for natural backgrounds in different data sets however successful application of both methods 2 δ and cdf requires a relatively large data set n 30 for smaller data sets n 30 grubbs test is usually applied to discard abnormal values based on data distribution the objective of this study is to regionally evaluate nbls of major groundwater ions in a large basin guanzhong basin china we accomplish this objective by using 2 δ cdf and grubbs test to obtain reliable ranges for natural background levels of groundwater ions in various regions because groundwater flow systems comprehensively reflect hydrogeological and atmospheric processes and are crucial to groundwater chemistry the basin was divided into several units based on groundwater flow systems and hydrogeological structures the nbls for each unit were evaluated and factors determining regional variations are discussed in detail to the best of our knowledge this study is the first assessment for nbls on a regional scale based on groundwater flow systems in a large basin the paper provides a comprehensive understanding of nbls as well as their influencing factors in the guanzhong basin china 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the guanzhong basin is one of the larger basins in the yellow river catchment with an area of 20 035 km2 it stretches from baoji in the west to the yellow river in the east and borders the qinling mountains in the south and bei mountains in the north the area is dominated by a warm sub humid continental climate with an average annual evaporation of 900 1200 mm a and an average annual precipitation of 543 6 863 0 mm a wu et al 2017 the aridity index the ratio of evaporation and precipitation in the basin is higher than 1 25 so it is a typical semi arid area the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river traverses the center of the guanzhong basin from west to east the topography of the basin is high in the west low in the east and shows the ladder like distribution from the mountains to the wei river which turns from floodplains to loess tablelands and river terraces wang et al 2018 geologically guanzhong basin is a typical cenozoic faulted basin formed by the joint action of deep formation uprising and region extension during the archean proterozoic period due to the frequent tectonic activity guanzhong basin had experienced long term evolutionary processes of cracking and splicing and formed several faults in ew ne and nw directions during the proterozoic period areas located in the south of weihe fault kept in the state of uplift and denudation for a long time meanwhile areas located in the north of weihe fault depressed and occurred transgression resulting in extremely thick clastic and carbonate formation of the cambrian ordovician until the period of hercynian indo china and yanshan movement due to the strong tectonic and magmatic activity the qinling mountains and beishan mountains rose successively forming a near east west compression zone and depression in the guanzhong area during the early tertiary period the neotectonic activities of the weihe graben continuously strengthened and the range gradually expanded due to the differential vertical movement of deep and large faults in each stage the uplift and sag with great height difference were formed which controlled the range and thickness of the sedimentary deposits of the cenozoic in the basin the cenozoic with a maximum thickness of 7000 m in guanzhong basin is still in a state of continuous extension settlement and deposition the overlying loose quaternary deposits with thickness more than 1000 m are widely distributed in the guanzhong basin and formed the main aquifers the high permeability of these deposits and the low lying terrain are beneficial for the accumulation and transportation of groundwater hydrogeologically according to the burial characteristics aquifers in the guanzhong basin can be divided into phreatic aquifers shallow confined aquifers and deep confined aquifers based on aquifer characteristics phreatic water which exists between 1 and 100 m includes pore water in the interbedding of diluvial boulder gravel and silty clay pore water in alluvial gravel and pebble stratum and eolian loess pore fissure water pore water in alluvial plain with shallow water table level 2 30 m is mainly distributed in the river terraces of wei river or its large tributaries pore water in diluvial plain or fan with slightly deep groundwater levels 5 40 m is mainly distributed in the piedmont zone of qinling mountains and beishan mountain around the edge of basin however due to the fine grain of sediment the large amount of mud and thick clay in diluvial fan of beishan mountains the water abundance is relatively poorer in north of wei river than in south of wei river pore fissure water in loess is mainly distributed in the loess plateau and high terraces and its water table level is buried deeply 20 80 m the phreatic water flows from the qinling and bei mountains to the center of the basin following the local topography fig 1 a and b rainfall infiltration from irrigation leakage of rivers and the lateral flow from the mountains recharge the groundwater runoff evaporation and artificial exploitation are the main ways of discharge the main cities in the guanzhong basin include xi an xianyang weinan and baoji fig 1b xi an located in the center of the basin is the capital of shaanxi province and the largest city in northwest china with a population more than 10 million people the population density of xi an city is 31 190 per square kilometer which is the largest density in the basin and the entire shaanxi province this density is due to rapid economic development and urbanization in xi an the region located north of the wei river and east of the jing river mainly consists of irrigation districts namely the jinghuiqu and jiaokou irrigation districts fig 1b the jinghuiqu irrigation district is a historical area irrigated with surface water for more than 2250 years liu et al 2012 2013 2 2 division of the groundwater environmental units geus groundwater environmental unit geu refers to an area with the same or similar environmental factors at a certain time and within a certain region rational division of geus is crucial for figuring out the characteristics and objective law of nbls the guanzhong basin sandwiched between the northern shaanxi plateau and qinling mountains is a faulted zone formed during the himalayan movement it is bordered by mountains in the north south and west although the hydraulic connection between mountains and the basin is weak there is groundwater flowing into the basin so these borders north south and west can be treated as given flux boundary wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2005 the yellow river which flows from north to south is located along the eastern border of the basin and can be generalized as a discharge boundary the wei river which runs through the basin from west to east can be regarded as discharge boundary in the interior of the basin therefore the whole basin acts as an independent and integrated groundwater aquifer system based on aquifer media zhang et al 2005 further partitioned the groundwater aquifer system of the guanzhong basin into five subsystems porous fractured aquifer system at the loess table porous aquifer system in the alluvial plain porous aquifer system at the pluvial fan of the mountains karst water system north of the wei river and the bedrock fractured aquifer system because the object of this study is shallow groundwater the division of the geus is only done for the phreatic water in the basin groundwater flow system as an ideal tool to study the spatiotemporal evolution of water quality zhang et al 2011 is a comprehensive embodiment of geology hydrogeology landform and atmospheric conditions due to the separation of the wei river jing river qishui river ba river as well as chan river there are weak hydraulic connections in shallow groundwater between the banks of these rivers as shown by the contours of the water table in fig 1 therefore based on the divisions proposed by zhang et al 2005 and in full consideration of new needs e g the continuity of the groundwater flow system for nbl assessment we divided the basin into ten groundwater environmental units geus as shown in fig 2 6 geus i to vi are in the north of the wei river and the other 4 geus vii to x are in the south of the wei river overall the divided geus of the guanzhong basin have an integrated hydrogeological structure and a relatively independent aquifer flow system 2 3 data data set 509 samples in total for evaluating nbls in guanzhong basin were obtained from hydrogeochemical surveys carried out by chang an university from 2016 to 2018 all samples were collected from 509 separate wells sample collection storage transport and analysis were all undertaken with strict adherence to the standard methods ministry of health of prc standardization administration of prc 2006 to ensure data quality chen et al 2020 groundwater samples were collected and stored in polyethylene bottles 2 5 l after pumping for 10 15 min temperature ph and ec were measured on site using a portable multi parameter water quality meter samples were stored at 4 c until analyses were conducted major ions na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 minor elements f cr6 total dissolved solid tds and total hardness th were analyzed in the laboratory of the shaanxi bureau of geology and mineral charge balance error cbe was calculated to ensure the accuracy and reliability of groundwater chemical analysis chen et al 2019 li et al 2018c results for all samples recorded cbe 5 indicating results from all analyses were accurate and reliable 2 4 methodology for assessing nbls the 2 δ and cdf which belong to model based objective methods define the background and threshold values by processing the data i e removing outliers until a normal distribution is obtained nakic et al 2007 the data removed represents contaminated groundwater or non background values data that remained in the normal distribution represents background values for large datasets n 30 2 δ and cdf were used to calculate geochemical background levels of chemical parameters both methods remove outlier data until a normal distribution is obtained and then the fit of background data to a normal distribution is tested by lilliefors test lilliefors 1967 only the remained data background data passed lilliefors test was used to assess the nbls if background data obtained by 2 δ and cdf both obey a normal distribution the data with a smaller variation coefficient is used to assess the background ranges calculation methods are reviewed in detail by nakic et al 2007 a visual basic macro background developed by nakic et al 2007 was applied to automatically process geochemical data and generate the background ranges for chemical parameters fig 3 for a relatively small dataset n 30 grubbs test α 0 01 analytical methods committee 2015 li et al 2018b was used to reject abnormal values of each geu if one geochemical sample is abnormal the measured data is rejected but the corresponding sample is not removed from the dataset then the types of probability distribution for each chemical parameter are judged using kolmogorov smirnov k s test and shapiro wilk tests α 0 05 with the help of spss software the datasets may be approximately subordinate to normal or lognormal density function or skewed distribution finally based on the distribution of geochemical components nbls were calculated using different statistical methods as follows structure for calculation is shown in fig 3 1 arithmetic mean method is applicable to normal cumulative distribution x 0 x s x i 1 n x i n s i 1 n x i x n 1 cv s x 2 geometric mean method is applicable to the log normal distribution x 0 x s x i 1 n x i 1 n s ln x i 1 n ln x ln x i n 1 s e s ln x cv e s ln x 2 1 3 cumulative frequency analysis is applicable to the skewed distribution x 0 x s x md x 0 5 s x 0 841 x 0 5 cv s md where x0 is the range of background values xi is the measured data n is the number of samples x is the mean s is the standard deviation md is the median x 0 5 is the value corresponding to a cumulative frequency of 50 x 0 841 is the value corresponding to a cumulative frequency of 84 1 cvis the coefficient of variation 3 results 3 1 nbls assessment appropriate methods were selected to process the data set according to the amount of groundwater samples in various geus table 1 the nbls of geus ii vi and ix were calculated by grubbs test and the results are shown in table 2 the nbls of other geus were calculated based on 2 δ and cdf methods and those results appear in tables 3 and 4 nbls of groundwater chemical parameters in geus with samples 30 geu ⅰ iii iv v vii viii and ⅹ were calculated by 2 δ and the cdf those results showed that most chemical components of groundwater in each geu formed a normal distribution and both methods gave similar results for background values tables 3 and 4 however there were also some obvious distinctions between some nbls calculated by these two methods in the alluvial plain located west of the jing river and north of the wei river iv geu the upper limit of nbl for th total hardness calculated by cdf was much higher than 2 δ table 3 and fig 4 whereas the test statistic t in 2 δ is greater than the critical value of the lilliefors test statistic tcrit indicating it fails to pass the lilliefors test as shown in fig 4 the dispersion degree of distribution for the remaining values was relatively large according to nakic et al 2007 the purpose of 2 δ is to construct a normal distribution but the background range will be overestimated or underestimated when the distribution is polymodal additionally the cdf method is more suitable for an overlapping polymodal distribution if lower values in the original data set distribution are dominant fig 4b shows t in the cdf method was lower than tcrit indicating the nbl identified fitted the normal distribution well and the results were satisfactory hence the nbls of th in iv geu should also be identified by the cdf method cl in the alluvial plain located west of the chan river and south of the wei river geu viii shows a similar polymodal distribution so the nbls of cl in geu viii should also be identified by the cdf method fig 5 shows the range of background values for cl in geu v identified by 2 δ was from 0 to 614 0 mg l while the range obtained by the cdf method was from 0 to 730 9 mg l indicating a difference between the results of the two methods it is worth noting that only the results of 2 δ successfully passed the lilliefors test moreover an advantage of 2 δ is its ability to omit outliers below the lower limit of normal background fluctuation nakic et al 2007 because low values as well as high values usually reflect anomalies e g low values of dissolved oxygen may be an indicator of extreme oxygen consumption in aquifers 2 δ leads to more realistic and plausible approximations for background values mg2 at the alluvial plain located east of the jing river and north of the wei river geu v and at the pluvial fan of the qinling mountains geu vii show similar results so the nbls of mg2 in geu v and geu vii should also be identified by 2 δ the nbls of hco3 at the alluvial plain located east of the chan river and south of the wei river geu x should also be identified by 2 δ 3 2 the spatial characteristics of nbls controlled by natural geogenic processes and anthropogenic influence nbl values for chemical components sodium calcium magnesium chloride sulfate bicarbonate fluoride chromium total hardness and tds differed significantly in spatial distribution fig 6 as mentioned in the division of the geus the wei river is considered as a discharge boundary for the basin interior so geus i x can be classified into two systems one is located north of the wei river consisting of geus i vi the other is located south of the wei river with geus vii x zhang et al 2005 obviously as shown in fig 6 the nbls of most parameters especially na mg2 so4 2 cl hco3 f and tds north of the wei river are collectively higher than those south of the wei river only ca2 and th south of the wei river are higher than those in the north taken as a whole groundwater south of the wei river is dominated by ca hco3 type but na hco3 na mg hco3 types are dominant north of the wei river the differences could be attributed to well developed rivers large hydraulic gradients and excellent water circulation south of the wei river tds is an index synthetically reflecting dissolved components in groundwater so it is used to identify overall hydrochemistry trends south of the wei river the nbls of tds increase from geu ix to x and from geu vii to viii fig 6j which are consistent with groundwater flow direction north of the wei river the nbls of tds increase from geu ii i to iii and iv and from geu vi to v indicating the accumulation of chemical components along the groundwater flow direction south of the wei river nbls of some parameters na cl so4 2 and tds for geu viii and geu x were higher than the other two geus the upper limits of tds for geus viii and x were 958 0 and 1237 9 mg l table 4 which are almost two times higher than the adjacent geus geus vii and ix respectively and approximately equal to or greater than the drinking water standard limit 1000 mg l geu x is mainly located in the narrow terrace of the wei river where the water table is shallow moreover the lithology in the li mountains differs significantly from other places fig 1b hence high concentrations could be attributed to intensive evaporation and geology geu viii is mainly located in the urban area of xi an so the relatively poor water quality could be attributed to urbanization and human activities as shown in fig 6 the concentrations of na mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and tds in geu v are obviously much higher than other geus geu v is located north of the wei river and east of the jing river it is an alluvial plain with an irrigation history of approximately 2250 years mainly consists of jinghuiqu and jiaokou irrigation districts fig 1b irrigation in this arid semi arid area is responsible for soil salinization and ion enrichment due to hydrogeological condition changes and extensive evaporation huang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b for f fig 6g shows that the nbls of f north of the wei river are generally high and surpass the accepted drinking water limit of 1 0 mg l 4 discussion to better understand the main factors affecting nbls for various geus the spatial characteristics of natural factors including geology precipitation topography and evaporation and anthropogenic factors mainly irrigation and urbanization were analyzed and compared with the nbls of various geus in detail 4 1 natural factors 4 1 1 geology geology or hydrogeology is a crucial factor determining the chemical components dissolved in groundwater anders et al 2014 reimann and de caritat 2005 the guanzhong basin is widely covered by quaternary deposits especially loess of different thicknesses and different geological times fig 1b shows that pleistocene loess is mainly distributed in the north of the wei river while holocene loess is widely distributed south of the wei river according to loessology studies zhang 1958 yan 1960 holocene soil consists of alluvial gravel sand and clay so it possesses relatively good permeability fig 7 and fig 8 are the profiles showing the terrain and hydrogeological conditions in the west i i and the center ii ii iii iii of the guanzhong basin compared with conditions south of the wei river the loess thickness is larger in the north of the wei river due to the poor permeability of pleistocene loess less than 1 10 5 cm s gao et al 2018 hydrologic cycles are slow and residence times for groundwater are relatively long which result in higher concentrations of various components north of the wei river in addition groundwater north of the wei river is mainly recharged from bei mountain or cuo e mountain which is characterized by paleozoic rocks ordovician or cambrian consisting of dolomite limestone or marlite zhang 1991 while proterozoic rocks with abundant quartzite are mainly distributed in the qinling mountains fig 7 thus the distribution of different lithological rocks in the recharge area also results in higher concentrations of chemical components north of the wei river south of the wei river tds of geu x is higher than geu viii likely a consequence of different lithological rocks as shown in fig 8 groundwater recharge of geu x comes from the li mountain with a wide distribution and outcrops of archean and tertiary rocks ar and n in fig 8 the li mountain belongs to the qinling mountains but it is formed by faults in the guanzhong basin since the cenozoic era 65 million years ago the rock strata buried deeply underground gradually lifted upward along the fault plane which resulted in a difference of lithology and strata within the qinling mountains zhang 1991 cheng 2018 due to higher soluble salt contents of tertiary rocks chemical component concentrations in groundwater recharge areas the li mountain are higher thus with the dissolution of minerals along the flow path the concentrations of various components increased so the tds of geu x is the greatest south of the wei river 4 1 2 precipitation precipitation as the dominant recharge source and the dynamic factor of groundwater smerdon 2017 wu et al 2017 is crucial to the concentrations of each chemical component abundant rainfall is beneficial for accelerating the water cycle and the dissolution of soluble materials in rocks long term dissolution results in lower tds values and the dominance of insoluble ions hco3 ca2 mg2 while groundwater in regions with light rainfall is usually rich in the soluble ions cl na precipitation in the guanzhong basin varies extensively fig 9 a due to large area of the basin range 360 km from west to east and differences in geomorphology the maximum annual average precipitation is 860 3 mm 1 6 times larger than the minimum 543 6 mm wu et al 2017 as shown in fig 9a the precipitation obviously increases from north to south and from east to west maximum precipitation falls in the southeast and minimum in the northeast the spatial distribution of precipitation is consistent with tds and hco3 trends indicating the influence of precipitation on nbls 4 1 3 topography the terrain slope is consistent with the hydraulic gradient of shallow groundwater and determines the speed of groundwater runoff and the water cycle wu et al 2017 soluble components readily migrate with a high speed water cycle thus slope is a principal factor impacting dissolution and hydrogeochemistry the terrain slope fig 9b of the guanzhong basin shows that steep slopes are located along the edge of the basin geu i ii vi ix the relatively lower concentrations of tds and soluble components na cl along the edge of the basin geu i ii and vi in the north geu vii and ix in the south relative to the center geu iii iv and v in the north geu viii and x in the south coordinated well with regional slope moreover the qinling mountains are the main recharge area for shallow groundwaters south of the wei river the slopes of those mountains are much steeper than the bei mountains fig 1a 4 1 4 evaporation evaporation affects the concentrations of chemical components in groundwater which usually occurs in groundwater discharge areas low lying areas of basins or plains and especially in arid semi arid areas the water evaporates and the salts are left behind resulting in high concentration of solute components in groundwater additionally the more intense the evaporation the higher the concentration of solute components hence hydrochemical characteristics and nbls of groundwater vary from region to region due to differences between the local evaporation as shown in fig 9c evaporation in the guanzhong basin varies from 84 3 to 1015 3 mm a maximum evaporation rates occur in the basin center especially in geus v and x minimum rates occur in the northwest region of the basin mainly in the geu vi in fig 6 the nbls of tds for geu v and x are much higher than other geus north and south of the wei river respectively which are consistent with the distribution of maximum evaporation rates however the nbl of tds for geu vi is not the lowest but the second highest in the north of the wei river which is inconsistent with minimum evaporation this can be explained by the light precipitation fig 9a poor infiltration and slow groundwater refresh rates fig 9b in the loess tableland 4 2 anthropogenic factors 4 2 1 irrigation irrigation usually transports large amount of water through channels or rivers to a wider range of surface and redistributes groundwater and surface water resource therefore irrigation is one of the most important human activities that utilizes water resources and alters the delicate natural balance han et al 2017 wang et al 2017a ten irrigation districts are widely distributed in the guanzhong basin and occupies about 60 of the total area most of these irrigation districts were built in 1970s except for jinghuiqu jinghuiqu located in geu v was first built in 246 bce and then was repaired and modernized in 1932 it is a historical irrigation district with a roughly 2250 years history of human irrigation regionally the arable land in the guanzhong basin is under irrigation either from surface water or groundwater sometimes groundwater as a supplementary source of irrigation water during periods of surface water shortage wang et al 2018 in the jinghui irrigation district the jing river primarily provides irrigation water especially prior to the 1970s large amounts of surface water recharged groundwater through the vadose zone and resulted in an upraise of the shallow groundwater table according historical data the water table levels in jinghuiqu were 15 30 m before 1932 but it increased rapidly by rates of 0 7 1 4 m a and 0 3 1 0 m a during the period of 1932 1944 and 1944 1954 respectively ye et al 1991 the percent of total areas with water table depth less than 3 m increased from 19 5 in 1954 to 60 in 1965 due to the poor drainage fig 10 ye et al 1991 as discussed in part 4 1 precipitation amounts in geu v are low and evaporation is strong thus the obvious and massive rise of the water table leads to accumulation of chemical components and salinization in this geu historical records and local chronicles show that soil salinization has been frequently observed in the jinghuiqu irrigation district for nearly 1400 years since 655 ac http www sxjhj cn 7 19 8 list aspx due to flooding irrigation and tds of groundwater in this irrigation district had been up to 2 72 g l in 1962 ye et al 1991 although groundwater level tends to fall since well irrigation and drainage were developed and promoted after 1965 water table depth in the whole irrigation district is even deeper than 3 m after 1994 soil and groundwater salinization are still extremely serious in jinghuiqu in which average nbl of tds in groundwater 1639 3 mg l is almost two times higher than others fig 6j therefore long term irrigation certainly would cause the fluctuation of groundwater levels and the change of hydraulic condition influenced by intense evaporation and low precipitation in this semi arid area hydrochemical components of groundwater keep enriching and eventually result in the highest nbl concentrations of various ions in geu v 4 2 2 urbanization urbanization is another important human factor influencing the natural hydrogeological conditions and hydrogeochemistry de caro et al 2017 han et al 2017 mikkonen et al 2018a with economic development and urbanization in the guanzhong basin abundant groundwater has been exploited in cities since the 1970s resulting in a series of environmental hydrogeological problems such as increasingly declining groundwater levels and even ground fissures howard and zhou 2019 declining groundwater levels weaken intensive evaporation of groundwater and ground fissures may become channels connecting phreatic and confined groundwater xi an as the capital of shaanxi province is rapidly developing in recent decades in the urban areas of xi an groundwater levels have dropped more than 10 m since the 1970s which induced the development of ground fissures according to related research fourteen ground fissures with different scales have been found in xi an howard and zhou 2019 peng et al 2017 2016 thus confined groundwater can recharge shallow groundwater through water conducted channel ground fissures which may reduce the concentrations of chemical components in shallow groundwater additionally due to declining groundwater level and impervious surfaces in urban area the influence of evaporation on groundwater could be less and it will contribute to decreasing the concentration of solute components population density serves as an indirect proxy for urbanization and areas with high urbanization levels generally have a relatively large population to identify the influence of urbanization on nbls population density of the whole study area is plotted in fig 9d urban area of xi an which is the main region of geu viii is characterized by the highest population density fig 9d suppose there is no anthropogenic influence the residence time of groundwater in geu x should be shorter than geu viii by considering the narrower range of geu x relative to geu viii fig 2 thus tds should increase more slowly along the water flow path of geu ix to x than from geu vii to viii however according to tables 2 and 4 nbl of tds for geu viii average value increases by just 90 mg l relative to geu vii while for geu x it increases by 270 mg l relative to geu ix the smaller change of tds from geu vii to geu viii indicates slower accumulation of chemical components and it may be attributed to weak evaporation and recharge from the confined aquifer induced by rapid urbanization in xi an city geu viii therefore urbanization has had an important influence on groundwater mineralization additionally the nbl of f for geu viii is the lowest south of the wei river based on a comprehensive literature review borzi et al 2015 brahman et al 2013 mikkonen et al 2018b fluoride in groundwater readily concentrates in areas with shallow groundwater tables slow groundwater runoff and intensive evaporation however urbanization in geu viii not only weakens the evaporation intensity but also accelerates water cycle by exploiting groundwater which therefore may weaken fluorine enrichment 4 3 recommendations for water management groundwater quality in this basin is controlled by both natural processes and human activities determination of nbls is the basis for identifying the degree of contamination and for taking reasonable measures to protect groundwater resources due to the special geological meteorological characteristics and long term human influence in some areas the concentrations of some chemical parameters may accumulate or differ from other areas but these data sometimes may be abandoned or regraded directly as samples disturbed by human activities additionally assessment or evaluation of groundwater pollution in many countries or regions are conducted only by considering drinking water standards as baseline values or setting the nbl or baseline value as one fixed value for an entire region thus the degree of contamination will be better understood if the influence of natural and human activities on the inter regional nbls is considered therefore nbls should be calculated regionally by carefully considering the characteristics of local natural conditions as well as anthropological activities groundwater quality and pollution trends should also be evaluated regionally based on the local calculated nbls in this way it benefits decision makers or the government to assist in the proposal of reasonable countermeasures for water protection for example because of the combined effects of natural factors and long term irrigation the nbls of most parameters in geu v are much higher than accepted drinking water limits thus local governments should pay attention to prevent salinization and endemic disease in geu v and some measures should be taken based on factor analyses such as planting enough salt enduring plants to slow the evaporation properly pumping groundwater to maintain reasonable water tables diverting water to cities and towns or purifying water supplied for drinking to ensure drinking water safety additionally it should be noted that the nbls of f north of the wei river are generally higher than the accepted drinking water limit of 1 0 mg l defluoridation such as coagulation and sedimentation as well as filter layer adsorption processes should be advanced to improve water quality and prevent endemic fluorosis 5 conclusions to identify groundwater quality and pollution trends natural background levels nbls need to be determined the guanzhong basin is a large basin with an area of 20 035 km2 due to the obvious differences in geological geomorphologic hydrogeological and atmospheric characteristics it is not reasonable to assess nbls as fixed values for the entire basin therefore the basin was divided into ten geus mainly based on the characteristics of hydrogeological structures and groundwater flow system regional nbls for each geu for na ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl f cr6 th and tds were evaluated by using a combination of iterative 2 δ technique 2 δ calculated distribution function cdf and grubbs test limited by the amount of groundwater samples the grubbs test was applied in geu ii vi and ix n 30 background data for other geus n 30 were calculated by both 2 δ and cdf methods final nbls were determined by the lilliefors test and variable coefficients of background data results show that both 2 δ and cdf methods gave similar results for background values but some differences were also observed due to the differences of data distribution the 2 δ method was not suitable to evaluate polymodal distributions geus in the guanzhong basin can be classified into two bigger groundwater flow systems namely north and south of the wei river results showed that the nbls of na so4 2 cl hco3 f and tds north of the wei river were obviously higher than those in the south additionally groundwater north of the wei river was dominated by na hco3 na mg hco3 types but ca hco3 type was dominant south of the wei river consistent with groundwater flow direction the nbls of tds increased from the geus geu i ii and vi in the north geu vii and ix in the south at the foot of mountains to geus geu iii iv and v in the north geu viii and x in the south near the two banks of the wei river the natural and anthropogenic factors affecting nbls were discussed in detail south of the wei river outcrops of tertiary rocks in the li mountains resulted in higher nbls for most ions na ca2 so4 2 cl hco3 th and tds in geu x than in geu viii precipitation clearly increases from north to south and from east to west which is consistent with tds and hco3 trends the lower tds along the edge of the basin compared to the center are related to the flow direction and faster flow speed in the marginal areas maximum evaporation occurs in the center of basin especially in geus v and is responsible for the highest nbls for this region anthropogenic factors include irrigation and urbanization with historical irrigation records dating back more than 2250 years in geu v the nbls of most parameters were higher than any other region in the basin moreover rapid urbanization in xi an geu viii led to a decline in the groundwater table the occurrence of ground fissures and reduced evaporation deep tectonic origins of ground fissures may be a conduit for deep groundwater to flow up and mix with shallow groundwater which slows down the accumulation of chemical components leading to lower tds nbls in geu viii relative to geu x by evaluating nbls for each geu a focused analysis at regional scales is helpful for decision makers to make reasonable countermeasures on protecting groundwater resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
