675,the frequency of flood events has increased across most of the u s midwest in the past 50 70 years however little is known about what is driving these changes using an observation driven approach we develop a statistical framework to attribute the changes in the frequency of flood peak events to changes in the climate system and to land use land cover we focus on 287 u s geological survey sites with at least 50 years of daily discharge measurements between the second half of the 20th century and the present our analyses are performed at the seasonal level and consider five predictors precipitation temperature antecedent wetness conditions agriculture and population density even though we use simple models we are able to reproduce well the interannual variability in the frequency of flood events as well as the overall long term tendencies results indicate that precipitation and antecedent wetness conditions are the strongest predictors with the role of the latter increasing as we lower the threshold for the event identification temperature is an important predictor only in the northern great plains during spring where snow related processes are most relevant population as a proxy of urbanization and agriculture are less important compared to the climate predictors keywords flood peaks attribution statistical modeling peak over threshold 1 introduction floods are often associated with a high toll in terms of economic impacts and fatalities and are one of the most costly natural hazards in the united states centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters 2017 in the u s midwest alone floods have caused dozens of billions of dollars in economic losses over the most recent decades with a loss of 7 7 billion and 80 fatalities in just 2013 2017 noaa national centers for environmental information ncei 2018 moreover recent studies mallakpour and villarini 2015 slater and villarini 2016 have found that the frequency of flood events has been generally increasing likely exacerbating these negative impacts therefore an improved understanding of the physical processes responsible for these events can provide basic information to help with our preparedness and response against flood hazards most of the literature has focused on the detection of changes in the frequency of flood events e g mallakpour and villarini 2015 slater and villarini 2016 showing statistically significant trends across large areas of the central united states most of these trends are increasing fig 1 regardless of the season or the event rarity albeit scientifically important the knowledge and insight gained from the detection of trends do not advance our understanding of the drivers responsible for those changes from that perspective attribution studies related to flooding are essential hirsch and archfield 2015 merz et al 2012 and there has been a growing interest toward this line of research for instance slater and villarini 2017 focused their analysis on establishing which set of drivers allows a better prediction of streamflow ranging from low to high flows slater and villarini 2017 2016 and berghuijs et al 2016 confirmed that antecedent wetness is an important predictor of streamflow magnitude mishra et al 2010 schottler et al 2014 villarini and strong 2014 observed that land use land cover lulc can influence streamflow regime potentially leading to increases in high flows berghuijs et al 2016 ivancic and shaw 2015 pradhanang et al 2013 and tang et al 2012 showed that temperature can affect the magnitude of flood peaks through evapotranspiration and snow related processes only few recent studies have attempted to understand the causes of the changes in the frequency of flood events mallakpour and villarini 2015 focused on daily discharge records at 774 stream gage stations across the central united states and detected statistically significant trends in the frequency of flood counts over the 1962 2011 period they preliminarily related these changes to more frequent extreme rainfall events slater and villarini 2016 focused on stage height exceeding the national weather service s flood thresholds over the past 30 years and found that while the precipitation preceding the flood events is important the overall basin wetness is a critical driver of the frequency of flood events also despite the few studies attempting to explain the drivers of year to year variations in the flood counts a framework capable of explaining the observed changes in a comprehensive way is still lacking in fact while climatic processes are expected to play an important role e g more frequent heavy rainfall events leading to more frequent flood events mallakpour and villarini 2015 much less is known about the effect of changes in lulc on the frequency of flood counts the role of lulc is expected to be especially important across the u s midwest which has been experiencing large changes in agricultural intensity and urbanization for instance in the upper mississippi river basin half of the land has been converted from grassland and forest to crops especially corn and soybean frans et al 2013 in the states of iowa minnesota and michigan soybean expansion increased by 1000 at the expense of pastures or other sod based crops zhang and schilling 2006 across the entire midwest house density grew by 146 between 1940 and 2000 radeloff et al 2005 while population increased by 34 4 from 1958 to 2016 united states regional economic analysis project 2017 therefore the main research questions we seek to address are what are the major drivers whether climate or lulc related of the year to year variability and multidecadal changes in the frequency of flood events how do these drivers representing different physical processes change across the different seasons do we identify the same drivers as we move from rarer to more frequent events the paper is organized as follows we describe the data and the methodology in section 2 which is followed by section 3 where we present and discuss our results section 4 summarizes the main points of the study and concludes the paper 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we focus on stream gages located in the u s midwest defined here to include illinois indiana iowa kansas michigan minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota ohio south dakota and wisconsin with daily average discharge measurements up to december 2016 we include only the sites that were classified as not affected by any significant regulation i e the codes 5 or 6 are not present in their peak flow records and that have at least 50 complete years we consider a year complete if it has at least 330 daily observations fig 2 shows the location of the 287 stream gages to obtain the time series of the number of flood events that occurred during each season we use a peak over threshold pot approach we choose a threshold value that gives us one two three and four events per year on average among the entire streamflow record length allowing only one peak within a time window of 5 days plus the logarithm of the drainage area in square miles lang et al 1999 see also silva et al 2012 in this study we will refer to the events exceeding the selected thresholds as floods acknowledging that some of the events identified in this way will not lead to water outside the river banks the examination of a different number of events allows us to evaluate the sensitivity of our results to different flood severity thresholds to evaluate whether the drivers of those events tend to be the same or they change as we move from rarer to more frequent events in terms of predictors we use precipitation temperature wetness conditions agricultural land use and population density as a proxy for urbanization e g dewalle et al 2000 gluck and mccuen 1975 we hypothesize that these drivers explain the frequency of flood events and that their relative importance is site threshold

which reflects the effects of land cover on the rainfall runoff relationship gupta et al 2015 schilling et al 2008 zhang and schilling 2006 we focus on the corn and soybean acreage combined because these two crops represent the highest percentage of harvested acreage in the midwest u s department of agriculture 2007 here we use data from the national agricultural statistics service website u s department of agriculture 2015 at a county level fig 2 and compute a basin averaged value by measuring the area of the basin within each county and assuming that the corn and soybean acreage is uniformly distributed within each county e g slater and villarini 2017 villarini and strong 2014 similar to slater and villarini 2017 we include agricultural intensity as a predictor only for basins where at least 33 of the area is cultivated with corn and or soybean during any year of the study period the data have a time resolution of one year so we used the same time series for all the four seasons the last covariate we consider is the population density xpop which we use as a proxy of the urbanization of the water basin and assume to reflect municipal water use because there was no unique time series covering the entire period we gathered population information from three different sources similar to slater and villarini 2017 a 10 year time scale dataset was obtained from the population of counties by decennial census 1900 to 1990 forstall 1995 an annual time series from 1970 to 2014 was obtained from the national bureau of economics research roth 2016 population data for 2015 and 2016 were obtained from the annual estimates of the resident population april 1 2010 to july 1 2016 u s census bureau 2016 we then merged these three datasets and fitted the time series with a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess curve to obtain annual estimates because all three datasets provide population information at a county level fig 2 we computed basin averaged population density in the same way as for agriculture see also slater and villarini 2017 given that the finest resolution was annual we used the same value for each of the four seasons in a year finally we include population as a predictor only for the basins with a population density higher than 50 persons km2 in at least one year of the time series slater and villarini 2017 2 2 methods because of the discrete nature of the independent variable we use poisson regression to model the interannual variability in flood counts here we consider seven different regression models relating the response variable i e flood counts to the different predictors described in the previous section see in table 1 recognizing that there may be sites with no flood events during a particular season e g northern great plains during the winter and to be able to estimate the parameters of the poisson model we only model the seasonal records at the locations with at least five years where flood counts are greater than zero moreover we exclude sites with negative β values i e the parameter related to precipitation as that would mean that we would expect fewer events for more precipitation as shown in table 1 all the models we considered have seasonal accumulated precipitation as predictor either in isolation model p or combined with other covariates for instance the p t and p m models also include the basin averaged mean temperature xt and wetness conditions xm respectively models p pa and p ppop consider agricultural land cover xa and population density xpop not as separate covariates like for p t and p m but as an interaction factor as we view them as important in modifying the relationship between precipitation and discharge akin to the runoff coefficient villarini and strong 2014 model p pa pm is similar to the previous ones but it considers a total of three covariates the total precipitation xp as a separate predictor and xa and xm as interaction terms the last model is the mixed model which uses precipitation antecedent wetness conditions and temperature as three separate covariates this model uses two different temperature values according to the season that is analyzed during spring the temperature covariate is the average temperature between march and april x t m a r a p r as a simple way of representing snowmelt processes in summer and fall we include the average june august temperature x t s u m m e r as a way of accounting for evapotranspiration in the summer and drying soils in the fall overall the selected sets of predictors and their rationale for being included here are consistent with the approach taken in slater and villarini 2017 rather than selecting a priori one of these seven models we use the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 as a way of compromising goodness of fit and parsimony with the former penalizing the inclusion of additional variables more than the latter for our sample sizes for each station threshold and season we select the best model as the one with the lowest bic or aic value in addition to a visual examination of all the time series to quantify how well our models perform figures not shown we compute the correlation coefficient r between the observations and the median of the fitted poisson distribution furthermore we evaluate the models performance via leave one out cross validation at each station and for each season and threshold value the leave one out cross validation is applied by estimating the parameters of the best model recursively by withholding one observation at the time and predicting its value based on the value of the predictors for that season year we then compute the correlation coefficient between the observed time series and the predicted time series obtained this way 3 results and discussion figs 3 and 4 show the location of the best fitting models for each season and for each flood threshold from one to four peaks per year on average using bic and aic respectively as expected less parsimonious models e g p m and mixed models are selected when using aic rather than bic even though the models selected are often the same regardless of the criterion see figure s2 of the supplemental material for more details the two models that are most frequently selected are the p and p m models followed by the mixed model during the spring the p model tends to be selected in areas where storm rainfall plays an important role in particular in association with extratropical storms and atmospheric rivers e g nayak and villarini 2017 villarini 2016 across the northern great plains on the other hand the p m and mixed models are the most frequently selected likely because of processes related to snowmelt and rain on frozen ground during the summer the model with only precipitation as covariate is the one most often selected especially when bic is used as selection criterion while in the fall it is p m model aside from seasonal differences the choice of the threshold also plays a role in the identification of the best fitting models more specifically as we decrease the flood threshold value from one to four events per year on average moving from left to right in figs 3 and 4 we notice a transition from the precipitation only model as being the most frequently selected model to the p m model this transition suggests that the largest flood events tend to be driven by storm rainfall and that the role of basin wetness increases as we deal with lower magnitude but more frequent flood events slater and villarini 2017 smith et al 2013 our results also indicate that the models that include population or agriculture are rarely selected suggesting that the year to year changes in flood counts are more strongly related to climate than lulc drivers this statement holds regardless of the threshold or season note that at some stations none of the seven models was selected either because the coefficient of the precipitation predictor was negative for all the seven models or because the observed time series had less than five years with flood counts greater than zero figure s1 as an example of how well these models can reproduce the observational records fig 5 shows our modeling results for the usgs station 03230500 big darby creek at darbyville ohio for two different flood threshold albeit simple our models can capture the interannual variability exhibited by the historical record very well both at times when there is a lot of activity e g summer and spring as well as during quieter times e g winter and in particular fall while the results in fig 5 refer to a single site we produce the same plots for all the 287 sites and for the 4 different flood threshold values the figures are omitted to facilitate the reading of the paper the good performance of our statistical models holds across the sites considered here regardless of the season or threshold value to quantitatively evaluate the performance of our models across the study area we show in fig 6 the values of the correlation coefficient between observations and the median of the fitted poisson distribution using the bic to select the best models figure s3 of the supplemental material indicates the same results but referred to the best models selected according to the aic the average value of the correlation coefficient among all stations seasons and threshold definitions is 0 58 and it increases when the threshold is lowered ranging from an average value of 0 50 one peak per year on average to 0 63 four peaks per year on average among all seasons two main clusters with lower r values can be observed especially for higher threshold values one in the winter in the upper mississippi and missouri river basins across the states of iowa north dakota and south dakota and a second one during spring and summer in the eastern part of the domain aside from these two clusters the values of the correlation coefficient are high for the rest of the stations as also highlighted by the visual examination of the time series fig 7 shows the differences in correlation coefficients when using bic and aic as selection criterion overall the differences are very small with a global average difference equal to 0 02 this indicates the models based on aic tend to exhibit a small improvement over those selected based on bic even though this limited improvement comes at the expenses of adding additional predictors leading to more complex models to further assess the performance of the models we performed a leave one out cross validation which confirms the good prediction skills of these statistical models fig 8 the same results obtained using the aic are presented in figure s4 of the supplemental material as shown by these results the models exhibit good skills especially during the flood active periods like spring and summer mallakpour and villarini 2017 villarini 2016 highlighting the potential applicability of these models for flood forecasting see also slater and villarini 2018 fig 9 stratifies the models performance across the different sets of predictors when the bic is used to select the best models similar results are obtained when using the aic to select the best models as shown in figure s5 model p is very frequently selected and the model fit improves as we move from rarer to more frequent events with values of the correlation coefficient increasing from 0 4 to 0 6 the p t model is selected only at a small number of stations with a better fit during spring for all seasons the values of the coefficient related to the xt predictor γ2 table 1 are negative indicating that the number of flood events increases decreases with a decrease increase in temperature one possible explanation for the improved model fit in spring is related to rain on snow events where the colder temperatures can affect the duration of the snow cover and reduce infiltration thus increasing the probability of higher discharge values during heavy rainfall events pradhanang et al 2013 during summer and fall instead lower temperatures can result in lower evapotranspiration maintaining high wetness conditions and thus facilitating the occurrence of higher discharges berghuijs et al 2016 model p m is the second most widespread model and is selected more frequently as we consider lower flood thresholds i e higher number of annual exceedances compared to model p the values of the correlation coefficient are slightly higher fig 9 and figure s5 the high number of stations where p m was selected as the best fitting model and the value of the average correlation coefficient across all stations seasons and threshold values r 0 63 when bic is used as the selection criterion confirm the importance of the wetness conditions in predicting high flow discharge values ivancic and shaw 2015 slater and villarini 2017 villarini and slater 2017 and flood counts models p pa p ppop and p pa pm are rarely selected suggesting that the covariates xa and xpop do not add much to the precipitation related information likely because lulc changes mostly affect low and medium discharges slater and villarini 2017 the mixed model performs quite well during spring in the northern part of the study region figs 3 and 4 where both antecedent wetness and temperature are important for snow related processes also in this case the relationship between temperature and number of events is negative possibly due to rain on snow events and rain on frozen ground compared to the p t model where only precipitation and temperature are included as predictors the mixed model performs better in the spring indicating that accounting for the snow that fell during the winter can help improving the model performance with an average correlation coefficient among all threshold values of 0 62 against 0 59 for the p t model when the bic is used to select the best models fig 9 during fall where xt is the average summer temperature the behavior is similar the model is selected in more stations compared to the p t model suggesting that the evapotranspiration and its impact in the water stored during the summer plays a relevant role slater and villarini 2016 villarini and slater 2017 overall the values of the correlation coefficients are large fig 9 and figure s5 during summer where the predictors are precipitation wetness conditions and average summer temperature the model was selected in fewer stations than model p t suggesting that the penalization of considering a third predictor wetness conditions xm is higher than the improvement of the goodness of fit that it provides similar results are obtained when using aic to select the best models to quantify the improvement in model fit due to the addition of a predictor to model p we computed for each season flood threshold and for every station where p model was not selected as the best model the difference between the r value of the best model and the r value of the p model considering both bic and aic as selection criterion as shown in fig 10 the addition of other predictors improves the overall performance the biggest improvements are found during spring and fall where temperature and wetness conditions are important predictors capturing the processes responsible for the large discharge values and therefore flood events during winter and summer on the other hand the improvement is overall more muted moreover the average improvement is higher when considering aic given that it tends to select more complex models these statements are valid regardless of the selected threshold at the beginning of this study we showed the trends in the frequency of flood events across the u s midwest fig 1 and then developed a methodology that allows the attribution of the interannual variability of flood events frequency in terms of simple predictors to further evaluate the performance of our modeling framework we circle back to the results in fig 1 and see if they can be explained in terms of the drivers we have identified results indicate that the observed trends in fig 1 are very well reproduced by our simple models fig 11 using the results from the fitted distribution rather than the observations we find the same trends for most of the stations in our domain from ohio to missouri to the dakotas the areas where we observe the largest discrepancies are kansas and nebraska where groundwater abstraction and the construction of ponds and terraces have led to declining water tables e g rasmussen and perry 2001 4 conclusions and future directions in this work we modeled the interannual variability in the frequency of flood events at 287 stream gage stations across the central united states analyses were performed at the seasonal scale and for different threshold values the main findings of the study can be summarized as follows we have developed seven simple poisson regression models that used a combination of five predictors related to climatic conditions i e precipitation antecedent wetness and temperature and lulc properties i e urbanization and agricultural intensity despite the simplicity of these statistical models they were able to describe very well the interannual variability in the flood counts across different flood threshold values and seasons the models performance was evaluated through visual examination of the time series and by computing the correlation coefficient between the observational record and the median of the fitted poisson distribution the goodness of fit of our models was further substantiated through leave one out cross validation the model with precipitation as the only predictor was the most frequently selected especially during spring and summer and for rarer flood events i e higher flood threshold values the second most important covariate was the antecedent wetness which influences the frequency of flood counts either in terms of snow related processes during winter and spring or in terms of evapotranspiration during summer and fall moreover we found that this predictor played an increasing role as we considered more frequent events i e lower threshold values temperature constitutes a good predictor only when combined with antecedent wetness conditions lulc drivers i e agricultural intensity and urbanization are rarely selected suggesting that much of the interannual variability in flood counts is driven by climate processes therefore based on these modeling results we have found that a very large component of the detected increasing trends across this area can be largely attributed to changes in precipitation and wetness conditions the framework developed in this study could be improved by considering other predictors that would be directly related to the processes we are trying to capture through proxies e g evapotranspiration or solid precipitation one of the advantages of using only temperature and precipitation is that these quantities are readily available from global climate models potentially extending the applicability of these models for

include population as a predictor only for the basins with a population density higher than 50 persons km2 in at least one year of the time series slater and villarini 2017 2 2 methods because of the discrete nature of the independent variable we use poisson regression to model the interannual variability in flood counts here we consider seven different regression models relating the response variable i e flood counts to the different predictors described in the previous section see in table 1 recognizing that there may be sites with no flood events during a particular season e g northern great plains during the winter and to be able to estimate the parameters of the poisson model we only model the seasonal records at the locations with at least five years where flood counts are greater than zero moreover we exclude sites with negative β values i e the parameter related to precipitation as that would mean that we would expect fewer events for more precipitation as shown in table 1 all the models we considered have seasonal accumulated precipitation as predictor either in isolation model p or combined with other covariates for instance the p t and p m models also include the basin averaged mean temperature xt and wetness conditions xm respectively models p pa and p ppop consider agricultural land cover xa and population density xpop not as separate covariates like for p t and p m but as an interaction factor as we view them as important in modifying the relationship between precipitation and discharge akin to the runoff coefficient villarini and strong 2014 model p pa pm is similar to the previous ones but it considers a total of three covariates the total precipitation xp as a separate predictor and xa and xm as interaction terms the last model is the mixed model which uses precipitation antecedent wetness conditions and temperature as three separate covariates this model uses two different temperature values according to the season that is analyzed during spring the temperature covariate is the average temperature between march and april x t m a r a p r as a simple way of representing snowmelt processes in summer and fall we include the average june august temperature x t s u m m e r as a way of accounting for evapotranspiration in the summer and drying soils in the fall overall the selected sets of predictors and their rationale for being included here are consistent with the approach taken in slater and villarini 2017 rather than selecting a priori one of these seven models we use the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 as a way of compromising goodness of fit and parsimony with the former penalizing the inclusion of additional variables more than the latter for our sample sizes for each station threshold and season we select the best model as the one with the lowest bic or aic value in addition to a visual examination of all the time series to quantify how well our models perform figures not shown we compute the correlation coefficient r between the observations and the median of the fitted poisson distribution furthermore we evaluate the models performance via leave one out cross validation at each station and for each season and threshold value the leave one out cross validation is applied by estimating the parameters of the best model recursively by withholding one observation at the time and predicting its value based on the value of the predictors for that season year we then compute the correlation coefficient between the observed time series and the predicted time series obtained this way 3 results and discussion figs 3 and 4 show the location of the best fitting models for each season and for each flood threshold from one to four peaks per year on average using bic and aic respectively as expected less parsimonious models e g p m and mixed models are selected when using aic rather than bic even though the models selected are often the same regardless of the criterion see figure s2 of the supplemental material for more details the two models that are most frequently selected are the p and p m models followed by the mixed model during the spring the p model tends to be selected in areas where storm rainfall plays an important role in particular in association with extratropical storms and atmospheric rivers e g nayak and villarini 2017 villarini 2016 across the northern great plains on the other hand the p m and mixed models are the most frequently selected likely because of processes related to snowmelt and rain on frozen ground during the summer the model with only precipitation as covariate is the one most often selected especially when bic is used as selection criterion while in the fall it is p m model aside from seasonal differences the choice of the threshold also plays a role in the identification of the best fitting models more specifically as we decrease the flood threshold value from one to four events per year on average moving from left to right in figs 3 and 4 we notice a transition from the precipitation only model as being the most frequently selected model to the p m model this transition suggests that the largest flood events tend to be driven by storm rainfall and that the role of basin wetness increases as we deal with lower magnitude but more frequent flood events slater and villarini 2017 smith et al 2013 our results also indicate that the models that include population or agriculture are rarely selected suggesting that the year to year changes in flood counts are more strongly related to climate than lulc drivers this statement holds regardless of the threshold or season note that at some stations none of the seven models was selected either because the coefficient of the precipitation predictor was negative for all the seven models or because the observed time series had less than five years with flood counts greater than zero figure s1 as an example of how well these models can reproduce the observational records fig 5 shows our modeling results for the usgs station 03230500 big darby creek at darbyville ohio for two different flood threshold albeit simple our models can capture the interannual variability exhibited by the historical record very well both at times when there is a lot of activity e g summer and spring as well as during quieter times e g winter and in particular fall while the results in fig 5 refer to a single site we produce the same plots for all the 287 sites and for the 4 different flood threshold values the figures are omitted to facilitate the reading of the paper the good performance of our statistical models holds across the sites considered here regardless of the season or threshold value to quantitatively evaluate the performance of our models across the study area we show in fig 6 the values of the correlation coefficient between observations and the median of the fitted poisson distribution using the bic to select the best models figure s3 of the supplemental material indicates the same results but referred to the best models selected according to the aic the average value of the correlation coefficient among all stations seasons and threshold definitions is 0 58 and it increases when the threshold is lowered ranging from an average value of 0 50 one peak per year on average to 0 63 four peaks per year on average among all seasons two main clusters with lower r values can be observed especially for higher threshold values one in the winter in the upper mississippi and missouri river basins across the states of iowa north dakota and south dakota and a second one during spring and summer in the eastern part of the domain aside from these two clusters the values of the correlation coefficient are high for the rest of the stations as also highlighted by the visual examination of the time series fig 7 shows the differences in correlation coefficients when using bic and aic as selection criterion overall the differences are very small with a global average difference equal to 0 02 this indicates the models based on aic tend to exhibit a small improvement over those selected based on bic even though this limited improvement comes at the expenses of adding additional predictors leading to more complex models to further assess the performance of the models we performed a leave one out cross validation which confirms the good prediction skills of these statistical models fig 8 the same results obtained using the aic are presented in figure s4 of the supplemental material as shown by these results the models exhibit good skills especially during the flood active periods like spring and summer mallakpour and villarini 2017 villarini 2016 highlighting the potential applicability of these models for flood forecasting see also slater and villarini 2018 fig 9 stratifies the models performance across the different sets of predictors when the bic is used to select the best models similar results are obtained when using the aic to select the best models as shown in figure s5 model p is very frequently selected and the model fit improves as we move from rarer to more frequent events with values of the correlation coefficient increasing from 0 4 to 0 6 the p t model is selected only at a small number of stations with a better fit during spring for all seasons the values of the coefficient related to the xt predictor γ2 table 1 are negative indicating that the number of flood events increases decreases with a decrease increase in temperature one possible explanation for the improved model fit in spring is related to rain on snow events where the colder temperatures can affect the duration of the snow cover and reduce infiltration thus increasing the probability of higher discharge values during heavy rainfall events pradhanang et al 2013 during summer and fall instead lower temperatures can result in lower evapotranspiration maintaining high wetness conditions and thus facilitating the occurrence of higher discharges berghuijs et al 2016 model p m is the second most widespread model and is selected more frequently as we consider lower flood thresholds i e higher number of annual exceedances compared to model p the values of the correlation coefficient are slightly higher fig 9 and figure s5 the high number of stations where p m was selected as the best fitting model and the value of the average correlation coefficient across all stations seasons and threshold values r 0 63 when bic is used as the selection criterion confirm the importance of the wetness conditions in predicting high flow discharge values ivancic and shaw 2015 slater and villarini 2017 villarini and slater 2017 and flood counts models p pa p ppop and p pa pm are rarely selected suggesting that the covariates xa and xpop do not add much to the precipitation related information likely because lulc changes mostly affect low and medium discharges slater and villarini 2017 the mixed model performs quite well during spring in the northern part of the study region figs 3 and 4 where both antecedent wetness and temperature are important for snow related processes also in this case the relationship between temperature and number of events is negative possibly due to rain on snow events and rain on frozen ground compared to the p t model where only precipitation and temperature are included as predictors the mixed model performs better in the spring indicating that accounting for the snow that fell during the winter can help improving the model performance with an average correlation coefficient among all threshold values of 0 62 against 0 59 for the p t model when the bic is used to select the best models fig 9 during fall where xt is the average summer temperature the behavior is similar the model is selected in more stations compared to the p t model suggesting that the evapotranspiration and its impact in the water stored during the summer plays a relevant role slater and villarini 2016 villarini and slater 2017 overall the values of the correlation coefficients are large fig 9 and figure s5 during summer where the predictors are precipitation wetness conditions and average summer temperature the model was selected in fewer stations than model p t suggesting that the penalization of considering a third predictor wetness conditions xm is higher than the improvement of the goodness of fit that it provides similar results are obtained when using aic to select the best models to quantify the improvement in model fit due to the addition of a predictor to model p we computed for each season flood threshold and for every station where p model was not selected as the best model the difference between the r value of the best model and the r value of the p model considering both bic and aic as selection criterion as shown in fig 10 the addition of other predictors improves the overall performance the biggest improvements are found during spring and fall where temperature and wetness conditions are important predictors capturing the processes responsible for the large discharge values and therefore flood events during winter and summer on the other hand the improvement is overall more muted moreover the average improvement is higher when considering aic given that it tends to select more complex models these statements are valid regardless of the selected threshold at the beginning of this study we showed the trends in the frequency of flood events across the u s midwest fig 1 and then developed a methodology that allows the attribution of the interannual variability of flood events frequency in terms of simple predictors to further evaluate the performance of our modeling framework we circle back to the results in fig 1 and see if they can be explained in terms of the drivers we have identified results indicate that the observed trends in fig 1 are very well reproduced by our simple models fig 11 using the results from the fitted distribution rather than the observations we find the same trends for most of the stations in our domain from ohio to missouri to the dakotas the areas where we observe the largest discrepancies are kansas and nebraska where groundwater abstraction and the construction of ponds and terraces have led to declining water tables e g rasmussen and perry 2001 4 conclusions and future directions in this work we modeled the interannual variability in the frequency of flood events at 287 stream gage stations across the central united states analyses were performed at the seasonal scale and for different threshold values the main findings of the study can be summarized as follows we have developed seven simple poisson regression models that used a combination of five predictors related to climatic conditions i e precipitation antecedent wetness and temperature and lulc properties i e urbanization and agricultural intensity despite the simplicity of these statistical models they were able to describe very well the interannual variability in the flood counts across different flood threshold values and seasons the models performance was evaluated through visual examination of the time series and by computing the correlation coefficient between the observational record and the median of the fitted poisson distribution the goodness of fit of our models was further substantiated through leave one out cross validation the model with precipitation as the only predictor was the most frequently selected especially during spring and summer and for rarer flood events i e higher flood threshold values the second most important covariate was the antecedent wetness which influences the frequency of flood counts either in terms of snow related processes during winter and spring or in terms of evapotranspiration during summer and fall moreover we found that this predictor played an increasing role as we considered more frequent events i e lower threshold values temperature constitutes a good predictor only when combined with antecedent wetness conditions lulc drivers i e agricultural intensity and urbanization are rarely selected suggesting that much of the interannual variability in flood counts is driven by climate processes therefore based on these modeling results we have found that a very large component of the detected increasing trends across this area can be largely attributed to changes in precipitation and wetness conditions the framework developed in this study could be improved by considering other predictors that would be directly related to the processes we are trying to capture through proxies e g evapotranspiration or solid precipitation one of the advantages of using only temperature and precipitation is that these quantities are readily available from global climate models potentially extending the applicability of these models for

676,fines migration during co₂ injection into water saturated rocks causes mineral dissolution and precipitation we present a careful experimental study to investigate the effect of water salinity on permeability damage during co₂ sequestration core samples were cut from two berea sandstone blocks for coreflooding images the core samples were characterized using x ray powder diffraction xrd x ray fluorescence xrf and scanning electron microscopy sem analyses the coreflooding began by injecting a core sample with water having salinity values of 0 10 30 or 60 g l nacl then co₂ saturated water was injected to displace the previously injected water the resulting fluid was then displaced by the injection of water saturated supercritical sc co₂ throughout coreflooding the pressure difference across the core sample was monitored and produced water samples were collected after the coreflooding sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis was run to generate images that were then registered with the pre injection images to reveal fines migration the produced water samples were subjected to measurement of fines concentration and ionic chromatography analysis during co₂ saturated water injection permeability increased for low salinity water coreflooding 0 and 10 g l nacl and decreased for high salinity water coreflooding 30 and 60 g l nacl after water saturated scco₂ injection permeability decrease ranged from 85 for freshwater 0 g l nacl to 20 for high salinity water 60 g l nacl fines migration and its consequent mineral dissolution and precipitation determine the core samples permeability 1 introduction co₂ injection into deep saline aquifers oil reservoirs and coalbeds is being considered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions a technique called geological co₂ sequestration kamali and hussain 2017 kamali et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 permeability damage during co₂ sequestration can jeopardize the economic feasibility of the project mijic et al 2014 sbai and azaroual 2011 several researchers have investigated the effect of salinity on permeability damage during enhanced oil recovery yu et al 2018 al sarihi et al 2018 zeinijahromi et al 2016 yu et al 2019 but no experiment has investigated this during co₂ sequestration initially all the components of a subsurface aquifer are in thermodynamic equilibrium when fluids containing substances not yet present in the aquifer begin to be injected into the system that equilibrium is disturbed which can lead to chemical reactions and fines migration sbai and azaroual 2011 presented a mathematical model based on double layer expansion theory to predict permeability damage due to fines migration during co₂ sequestration but their model did not include the effect of chemical reactions these chemical reactions can cause mineral dissolution and precipitation which in turn affect permeability pouryousefy et al 2016 guo et al 2016 guo et al 2015 ranganathan et al 2011 zahid et al 2012 however berrezueta et al 2013 disputed the existence of chemical reactions during injection of supercritical co₂ scco₂ in saline aquifers arguing that in field scale co₂ injection co₂ displaces water in near dry conditions and that chemical reactions therefore do not occur chemical reactions are only considered in the long term several centuries modelling studies to estimate the mineral trapping bachu et al 1994 xu et al 2004 yet laboratory studies have found that chemical reactions can be significant during short term scco₂ injection luquot and gouze 2009 gouze and luquot 2011 mohamed et al 2012 carroll et al 2013 hao et al 2013 smith et al 2013 luhmann et al 2014 luquot et al 2014 garing et al 2015 othman et al 2018 rathnaweera et al 2018 chen et al 2017 injected co₂ saturated water into a berea sandstone sample and detected ca2 and mg2 in the produced water twenty hours of this injection brought about a 5 decrease in the sample s permeability they concluded that both fines migration and dissolution mechanisms had occurred however they used 30 g l water only xie et al 2017 sequentially injected 30 g l water co₂ saturated water and water saturated scco₂ into reservoir core samples they determined that this series of injections had significantly decreased the permeability of the samples al yaseri et al 2017 used 60 g l water and found permeability damage to be insignificant although xie et al 2017 and al yaseri et al 2017 acknowledged that salinity is a major determinant of permeability damage they did not attempt to quantify this this paper presents experiments to investigate permeability damage under various salinities core samples and produced water are characterized in detail to evaluate fines migration and consequent mineral dissolution and precipitation the structure of the paper is following section 2 presents the rock fluids apparatus and experimental procedure used in this study section 3 describes the results section 4 presents the conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock cylindrical core samples 25 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length were drilled from two outcrop berea sandstone blocks 30 cm x 30 cm x 10 cm designated berea 1 and berea 2 tables 1 and 2 present x ray powder diffraction xrd and x ray fluorescence xrf analysis results respectively berea 2 does not contain any rutile and contains less muscovite than berea 1 but berea 2 contains more microcline dolomite and siderite than berea 1 lithic fragments in berea sandstone such as rutile siderite and dolomite form cement when combined with clays or quartz haimson and song 1998 churcher et al 1991 two core samples were drilled from berea 1 and designated berea 1a and berea 1b berea 1a would be subjected to 0 g l nacl and berea 1b 60 g l nacl four core samples were drilled from berea 2 and designated berea 2a berea 2b berea 2c and berea 2d berea 2a would be subjected to 0 g l nacl berea 2b to 10 g l nacl berea 2c to 30 g l nacl and berea 2d to 60 g l nacl comparison of berea 1 and berea 2 corefloods provides us the reproducibility of our conclusions table 3 gives some of their physical properties 2 2 fluids deaerated milliq water was used to prepare the nacl water table 4 presents fluid properties at experimental conditions 323 k and 10 mpa water properties values were taken from kestin et al 1978 co₂ saturated water properties values were taken from bando et al 2004 and duan and sun 2003 and the interfacial tension values were taken from bachu and bennion 2009 nitrogen was used to measure gas permeability before and after the flooding experiments 2 3 apparatus and procedure fig 1 shows a schematic of the apparatus used in the flooding experiment two continuous flow isco 260d pumps were used to inject co₂ and water an accumulator was used to inject co₂ saturated water and water saturated scco₂ the confining pressure was kept constant at 14 mpa the back pressure regulator was set at 10 mpa a high precision 0 20 kpa pressure transducer was used to measure pressure difference across the core a fraction collector was used to collect produced water more details of the experimental facility have been reported by hussain et al 2010 the following procedure was conducted for each core sample 1 measure nitrogen permeability of the dry core sample 2 take scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds images of the injection and production faces of the core sample 3 saturate the core sample with water having the designated concentration of nacl 4 cover the core sample with the lead sleeve to avoid co₂ bypassing during the experiment 5 mount the core sample in a hassler core holder adjust the rotation stage to fix the core holder at the horizontal 6 perform the following three stages of flooding at a constant injection rate of 2 5 cm3 min at 323 k and 10 mpa during each stage the pressure difference across the core sample is measured and produced water is collected a inject water having the designated concentration of nacl into the core sample for 20 pore volumes injected pvi b inject co₂ saturated water having the designated concentration of nacl into the core sample from 21 80 pvi c adjust the rotation stage to fix the core holder at the vertical and inject water saturated scco₂ from 80 114 pvi where the water has the designated concentration of nacl into the core sample from the top to displace co₂ saturated water 7 dismount the core sample from the core holder 8 clean the core sample in a soxhlet extractor using methanol solvent to remove any precipitated nacl this step is not performed for berea 1a or berea 2a because their injections contain no nacl 9 dry the core sample at 323 k in a drying oven until weight of the core sample becomes constant 10 measure nitrogen permeability of the core sample 11 mount the core sample in the hassler core holder adjust the rotation stage to fix the core holder at the horizontal 12 inject water having the designated concentration of nacl into the core sample for 20 pvi 13 measure liquid permeability of the core sample 14 use the laser particle counter to measure fines concentration of the water produced in step 6 15 divide each batch of produced water at least 5 cm3 into two equal parts a use one part for inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icpoes to quantify the produced ionic concentrations b filter the other part to separate the fines which are then tested with sem eds for mineral identification the above procedure ensures that gravity effects are small during coreflooding during water and co₂ saturated water injection step 6a and 6b the core sample is horizontal because the density difference in the injected and displaced fluids is negligible during water saturated scco₂ injection step 6c the injected fluid is lighter and therefore injected from top to minimize gravity effects zhou et al 2019 al riyami et al 2017 furthermore during water saturated scco₂ injection both injected and displaced fluids are saturated mass transfer between the fluids is zero during this stage chang et al 2017 berg et al 2013 that is why this series of injections is generally used in laboratory measurement of co₂ water relative permeability chen and dicarlo 2016 pini and benson 2017 pini et al 2012 in addition the adopted series of injections is closer to a realistic scenario of large scale co₂ sequestration in a saline storage formation hussain et al 2016 othman et al 2018 near the interface of the injected scco₂ and the storage formation water the two fluids become mutually equilibrated therefore the advancing plume of water equilibrated scco₂ displaces co₂ saturated water 3 results 3 1 chemistry of produced water figs 2 and 3 present the icpoes results of the produced water from the core samples drilled from berea 1 and berea 2 respectively ca mg si fe and mn ions were in the produced water yet were entirely absent from the injection fluids this indicates that chemical reactions caused these ions to separate from the core samples concentrations of these ions were negligible during water injection but became significant during the injection of co₂ saturated water and water saturated scco₂ appendix a presents a list of possible chemical reactions and related theory generally the produced ion concentrations from the berea 1 core samples were similar to those from the berea 2 core samples produced fe concentration for the berea 1 core samples was dwarfed by that of the berea 2 core samples figs 2d and 3d which could be attributed to the lower concentration of siderite in berea 1 than in berea 2 in general the produced ion concentrations were higher for high salinity 30 and 60 g l than low salinity 0 and 10 g l at higher salinity more chemical reactions occurred which caused further dissolution as a result decrease in the core samples bulk density was more severe at higher salinity fig 4 higher concentration of na ions facilitates ion exchange between co2 saturated water and minerals shao et al 2011 therefore more chemical reactions occur at higher salinity figs 2 4 in addition salinity dependent co2 solubility and interfacial tension can also affect dissolution and precipitation rates shao et al 2011 duan and sun 2003 3 2 produced fines characterization figs 5 and 6 show laser particle measurements for the produced water of the core samples of berea 1 and berea 2 respectively the concentration and the mean size of produced fines were lowest during water injection and were highest during co₂ saturated water injection after the early period of water saturated scco₂ injection both concentration and mean size decreased fig 7 presents sem images of the filter membranes used to separate fines from produced water fines in the produced water of berea 2 core samples were not analyzed therefore only the results for berea 1 core samples are presented during water injection the number of produced fines was negligible compared to the later stages during co₂ saturated water injection numerous bright fines were produced sem eds analysis showed that these bright fines were high density silica or carbonate based cement during water saturated scco₂ injection there were fewer produced fines on the filter membrane than during co₂ saturated water injection after the breakthrough of water saturated scco₂ the volume of produced water was low therefore less fines were produced fig 8 presents selected high resolution sem images of the filter membranes these images show produced fines during co₂ saturated water injection and water saturated scco₂ injection the produced fines included quartz kaolinite and muscovite chemistry of produced water shows that quartz and kaolinite did not react during co₂ saturated water injection or water saturated scco₂ injection therefore quartz and kaolinite fines were produced due to fines migration chemical reactions dissolved intergranular cement which causes dislodgment of fines 3 3 sem eds analysis of berea 1 core samples sem images were taken of the berea 1 core samples before and after the series of injections to reveal any changes in the pore structure at the injection and production faces of the core samples eds analysis was also applied the following text uses pore opening to mean the enlargement of a pore due to dissolution or displacement of a fine similarly pore plugging means the obstruction of a pore due to precipitation or fines straining fig 9 shows that pore opening was significantly greater in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment berea 1b than in the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment berea 1a this is consistent with the chemical analysis of produced water in that it showed more dissolution in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment fig 10 presents selected sem images from production faces for 0 and 60 g l salinity flooding experiments as with the injection face pore opening due to dissolution is more prominent in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment and pore plugging is absent however several pore plugging occurrences appear in the sem image of the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment fig 11 presents sem images of the injection face before and after the injection series for the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment the post coreflooding sem image shows cement precipitation on the entire surface pore opening and blockage occurred due to changes in quartz kaolinite muscovite microcline and carbonate cement minerals examples are given in fig 12 to expand our analysis we randomly selected 85 sections of sem images of the injection face and production face of both berea 1 core samples for a total of 340 sections the results of the 340 sections are presented in fig 13 at the injection face 18 of the observed pores were plugged in the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment but only 7 in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment similarly at the production face 39 of the observed pores were plugged in the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment but only 4 in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment at the injection face 42 of the observed pores were enlarged in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment but only 30 in the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment fig 14 presents the mineral changes observed in the 340 sections of the observed 4 plugging at the production face of the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment 67 was by muscovite and 33 by quartz however of the observed 39 plugging at the production face of the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment 48 of the plugging was by muscovite 19 by kaolinite 16 by quartz 13 by microcline and 3 by dolomite there being kaolinite displacement only at the lower salinity can be explained by salinity effect on electrostatic forces sbai and azaroual 2011 bedrikovetsky and caruso 2014 shapiro and bedrikovetsky 2008 shapiro and bedrikovetsky 2010 at lower salinity electrostatic forces are lower facilitating displacement of kaolinite during flow 3 4 permeability ratios fig 15 a presents the permeability ratios between the permeability k following co₂ saturated water injection and that the initial permeability k0 reported in table 3 these were calculated using the pressure difference across the core sample and water properties defined in table 4 permeability ratio during co₂ saturated water injection appeared to be directly related to salinity both the berea 1 and berea 2 60 g l salinity flooding experiments showed a decrease in permeability of 20 the 30 g l salinity flooding experiment exhibited negligible change the 10 g l salinity flooding experiment had an increase of 6 for berea 1 0 g l salinity flooding experiment showed a 30 increase and for berea 2 0 g l salinity flooding experiment showed a 15 increase in conclusion injection of co₂ saturated water led to an increase in permeability of core samples that contained low salinity water but it led to a decrease in permeability of core samples that contained high salinity water after the injection series the berea 2 core samples were measured for nitrogen permeability and water permeability nitrogen permeability reasonably matched the water permeability for the berea 1 core samples only water permeability was measured fig 15b shows that for the 60 g l salinity flooding experiments water permeability decrease was around 20 however for 0 g l flooding experiment water permeability decrease was around 85 after water saturated scco₂ injection permeability decrease is more for lower salinity water the observed permeability trend after water saturated scco₂ injection can be explained by sem eds results section 3 3 and fig 14 although muscovite dissolution was more for high salinity kaolinite was only displaced for low salinity kaolinite displacement is known to cause significant permeability damage bedrikovetsky and caruso 2014 guo et al 2018 4 conclusions we conducted a series of experiments to better understand the effect of water salinity on permeability decrease during supercritical carbon dioxide scco₂ injection detailed characterization of core samples and produced water was carried out to investigate underlying mechanisms of permeability damage our key findings were as follows chemical reactions were significant during the experiment they led to more dissolution at higher salinity as a result higher salinity caused higher reduction in the density of the core samples chemical analysis of the produced water did not show significant chemical reaction between injected fluids and either kaolinite or quartz however the presence of these minerals in produced water and sem images of blocked pores suggested that these minerals were displaced due to fines migration chemical reactions dissolved intergranular cement thereby dislodging fines injection of co₂ saturated water led to an increase in permeability of core samples that contained low salinity water but it led to a decrease in permeability of core samples that contained high salinity water the permeability change during co₂ saturated water injection was determined by two competing factors a pore enlargement due to dissolution and b pore blockage due to precipitation and fines migration for core samples that contained low salinity water dissolution was dominant causing permeability to increase core samples that contained high salinity water had even greater dissolution but dislodged fines were also greater causing permeability to decrease the permeability decrease during water saturated scco₂ injection was more severe for core samples that contained low salinity water than for those that contained high salinity water for core samples that contained freshwater 0 g l nacl the permeability decrease was 85 but for those that contained 60 g l nacl water the permeability decrease was only 20 in this study we have not investigated a number of parameters which can affect the permeability damage during co2 sequestration these parameters include flow velocity pressure and temperature conditions type and concentration of ions present in the formation water and mineral composition of the storage formation therefore the permeability alteration values reported here are limited to the experimental conditions in a realistic co₂ sequestration scenario near the interface of the injected scco₂ and

shapiro and bedrikovetsky 2010 in general laboratory studies to determine co2 water relative permeability curves do not consider fines migration pini et al 2012 berg et al 2013 however fines migration and resultant permeability damage can be significant under low salinity conditions integrated experimental and modelling studies are needed to evaluate the effect of fines migration and chemical reactions on co2 water relative permeability curves these relative permeability curves can then be used to evaluate the effect of fines migration and chemical reactions on the injectivity of co2 in a

676,fines migration during co₂ injection into water saturated rocks causes mineral dissolution and precipitation we present a careful experimental study to investigate the effect of water salinity on permeability damage during co₂ sequestration core samples were cut from two berea sandstone blocks for coreflooding images the core samples were characterized using x ray powder diffraction xrd x ray fluorescence xrf and scanning electron microscopy sem analyses the coreflooding began by injecting a core sample with water having salinity values of 0 10 30 or 60 g l nacl then co₂ saturated water was injected to displace the previously injected water the resulting fluid was then displaced by the injection of water saturated supercritical sc co₂ throughout coreflooding the pressure difference across the core sample was monitored and produced water samples were collected after the coreflooding sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis was run to generate images that were then registered with the pre injection images to reveal fines migration the produced water samples were subjected to measurement of fines concentration and ionic chromatography analysis during co₂ saturated water injection permeability increased for low salinity water coreflooding 0 and 10 g l nacl and decreased for high salinity water coreflooding 30 and 60 g l nacl after water saturated scco₂ injection permeability decrease ranged from 85 for freshwater 0 g l nacl to 20 for high salinity water 60 g l nacl fines migration and its consequent mineral dissolution and precipitation determine the core samples permeability 1 introduction co₂ injection into deep saline aquifers oil reservoirs and coalbeds is being considered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions a technique called geological co₂ sequestration kamali and hussain 2017 kamali et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 permeability damage during co₂ sequestration can jeopardize the economic feasibility of the project mijic et al 2014 sbai and azaroual 2011 several researchers have investigated the effect of salinity on permeability damage during enhanced oil recovery yu et al 2018 al sarihi et al 2018 zeinijahromi et al 2016 yu et al 2019 but no experiment has investigated this during co₂ sequestration initially all the components of a subsurface aquifer are in thermodynamic equilibrium when fluids containing substances not yet present in the aquifer begin to be injected into the system that equilibrium is disturbed which can lead to chemical reactions and fines migration sbai and azaroual 2011 presented a mathematical model based on double layer expansion theory to predict permeability damage due to fines migration during co₂ sequestration but their model did not include the effect of chemical reactions these chemical reactions can cause mineral dissolution and precipitation which in turn affect permeability pouryousefy et al 2016 guo et al 2016 guo et al 2015 ranganathan et al 2011 zahid et al 2012 however berrezueta et al 2013 disputed the existence of chemical reactions during injection of supercritical co₂ scco₂ in saline aquifers arguing that in field scale co₂ injection co₂ displaces water in near dry conditions and that chemical reactions therefore do not occur chemical reactions are only considered in the long term several centuries modelling studies to estimate the mineral trapping bachu et al 1994 xu et al 2004 yet laboratory studies have found that chemical reactions can be significant during short term scco₂ injection luquot and gouze 2009 gouze and luquot 2011 mohamed et al 2012 carroll et al 2013 hao et al 2013 smith et al 2013 luhmann et al 2014 luquot et al 2014 garing et al 2015 othman et al 2018 rathnaweera et al 2018 chen et al 2017 injected co₂ saturated water into a berea sandstone sample and detected ca2 and mg2 in the produced water twenty hours of this injection brought about a 5 decrease in the sample s permeability they concluded that both fines migration and dissolution mechanisms had occurred however they used 30 g l water only xie et al 2017 sequentially injected 30 g l water co₂ saturated water and water saturated scco₂ into reservoir core samples they determined that this series of injections had significantly decreased the permeability of the samples al yaseri et al 2017 used 60 g l water and found permeability damage to be insignificant although xie et al 2017 and al yaseri et al 2017 acknowledged that salinity is a major determinant of permeability damage they did not attempt to quantify this this paper presents experiments to investigate permeability damage under various salinities core samples and produced water are characterized in detail to evaluate fines migration and consequent mineral dissolution and precipitation the structure of the paper is following section 2 presents the rock fluids apparatus and experimental procedure used in this study section 3 describes the results section 4 presents the conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock cylindrical core samples 25 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length were drilled from two outcrop berea sandstone blocks 30 cm x 30 cm x 10 cm designated berea 1 and berea 2 tables 1 and 2 present x ray powder diffraction xrd and x ray fluorescence xrf analysis results respectively berea 2 does not contain any rutile and contains less muscovite than berea 1 but berea 2 contains more microcline dolomite and siderite than berea 1 lithic fragments in berea sandstone such as rutile siderite and dolomite form cement when combined with clays or quartz haimson and song 1998 churcher et al 1991 two core samples were drilled from berea 1 and designated berea 1a and berea 1b berea 1a would be subjected to 0 g l nacl and berea 1b 60 g l nacl four core samples were drilled from berea 2 and designated berea 2a berea 2b berea 2c and berea 2d berea 2a would be subjected to 0 g l nacl berea 2b to 10 g l nacl berea 2c to 30 g l nacl and berea 2d to 60 g l nacl comparison of berea 1 and berea 2 corefloods provides us the reproducibility of our conclusions table 3 gives some of their physical properties 2 2 fluids deaerated milliq water was used to prepare the nacl water table 4 presents fluid properties at experimental conditions 323 k and 10 mpa water properties values were taken from kestin et al 1978 co₂ saturated water properties values were taken from bando et al 2004 and duan and sun 2003 and the interfacial tension values were taken from bachu and bennion 2009 nitrogen was used to measure gas permeability before and after the flooding experiments 2 3 apparatus and procedure fig 1 shows a schematic of the apparatus used in the flooding experiment two continuous flow isco 260d pumps were used to inject co₂ and water an accumulator was used to inject co₂ saturated water and water saturated scco₂ the confining pressure was kept constant at 14 mpa the back pressure regulator was set at 10 mpa a high precision 0 20 kpa pressure transducer was used to measure pressure difference across the core a fraction collector was used to collect produced water more details of the experimental facility have been reported by hussain et al 2010 the following procedure was conducted for each core sample 1 measure nitrogen permeability of the dry core sample 2 take scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds images of the injection and production faces of the core sample 3 saturate the core sample with water having the designated concentration of nacl 4 cover the core sample with the lead sleeve to avoid co₂ bypassing during the experiment 5 mount the core sample in a hassler core holder adjust the rotation stage to fix the core holder at the horizontal 6 perform the following three stages of flooding at a constant injection rate of 2 5 cm3 min at 323 k and 10 mpa during each stage the pressure difference across the core sample is measured and produced water is collected a inject water having the designated concentration of nacl into the core sample for 20 pore volumes injected pvi b inject co₂ saturated water having the designated concentration of nacl into the core sample from 21 80 pvi c adjust the rotation stage to fix the core holder at the vertical and inject water saturated scco₂ from 80 114 pvi where the water has the designated concentration of nacl into the core sample from the top to displace co₂ saturated water 7 dismount the core sample from the core holder 8 clean the core sample in a soxhlet extractor using methanol solvent to remove any precipitated nacl this step is not performed for berea 1a or berea 2a because their injections contain no nacl 9 dry the core sample at 323 k in a drying oven until weight of the core sample becomes constant 10 measure nitrogen permeability of the core sample 11 mount the core sample in the hassler core holder adjust the rotation stage to fix the core holder at the horizontal 12 inject water having the designated concentration of nacl into the core sample for 20 pvi 13 measure liquid permeability of the core sample 14 use the laser particle counter to measure fines concentration of the water produced in step 6 15 divide each batch of produced water at least 5 cm3 into two equal parts a use one part for inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icpoes to quantify the produced ionic concentrations b filter the other part to separate the fines which are then tested with sem eds for mineral identification the above procedure ensures that gravity effects are small during coreflooding during water and co₂ saturated water injection step 6a and 6b the core sample is horizontal because the density difference in the injected and displaced fluids is negligible during water saturated scco₂ injection step 6c the injected fluid is lighter and therefore injected from top to minimize gravity effects zhou et al 2019 al riyami et al 2017 furthermore during water saturated scco₂ injection both injected and displaced fluids are saturated mass transfer between the fluids is zero during this stage chang et al 2017 berg et al 2013 that is why this series of injections is generally used in laboratory measurement of co₂ water relative permeability chen and dicarlo 2016 pini and benson 2017 pini et al 2012 in addition the adopted series of injections is closer to a realistic scenario of large scale co₂ sequestration in a saline storage formation hussain et al 2016 othman et al 2018 near the interface of the injected scco₂ and the storage formation water the two fluids become mutually equilibrated therefore the advancing plume of water equilibrated scco₂ displaces co₂ saturated water 3 results 3 1 chemistry of produced water figs 2 and 3 present the icpoes results of the produced water from the core samples drilled from berea 1 and berea 2 respectively ca mg si fe and mn ions were in the produced water yet were entirely absent from the injection fluids this indicates that chemical reactions caused these ions to separate from the core samples concentrations of these ions were negligible during water injection but became significant during the injection of co₂ saturated water and water saturated scco₂ appendix a presents a list of possible chemical reactions and related theory generally the produced ion concentrations from the berea 1 core samples were similar to those from the berea 2 core samples produced fe concentration for the berea 1 core samples was dwarfed by that of the berea 2 core samples figs 2d and 3d which could be attributed to the lower concentration of siderite in berea 1 than in berea 2 in general the produced ion concentrations were higher for high salinity 30 and 60 g l than low salinity 0 and 10 g l at higher salinity more chemical reactions occurred which caused further dissolution as a result decrease in the core samples bulk density was more severe at higher salinity fig 4 higher concentration of na ions facilitates ion exchange between co2 saturated water and minerals shao et al 2011 therefore more chemical reactions occur at higher salinity figs 2 4 in addition salinity dependent co2 solubility and interfacial tension can also affect dissolution and precipitation rates shao et al 2011 duan and sun 2003 3 2 produced fines characterization figs 5 and 6 show laser particle measurements for the produced water of the core samples of berea 1 and berea 2 respectively the concentration and the mean size of produced fines were lowest during water injection and were highest during co₂ saturated water injection after the early period of water saturated scco₂ injection both concentration and mean size decreased fig 7 presents sem images of the filter membranes used to separate fines from produced water fines in the produced water of berea 2 core samples were not analyzed therefore only the results for berea 1 core samples are presented during water injection the number of produced fines was negligible compared to the later stages during co₂ saturated water injection numerous bright fines were produced sem eds analysis showed that these bright fines were high density silica or carbonate based cement during water saturated scco₂ injection there were fewer produced fines on the filter membrane than during co₂ saturated water injection after the breakthrough of water saturated scco₂ the volume of produced water was low therefore less fines were produced fig 8 presents selected high resolution sem images of the filter membranes these images show produced fines during co₂ saturated water injection and water saturated scco₂ injection the produced fines included quartz kaolinite and muscovite chemistry of produced water shows that quartz and kaolinite did not react during co₂ saturated water injection or water saturated scco₂ injection therefore quartz and kaolinite fines were produced due to fines migration chemical reactions dissolved intergranular cement which causes dislodgment of fines 3 3 sem eds analysis of berea 1 core samples sem images were taken of the berea 1 core samples before and after the series of injections to reveal any changes in the pore structure at the injection and production faces of the core samples eds analysis was also applied the following text uses pore opening to mean the enlargement of a pore due to dissolution or displacement of a fine similarly pore plugging means the obstruction of a pore due to precipitation or fines straining fig 9 shows that pore opening was significantly greater in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment berea 1b than in the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment berea 1a this is consistent with the chemical analysis of produced water in that it showed more dissolution in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment fig 10 presents selected sem images from production faces for 0 and 60 g l salinity flooding experiments as with the injection face pore opening due to dissolution is more prominent in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment and pore plugging is absent however several pore plugging occurrences appear in the sem image of the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment fig 11 presents sem images of the injection face before and after the injection series for the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment the post coreflooding sem image shows cement precipitation on the entire surface pore opening and blockage occurred due to changes in quartz kaolinite muscovite microcline and carbonate cement minerals examples are given in fig 12 to expand our analysis we randomly selected 85 sections of sem images of the injection face and production face of both berea 1 core samples for a total of 340 sections the results of the 340 sections are presented in fig 13 at the injection face 18 of the observed pores were plugged in the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment but only 7 in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment similarly at the production face 39 of the observed pores were plugged in the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment but only 4 in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment at the injection face 42 of the observed pores were enlarged in the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment but only 30 in the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment fig 14 presents the mineral changes observed in the 340 sections of the observed 4 plugging at the production face of the 60 g l salinity flooding experiment 67 was by muscovite and 33 by quartz however of the observed 39 plugging at the production face of the 0 g l salinity flooding experiment 48 of the plugging was by muscovite 19 by kaolinite 16 by quartz 13 by microcline and 3 by dolomite there being kaolinite displacement only at the lower salinity can be explained by salinity effect on electrostatic forces sbai and azaroual 2011 bedrikovetsky and caruso 2014 shapiro and bedrikovetsky 2008 shapiro and bedrikovetsky 2010 at lower salinity electrostatic forces are lower facilitating displacement of kaolinite during flow 3 4 permeability ratios fig 15 a presents the permeability ratios between the permeability k following co₂ saturated water injection and that the initial permeability k0 reported in table 3 these were calculated using the pressure difference across the core sample and water properties defined in table 4 permeability ratio during co₂ saturated water injection appeared to be directly related to salinity both the berea 1 and berea 2 60 g l salinity flooding experiments showed a decrease in permeability of 20 the 30 g l salinity flooding experiment exhibited negligible change the 10 g l salinity flooding experiment had an increase of 6 for berea 1 0 g l salinity flooding experiment showed a 30 increase and for berea 2 0 g l salinity flooding experiment showed a 15 increase in conclusion injection of co₂ saturated water led to an increase in permeability of core samples that contained low salinity water but it led to a decrease in permeability of core samples that contained high salinity water after the injection series the berea 2 core samples were measured for nitrogen permeability and water permeability nitrogen permeability reasonably matched the water permeability for the berea 1 core samples only water permeability was measured fig 15b shows that for the 60 g l salinity flooding experiments water permeability decrease was around 20 however for 0 g l flooding experiment water permeability decrease was around 85 after water saturated scco₂ injection permeability decrease is more for lower salinity water the observed permeability trend after water saturated scco₂ injection can be explained by sem eds results section 3 3 and fig 14 although muscovite dissolution was more for high salinity kaolinite was only displaced for low salinity kaolinite displacement is known to cause significant permeability damage bedrikovetsky and caruso 2014 guo et al 2018 4 conclusions we conducted a series of experiments to better understand the effect of water salinity on permeability decrease during supercritical carbon dioxide scco₂ injection detailed characterization of core samples and produced water was carried out to investigate underlying mechanisms of permeability damage our key findings were as follows chemical reactions were significant during the experiment they led to more dissolution at higher salinity as a result higher salinity caused higher reduction in the density of the core samples chemical analysis of the produced water did not show significant chemical reaction between injected fluids and either kaolinite or quartz however the presence of these minerals in produced water and sem images of blocked pores suggested that these minerals were displaced due to fines migration chemical reactions dissolved intergranular cement thereby dislodging fines injection of co₂ saturated water led to an increase in permeability of core samples that contained low salinity water but it led to a decrease in permeability of core samples that contained high salinity water the permeability change during co₂ saturated water injection was determined by two competing factors a pore enlargement due to dissolution and b pore blockage due to precipitation and fines migration for core samples that contained low salinity water dissolution was dominant causing permeability to increase core samples that contained high salinity water had even greater dissolution but dislodged fines were also greater causing permeability to decrease the permeability decrease during water saturated scco₂ injection was more severe for core samples that contained low salinity water than for those that contained high salinity water for core samples that contained freshwater 0 g l nacl the permeability decrease was 85 but for those that contained 60 g l nacl water the permeability decrease was only 20 in this study we have not investigated a number of parameters which can affect the permeability damage during co2 sequestration these parameters include flow velocity pressure and temperature conditions type and concentration of ions present in the formation water and mineral composition of the storage formation therefore the permeability alteration values reported here are limited to the experimental conditions in a realistic co₂ sequestration scenario near the interface of the injected scco₂ and the storage formation water the two fluids become mutually equilibrated which resembles the displacement scheme of our laboratory corefloods therefore the adopted methodology in this study can be used to evaluate permeability damage in a realistic scenario our results show that permeability damage is more severe in storage formations containing low salinity or freshwater to model permeability alteration during co2 sequestration fines migration models should be upgraded to incorporate chemical reaction sbai and azaroual 2011 bedrikovetsky and caruso 2014 shapiro and bedrikovetsky 2008 shapiro and bedrikovetsky 2010 in general laboratory studies to determine co2 water relative permeability curves do not consider fines migration pini et al 2012 berg et al 2013 however fines migration and resultant permeability damage can be significant under low salinity conditions integrated experimental and modelling studies are needed to evaluate the effect of fines migration and chemical reactions on co2 water relative permeability curves these relative permeability curves can then be used to evaluate the effect of fines migration and chemical reactions on the injectivity of co2 in a

literature simulations of tidal variation of flow and transport were performed results show a discrepancy in the transport behavior of viruses predicted by our model and the classical approach in particular our results show a peak of virus concentration when a contaminated saline system is flooded by a low salinity water the peak is due to virus detachment from the porous medium surface upon salinity reduction the magnitude of the peak can be up to one order of magnitude of the initial concentration within the medium suggesting a negative feedback from tidal flow in coastal aquifers

microorganisms within coastal aquifers in this paper a coupled model of transport in porous media of viruses and salinity is presented a mathematical model was developed implemented and verified with the analytical solution derived in this work and validated with experimental data from the literature cao et al 2010 simulations of the tidal flow of a brine carrying viruses were performed the results were compared with the uncoupled transport model commonly adopted schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 and they show significant discrepancy in the transport behavior of the viruses predicted by the two approaches 2 mathematical model following bradford et al 2003 and cao et al 2010 a one dimensional 1d model for viruses and salinity transport through a saturated porous medium was developed it comprises a 2 2 coupled system of partial differential equations pdes of mass conservation 1 c t ρ n s i t s i i t v c x d 2 c x 2 0 2 c s t v c s x d 2 c s x 2 0 where t 0 is the time s 0 x l is the

these calculations model parameters k a t t i k a t t i i k d e t i and s max were described by a continuous functions varying with salinity which were determined upon fitting the estimates reported

numerical discretization the coupled system of mass conservation equations together with the constitutive equations for attachment detachment process as reported in section 2 was discretized with an

transport through sediments and verified with the analytical solution explained below section 4 4 derivation of the analytical solution in the limit of negligible longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion

of pdes that can be solved with the method of characteristics moc lake et al 2002 leveque 2002 the solution consists of two composite waves identifying the concentration fronts of the viruses and the salinity the latter is a contact discontinuity always traveling ahead of the composite wave at the average fluid velocity therefore the salinity wave is only accounted for the selection of the

discussion in this section the developed coupled model for virus and salinity transport in porous media is verified with the analytical solution section 5 1 and validated with the experimental data section 5 2 upon validation numerical simulations of virus transport under tidal variation of flow and salinity were performed and the results are shown and discussed in section 5 3 5 1 comparison of the numerical simulations with the fundamental structures of the analytical solution in this section the fundamental structure of the analytical solution to the systems of pdes given by eqs 7 and 8 is provided and illustrated on the time space diagram for different combinations of constant initial and boundary conditions riemann problem table 1 summarizes the conditions for which the analytical solutions and the numerical simulations were determined the values of the concentrations were all normalized by the injected concentration each solution is illustrated as characteristics on the time space diagram part a and as concentration profiles function of the dimensionless time and space variables part b through e the time when the system reaches equilibrium with the left state critical time τc calculated by eq 20 is indicated with a gray circle in part a of the figure the dashed lines indicate the dimensionless time and space at which the concentration profiles were determined and then reported in the corresponding parts of the same figure overall the salinity is given by a contact discontinuity travelling at average flow velocity while the virus concentration is described by a composite wave with a contact discontinuity and rarefaction changing at constant salinity reversing the conditions the two concentrations change simultaneously in particular the solutions for the first set of conditions in table 1 i e numbers 1 and 2 are reported in figs 2 and 3 respectively for the first condition the time space diagram part a of fig 2 is divided into three regions for ζ τ the characteristics carry the right state gray lines for ζ τ i e below the dividing characteristic black bold line the regions are split into two parts namely a region due to the kinetic process of attachment detachment yellow lines and a region where the characteristics carry the left state green lines as expected the salinity always travels ahead of the virus concentration fronts the virus concentration changes within the right and the left state at constant salinity concentration and during this transition a rarefaction forms in all cases the numerical and analytical solutions agree very well fig 3 reports the solutions for condition 2 in table 1 which is the reversed of condition 1 in part a of this figure it is possible to see that the transition highlighted in the inset from the right to the left states is almost sudden and coincides with the salinity front parts b through e of the figure indicating that as the salinity is reduced simultaneously the detachment of the viruses from the porous medium surface occurs however during this period a peak of virus concentration with a magnitude increasing with time forms the maximum of the peak can reach values up to one order of magnitude larger than the initial right state a similar behavior was observed in column flood experiments upon reduction of salinity by cao et al 2010 in the case of virus transport torkzaban et al 2008 and redman et al 2004 in the case of bacteria transport i e e coli and by franchi and o melia 2003 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 and sang et al 2013 in the case of colloid transport however all these studies are experimental and the detachment peak was not described with a mathematical model here as it is possible to see the numerical and analytical solutions both predict the formation of the peak and they agree very well although numerical diffusion in the simulations smooths the profiles figs 4 and 5 report the solutions for conditions 3 and 4 in table 1 similarly to fig 3 the time space diagram part a is divided into three regions with is a transition zone between the right and the left state during transient a composite wave forms which comprises two waves a contact discontinuity traveling with the salinity which passes from the right state to an intermediate lower concentration and a rarefaction that increases smoothly between the intermediate state and the left state the concentration profiles are reported in parts b through e in fig 4 when the conditions are reversed fig 5 a sudden detachment front forms as observed in fig 3 which reaches a maximum concentration much larger than the constant right state also in this case the numerical and analytical solutions agree well figs 6 and 7 report the solutions for conditions 5 and 6 in table 1 where the salinity is maintained now constant i e c s r c s l 1 as it is possible to see in part a of both figs 6 and 7 the transition zone from the right and left state has disappeared this is because the salinity does not change and therefore no detachment occurs the concentration profile of viruses is always a sharp front with speed given by eq 29 it changes between the right and the left state parts b through e in fig 6 and vice versa as the conditions are reversed parts b through e in fig 7 5 2 comparison of the numerical simulations with literature data and the analytical solution simulations with the numerical model described in section 2 were carried out at the conditions applied in the experiments reported in cao et al 2010 namely in the three calculations the right and the left states of the virus concentration cr and left cl respectively were set always equal to zero and 270 pfu ml correspondingly while the right and left states for salinity c s r and c s l respectively were maintained constant at either 1 20 or 30 ppt the results are shown in fig 8 and also the analytical solutions determined under the experimental conditions are reported as it is possible to see the numerical simulations the literature data and the analytical solutions agree very well the small discrepancy between the numerical simulations and the literature data is due to the selection of the parameter values which is given by the functions obtained upon fitting of the estimates instead of the actual optimal value identifies by cao et al 2010 and provided in their paper it is important to point out that the analytical solution does not account for the so called reversible attachment detachment process described by eq 3 however the calculated profiles describe well the data and agree with the numerical simulations suggesting that this process has only minor effect 5 3 simulations of the transport of viruses within a tidal system to investigate the effect of the tidal change of flow direction and salinity concentration on virus migration in porous media simulations were run and the results of our model compared with those from the uncoupled model cao et al 2010 in the latter model parameter values were assigned on the basis of the salinity of the left state i e c s l in these simulations a tidal flow of a brine rich in virus was considered the flow direction was changed every 4 5 pore volume pv pv qt vv with q the flowrate and vv the void volume of the 1d system which corresponds to the time when the virus front reaches the middle of domain x l 0 5 in all simulations the velocity the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion and the porosity were set equal to 8 3 10 4 m s 1 10 13 m2 s and 0 40 5 3 1 simulating contamination by a brine in the first investigated case a system initially clean was flooded flow from left to right with clean water of salinity equal to 0 ppt after 4 5 pv the flow was reversed and a brine of salinity equal to 30 ppt containing a virus concentration of 3000 pfu ml was injected flow from right to left the conditions were then reversed every 4 5 pv for six times the concentration profiles of the coupled and uncoupled models as a function of normalized distance are illustrated in figs 9 and 10 respectively parts a through h of these figures report the virus concentration profiles in suspension and parts i through p show the virus concentration profiles attached onto the porous medium comparing the results in figs 9 and 10 it is possible to see that the two models predict different behaviors of virus transport the coupled model parts a through h of fig 9 clearly show that after 9 pv when a clean brine is injected a significant concentration peak forms due to detachment such a peak it is not predicted by the uncoupled model parts a through h of fig 10 regarding the attached concentration of viruses on the porous medium surface the two models predict a similar trend parts i through p of figs 9 and 10 here it is possible to see the formation of accumulation within the medium which persists even when clean low salinity water is injected into the system the accumulated concentration grows over time and stabilizes at a value equal to the maximum attached concentration s max at the salinity of the injected brine 5 5 105 pfu g accumulation is predicted by both models but with a larger extent by the coupled approach to gain an insight into the evolution of the concentration of the viruses within the domain their suspended and attached concentrations at the middle of the system were plotted over time fig 11 as it is possible to see in this figure the concentration profiles are distinct because of the velocity of the fronts the magnitude of the detached concentration and the amount of viruses accumulated onto the porous medium surface in all cases the coupled model predicts larger values after 36 pv clean water and clean brine were injected from the left and the right of the 1d domain respectively the results of the simulations are shown in figs 1 and 2 of the si document as it is possible to notice the predicted structure of the virus concentration profiles in suspension is the major difference in the coupled model a concentration peak of viruses in suspension forms upon detachment due to the injection of clean water which is approximately 6 fold larger than that predicted by the coupled model the attached concentration of viruses on the porous medium surface slowly decreases towards zero and after 18 pv is around 4 103 pfu g which is slightly lower than the maximum attached concentration that can be attained at the injected salinity namely s max 5 5 10 3 pfu g regarding the attached concentration both models predict similar behavior the values of s stabilizes at 2 103 pfu g which is lower than the maximum attainable with the clean brine of high salinity 30 ppt this behavior is evident in fig 3 of the si document which reports the evolution of the concentrations in the middle of the domain 5 3 2 simulating accumulation due to two contaminated brines in the second investigated case two contaminated brines were considered in the tidal process initially the system was clean and then flooded from left to right with a brine of salinity equal to 10 ppt containing a virus concentration of 2000 pfu ml after 4 5 pv the flow was reversed and a brine of salinity equal to 30 ppt containing a virus concentration of 3000 pfu ml was injected flow from right to left the conditions were reversed every 4 5 pv for six times the concentration profiles of virus in suspension and attached to the porous medium surface are shown in figs 12 and 13 as it is possible to see in these diagrams the coupled model parts a through h in fig 12 predicts much larger suspended concentration upon detachment than that calculated with the uncoupled model parts a through h in fig 13 in both cases the concentration attached onto the porous medium reaches equilibrium after 36 pv stabilizing around 5 5 103 pfu g corresponding to the maximum attainable concentration s max at 30 ppt to gain an insight into the evolution of the concentration of the viruses within the domain their suspended and attached concentrations at the middle of the system were plotted as a function of time and the results are shown in fig 14 on one hand the concentration profiles of the viruses in suspension are significantly different parts a and c of the figure the coupled model predicts concentrations upon detachment that are up to 3 fold larger than that predicted by the uncoupled model on the other hand the concentration profiles of the viruses attached to the porous medium surface are similar and after 15 pv their values change periodically between the minimum and maximum attainable concentrations corresponding to the injected salinity of 10 and 30 ppt indicated by the red and black dashed lines respectively similarly to the case analyzed above after 36 pv the domain was flooded by a clean brine of salinity 10 and 30 ppt from the right and the left of the system respectively the results are shown in figs 4 and 5 of the si document the coupled model predicts concentrations of viruses in suspension due to detachment much higher than those predicted by the uncoupled model but in both cases the suspended virus concentration is completely displaced after 4 5 pv regarding the attached concentration both models predict similar behavior the values of s stabilizes at the maximum attainable values with the clean brine of lower salinity 10 ppt i e at 3 8 103 pfu g this behavior is shown in fig 6 of the si document which reports the evolution of the concentrations in the middle of the domain 6 conclusions in this work the effect of salinity on the transport of viruses through a porous medium was studied a coupled model was developed to account for the change of the model parameter values on salinity and then verified with the analytical solution derived in this work and validated with literature data upon validation the effect of tidal flow and composition was analyzed and the simulations results of the coupled model were compared with those of the classical uncoupled approach results show a peak of virus concentration when a contaminated saline system is flooded by a low salinity water which is not predicted by the uncoupled model the peak is due to virus detachment from the porous medium surface upon salinity reduction the magnitude of the peak can be up to one order of magnitude of the initial concentration within the medium suggesting a negative feedback from tidal flow in coastal aquifers nearby estuaries affected by virus contamination therefore we believe that this model is a valuable tool to help gaining an insight into virus transport in sediments in the presence of tidal flow nearby estuaries coupling water composition and microorganism transport overall the results provide the basis for future work that may extend the model to include the effect of other characteristics of the liquid phase e g ph and temperature finally a coupled transport model allows to describe not only specific experiments under selected conditions but more importantly it allows to predict virus transport under variable conditions which are for instance of great interest in coastal engineering and science

literature simulations of tidal variation of flow and transport were performed results show a discrepancy in the transport behavior of viruses predicted by our model and the classical approach in particular our results show a peak of virus concentration when a contaminated saline system is flooded by a low salinity water the peak is due to virus detachment from the porous medium surface upon

and the transport of escherichia coli and bacteriophages in porous media have been extensively studied bradford et al 2014 gargiulo et al 2008 guan et al 2003 kim et al 2008 however if the experimental and modeling works on bacteria migration are equally balanced in the case of viruses fewer modeling efforts have been performed cao et al 2009 chrysikopoulos and sim 1996 schijven and

2010 glud and mathias 2004 han et al 2006 sadeghi et al 2011 walshe et al 2010 earlier works focused on the transport in saturated porous media which resemble conditions within coastal aquifers were carried out under constant chemical conditions chu et al 2000 guan et al 2005 torkzaban et al 2006 to the best of authors knowledge there are no studies that have investigated the effect of variable chemical conditions on virus transport current modeling approaches do not account for the coupling of the transport of viruses with e g salinity and ph which are critical to describe the fate of microorganisms within coastal aquifers in this paper a coupled model of transport in porous media of viruses and salinity is presented a mathematical model was developed implemented and verified with the analytical solution derived in this work and validated with experimental data from the literature cao et al 2010 simulations of the tidal flow of a brine carrying viruses were performed the results were compared with the uncoupled transport model commonly adopted schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 and they show significant discrepancy in the transport behavior of the viruses predicted by the two approaches 2 mathematical model following bradford et al 2003 and cao et al 2010 a one dimensional 1d model for viruses and salinity transport through a saturated porous medium was developed it comprises a 2 2 coupled system of partial differential equations pdes of mass conservation 1 c t ρ n s i t s i i t v c x d 2 c x 2 0 2 c s t v c s x d 2 c s x 2 0 where t 0 is the time s 0 x l is the

these calculations model parameters k a t t i k a t t i i k d e t i and s max were described by a continuous functions varying with salinity which were determined upon fitting the estimates reported

this figure coefficient k a t t i is one order of magnitude smaller than k a t t i i suggesting that the resulting attached concentration of viruses on the porous medium surface given by mechanism described in eq 3 i e si is less important than that described in eq 4 i e sii the inactivation of viruses it is a second order process considering the scale of the experiments used to developed the

section 5 2 upon validation numerical simulations of virus transport under tidal variation of flow and salinity were performed and the results are shown and discussed in section 5 3 5 1 comparison of the numerical simulations with the fundamental structures of the analytical solution in this section the fundamental structure of the analytical solution to the systems of pdes given by eqs 7 and 8 is provided and illustrated on the time space diagram for different combinations of constant initial and boundary conditions riemann problem table 1 summarizes the conditions for which the analytical solutions and the numerical simulations were determined the values of the concentrations were all normalized by the injected concentration each solution is illustrated as characteristics on the time space diagram part a and as concentration profiles function of the dimensionless time and space variables part b through e the time when the system reaches equilibrium with the left state critical time τc calculated by eq 20 is indicated with a gray circle in part a of the figure the dashed lines indicate the dimensionless time and space at which the concentration profiles were determined and then reported in the corresponding parts of the same figure overall the salinity is given by a contact discontinuity travelling at average flow velocity while the virus concentration is described by a composite wave with a contact discontinuity and rarefaction changing at constant salinity reversing the conditions the two concentrations change simultaneously in particular the solutions for the first set of conditions in table 1 i e numbers 1 and 2 are reported in figs 2 and 3 respectively for the first condition the time space diagram part a of fig 2 is divided into three regions for ζ τ the characteristics carry the right state gray lines for ζ τ i e below the dividing characteristic black bold line the regions are split into two parts namely a region due to the kinetic process of attachment detachment yellow lines and a region where the characteristics carry the left state green lines as expected the salinity always travels ahead of the virus concentration fronts the virus concentration changes within the right and the left state at constant salinity concentration and during this transition a rarefaction forms in all cases the numerical and analytical solutions agree very well fig 3 reports the solutions for condition 2 in table 1 which is the reversed of condition 1 in part a of this figure it is possible to see that the transition highlighted in the inset from the right to the left states is almost sudden and coincides with the salinity front parts b through e of the figure indicating that as the salinity is reduced simultaneously the detachment of the viruses from the porous medium surface occurs however during this period a peak of virus concentration with a magnitude increasing with time forms the maximum of the peak can reach values up to one order of magnitude larger than the initial right state a similar behavior was observed in column flood experiments upon reduction of salinity by cao et al 2010 in the case of virus transport torkzaban et al 2008 and redman et al 2004 in the case of bacteria transport i e e coli and by franchi and o melia 2003 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 and sang et al 2013 in the case of colloid transport however all these studies are experimental and the detachment peak was not described with a mathematical model here as it is possible to see the numerical and analytical solutions both predict the formation of the peak and they agree very well although numerical diffusion in the simulations smooths the profiles figs 4 and 5 report the solutions for conditions 3 and 4 in table 1 similarly to fig 3 the time space diagram part a is divided into three regions with is a transition zone between the right and the left state during transient a composite wave forms which comprises two waves a contact discontinuity traveling with the salinity which passes from the right state to an intermediate lower concentration and a rarefaction that increases smoothly between the intermediate state and the left state the concentration profiles are reported in parts b through e in fig 4 when the conditions are reversed fig 5 a sudden detachment front forms as observed in fig 3 which reaches a maximum concentration much larger than the constant right state also in this case the numerical and analytical solutions agree well figs 6 and 7 report the solutions for conditions 5 and 6 in table 1 where the salinity is maintained now constant i e c s r c s l 1 as it is possible to see in part a of both figs 6 and 7 the transition zone from the right and left state has disappeared this is because the salinity does not change and therefore no detachment occurs the concentration profile of viruses is always a sharp front with speed given by eq 29 it changes between the right and the left state parts b through e in fig 6 and vice versa as the conditions are reversed parts b through e in fig 7 5 2 comparison of the numerical simulations with literature data and the analytical solution simulations with the numerical model described in section 2 were carried out at the conditions applied in the experiments reported in cao et al 2010 namely in the three calculations the right and the left states of the virus concentration cr and left cl respectively were set always equal to zero and 270 pfu ml correspondingly while the right and left states for salinity c s r and c s l respectively were maintained constant at either 1 20 or 30 ppt the results are shown in fig 8 and also the analytical solutions determined under the experimental conditions are reported as it is possible to see the numerical simulations the literature data and the analytical solutions agree very well the small discrepancy between the numerical simulations and the literature data is due to the selection of the parameter values which is given by the functions obtained upon fitting of the estimates instead of the actual optimal value identifies by cao et al 2010 and provided in their paper it is important to point out that the analytical solution does not account for the so called reversible attachment detachment process described by eq 3 however the calculated profiles describe well the data and agree with the numerical simulations suggesting that this process has only minor effect 5 3 simulations of the transport of viruses within a tidal system to investigate the effect of the tidal change of flow direction and salinity concentration on virus migration in porous media simulations were run and the results of our model compared with those from the uncoupled model cao et al 2010 in the latter model parameter values were assigned on the basis of the salinity of the left state i e c s l in these simulations a tidal flow of a brine rich in virus was considered the flow direction was changed every 4 5 pore volume pv pv qt vv with q the flowrate and vv the void volume of the 1d system which corresponds to the time when the virus front reaches the middle of domain x l 0 5 in all simulations the velocity the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion and the porosity were set equal to 8 3 10 4 m s 1 10 13 m2 s and 0 40 5 3 1 simulating contamination by a brine in the first investigated case a system initially clean was flooded flow from left to right with clean water of salinity equal to 0 ppt after 4 5 pv the flow was reversed and a brine of salinity equal to 30 ppt containing a virus concentration of 3000 pfu ml was injected flow from right to left the conditions were then reversed every 4 5 pv for six times the concentration profiles of the coupled and uncoupled models as a function of normalized distance are illustrated in figs 9 and 10 respectively parts a through h of these figures report the virus concentration profiles in suspension and parts i through p show the virus concentration profiles attached onto the porous medium comparing the results in figs 9 and 10 it is possible to see that the two models predict different behaviors of virus transport the coupled model parts a through h of fig 9 clearly show that after 9 pv when a clean brine is injected a significant concentration peak forms due to detachment such a peak it is not predicted by the uncoupled model parts a through h of fig 10 regarding the attached concentration of viruses on the porous medium surface the two models predict a similar trend parts i through p of figs 9 and 10 here it is possible to see the formation of accumulation within the medium which persists even when clean low salinity water is injected into the system the accumulated concentration grows over time and stabilizes at a value equal to the maximum attached concentration s max at the salinity of the injected brine 5 5 105 pfu g accumulation is predicted by both models but with a larger extent by the coupled approach to gain an insight into the evolution of the concentration of the viruses within the domain their suspended and attached concentrations at the middle of the system were plotted over time fig 11 as it is possible to see in this figure the concentration profiles are distinct because of the velocity of the fronts the magnitude of the detached concentration and the amount of viruses accumulated onto the porous medium surface in all cases the coupled model predicts larger values after 36 pv clean water and clean brine were injected from the left and the right of the 1d domain respectively the results of the simulations are shown in figs 1 and 2 of the si document as it is possible to notice the predicted structure of the virus concentration profiles in suspension is the major difference in the coupled model a concentration peak of viruses in suspension forms upon detachment due to the injection of clean water which is approximately 6 fold larger than that predicted by the coupled model the attached concentration of viruses on the porous medium surface slowly decreases towards zero and after 18 pv is around 4 103 pfu g which is slightly lower than the maximum attached concentration that can be attained at the injected salinity namely s max 5 5 10 3 pfu g regarding the attached concentration both models predict similar behavior the values of s stabilizes at 2 103 pfu g which is lower than the maximum attainable with the clean brine of high salinity 30 ppt this behavior is evident in fig 3 of the si document which reports the evolution of the concentrations in the middle of the domain 5 3 2 simulating accumulation due to two contaminated brines in the second investigated case two contaminated brines were considered in the tidal process initially the system was clean and then flooded from left to right with a brine of salinity equal to 10 ppt containing a virus concentration of 2000 pfu ml after 4 5 pv the flow was reversed and a brine of salinity equal to 30 ppt containing a virus concentration of 3000 pfu ml was injected flow from right to left the conditions were reversed every 4 5 pv for six times the concentration profiles of virus in suspension and attached to the porous medium surface are shown in figs 12 and 13 as it is possible to see in these diagrams the coupled model parts a through h in fig 12 predicts much larger suspended concentration upon detachment than that calculated with the uncoupled model parts a through h in fig 13 in both cases the concentration attached onto the porous medium reaches equilibrium after 36 pv stabilizing around 5 5 103 pfu g corresponding to the maximum attainable concentration s max at 30 ppt to gain an insight into the evolution of the concentration of the viruses within the domain their suspended and attached concentrations at the middle of the system were plotted as a function of time and the results are shown in fig 14 on one hand the concentration profiles of the viruses in suspension are significantly different parts a and c of the figure the coupled model predicts concentrations upon detachment that are up to 3 fold larger than that predicted by the uncoupled model on the other hand the concentration profiles of the viruses attached to the porous medium surface are similar and after 15 pv their values change periodically between the minimum and maximum attainable concentrations corresponding to the injected salinity of 10 and 30 ppt indicated by the red and black dashed lines respectively similarly to the case analyzed above after 36 pv the domain was flooded by a clean brine of salinity 10 and 30 ppt from the right and the left of the system respectively the results are shown in figs 4 and 5 of the si document the coupled model predicts concentrations of viruses in suspension due to detachment much higher than those predicted by the uncoupled model but in both cases the suspended virus concentration is completely displaced after 4 5 pv regarding the attached concentration both models predict similar behavior the values of s stabilizes at the maximum attainable values with the clean brine of lower salinity 10 ppt i e at 3 8 103 pfu g this behavior is shown in fig 6 of the si document which reports the evolution of the concentrations in the middle of the domain 6 conclusions in this work the effect of salinity on the transport of viruses through a porous medium was studied a coupled model was developed to account for the change of the model parameter values on salinity and then verified with the analytical solution derived in this work and validated with literature data upon validation the effect of tidal flow and composition was analyzed and the simulations results of the coupled model were compared with those of the classical uncoupled approach results show a peak of virus concentration when a contaminated saline system is flooded by a low salinity water which is not predicted by the uncoupled model the peak is due to virus detachment from the porous medium surface upon salinity reduction the magnitude of the peak can be up to one order of magnitude of the initial concentration within the medium suggesting a negative feedback from tidal flow in coastal aquifers nearby estuaries affected by virus contamination therefore we believe that this model is a valuable tool to help gaining an insight into virus transport in sediments in the presence of tidal flow nearby estuaries coupling water composition and microorganism transport overall the results provide the basis for future work that may extend the model to include the effect of other characteristics of the liquid phase e g ph and temperature finally a coupled transport model allows to describe not only specific experiments under selected conditions but more importantly it allows to predict virus transport under variable conditions which are for instance of great interest in coastal engineering and science

678,this paper analyzes the natural hydrogeochemical conditions of the future central storage facility site at villar de cañas and evaluates the evolution of the system associated with its construction the characterization of the hydrogeochemical structure of the system is based on a comprehensive field and laboratory survey which allowed us to define both the distribution of materials and their hydro chemo mechanical properties under isothermal conditions the resulting observations were used to develop a numerical model in a multiphysics environment solver which was calibrated from the monitoring of the hydraulic head distribution and from detailed geochemical analysis of water samples the numerical model indicated that the behavior of the system is governed by a very slow underground flow regime and by equilibrium with gypsum and the dissolution of other sulfated phases these results also suggest that the construction of facilities will not significantly disturb these processes showing a very small effect of chemistry on the mechanical evolution vertical displacements keywords hydro chemo mechanical model numerical model environmental load construction groundwater 1 introduction the spanish central storage facility csf consists of a set of facilities designed to hold high level radioactive waste hlrw in villar de cañas central spain see fig 1 a the main origin of this waste is the operation and dismantling of existing nuclear power plants in spain whose individual facilities are close to reaching their maximum storage capacity given the operational life of the csf 60 years this represents a temporary solution prior to the final management of nuclear waste using other processes and the construction of a permanent repository thus until then the csf allows the adequate control of waste under safe conditions enresa 2017 to construct the csf facilities see fig 1b major earthworks and the urbanization of an area of more than 230 000 m2 are needed these operations involve the modification of pre existing natural conditions governed by a set of hydrogeochemical processes that are active and interrelated which must be studied in detail both to reduce the impact on the natural environment and to ensure the safe geotechnical and structural design of the facilities for instance in the ascó nuclear power plant the alteration of the site s natural conditions led to the transformation from anhydrite to gypsum deu lozano 2008 and the construction of underground works led to modifications in the swelling potential of clay sulfate rocks in several countries butscher et al 2011a b cases such as these and other studies relating to the impact of anthropogenic activities on hydrogeochemical conditions güler et al 2012 han et al 2017 green et al 2011 highlight the importance of detailed studies of the response of hydrogeochemical systems to modifications of their natural conditions an initial explanation of the natural hydrogeochemical behavior of the study area was carried out by gómez et al 2014 who established a conceptual model of its behavior supported by the development of local mathematical models using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 despite the relevance of this contribution the analysis of the effects of construction processes on its natural hydrogeochemical behavior has not yet been completed this issue must account for the spatial distribution of the litho stratigraphic units that comprise the system as well as their complex hydro chemo mechanical hcm behavior this is dealt in this paper where the application of a numerical model implemented in comsol multiphysics cm comsol 2013 to solve the differential equations that idealize the behavior of the ground below a singular building is described in this way the hydrogeochemistry of the geological environment of the csf under natural conditions and its modification as a consequence of the construction of facilities were modeled this work was developed as part the activities of technical advice and specific research work within the framework of a research project between the geoenvironmental group of the university of castilla la mancha and a public state company enresa which is responsible of the design operation and management of the future facilities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the csf site in the vicinity of the town of villar de cañas is placed on the eastern flank of the tertiary syncline of villar de cañas within the so called loranca basin or intermediate depression the tertiary materials are located in the valley areas between the main mesozoic reliefs aligned in a n s to nw se direction fig 2 a the loranca basin was separated in the upper oligocene lower miocene from the madrid basin to the west by the formation of the sierra de altomira calvo et al 1989 within the synclinal it is possible to differentiate several lithologies of tertiary and quaternary materials fig 2b grouped in units and separated from each other by low angle discordances the tertiary units are interpreted as continental facies of the middle and distal zones of fluvial fans and floodplain deposits that formed in marsh and lake environments and are the most relevant materials in the study area a broad field and laboratory survey as shown in fig 3 was made for the characterization of the study area cienfuegos et al 2014 rueda et al 2015 to this end geophysical prospecting campaigns surveys were carried out in the field 31 940 m of electrical tomography 11 440 m of seismic reflection and a 3d mesh of seismic tomography 2900 m of trenches were excavated to analyze the neotectonics of the study area and 39 trial pits and nearly 200 geotechnical boreholes were drilled from this surveying campaign a more detailed litho stratigraphic profile was defined where various tertiary materials were differentiated at the site this way from bottom to top the paleogene neogene unit upn consisting on a set of mainly detritic deposits which contains clays silts sandstones and calcareous conglomerates was surveyed above this unit the lower unit ui including mudstones gypsiferous loams and sandstones was identified this unit is in turn under the lower balanzas unit lbi consisting of marly gypsiferous mudstones the balanzas gypsum unit yb composed of gypsifeorus materials with intercalated mudstones and the upper balanzas lutitas unit lbs consisting of dolomitic gypsifeorus mudstones were surveyed above the lbi unit these materials were identified in the field and laboratory survey allowing to observe certain heterogeneity of the materials within each unit additionally 141 hydraulic characterization tests 54 penetrometric tests 20 down hole tests 7 cross hole tests 22 full wave sonic tests and 33 multichannel analysis tests of surface waves or masw were completed unaltered samples were obtained in boreholes for the complete laboratory analysis of the material behavior and its characterization including grain size distribution mineralogy plasticity swelling pressure and oedometric behavior finally 82 piezometers were installed in 69 boreholes and 30 water sampling surveys including 56 surface water points 62 rainwater samples 257 water samples from rivers 106 geochemical profiles and 383 groundwater samples from boreholes were performed to characterize the geochemistry of the system from the samples taken in the field survey a geotechnical hydrogeological and mineralogical characterization of the materials was carried out some of these results are summarized in table 1 for the subunits considered in this paper ngyba ngybb yb1 and ybdis subunits were differentiated within unit yb for modeling purposes in this table based on the lithological and geotechnical characteristics of the materials similarly the lbs unit was divided into the lbs1 and lbs2 subunits 2 2 hydrogeology the characterization of the main hydrogeological units was based on an extensive survey of fieldwork of the 141 tests carried out in the field campaigns to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the main lithological units 105 were lugeon type tests and the rest were slug type tests pumping and pulse these tests allowed the estimation of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values cienfuegos et al 2014 rueda et al 2015 this surveying revealed that the geological structure of the study area is closely related to its hydrogeological performance as it differentiates shallow and local water flow from deeper and broader flow cienfuegos et al 2014 thus tertiary and quaternary materials whose heterogeneity and lithological composition confer a low permeability to the entire region include local aquifers with negligible regional flow on the other hand the broader flows beneath them are related to an aquifer system of high transmissivity formed by the large scale mesozoic carbonate materials that rise to the east of the installations at higher elevations the main recharge is produced to the east of the study area by rainfall infiltration and the main discharge of the flow is produced by lateral drainage toward the alluvial fan of the záncara river to the west fig 2a occasional and less important discharge occurs in points of the valley where more fractured or permeable materials outcrop discharge point fig 2b in general under the study area the present lithologies form a set that is heterogeneous both laterally and with depth and has low permeability leading to the existence of little significant flow 2 3 hydrogeochemistry the chemical analysis of the waters was based on data obtained from sampling surface water monitoring points within the study area rainwater from a meteorological station samples of záncara river water fig 3 and groundwater samples obtained from boreholes drilled in the csf site the groundwaters have medium or high salinity with highly variable amounts 1 4 105 g l of total dissolved solids tds based on the lithology that hosts them different groundwater facies were recognized in the csf area ranging from the shallow water of the recharge area in the east that presents a poorly mineralized ca2 so4 2 facies to the saline waters within the highly mineralized mg2 na ca2 so4 2 cl facies the main difference between these facies is the presence or absence of evaporitic deposits fig 4 a and b plots the concentration of total ca mg vs total hco3 and of total ca vs total hco3 in waters of the study area the relationship between bicarbonate and calcium maintains the stoichiometry of calcite dissolution only for some surface bicarbonated waters but not for the rest there is an excess of calcium in the lbs and yb groundwaters the same applies to sum of the concentrations of magnesium and calcium versus bicarbonate which is much greater than bicarbonate in most waters this means that in addition to carbonates other minerals control magnesium in water in the case of total na its relationship with the cl content indicates that other minerals besides halite are also providing sodium to the system see fig 4c sulfate on the other hand is the dominant anion in all groundwaters see table 2 the relationship between sulfate and calcium is shown in fig 4d where it is possible to observe a good correlation for surface waters except bicarbonate surface waters being its relationship controlled by gypsum dissolution see fig 4e from a sulfate concentration higher than 0 015 mol l equilibrium is achieved with gypsum and an increase in the sulfate content is observed without increasing the calcium content fig 4d this can be appreciated in groundwaters lbs and yb which have a higher sulfate content than surface waters due to its longer contact time with lithologies this increase in sulfate not correlated with calcium indicates that for these groundwaters there must be other mineral phases in addition to gypsum which provide sulfate to solution mainly na and or mg2 sulfates gómez et al 2014 thus hydrogeochemical surveying in the study area showed the existence of small quantities of other sulfated mineral phases with evidence of dissolution that could have provided sulfate and magnesium see appendix a other dissolution processes have probably occurred thus calcitization may have taken place resulting in the precipitation of calcite and providing mg2 and so4 2 ions to the dissolution however as shown in fig 4f there is no strong correlation between magnesium and sulfate highlighting the prevalence of other processes contributing to these ions in dissolution 2 4 system modeling the state functions mass balance and field equations defined in appendix b to model the hydro chemo mechanical behavior of the system were implemented in cm comsol 2013 this numerical tool was developed for solving systems of partial differential equations by the finite element method an explanation of the numerical strategy of the solution used in cm with the formulation of advanced mechanical constitutive models and their coupling to flow problems is summarized in navarro et al 2014a and alonso et al 2016 this strategy has been used in numerous simulation works carried out by the geoenvironmental engineering group of the university of castilla la mancha in the field of multiphysic problems such as the modeling of expansive clays navarro et al 2014b 2015 2016 or the geological storage of co2 alonso et al 2012a b the 2 d extended model defined in fig 5 a was used to analyze both the natural condition prior to the urbanization of the area and the situation reached after the construction of the csf the difference in the hydraulic head obtained between both simulations allowed us to define the area where the flow is affected by construction which is bounded by the isolines where the hydraulic head is equal to 798 1 m and 808 3 m these two lines where a dirichlet boundary condition was applied together with the flow line at the bottom identified in fig 5b where a zero flow natural condition was assumed defined the study area in fig 5c in this way it was possible to evaluate the system s behavior with greater precision using a refined mesh fig 6 in the top boundary an inflow rate value was imposed r1 to r4 fig 5c in accordance with cienfuegos et al 2014 at the discharge point shown in fig 5c a cauchy type boundary condition was assigned due to the existence of a natural drainage point in an orthogonal direction to the study plane this boundary condition describes a nodal water mass flux q kg s through a semi pervious layer connected to an external fluid source at different hydraulic head it can be written as 1 q ρ r b p b p l ρ g d b d where p l and d are the liquid pressure and the hydraulic head at the boundary respectively p b and d b are the pressure and elevation of the distant fluid source r b is the hydraulic conductivity multiplied by the cross section area of the node of the materials between the source and the model domain ρ is the density of the fluid and g is the gravity the values adopted in the discharge point d b 803 1 m p b atmospheric pressure and r b 2 3 e 06 m2 s 1 were obtained from the model described in cienfuegos et al 2014 through the calibration of the hydrogeological model of flow at regional scale despite the extensive field and testing surveys the characterization of the hydraulic properties of the material was not straightforward the high spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values obtained in the survey as a consequence of the presence of sands and gypsum intercalated in the lbs unit sands in the ui unit and mudstone in the yb unit as well as the variations caused by dissolution and compaction processes rueda et al 2015 made it necessary to calibrate the hydrogeological parameters used in the model to fit the field observations in addition the estimation of the retention curve parameters of the materials considered here assuming a van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 see appendix b was made based on laboratory tests gómez et al 2014 villar et al 2016 and group pedotransfer functions meyer et al 1997 the parameters used in the model shown in table 1 were obtained from the analysis of the extensive field and laboratory testing cienfuegos et al 2014 sondon 2016 rueda et al 2015 the choice of which chemical species to consider in the model was based on the experimental results obtained in the groundwater and surface water analyses carried out by gómez et al 2014 ca2 na mg2 and k cations and cl hco3 and so4 2 anions were used as the primary species or components see appendix b for definition in the model table 3 for the modeling of the dissolution processes until achieving present hydrogeochemical conditions it was necessary to estimate the initial minerals present in the different lithostratigraphic units as well as their quantities to this end and prior to the modeling in cm a first approximation was obtained by inverse modeling this approach has been used by several authors to calculate the quantities of dissolved or precipitated minerals in aqueous media from a known initial chemical composition acero et al 2015 asta et al 2015 carucci et al 2012 morán ramírez et al 2016 this way the moles of minerals that must dissolve or precipitate to account for the difference in composition between an initial and a final solution were calculated with the software phreeqc see table 4 with that aim the number of minerals in the inverse modeling was constrained including potential phases involved in the precipitation or dissolution processes based on the explanation given in appendix a where a possible mineral paragenesis hypothesis is considered among the minerals in the appendix gypsum bloedite epsomite and halite showed a good fit with the data shown in table 4 with the exception of gypsum which is always present the rest of minerals were assumed to have fully disappeared therefore the calculated number of dissolved moles of these minerals table 4 was used as a first estimation of their initial quantities in the case of gypsum it was concluded that the amount of dissolved minerals until reaching equilibrium was very low compared to the quantity measured in the lithostratigraphic units thus its present content was introduced as the initial value in the model nevertheless the initial estimates of minerals obtained from mass balance calculations with phreeqc did not consider the spatial distribution and hydrogeological regime of the system so they were fitted in the subsequent cm model the dissolution precipitation mineral reactions with the kinetic constants summarized in table 5 were considered in the cm model to reproduce the chemical concentrations of the natural system obtained by gómez et al 2014 the initial quantities of minerals in table 6 showed good agreement with field data as will be discussed later in this paper section 3 1 with an amount of moles of dissolved mineral phases within the range of values obtained in phreeqc table 4 furthermore in the absence of experimental data a value of σ c k 2 03e 08 mol mw 3 s 1 see table 5 obtained from ramón and alonso 2013 for shale rocks from back analysis of field heave records was used this value see eq b 23 for σ c k definition was used for calculation of gypsum dissolution precipitation reaction rates whereas the kinetic constants for the remaining chemical reactions had to be identified by the fitting of field data obtained from gómez et al 2014 a non diffusive flow type condition was considered in the western boundary for the chemical problem this boundary condition transports species out of the model domain by a fluid flow it assumes that advection is the dominating transport mechanism across outflow boundaries and therefore that diffusive transport can be disregarded its numerical expression is n d m i 0 where n is the normal vector pointing outwards the boundary d the diffusion coefficient and m i the concentration of species i on the eastern and top boundaries a dirichlet type condition in which the species concentrations correspond to freshwater with a low content of dissolved soluble salts initial waters see table 4 was imposed finally a zero flow natural condition n m i v i 0 where m i v i is the molar flow of species i see eq b 13 was applied to the bottom boundary in the mechanical problem a null displacement condition u v 0 where u and v are the displacements in the x and y direction respectively was assumed on the lateral and bottom boundaries whereas free displacement no constraints and no loads acting on the boundary was allowed on the top boundary of the model the values of the elastic parameters shown in table 1 were fitted from the experimental data in sondon 2016 and rueda et al 2015 the estimation of the response in the study area was computed in different stages related to the construction and start up processes of the facilities 1 the flow regime and chemical speciation under natural conditions 2 an excavation process up to the proposed height and 3 the construction and commissioning of the installation detailed explanations of these stages are given in the following section 3 results and discussion 3 1 natural condition the natural condition which represents the initial condition for the excavation stage is assumed to be a quasi steady situation obtained by adopting isothermal conditions as described in the previous section the main challenge of this simulation stage is to obtain a sound description of the hydro geochemical condition of the system for the validation of the hydrogeological model the values of hydraulic head in a 265 point grid distributed along the extended model fig 5a were obtained and compared with the values of the model described in cienfuegos et al 2014 with the adjustment of fig 5d the results shown in fig 7 reproduce the conceptual hydrogeological model proposed by cienfuegos et al 2014 which is characterized by two main flow components the first is a shallower flow from the areas surrounding the facilities that discharges to the záncara river toward the west and to the discharge point toward the east fig 7 the second and deeper flow moves from east to west in general the hydrogeological regime of the system is characterized by a very slow flow velocity as is expected in mudstone and gypsum formations which have very low permeabilities see table 1 this also limits the amount of chemical species transported by advection in addition the model reproduces the experimental values of the relationships between the concentrations of sulfate and cations at different control points fig 8 these relationships represent the contribution of the main geochemical processes in the system the contribution of the dissolution equilibrium of gypsum to the concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 ions and the contribution of the remaining minerals to the concentrations of na cl and mg2 ions since realistic values of the kinetic constants of the dissolution precipitation of the minerals in the study area are not available it is difficult to accurately predict this process as a function of time thus the concentration of so4 2 is used to evaluate the chemical progress in this stage fig 8a shows the evolution of the relationship between so4 2 and ca2 the curve increases in its first section before reaching the maximum value of dissolved ca2 content the slope of the curve in this section depends on the relationship between the reaction rates of the minerals considered fig 8 shows various results corresponding to different reaction rate relationships as well as the values for which a better fit to the experimental results was produced included in table 5 on the other hand the maximum value of ca2 in fig 8a represents the resulting concentration of so4 2 when the system reaches equilibrium with gypsum as the rest of the more soluble minerals considered in the model continue to contribute ions to the groundwater this process does not stabilize until their dissolution is complete maximum values of sulfate in figs 8a b c finally a quasi steady state situation is reached in which only very small hydrogeochemical variations associated with the transport processes in the system are produced the initial values of the concentrations of chemical species can be obtained from this situation for subsequent stages to assess the validity of the results obtained in different litho stratigraphic units their gypsum saturation index si values are shown in fig 9 together with the field data units yb lbs lbi ui ybdis the si values are plotted against the ca2 so4 2 ratio the relationship between them explains how gypsum achieves equilibrium in all groundwaters and allows us to interpret the spatial hydrogeochemical behavior of the system the model adequately reproduces the experimental results obtained in different units such that the waters of the lbs control point cp1 and yb control point cp2 are in equilibrium or saturated with gypsum si 0 while it obtains a lower ratio between ca2 and so4 2 for the yb as equilibrium with the minerals was reached in the latter later than in the lbs see fig 8a on the other hand in the lbi and ui units control point cp3 the ca2 so4 2 ratio is close to one based on these observations we conclude that the initial quantity of minerals considered in the system table 4 is a determining factor in the quantity of sulfate dissolved in the groundwater of different formations in equilibrium and that it largely controls the evolution of its chemistry an initial proportion of sulfate minerals relative to gypsum of less than 1 is enough to reproduce the results shown in figs 8 and 9 on the other hand the flow velocity exerts a minor influence on the hydrogeochemical evolution of this system under natural conditions as can be concluded from the evolution of the sulfate contents of formations with equal initial gypsum contents but different permeabilities such as lbi ui cp3 and ybdis control point cp4 see fig 9 3 2 excavation the simulation of the excavation stage was carried out using a smooth function that progressively cancels the effects of the volumetric forces weight young s modulus stiffness and hydraulic conductivity of the excavated materials blank area in fig 5c over a 100 day period to this end a cubic spline function was defined by means of cm functionality to impose a progressive transition for changes in the stress strain state and the hydrogeological regime in the domain where the excavation is applied this methodology is implemented in some well known numerical solvers to simulate excavation and construction processes element birth and death option in ansys 1998 for example and contrary to other strategies where finite elements are removed see gutierrez et al 2002 for example the calculation domain remains unchanged through the process the excavation reduces the vertical stress in the ground beneath the facilities causing its heave this response is not immediate as a negative consolidation process develops that lasts for several years after the completion of the excavation this process modifies the flow regime making it different than that in natural conditions the complex behavior of the hydrogeological regime along the excavation process is shown in fig 10 which depicts the flow vectors under the csf installations in different times during the process initially the flow trend in the area is from east to west fig 10a it should be noted that the flow vectors in the figure do not express their real magnitude no to scale since the materials existing under the installations have a broad variation on their hydraulic conductivity differences on flow velocities are of several orders of magnitude between different units so it would not be possible to clearly differentiate them in the figure therefore they should only be interpreted for visualization of the preferential flow direction where the size of the arrows is used as a relative indicator fig 10b shows the development of a downward flow trend after 50 days halfway through the excavation process with a small amount of flow going into ngybb this flow regime gradually changes due to the consolidation process until the end of the excavation works where the preferential flow direction is from the yb to the base of the excavated facility fig 10c the modification of the flow regime also affects the hydrogeochemical conditions in the vicinity of the csf they are altered by a calcium sulfate rich water intake coming from the yb unit toward the end of the excavation process resulting in an increase in the rate of dissolved sulfate content that lasts in the subsequent stage of calculation as shown for the cp1 in fig 11 despite the effects of this process on the groundwater chemistry the amount of gypsum precipitated because of the increase in the amount of sulfate in groundwater is practically negligible 1e 04 mol kgw 1 for the time period considered 3 3 construction and commissioning of the facilities after the excavation process the construction of the facility was modeled by introducing the effect of the foundation slab and the service loads transmitted by the building maintaining a fixed computational domain similar to the excavation stage this was done through functions describing the activation of the flexural rigidity and the density of the slab plus the service loads transmitted by the building over a period of 3 months estimated for its construction therefore at the beginning of the stage the flexural rigidity and load transmitted by the slab is null reaching the 100 of their values after 3 months in this way changes produced by the effect of the construction are introduced gradually over time so that the process is more realistic from the point of view of modeling and smoother from the point of view of the convergence of the numerical problem to take into account the hydraulic effects of the pavement a recharge value of zero was applied in the vicinity of the facilities the mechanical effect of the storage building on the soil was introduced by adding a vertical service stress of 375 kpa which corresponds to the dead weight of the building and the imposed loads during this calculation stage the flow rate changes again to adapt to the new boundary conditions as seen in fig 10d the water table level zero porewater pressure decreases throughout this calculation stage as do the flow velocity and rate of dissolved sulfate content under the installations see fig 11 this behavior could be explained by the variation of the hydrogeological conditions created during the excavation phase when water with a higher sulfate content from the yb units infiltrated the lbs unit where the excavation occurs the new variation in groundwater conditions with a considerable reduction in flow velocity leads to a decrease in the contribution of sulfate from the yb units by advection however the increase in sulfate experienced at the beginning of the calculation stage is due to the persistence of the ascending flow regime developed at the end of the negative consolidation process initiated in the previous stage and it continues until the end of the construction period of the facilities when the changes in the trend and reduction of sulfate contents occur the modification of the hydrogeochemical conditions exerts a very small influence on the mechanical problem fig 12 a shows the magnitude of the vertical displacements obtained in the hydro mechanical model compared to those obtained in the hydro chemical mechanical model along the cross section of the spent fuel storage building slab foundation furthermore due to the lack of accurate reaction rates values of the minerals considered in the model a study of the sensitivity to σck values was performed for the construction stage so various reaction rate reference values were considered even if reaction rates modify the evolution of the displacements predicted for the slab vertical displacements related to hydrogeochemistry changes are small in all cases and angular distortions remains under the 1 500 limit considered in common construction practice see fig 12b for higher reaction rates vertical displacements under the slab are reduced as volumetric straining exerted by mineral precipitation which opposes to the settlement related to consolidation process occurs faster nevertheless differences between hm and hcm models are minor in all cases for design purposes 4 conclusions the hydro chemo mechanical model proposed in this paper can reproduce the hydrogeochemical system around the central storage facility under natural conditions and predict its response to construction works this model reproduces the spatial distribution of the chemical composition of groundwater resulting from a process governed by equilibrium with gypsum using different initial contents and other sulfate soluble salts the results show a dependency between the evolution of groundwater composition and the modification of hydrogeological flow conditions after the construction and commissioning of facilities although this relationship can be useful for estimating trends in the evolution of groundwater chemistry it has a very small impact on the system in any case this model is a useful tool for the prediction of the evolution of hydrogeochemical systems subject to changes in natural conditions due to the construction of installations in complex environments acknowledgments this research work was carried out under the framework of the collaborative agreement between the university of castilla la mancha and the public state company enresa s a empresa nacional de residuos s a appendix a sulfate mineralogy and paragenesis the determination of a mineral paragenesis is not an easy task thus the existence of different types of waters and the complexity of the system with different chemical characteristics in the waters depending on the existing lithotypes could indicate different origins and processes of the formation of the waters this appendix presents a hypothesis of mineral paragenesis in the study area in order to obtain an approximation to the initial chemical conditions of the system prior to the excavation and the construction works thus the system was considered characterized as a continental evaporate environment according to the presence of gypsum in all the existing lithologies and the marked sulfated character of all the waters of the site except for some surface waters the geochemical evolution of such systems has been extensively studied by several authors e g hardie and eugster 1970 warren 2010 who established general patterns of the mineralogical associations that precipitate based on the predominant ions in water see table a 1 considering the hydrogeochemical characterization and hydrological composition patterns described by warren 2010 it is possible to determine the initial mineralogy in a given formation environment and its evolution in this way given the major presence of gypsum in the existing lithologies as well as the nature of the major cations ca2 mg2 na it seems appropriate to assign a mg2 na ca2 so4 2 cl type composition to the inflow waters at the time of sediment formation this type of pattern could theoretically have resulted in the precipitation of the following minerals bischofite mgcl2 6h2o bloedite na2so4 mgso4 4h2o epsomite mgso4 7h2o glauberite caso4 na2so4 gypsum caso4 2h2o halite nacl hexahydrite mgso4 6h2o kieserite mgso4 h2o mirabilite na2so4 10h2o and thernadite na2so4 this assumption is supported by the hydrogeochemical observations of the yb and lbs units which indicate that groundwater is in equilibrium with gypsum and that some other sulfate minerals are present that contain mg2 ca2 and na in their structures gómez et al 2014 villar et al 2016 however their precipitation from the inflow water should also have been influenced by the presence of other salts in solution and the temperature of the system which affected the minerals that were finally formed thus the existing climate and temperature could favor the precipitation of some minerals and inhibit the formation of others as the climate at the beginning of the lower miocene to which the lithostratigraphic units belong was similar or somewhat warmer than that at present van der meulen and daams 1992 the sodium and magnesium sulfates that would have predominantly precipitated would have been kieserite bloedite and thenardite as they are the most common minerals in this type of environment warren 2010 these phases could have precipitated either as primary phases depending on their mg2 and na contents or as secondary phases produced by the alteration of other precursor minerals in the case of double salts which form with slower precipitation kinetics the latter could be the case for bloedite whose formation can theoretically occur from previous phases of epsomite and mirabilite as described by sánchez moral et al 1998 other salts such as kieserite require pre nucleation conditions and long equilibrium times steiger et al 2011 that may not have occurred thus favoring the development of other phases that were more stable under those conditions such as epsomite regarding the sodium and calcium sulfates usual in this type of system some authors escavy et al 2012 ordoñez et al 1991 determined that in the nearby environment of the madrid basin the precipitation of anhydrite halite and magnesite occurred in the neogene lacustrine sequences and that other sodium sulfates such as glauberite and thenardite precipitated in the central areas although it is worth comparing these basins due to their proximity and formation environment in the loranca basin where the study area is located gypsum deposits are predominant relative to the mineral deposits of the central areas observed in the madrid basin because they developed in a basin with a smaller surface area and are probably less thick in its central part therefore summarizing the above assumptions and based on the theoretically possible mineralogical phases for mg2 na ca2 so4 2 cl type systems the most likely salts for this system are assumed to be halite gypsum bloedite epsomite glauberite and thenardite in this type of environment eugsterite na4ca so4 3 2h2o associated with secondary gypsum is sometimes observed as it develops from the transformation of glauberite therefore the same transformation could have occurred in the study area the presence of these salts was confirmed in the study of the minerals observed in samples obtained at different depths from the boreholes drilled in the study area x ray diffraction xrd analysis was used when the mineral proportion was found to be more than 1 by weight whereas qualitative analysis by scanning electron microscopy and x ray energy dispersion microanalysis meb edax was performed for phases found in smaller proportions these analyses detected the existence of the following types of sulfate minerals in minor quantities thenardite eugsterite glauberite bloedite and epsomite in all cases gypsum was found as a major mineral gómez et al 2014 see table a 2 while this hypothesis is based on existing sulfated phases other processes could have intervened in the evolution and mineral composition of the system thus for example the magnesic character of water may be due to processes of calcification of magnesite and or dolomite the latter also known as dedolomitization is a common process in karstic environments with the presence of gypsum which facilitates the reaction this was evidenced in different studies bischoff et al 1994 however in the recharge area meteoric waters can percolate into the surface units dissolving gypsum and providing calcium enriched waters that can replace magnesite by calcite releasing magnesium and sulphate this process is named the calcitization of magnesite and has been observed in the study area the high concentrations of sulfate in water higher than those attributable to the dissolution of gypsum seems to evidence the implication of a contribution of sulfate to the water from another source thus hydrogeochemical studies carried out in the area gómez et al 2014 indicate the existence of small quantities of different sulfate minerals bloedite epsomite thenardite eugsterite and glauberite with evidence of dissolution which could be partly responsible for the contribution of sulfate magnesium and sodium however the modeling implies an idealization of the existing conditions much more in a coupled model so some simplifications concerning the environment processes and reactions were carried out appendix b equations b 1 hydraulic equations the characterization of the water flow was obtained by solving the water mass balance equation b 1 m w t m w v w 0 where is the divergence operator the total mass of water per unit volume m w is b 2 m w m l m v ρ w s r ϕ ρ v 1 s r ϕ where m l is the mass of liquid water m v is the mass of vapor ρ w and ρ v are the density of liquid water and vapor respectively ϕ is the free porosity which is expressed as the volume of voids relative to the total volume and sr is the degree of saturation in liquid which is obtained in this work using the van genuchten 1980 model b 3 s r 1 α s n m where s is the matric suction and α n and m are fitting parameters the relationship n 1 1 m was assumed the matric suction is identified as capillary suction which can be calculated as b 4 s p g p l where p l and p g are the liquid and gas pressure respectively in the proposed model the gas pressure has a constant value equal to atmospheric pressure the water mass flow component in eq b 1 is b 5 m w v w m l v l m v v v where the mass liquid flow is b 6 m l v l m l v s ρ w q l where v s is the deformation velocity of the solid skeleton and q l is the advective component of fluid flow which is obtained using darcy s law b 7 q l k l k l μ l p l ρ w g z where k l k l and μ l are the intrinsic permeability relative permeability and dynamic viscosity of the liquid respectively is the gradient operator z is the vertical coordinate oriented upwards and g is the acceleration due to gravity assuming p g constant the advective gas flow was disregarded in the model thus the mass vapor flow is calculated as b 8 m v v v m v v s j v where jv defines the mass diffusion of vapor with respect to the average movement of the solid phase which is calculated using fick s law b 9 j v ϕ 1 s r τ d ρ v where d is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient and τ is tortuosity the density of vapor was obtained from its value in equilibrium with free water ρ vo using the following equation which is adapted from the relationship proposed by edlefsen and anderson 1943 b 10 ρ v ρ vo t exp s tot w w r t ρ w where r is the ideal gas constant t is temperature w w is the molecular weight of water and s tot is the total suction which in turn represents the sum of the matric suction s and the osmotic suction s o b 11 s tot s s o osmotic suction is a function of the molal concentration of dissolved species in pore water c i and the osmotic coefficient φ b 12 s o r t ρ w c i φ b 2 chemical equations the chemical model was implemented by introducing the mass balance equations of the species considered in the system a formulation adapted from jacobs and probstein 1996 was used b 13 ϕ s r m i t ϕ s r m i v i ϕ s r r i j 1 m ϕ s r β ji r min j i 1 n ϕ s r m min j t ϕ s r r min j j 1 m where m i in moles per unit volume of solution is the amount of species i in solution n is the number of species m min j is the amount of species precipitated as mineral j m is the number of minerals r i and r min j are the net production rates of the chemical species as a result of chemical reactions and dissolution precipitation processes respectively β ji defines whether species i is related to mineral j β ji 1 or there is no relationship through dissolution precipitation processes β ji 0 and ϕ sr m i v i is the molar flow due to the difficulties associated with the numerical resolution of eq b 13 as chemical reactions are faster than transport processes and in order to reduce the number of governing equations to be solved these equations were rewritten in terms of the total mass of the components considered this resulted in transport equations without production terms except for those used for the balance of minerals susceptible to precipitation or dissolution the cumulative total quantities t k of each component in solution are b 14 t k i 1 n α ik m i k 1 l where α ik is the stoichiometric coefficient of the contribution of each species i to component k and l is the number of components the molar flow per unit area mol m 2 s 1 is defined by the contribution of an advective component and a diffusive component b 15 ϕ s r m i v i ϕ s r m i v l j i ϕ s r m i v s m i q l j i where as was done when describing the vapor transport the hydrodynamic dispersion has been neglected identifying j i with the molecular diffusion given by fick s law b 16 j i ϕ s r d i m i where d i is the diffusion coefficient of species i by combining eqs b 13 and b 14 the variation of the amount of each component in solution is given by b 17 ϕ s r t k t t k ϕ s r v s q l i 1 n α ik j i i 1 n j 1 m α ik β ji ϕ s r r min j k 1 l the l components considered in the chemical model can be obtained from eq b 17 furthermore the n secondary species concentrations m i in table 3 can be obtained through chemical equilibrium equations b 18 log a i log k i eq k 1 l α ik log a k where k i eq is the equilibrim constant of the reaction and a i is the activity defined as b 19 a i m i γ i being γ i is the activity coefficient which is estimated using the wateq debye hückel formulation described in parkhurst 1995 electroneutrality is also assumed and therefore b 20 i 1 n z i m i 0 where z i is the charge of species i the dissolution or precipitation of a mineral was calculated based on its saturation index si which is defined as b 21 s i log 10 ω and b 22 ω i a p k s where iap is the ionic activity product of a dissociated species and k s is the solubility product constant of each mineral these values were obtained from the thermodynamic databases published by andra 2015 and delany and lundeen 1989 the precipitation of a mineral is considered to occur when ω 1 while dissolution occurs if ω 1 at ω 1 equilibrium is assumed the precipitation or dissolution rate for each mineral was obtained using an expression adapted from lasaga 1998 b 23 r min j σ c j κ j ξ j ϕ j ω j θ 1 η where σ c j is the specific surface κ j is the kinetic constant of dissolution precipitation ξ j is the value of the sign indicating whether the process results in the precipitation or dissolution of the mineral and ϕ j is the volumetric fraction of each mineral in the term in brackets θ and η are empirical constants b 3 mechanical equations the equilibrium equation is defined as b 24 σ tot ρ g z 0 where σ τοτ is the total stress vector the engineering or voigt notation is adopted for both stress and strain ρ is the natural density of the ground the following definition of constitutive stresses σ was considered b 25 σ σ tot p ϕ m where m is the vector expression of the delta kroneker and p ϕis a reference pressure which represents the maximum value between the liquid pressure p l and the gas pressure p g b 26 p ϕ max p g p l based on this definition constitutive stress represents effective stress in the case of a fully saturated medium and represents net stress in the case of a partially saturated medium e g gens 2010 in the model adopted in this work the variations in constitutive stress are obtained using the following expression b 27 d σ d e d ε d ε s d ε ch where d ε is the incremental strain d e is the elastic matrix associated with the mechanical load and the terms to the right of the deformation components are not associated with elastic mechanical deformation in the proposed model changes in strain are related to variations in suction d ε s and the precipitation or dissolution of minerals d ε ch the component of elastic strain variation due to suction variations is given by the following expression b 28 d ε s 1 3 κ s s p atm d s m where p atm is the value of atmospheric pressure and κ s is the stiffness of the soil against suction changes the component of the deformation rate associated with the precipitation or dissolution of minerals was calculated as ramón and alonso 2013 b 29 d ε ch 1 3 j m w j γ j ρ j r min j m where ρ j is the density of each of the mineral considered and γ j represents the volume fraction displaced during the dissolution precipitation process of each mineral the rate of dissolution or precipitation for each mineral is given in eq b 23 with the updated value of σ obtained by integrating eq b 27 see navarro et al 2014 the value of σ tot is calculated using eq b 25 this value is introduced into the mechanical computation module provided by cm to check the weighted fulfillment of eq b 24 i e the principle of virtual works to do this the weak form eq b 24 implemented by default in cm has been modified to ensure that the desired σ tot value is used and that the signs of stress and strain are those used in soil mechanics the sign criterion adopted in the formulation described before the void ratio e volume of voids per volume of soil value can be continuously updated using the equation b 30 e t v s e 1 e v s finally it is interesting to note that the beam formulation available for structural elements in the structural mechanics module of cm comsol 2013 was used to model the behavior of the building foundation in this module the structural elements are completely defined by the introduction of the material and the properties of the section 
678,this paper analyzes the natural hydrogeochemical conditions of the future central storage facility site at villar de cañas and evaluates the evolution of the system associated with its construction the characterization of the hydrogeochemical structure of the system is based on a comprehensive field and laboratory survey which allowed us to define both the distribution of materials and their hydro chemo mechanical properties under isothermal conditions the resulting observations were used to develop a numerical model in a multiphysics environment solver which was calibrated from the monitoring of the hydraulic head distribution and from detailed geochemical analysis of water samples the numerical model indicated that the behavior of the system is governed by a very slow underground flow regime and by equilibrium with gypsum and the dissolution of other sulfated phases these results also suggest that the construction of facilities will not significantly disturb these processes showing a very small effect of chemistry on the mechanical evolution vertical displacements keywords hydro chemo mechanical model numerical model environmental load construction groundwater 1 introduction the spanish central storage facility csf consists of a set of facilities designed to hold high level radioactive waste hlrw in villar de cañas central spain see fig 1 a the main origin of this waste is the operation and dismantling of existing nuclear power plants in spain whose individual facilities are close to reaching their maximum storage capacity given the operational life of the csf 60 years this represents a temporary solution prior to the final management of nuclear waste using other processes and the construction of a permanent repository thus until then the csf allows the adequate control of waste under safe conditions enresa 2017 to construct the csf facilities see fig 1b major earthworks and the urbanization of an area of more than 230 000 m2 are needed these operations involve the modification of pre existing natural conditions governed by a set of hydrogeochemical processes that are active and interrelated which must be studied in detail both to reduce the impact on the natural environment and to ensure the safe geotechnical and structural design of the facilities for instance in the ascó nuclear power plant the alteration of the site s natural conditions led to the transformation from anhydrite to gypsum deu lozano 2008 and the construction of underground works led to modifications in the swelling potential of clay sulfate rocks in several countries butscher et al 2011a b cases such as these and other studies relating to the impact of anthropogenic activities on hydrogeochemical conditions güler et al 2012 han et al 2017 green et al 2011 highlight the importance of detailed studies of the response of hydrogeochemical systems to modifications of their natural conditions an initial explanation of the natural hydrogeochemical behavior of the study area was carried out by gómez et al 2014 who established a conceptual model of its behavior supported by the development of local mathematical models using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 despite the relevance of this contribution the analysis of the effects of construction processes on its natural hydrogeochemical behavior has not yet been completed this issue must account for the spatial distribution of the litho stratigraphic units that comprise the system as well as their complex hydro chemo mechanical hcm behavior this is dealt in this paper where the application of a numerical model implemented in comsol multiphysics cm comsol 2013 to solve the differential equations that idealize the behavior of the ground below a singular building is described in this way the hydrogeochemistry of the geological environment of the csf under natural conditions and its modification as a consequence of the construction of facilities were modeled this work was developed as part the activities of technical advice and specific research work within the framework of a research project between the geoenvironmental group of the university of castilla la mancha and a public state company enresa which is responsible of the design operation and management of the future facilities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the csf site in the vicinity of the town of villar de cañas is placed on the eastern flank of the tertiary syncline of villar de cañas within the so called loranca basin or intermediate depression the tertiary materials are located in the valley areas between the main mesozoic reliefs aligned in a n s to nw se direction fig 2 a the loranca basin was separated in the upper oligocene lower miocene from the madrid basin to the west by the formation of the sierra de altomira calvo et al 1989 within the synclinal it is possible to differentiate several lithologies of tertiary and quaternary materials fig 2b grouped in units and separated from each other by low angle discordances the tertiary units are interpreted as continental facies of the middle and distal zones of fluvial fans and floodplain deposits that formed in marsh and lake environments and are the most relevant materials in the study area a broad field and laboratory survey as shown in fig 3 was made for the characterization of the study area cienfuegos et al 2014 rueda et al 2015 to this end geophysical prospecting campaigns surveys were carried out in the field 31 940 m of electrical tomography 11 440 m of seismic reflection and a 3d mesh of seismic tomography 2900 m of trenches were excavated to analyze the neotectonics of the study area and 39 trial pits and nearly 200 geotechnical boreholes were drilled from this surveying campaign a more detailed litho stratigraphic profile was defined where various tertiary materials were differentiated at the site this way from bottom to top the paleogene neogene unit upn consisting on a set of mainly detritic deposits which contains clays silts sandstones and calcareous conglomerates was surveyed above this unit the lower unit ui including mudstones gypsiferous loams and sandstones was identified this unit is in turn under the lower balanzas unit lbi consisting of marly gypsiferous mudstones the balanzas gypsum unit yb composed of gypsifeorus materials with intercalated mudstones and the upper balanzas lutitas unit lbs consisting of dolomitic gypsifeorus mudstones were surveyed above the lbi unit these materials were identified in the field and laboratory survey allowing to observe certain heterogeneity of the materials within each unit additionally 141 hydraulic characterization tests 54 penetrometric tests 20 down hole tests 7 cross hole tests 22 full wave sonic tests and 33 multichannel analysis tests of surface waves or masw were completed unaltered samples were obtained in boreholes for the complete laboratory analysis of the material behavior and its characterization including grain size distribution mineralogy plasticity swelling pressure and oedometric behavior finally 82 piezometers were installed in 69 boreholes and 30 water sampling surveys including 56 surface water points 62 rainwater samples 257 water samples from rivers 106 geochemical profiles and 383 groundwater samples from boreholes were performed to characterize the geochemistry of the system from the samples taken in the field survey a geotechnical hydrogeological and mineralogical characterization of the materials was carried out some of these results are summarized in table 1 for the subunits considered in this paper ngyba ngybb yb1 and ybdis subunits were differentiated within unit yb for modeling purposes in this table based on the lithological and geotechnical characteristics of the materials similarly the lbs unit was divided into the lbs1 and lbs2 subunits 2 2 hydrogeology the characterization of the main hydrogeological units was based on an extensive survey of fieldwork of the 141 tests carried out in the field campaigns to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the main lithological units 105 were lugeon type tests and the rest were slug type tests pumping and pulse these tests allowed the estimation of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values cienfuegos et al 2014 rueda et al 2015 this surveying revealed that the geological structure of the study area is closely related to its hydrogeological performance as it differentiates shallow and local water flow from deeper and broader flow cienfuegos et al 2014 thus tertiary and quaternary materials whose heterogeneity and lithological composition confer a low permeability to the entire region include local aquifers with negligible regional flow on the other hand the broader flows beneath them are related to an aquifer system of high transmissivity formed by the large scale mesozoic carbonate materials that rise to the east of the installations at higher elevations the main recharge is produced to the east of the study area by rainfall infiltration and the main discharge of the flow is produced by lateral drainage toward the alluvial fan of the záncara river to the west fig 2a occasional and less important discharge occurs in points of the valley where more fractured or permeable materials outcrop discharge point fig 2b in general under the study area the present lithologies form a set that is heterogeneous both laterally and with depth and has low permeability leading to the existence of little significant flow 2 3 hydrogeochemistry the chemical analysis of the waters was based on data obtained from sampling surface water monitoring points within the study area rainwater from a meteorological station samples of záncara river water fig 3 and groundwater samples obtained from boreholes drilled in the csf site the groundwaters have medium or high salinity with highly variable amounts 1 4 105 g l of total dissolved solids tds based on the lithology that hosts them different groundwater facies were recognized in the csf area ranging from the shallow water of the recharge area in the east that presents a poorly mineralized ca2 so4 2 facies to the saline waters within the highly mineralized mg2 na ca2 so4 2 cl facies the main difference between these facies is the presence or absence of evaporitic deposits fig 4 a and b plots the concentration of total ca mg vs total hco3 and of total ca vs total hco3 in waters of the study area the relationship between bicarbonate and calcium maintains the stoichiometry of calcite dissolution only for some surface bicarbonated waters but not for the rest there is an excess of calcium in the lbs and yb groundwaters the same applies to sum of the concentrations of magnesium and calcium versus bicarbonate which is much greater than bicarbonate in most waters this means that in addition to carbonates other minerals control magnesium in water in the case of total na its relationship with the cl content indicates that other minerals besides halite are also providing sodium to the system see fig 4c sulfate on the other hand is the dominant anion in all groundwaters see table 2 the relationship between sulfate and calcium is shown in fig 4d where it is possible to observe a good correlation for surface waters except bicarbonate surface waters being its relationship controlled by gypsum dissolution see fig 4e from a sulfate concentration higher than 0 015 mol l equilibrium is achieved with gypsum and an increase in the sulfate content is observed without increasing the calcium content fig 4d this can be appreciated in groundwaters lbs and yb which have a higher sulfate content than surface waters due to its longer contact time with lithologies this increase in sulfate not correlated with calcium indicates that for these groundwaters there must be other mineral phases in addition to gypsum which provide sulfate to solution mainly na and or mg2 sulfates gómez et al 2014 thus hydrogeochemical surveying in the study area showed the existence of small quantities of other sulfated mineral phases with evidence of dissolution that could have provided sulfate and magnesium see appendix a other dissolution processes have probably occurred thus calcitization may have taken place resulting in the precipitation of calcite and providing mg2 and so4 2 ions to the dissolution however as shown in fig 4f there is no strong correlation between magnesium and sulfate highlighting the prevalence of other processes contributing to these ions in dissolution 2 4 system modeling the state functions mass balance and field equations defined in appendix b to model the hydro chemo mechanical behavior of the system were implemented in cm comsol 2013 this numerical tool was developed for solving systems of partial differential equations by the finite element method an explanation of the numerical strategy of the solution used in cm with the formulation of advanced mechanical constitutive models and their coupling to flow problems is summarized in navarro et al 2014a and alonso et al 2016 this strategy has been used in numerous simulation works carried out by the geoenvironmental engineering group of the university of castilla la mancha in the field of multiphysic problems such as the modeling of expansive clays navarro et al 2014b 2015 2016 or the geological storage of co2 alonso et al 2012a b the 2 d extended model defined in fig 5 a was used to analyze both the natural condition prior to the urbanization of the area and the situation reached after the construction of the csf the difference in the hydraulic head obtained between both simulations allowed us to define the area where the flow is affected by construction which is bounded by the isolines where the hydraulic head is equal to 798 1 m and 808 3 m these two lines where a dirichlet boundary condition was applied together with the flow line at the bottom identified in fig 5b where a zero flow natural condition was assumed defined the study area in fig 5c in this way it was possible to evaluate the system s behavior with greater precision using a refined mesh fig 6 in the top boundary an inflow rate value was imposed r1 to r4 fig 5c in accordance with cienfuegos et al 2014 at the discharge point shown in fig 5c a cauchy type boundary condition was assigned due to the existence of a natural drainage point in an orthogonal direction to the study plane this boundary condition describes a nodal water mass flux q kg s through a semi pervious layer connected to an external fluid source at different hydraulic head it can be written as 1 q ρ r b p b p l ρ g d b d where p l and d are the liquid pressure and the hydraulic head at the boundary respectively p b and d b are the pressure and elevation of the distant fluid source r b is the hydraulic conductivity multiplied by the cross section area of the node of the materials between the source and the model domain ρ is the density of the fluid and g is the gravity the values adopted in the discharge point d b 803 1 m p b atmospheric pressure and r b 2 3 e 06 m2 s 1 were obtained from the model described in cienfuegos et al 2014 through the calibration of the hydrogeological model of flow at regional scale despite the extensive field and testing surveys the characterization of the hydraulic properties of the material was not straightforward the high spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values obtained in the survey as a consequence of the presence of sands and gypsum intercalated in the lbs unit sands in the ui unit and mudstone in the yb unit as well as the variations caused by dissolution and compaction processes rueda et al 2015 made it necessary to calibrate the hydrogeological parameters used in the model to fit the field observations in addition the estimation of the retention curve parameters of the materials considered here assuming a van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 see appendix b was made based on laboratory tests gómez et al 2014 villar et al 2016 and group pedotransfer functions meyer et al 1997 the parameters used in the model shown in table 1 were obtained from the analysis of the extensive field and laboratory testing cienfuegos et al 2014 sondon 2016 rueda et al 2015 the choice of which chemical species to consider in the model was based on the experimental results obtained in the groundwater and surface water analyses carried out by gómez et al 2014 ca2 na mg2 and k cations and cl hco3 and so4 2 anions were used as the primary species or components see appendix b for definition in the model table 3 for the modeling of the dissolution processes until achieving present hydrogeochemical conditions it was necessary to estimate the initial minerals present in the different lithostratigraphic units as well as their quantities to this end and prior to the modeling in cm a first approximation was obtained by inverse modeling this approach has been used by several authors to calculate the quantities of dissolved or precipitated minerals in aqueous media from a known initial chemical composition acero et al 2015 asta et al 2015 carucci et al 2012 morán ramírez et al 2016 this way the moles of minerals that must dissolve or precipitate to account for the difference in composition between an initial and a final solution were calculated with the software phreeqc see table 4 with that aim the number of minerals in the inverse modeling was constrained including potential phases involved in the precipitation or dissolution processes based on the explanation given in appendix a where a possible mineral paragenesis hypothesis is considered among the minerals in the appendix gypsum bloedite epsomite and halite showed a good fit with the data shown in table 4 with the exception of gypsum which is always present the rest of minerals were assumed to have fully disappeared therefore the calculated number of dissolved moles of these minerals table 4 was used as a first estimation of their initial quantities in the case of gypsum it was concluded that the amount of dissolved minerals until reaching equilibrium was very low compared to the quantity measured in the lithostratigraphic units thus its present content was introduced as the initial value in the model nevertheless the initial estimates of minerals obtained from mass balance calculations with phreeqc did not consider the spatial distribution and hydrogeological regime of the system so they were fitted in the subsequent cm model the dissolution precipitation mineral reactions with the kinetic constants summarized in table 5 were considered in the cm model to reproduce the chemical concentrations of the natural system obtained by gómez et al 2014 the initial quantities of minerals in table 6 showed good agreement with field data as will be discussed later in this paper section 3 1 with an amount of moles of dissolved mineral phases within the range of values obtained in phreeqc table 4 furthermore in the absence of experimental data a value of σ c k 2 03e 08 mol mw 3 s 1 see table 5 obtained from ramón and alonso 2013 for shale rocks from back analysis of field heave records was used this value see eq b 23 for σ c k definition was used for calculation of gypsum dissolution precipitation reaction rates whereas the kinetic constants for the remaining chemical reactions had to be identified by the fitting of field data obtained from gómez et al 2014 a non diffusive flow type condition was considered in the western boundary for the chemical problem this boundary condition transports species out of the model domain by a fluid flow it assumes that advection is the dominating transport mechanism across outflow boundaries and therefore that diffusive transport can be disregarded its numerical expression is n d m i 0 where n is the normal vector pointing outwards the boundary d the diffusion coefficient and m i the concentration of species i on the eastern and top boundaries a dirichlet type condition in which the species concentrations correspond to freshwater with a low content of dissolved soluble salts initial waters see table 4 was imposed finally a zero flow natural condition n m i v i 0 where m i v i is the molar flow of species i see eq b 13 was applied to the bottom boundary in the mechanical problem a null displacement condition u v 0 where u and v are the displacements in the x and y direction respectively was assumed on the lateral and bottom boundaries whereas free displacement no constraints and no loads acting on the boundary was allowed on the top boundary of the model the values of the elastic parameters shown in table 1 were fitted from the experimental data in sondon 2016 and rueda et al 2015 the estimation of the response in the study area was computed in different stages related to the construction and start up processes of the facilities 1 the flow regime and chemical speciation under natural conditions 2 an excavation process up to the proposed height and 3 the construction and commissioning of the installation detailed explanations of these stages are given in the following section 3 results and discussion 3 1 natural condition the natural condition which represents the initial condition for the excavation stage is assumed to be a quasi steady situation obtained by adopting isothermal conditions as described in the previous section the main challenge of this simulation stage is to obtain a sound description of the hydro geochemical condition of the system for the validation of the hydrogeological model the values of hydraulic head in a 265 point grid distributed along the extended model fig 5a were obtained and compared with the values of the model described in cienfuegos et al 2014 with the adjustment of fig 5d the results shown in fig 7 reproduce the conceptual hydrogeological model proposed by cienfuegos et al 2014 which is characterized by two main flow components the first is a shallower flow from the areas surrounding the facilities that discharges to the záncara river toward the west and to the discharge point toward the east fig 7 the second and deeper flow moves from east to west in general the hydrogeological regime of the system is characterized by a very slow flow velocity as is expected in mudstone and gypsum formations which have very low permeabilities see table 1 this also limits the amount of chemical species transported by advection in addition the model reproduces the experimental values of the relationships between the concentrations of sulfate and cations at different control points fig 8 these relationships represent the contribution of the main geochemical processes in the system the contribution of the dissolution equilibrium of gypsum to the concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 ions and the contribution of the remaining minerals to the concentrations of na cl and mg2 ions since realistic values of the kinetic constants of the dissolution precipitation of the minerals in the study area are not available it is difficult to accurately predict this process as a function of time thus the concentration of so4 2 is used to evaluate the chemical progress in this stage fig 8a shows the evolution of the relationship between so4 2 and ca2 the curve increases in its first section before reaching the maximum value of dissolved ca2 content the slope of the curve in this section depends on the relationship between the reaction rates of the minerals considered fig 8 shows various results corresponding to different reaction rate relationships as well as the values for which a better fit to the experimental results was produced included in table 5 on the other hand the maximum value of ca2 in fig 8a represents the resulting concentration of so4 2 when the system reaches equilibrium with gypsum as the rest of the more soluble minerals considered in the model continue to contribute ions to the groundwater this process does not stabilize until their dissolution is complete maximum values of sulfate in figs 8a b c finally a quasi steady state situation is reached in which only very small hydrogeochemical variations associated with the transport processes in the system are produced the initial values of the concentrations of chemical species can be obtained from this situation for subsequent stages to assess the validity of the results obtained in different litho stratigraphic units their gypsum saturation index si values are shown in fig 9 together with the field data units yb lbs lbi ui ybdis the si values are plotted against the ca2 so4 2 ratio the relationship between them explains how gypsum achieves equilibrium in all groundwaters and allows us to interpret the spatial hydrogeochemical behavior of the system the model adequately reproduces the experimental results obtained in different units such that the waters of the lbs control point cp1 and yb control point cp2 are in equilibrium or saturated with gypsum si 0 while it obtains a lower ratio between ca2 and so4 2 for the yb as equilibrium with the minerals was reached in the latter later than in the lbs see fig 8a on the other hand in the lbi and ui units control point cp3 the ca2 so4 2 ratio is close to one based on these observations we conclude that the initial quantity of minerals considered in the system table 4 is a determining factor in the quantity of sulfate dissolved in the groundwater of different formations in equilibrium and that it largely controls the evolution of its chemistry an initial proportion of sulfate minerals relative to gypsum of less than 1 is enough to reproduce the results shown in figs 8 and 9 on the other hand the flow velocity exerts a minor influence on the hydrogeochemical evolution of this system under natural conditions as can be concluded from the evolution of the sulfate contents of formations with equal initial gypsum contents but different permeabilities such as lbi ui cp3 and ybdis control point cp4 see fig 9 3 2 excavation the simulation of the excavation stage was carried out using a smooth function that progressively cancels the effects of the volumetric forces weight young s modulus stiffness and hydraulic conductivity of the excavated materials blank area in fig 5c over a 100 day period to this end a cubic spline function was defined by means of cm functionality to impose a progressive transition for changes in the stress strain state and the hydrogeological regime in the domain where the excavation is applied this methodology is implemented in some well known numerical solvers to simulate excavation and construction processes element birth and death option in ansys 1998 for example and contrary to other strategies where finite elements are removed see gutierrez et al 2002 for example the calculation domain remains unchanged through the process the excavation reduces the vertical stress in the ground beneath the facilities causing its heave this response is not immediate as a negative consolidation process develops that lasts for several years after the completion of the excavation this process modifies the flow regime making it different than that in natural conditions the complex behavior of the hydrogeological regime along the excavation process is shown in fig 10 which depicts the flow vectors under the csf installations in different times during the process initially the flow trend in the area is from east to west fig 10a it should be noted that the flow vectors in the figure do not express their real magnitude no to scale since the materials existing under the installations have a broad variation on their hydraulic conductivity differences on flow velocities are of several orders of magnitude between different units so it would not be possible to clearly differentiate them in the figure therefore they should only be interpreted for visualization of the preferential flow direction where the size of the arrows is used as a relative indicator fig 10b shows the development of a downward flow trend after 50 days halfway through the excavation process with a small amount of flow going into ngybb this flow regime gradually changes due to the consolidation process until the end of the excavation works where the preferential flow direction is from the yb to the base of the excavated facility fig 10c the modification of the flow regime also affects the hydrogeochemical conditions in the vicinity of the csf they are altered by a calcium sulfate rich water intake coming from the yb unit toward the end of the excavation process resulting in an increase in the rate of dissolved sulfate content that lasts in the subsequent stage of calculation as shown for the cp1 in fig 11 despite the effects of this process on the groundwater chemistry the amount of gypsum precipitated because of the increase in the amount of sulfate in groundwater is practically negligible 1e 04 mol kgw 1 for the time period considered 3 3 construction and commissioning of the facilities after the excavation process the construction of the facility was modeled by introducing the effect of the foundation slab and the service loads transmitted by the building maintaining a fixed computational domain similar to the excavation stage this was done through functions describing the activation of the flexural rigidity and the density of the slab plus the service loads transmitted by the building over a period of 3 months estimated for its construction therefore at the beginning of the stage the flexural rigidity and load transmitted by the slab is null reaching the 100 of their values after 3 months in this way changes produced by the effect of the construction are introduced gradually over time so that the process is more realistic from the point of view of modeling and smoother from the point of view of the convergence of the numerical problem to take into account the hydraulic effects of the pavement a recharge value of zero was applied in the vicinity of the facilities the mechanical effect of the storage building on the soil was introduced by adding a vertical service stress of 375 kpa which corresponds to the dead weight of the building and the imposed loads during this calculation stage the flow rate changes again to adapt to the new boundary conditions as seen in fig 10d the water table level zero porewater pressure decreases throughout this calculation stage as do the flow velocity and rate of dissolved sulfate content under the installations see fig 11 this behavior could be explained by the variation of the hydrogeological conditions created during the excavation phase when water with a higher sulfate content from the yb units infiltrated the lbs unit where the excavation occurs the new variation in groundwater conditions with a considerable reduction in flow velocity leads to a decrease in the contribution of sulfate from the yb units by advection however the increase in sulfate experienced at the beginning of the calculation stage is due to the persistence of the ascending flow regime developed at the end of the negative consolidation process initiated in the previous stage and it continues until the end of the construction period of the facilities when the changes in the trend and reduction of sulfate contents occur the modification of the hydrogeochemical conditions exerts a very small influence on the mechanical problem fig 12 a shows the magnitude of the vertical displacements obtained in the hydro mechanical model compared to those obtained in the hydro chemical mechanical model along the cross section of the spent fuel storage building slab foundation furthermore due to the lack of accurate reaction rates values of the minerals considered in the model a study of the sensitivity to σck values was performed for the construction stage so various reaction rate reference values were considered even if reaction rates modify the evolution of the displacements predicted for the slab vertical displacements related to hydrogeochemistry changes are small in all cases and angular distortions remains under the 1 500 limit considered in common construction practice see fig 12b for higher reaction rates vertical displacements under the slab are reduced as volumetric straining exerted by mineral precipitation which opposes to the settlement related to consolidation process occurs faster nevertheless differences between hm and hcm models are minor in all cases for design purposes 4 conclusions the hydro chemo mechanical model proposed in this paper can reproduce the hydrogeochemical system around the central storage facility under natural conditions and predict its response to construction works this model reproduces the spatial distribution of the chemical composition of groundwater resulting from a process governed by equilibrium with gypsum using different initial contents and other sulfate soluble salts the results show a dependency between the evolution of groundwater composition and the modification of hydrogeological flow conditions after the construction and commissioning of facilities although this relationship can be useful for estimating trends in the evolution of groundwater chemistry it has a very small impact on the system in any case this model is a useful tool for the prediction of the evolution of hydrogeochemical systems subject to changes in natural conditions due to the construction of installations in complex environments acknowledgments this research work was carried out under the framework of the collaborative agreement between the university of castilla la mancha and the public state company enresa s a empresa nacional de residuos s a appendix a sulfate mineralogy and paragenesis the determination of a mineral paragenesis is not an easy task thus the existence of different types of waters and the complexity of the system with different chemical characteristics in the waters depending on the existing lithotypes could indicate different origins and processes of the formation of the waters this appendix presents a hypothesis of mineral paragenesis in the study area in order to obtain an approximation to the initial chemical conditions of the system prior to the excavation and the construction works thus the system was considered characterized as a continental evaporate environment according to the presence of gypsum in all the existing lithologies and the marked sulfated character of all the waters of the site except for some surface waters the geochemical evolution of such systems has been extensively studied by several authors e g hardie and eugster 1970 warren 2010 who established general patterns of the mineralogical associations that precipitate based on the predominant ions in water see table a 1 considering the hydrogeochemical characterization and hydrological composition patterns described by warren 2010 it is possible to determine the initial mineralogy in a given formation environment and its evolution in this way given the major presence of gypsum in the existing lithologies as well as the nature of the major cations ca2 mg2 na it seems appropriate to assign a mg2 na ca2 so4 2 cl type composition to the inflow waters at the time of sediment formation this type of pattern could theoretically have resulted in the precipitation of the following minerals bischofite mgcl2 6h2o bloedite na2so4 mgso4 4h2o epsomite mgso4 7h2o glauberite caso4 na2so4 gypsum caso4 2h2o halite nacl hexahydrite mgso4 6h2o kieserite mgso4 h2o mirabilite na2so4 10h2o and thernadite na2so4 this assumption is supported by the hydrogeochemical observations of the yb and lbs units which indicate that groundwater is in equilibrium with gypsum and that some other sulfate minerals are present that contain mg2 ca2 and na in their structures gómez et al 2014 villar et al 2016 however their precipitation from the inflow water should also have been influenced by the presence of other salts in solution and the temperature of the system which affected the minerals that were finally formed thus the existing climate and temperature could favor the precipitation of some minerals and inhibit the formation of others as the climate at the beginning of the lower miocene to which the lithostratigraphic units belong was similar or somewhat warmer than that at present van der meulen and daams 1992 the sodium and magnesium sulfates that would have predominantly precipitated would have been kieserite bloedite and thenardite as they are the most common minerals in this type of environment warren 2010 these phases could have precipitated either as primary phases depending on their mg2 and na contents or as secondary phases produced by the alteration of other precursor minerals in the case of double salts which form with slower precipitation kinetics the latter could be the case for bloedite whose formation can theoretically occur from previous phases of epsomite and mirabilite as described by sánchez moral et al 1998 other salts such as kieserite require pre nucleation conditions and long equilibrium times steiger et al 2011 that may not have occurred thus favoring the development of other phases that were more stable under those conditions such as epsomite regarding the sodium and calcium sulfates usual in this type of system some authors escavy et al 2012 ordoñez et al 1991 determined that in the nearby environment of the madrid basin the precipitation of anhydrite halite and magnesite occurred in the neogene lacustrine sequences and that other sodium sulfates such as glauberite and thenardite precipitated in the central areas although it is worth comparing these basins due to their proximity and formation environment in the loranca basin where the study area is located gypsum deposits are predominant relative to the mineral deposits of the central areas observed in the madrid basin because they developed in a basin with a smaller surface area and are probably less thick in its central part therefore summarizing the above assumptions and based on the theoretically possible mineralogical phases for mg2 na ca2 so4 2 cl type systems the most likely salts for this system are assumed to be halite gypsum bloedite epsomite glauberite and thenardite in this type of environment eugsterite na4ca so4 3 2h2o associated with secondary gypsum is sometimes observed as it develops from the transformation of glauberite therefore the same transformation could have occurred in the study area the presence of these salts was confirmed in the study of the minerals observed in samples obtained at different depths from the boreholes drilled in the study area x ray diffraction xrd analysis was used when the mineral proportion was found to be more than 1 by weight whereas qualitative analysis by scanning electron microscopy and x ray energy dispersion microanalysis meb edax was performed for phases found in smaller proportions these analyses detected the existence of the following types of sulfate minerals in minor quantities thenardite eugsterite glauberite bloedite and epsomite in all cases gypsum was found as a major mineral gómez et al 2014 see table a 2 while this hypothesis is based on existing sulfated phases other processes could have intervened in the evolution and mineral composition of the system thus for example the magnesic character of water may be due to processes of calcification of magnesite and or dolomite the latter also known as dedolomitization is a common process in karstic environments with the presence of gypsum which facilitates the reaction this was evidenced in different studies bischoff et al 1994 however in the recharge area meteoric waters can percolate into the surface units dissolving gypsum and providing calcium enriched waters that can replace magnesite by calcite releasing magnesium and sulphate this process is named the calcitization of magnesite and has been observed in the study area the high concentrations of sulfate in water higher than those attributable to the dissolution of gypsum seems to evidence the implication of a contribution of sulfate to the water from another source thus hydrogeochemical studies carried out in the area gómez et al 2014 indicate the existence of small quantities of different sulfate minerals bloedite epsomite thenardite eugsterite and glauberite with evidence of dissolution which could be partly responsible for the contribution of sulfate magnesium and sodium however the modeling implies an idealization of the existing conditions much more in a coupled model so some simplifications concerning the environment processes and reactions were carried out appendix b equations b 1 hydraulic equations the characterization of the water flow was obtained by solving the water mass balance equation b 1 m w t m w v w 0 where is the divergence operator the total mass of water per unit volume m w is b 2 m w m l m v ρ w s r ϕ ρ v 1 s r ϕ where m l is the mass of liquid water m v is the mass of vapor ρ w and ρ v are the density of liquid water and vapor respectively ϕ is the free porosity which is expressed as the volume of voids relative to the total volume and sr is the degree of saturation in liquid which is obtained in this work using the van genuchten 1980 model b 3 s r 1 α s n m where s is the matric suction and α n and m are fitting parameters the relationship n 1 1 m was assumed the matric suction is identified as capillary suction which can be calculated as b 4 s p g p l where p l and p g are the liquid and gas pressure respectively in the proposed model the gas pressure has a constant value equal to atmospheric pressure the water mass flow component in eq b 1 is b 5 m w v w m l v l m v v v where the mass liquid flow is b 6 m l v l m l v s ρ w q l where v s is the deformation velocity of the solid skeleton and q l is the advective component of fluid flow which is obtained using darcy s law b 7 q l k l k l μ l p l ρ w g z where k l k l and μ l are the intrinsic permeability relative permeability and dynamic viscosity of the liquid respectively is the gradient operator z is the vertical coordinate oriented upwards and g is the acceleration due to gravity assuming p g constant the advective gas flow was disregarded in the model thus the mass vapor flow is calculated as b 8 m v v v m v v s j v where jv defines the mass diffusion of vapor with respect to the average movement of the solid phase which is calculated using fick s law b 9 j v ϕ 1 s r τ d ρ v where d is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient and τ is tortuosity the density of vapor was obtained from its value in equilibrium with free water ρ vo using the following equation which is adapted from the relationship proposed by edlefsen and anderson 1943 b 10 ρ v ρ vo t exp s tot w w r t ρ w where r is the ideal gas constant t is temperature w w is the molecular weight of water and s tot is the total suction which in turn represents the sum of the matric suction s and the osmotic suction s o b 11 s tot s s o osmotic suction is a function of the molal concentration of dissolved species in pore water c i and the osmotic coefficient φ b 12 s o r t ρ w c i φ b 2 chemical equations the chemical model was implemented by introducing the mass balance equations of the species considered in the system a formulation adapted from jacobs and probstein 1996 was used b 13 ϕ s r m i t ϕ s r m i v i ϕ s r r i j 1 m ϕ s r β ji r min j i 1 n ϕ s r m min j t ϕ s r r min j j 1 m where m i in moles per unit volume of solution is the amount of species i in solution n is the number of species m min j is the amount of species precipitated as mineral j m is the number of minerals r i and r min j are the net production rates of the chemical species as a result of chemical reactions and dissolution precipitation processes respectively β ji defines whether species i is related to mineral j β ji 1 or there is no relationship through dissolution precipitation processes β ji 0 and ϕ sr m i v i is the molar flow due to the difficulties associated with the numerical resolution of eq b 13 as chemical reactions are faster than transport processes and in order to reduce the number of governing equations to be solved these equations were rewritten in terms of the total mass of the components considered this resulted in transport equations without production terms except for those used for the balance of minerals susceptible to precipitation or dissolution the cumulative total quantities t k of each component in solution are b 14 t k i 1 n α ik m i k 1 l where α ik is the stoichiometric coefficient of the contribution of each species i to component k and l is the number of components the molar flow per unit area mol m 2 s 1 is defined by the contribution of an advective component and a diffusive component b 15 ϕ s r m i v i ϕ s r m i v l j i ϕ s r m i v s m i q l j i where as was done when describing the vapor transport the hydrodynamic dispersion has been neglected identifying j i with the molecular diffusion given by fick s law b 16 j i ϕ s r d i m i where d i is the diffusion coefficient of species i by combining eqs b 13 and b 14 the variation of the amount of each component in solution is given by b 17 ϕ s r t k t t k ϕ s r v s q l i 1 n α ik j i i 1 n j 1 m α ik β ji ϕ s r r min j k 1 l the l components considered in the chemical model can be obtained from eq b 17 furthermore the n secondary species concentrations m i in table 3 can be obtained through chemical equilibrium equations b 18 log a i log k i eq k 1 l α ik log a k where k i eq is the equilibrim constant of the reaction and a i is the activity defined as b 19 a i m i γ i being γ i is the activity coefficient which is estimated using the wateq debye hückel formulation described in parkhurst 1995 electroneutrality is also assumed and therefore b 20 i 1 n z i m i 0 where z i is the charge of species i the dissolution or precipitation of a mineral was calculated based on its saturation index si which is defined as b 21 s i log 10 ω and b 22 ω i a p k s where iap is the ionic activity product of a dissociated species and k s is the solubility product constant of each mineral these values were obtained from the thermodynamic databases published by andra 2015 and delany and lundeen 1989 the precipitation of a mineral is considered to occur when ω 1 while dissolution occurs if ω 1 at ω 1 equilibrium is assumed the precipitation or dissolution rate for each mineral was obtained using an expression adapted from lasaga 1998 b 23 r min j σ c j κ j ξ j ϕ j ω j θ 1 η where σ c j is the specific surface κ j is the kinetic constant of dissolution precipitation ξ j is the value of the sign indicating whether the process results in the precipitation or dissolution of the mineral and ϕ j is the volumetric fraction of each mineral in the term in brackets θ and η are empirical constants b 3 mechanical equations the equilibrium equation is defined as b 24 σ tot ρ g z 0 where σ τοτ is the total stress vector the engineering or voigt notation is adopted for both stress and strain ρ is the natural density of the ground the following definition of constitutive stresses σ was considered b 25 σ σ tot p ϕ m where m is the vector expression of the delta kroneker and p ϕis a reference pressure which represents the maximum value between the liquid pressure p l and the gas pressure p g b 26 p ϕ max p g p l based on this definition constitutive stress represents effective stress in the case of a fully saturated medium and represents net stress in the case of a partially saturated medium e g gens 2010 in the model adopted in this work the variations in constitutive stress are obtained using the following expression b 27 d σ d e d ε d ε s d ε ch where d ε is the incremental strain d e is the elastic matrix associated with the mechanical load and the terms to the right of the deformation components are not associated with elastic mechanical

application of smev provides spatially consistent estimates of extreme quantiles in line with regional gev estimates and generally characterized by reduced uncertainties the sensitivity of extreme quantiles to changes and uncertainty in the intensity and yearly occurrences of events generated by different synoptic classes is examined and an application of smev for the projection of future extremes is provided keywords extreme value analysis metastatistical extreme value nonstationary processes climate change daily precipitation 1 introduction quantifying hydro meteorological extremes in a changing climate is crucial to build resilience and plan water resources management and hydrological design frequency analysis consists in the identification of a cumulative distribution function whose upper tail represents the probability of exceedance of high extreme values of the stochastic process of interest this is generally done assuming no temporal dependence stationarity in the statistical description of the process but evidences of climate change e g hall et al 2014 fisher and knutti 2016 call for the development of models able to cope with changing nonstationary conditions the term nonstationary refers to a time indexed process subject to temporal changes in its statistical description in this study in particular we will address deterministic temporal changes koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 in both a the probability of occurrence of the process and b the parameters describing its cumulative distribution function a review of earlier studies on nonstationary frequency analysis is provided by khaliq et al 2006 recent modelling efforts of future hydro meteorological extremes are based on two main approaches the first one consists of detecting trends in the process of interest from either observations or climate models and extrapolating such trends using extreme value formulations e g villarini et al 2009 westra et al 2013 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 agilan and umamahesh 2017 the second approach relies on the identification and quantification of causative relations between the process of interest and other explanatory variables e g hardwick jones et al 2010 berg et al 2013 lepore et al 2015 serago and vogel 2018 with the intent of gathering information on the future characteristics of extreme processes from the changes in the explanatory variables a relevant example is the scaling relation between temperature and extreme precipitation object of numerous studies in recent years e g westra et al 2014 dobrinski et al 2016 wasko et al 2016 nonetheless these approaches are subject to assumptions uncertainties and overfitting issues that prevent the current models from being fully trusted morin 2011 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2018 serinaldi et al 2018 a common background to these analyses is extreme value theory assuming independence and identical distribution of the examined process i id assumption and large enough n number of occurrences of the process in each year asymptotic assumption the distribution of extremes may only converge to known distribution classes fischer and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 however hydro meteorological extremes may arise from multiple underlying processes e g convective versus stratiform precipitation just to mention a simple example so that the i id assumption is often not met moreover the number of independent events in a year is far from being infinite violating the asymptotic assumption to overcome the violation of the i id assumption some studies included seasonal separation of the events willems 2000 fisher 2018 iliopoulou et al 2018 or multi variate models considering external explanatory variables in the formulation sun et al 2014 pineda and willems 2018 these approaches allow to include external information in the perspective of future climate modeling and were shown to improve the estimation of extreme quantiles for the studied cases this however requires the estimation of a large number of parameters a complicated effort that can give rise to important uncertainties due to the limited data availability and when interested in future projections to the inaccuracy characterizing extremes in climate models e g kendon et al 2017 meresa and romanowicz 2017 the metastatistical extreme value mev framework proposed by marani and ignaccolo 2015 relaxes the asymptotic assumption and allows the identification of the parameters from a largely increased data sample zorzetto et al 2016 moreover it has the potential to model extremes arising from multiple distributions thus providing potential to overcome both of the above highlighted issues marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2018 explicitly nonstationary formulations of the mev approach as well as formulations including extremes arising from multiple types of events however are not available so far the objective of this study is to introduce a simplified mev formulation smev in which inter annual variations are neglected and extremes are described as functions of the average properties of multiple underlying processes specific objectives are a expanding the mev framework to extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes b introducing the smev formulation c applying smev to daily precipitation records in the eastern mediterranean and d providing some example applications to sensitivity analyses and climate projections the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the analytical formulation of smev section 3 describes the application of smev to frequency analysis of daily precipitation in the eastern mediterranean and to sensitivity analyses and future projections section 4 discusses the results of the study and section 5 summarizes the main conclusions 2 formulation 2 1 mev formulation for extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes the mev approach marani and ignaccolo 2015 treats as stochastic variables both the parameters defining the cumulative distribution function of the process magnitudes observed during a given year and the number of times a process hereinafter termed ordinary event or simply event is observed in each of the years denoting with m the number of available years nj the number of events observed during the j th year and f the cumulative distribution function of the distribution class describing the ordinary event magnitude x described by l parameters θ j θ j 1 θ j l the mev cumulative distribution function can be written as a sample average of the cumulative distribution functions observed during the sampled years 1 m e v x 1 m j 1 m f x θ j n j the reader interested in additional details is referred to marani and ignaccolo 2015 and zorzetto et al 2016 the mev approach relaxes the asymptotic assumption of extreme value theory and makes use of all the available data to fit the distribution parameters this drastically decreases the fitting uncertainty with respect to classic extreme value theory which only exploits a small subset of the data i e the annual maxima or the peaks exceeding a high threshold analyses of the performance of the methodology with respect to classic extreme value analyses can be found in marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 and marra et al 2018 on the other hand the formulation in eq 1 requires prior knowledge of the distribution class describing the underlying ordinary events and assumes identical distribution of the ordinary events within each year whilst information on the former can be gained mining the available data identical distribution of the ordinary events within each year can still represent strong requirement the presence of extremes emerging from multiple distributions needs to be considered to accurately use the method marra et al 2018 relaxing the assumption of identical distribution within each year multiple types of ordinary events can be included in the framework let s consider s types of ordinary events and denote with fi the distribution class describing the i th type of ordinary events parametrized at the j th year by θ i j if the i th type of ordinary events is sampled n i j times during the j th year so that n j i 1 s n i j the mev cumulative distribution function can be written as 2 m e v x 1 m j 1 m i 1 s f i x θ i j n i j this formulation allows to explicitly include different types of ordinary events in the frequency analysis of extreme events thus permitting to quantify the probability of occurrence of extremes caused by multiple underlying processes in practice one needs to match each ordinary event to the corresponding type fit each fi to the n i j ordinary events of the i th type occurred during the j th year and then use eq 2 to derive the compound cumulative distribution function describing the resulting extremes this however requires to identify a large number of parameters m i 1 s 1 l i a problematic task in presence of limited data samples e g for situations in which only a limited number of events is observed each year marra et al 2018 which is even emphasized when the ordinary events are divided into multiple types 2 2 simplified mev smev formulation allowing inter annual variability of the parameters describing the ordinary events distribution the mev framework allows to derive accurate frequency analyses able to represent the period over which data is analyzed and implicitly accounting for possible nonstationary conditions however this theoretical advantage needs to be balanced with the practical need to estimate parameters from limited number of yearly ordinary events in fact parameter estimation uncertainty may lead to biased estimates of the quantiles of interest particularly important in situations in which only a limited number of events per year is observed marra et al 2018 in fact it should be noted that the inter annual variations of the ordinary events distribution parameters reported by previous studies e g marani and ignaccolo 2015 are co caused by three effects i inter annual variations of the characteristics of the ordinary events ii parameter estimation uncertainty and iii varying proportions in the occurrence of different types of ordinary events in case the identical distribution assumption within each year is not verified in order to be correctly represented inter annual variations of the parameters need to be larger than the uncertainty introduced by the other effects fig s1 shows the uncertainty related to the parameter estimation method for a typical case which gives a sense of the minimum detectable inter annual variations of the parameters as a function of the number of ordinary events per year in this section we introduce a simplified formulation in which the inter annual variability is neglected both in the ordinary events distributions i e assuming identical distribution of the ordinary events of each type identical distribution assumption and in their number of yearly occurrences mean probability of occurrence approximation for each event type the identical distribution assumption should not come as a surprise as adopted by all classic methods based on extreme value theory and already suggested as a way to decrease the parameter estimation uncertainty by marani and ignaccolo 2015 and marra et al 2018 moreover it allows parsimonious li parameter expressions for the ordinary events note that when multiple types of ordinary events are considered the assumption should be intended as identical distribution of the events of each type during the years different event types will still be described by different distributions the mean probability of occurrence approximation of the traditional mev expression will be analyzed more in detail in the following the identical distribution assumption allows to factorize the terms of eq 2 in which the mean number of ordinary events per year appears in the exponent 3 m e v x i 1 s f i x θ i n i 1 m j 1 m i 1 s f i x θ i δ i j where n i 1 m j 1 m n i j is the mean number of i th type ordinary events occurring in a year δ i j n i j ni are the deviations of the yearly values n i j from the mean ni and the term 4 r 1 m j 1 m i 1 s f i x θ i δ i j contains all the information on the inter annual variability of n i j in addition the identical distribution assumption allows to analytically express r as a function of the compound probability mev x without dependence on the distributions fi and on their parameters as shown in fig 1 taking the limit case f 1 i e analyzing extremes the term r goes to 1 quickly becoming negligible for the estimation of return periods exceeding 10 years for a wide variety of distributions of n i j fig 1 fig s2 the simplified mev smev formulation in which any inter annual variability is neglected is thus written as 5 s m e v x i 1 s f i x θ i n i the smev formulation drastically reduces the number of parameters to i 1 s 1 l i and allows a direct interpretation of their meaning for each event type li parameters describe the ordinary events intensity θ i and one parameter is related to their probability of occurrence ni such parameters have clear physical meaning and can be extracted relatively easily from observation or from either global regional circulation models climate projections and reanalyses e g tabari and willems 2018 which increasingly represent the sources of available information when past data records are analyzed eq 5 provides information for the average conditions observed during the study period while it assumes a prognostic meaning for conditions in which the values of the parameters can be inferred simulated or projected noteworthy the term r can be computed for any distribution of the number of yearly occurrences n i j again with no dependence on the fi and on their parameters when expressed as a function of the estimated return period and in case its impact is considered important used to adjust the smev estimates under nonstationary conditions both the intensity of the ordinary evens i e the θ i parameters if one reasonably assumes no changes in the functional forms fi and their yearly probability of occurrence i e ni can be expressed as a function of time yielding the smev nonstationary formulation 6 s m e v x t i 1 s f i x θ i t n i t in the following we explore the merit of describing changing extremes by incorporating a temporal dependence in a the intensity characteristics of different types of ordinary events θ i t and b their individual probability of occurrence ni t changes in any of the parameters in eq 6 can be easily modeled including simultaneous changes of intensity and occurrence of different types of events 3 application in this section we show an application of smev for a modeling extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes b quantifying the sensitivity of extreme quantiles to potential changes in the intensity and probability of occurrence of the individual type of ordinary event and c providing an illustrative example of future projections based on simple trends in the characteristics of the ordinary events we focus on daily precipitation which is among the most widely investigated hydro meteorological processes the approach however applies to any process for which the characteristics of the upper tail can be described by the ordinary events precipitation is caused by the condensation of atmospheric water vapor due to the lifting and cooling of air masses which can be driven by different synoptic meteorological and local conditions that in turn generate different precipitation patterns e g hirschboeck 1987 yarnal 1993 a classic example is the distinct characteristics of convective and stratiform precipitation but as in this application different types of events can be identified depending on the climatology of the region of interest 3 1 study area and data the eastern mediterranean region focus of this application is characterized by unique climatic conditions in which the mediterranean climate characterizing the coastal region abruptly changes to semiarid and arid in the space of few tens of kilometers fig 2 precipitation occurs in the winter months and transitional seasons with almost no rainfall from mid june to mid september precipitation is usually brought by mediterranean lows with minor but still relevant contributions from the active red sea trough a synoptic system that may bring humidity from the red sea de vries et al 2013 on rare occasions other synoptic systems bring extreme precipitation to the region e g armon et al 2018 we focus on two classes of synoptic systems known to display distinct precipitation characteristics e g dayan and morin 2006 belachsen et al 2017 armon et al 2018 a mediterranean lows hereinafter type 1 lows including both cyprus lows and lows to the east in the classification by belachsen et al 2017 and b active red sea troughs and other synoptic systems hereinafter type 2 other observations and model projections show substantial changes in the precipitation climatology of the region in response to changes in the frequency of occurrence of these synoptic systems making the topic of high relevance e g alpert et al 2002 ziv et al 2010 peleg et al 2015a hochman et al 2018b a large dataset of daily precipitation made available by the israel meteorological service including data from 170 stations with at least 60 year record in the period 1948 2018 is used fig 2 for each station ordinary events are defined as non zero i e above or equal to 0 1 mm daily precipitation amounts zorzetto et al 2016 and labeled according to the generating synoptic class derived from the classification by alpert et al 2004 and hochman et al 2018a 3 2 smev formulation for daily precipitation following the reasoning by wilson and tuomi 2005 and previous findings marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 papalexiou et al 2018 ordinary events are modeled using a weibull distribution weibull 1951 whose cumulative distribution function can be written as 7 w x λ κ 1 e x λ κ where λ 0 and κ 0 are the scale and shape parameters respectively larger scale parameters are associated to larger magnitude of the average events and larger shape parameters to lighter upper tail of the distribution we use the smev formulation assuming the presence of multiple processes underlying the daily precipitation extremes i e multiple event types this leads to a three parameter description λ i κ i ni of each event type i with two parameters describing the events intensity λ i κ i and one representing the number of yearly occurrences ni 8 s m e v x i 1 s w x λ i κ i n i i 1 s 1 e x λ i κ i n i a description that can be easily made nonstationary including temporal dependence in the parameters of interest 3 3 parameters estimation methods 3 3 1 weibull parameters fit application of the mev can be sensitive to the lower tail of the ordinary events distribution marra et al 2018 in fact low intensity ordinary events may diverge from the distribution describing the upper tail e g fig 3 due to the finite precision of the measuring instruments to the subjective definition of rainy non rainy day and to the presence of different physical processes thus the lower tail needs to be disregarded in the computation of the parameters describing the upper tail of the compound distribution following marani and ignaccolo 2015 we propose to left censor the observations i e to exclude from the fit values below a given threshold to avoid these issues given the high variability of precipitation regimes worldwide and the need to treat different types of ordinary events potentially characterized by different magnitudes we propose to left censor the data using a case dependent threshold e g a given quantile of the ordinary events instead of the fixed 10 mm threshold proposed by marani and ignaccolo 2015 sensitivity analyses based on the datasets used in this study showed that left censoring values between the 55th quantile and the 80th quantile all provide virtually indistinguishable results fig s2 while left censoring using different thresholds may cause biases in the estimated parameters due to either the inclusion of low intensity events non representative of the upper tail or to the use of an insufficient data sample from the upper tail itself fig 3 in this study we treat the two types of ordinary events independently and chose a threshold equal to the 75th quantile of the ordinary events the remaining 25 of the data points are observed to well represent the upper tail in all the stations examined in this study and still allow to use a sufficiently large data sample at least 75 data points but usually more than 400 are available in the examined dataset weibull parameters are then derived using the least squares method marani and ignaccolo 2015 on the remaining data points fig 3 and included in the smev formulation in eq 8 3 3 2 regional frequency analysis regional frequency analysis is used to indirectly test the quality of the at site smev analyses homogeneous groups of stations are identified based on climatic classification and geographic proximity homogeneity of the regions is ensured with the test based on the coefficient of l variation recommended by hosking and wallis 1997 a regional frequency analysis based on l moments is then adopted and the gev distribution is used to describe the regional growth curves of the annual maxima series normalized over their mean values hosking and wallis 1997 regional gev frequency curves for each station are then computed 3 3 3 quantification of uncertainty uncertainty related to the frequency analyses is quantified using bootstrap with replacement of m random years out of the m years in the full records 1000 repetitions overeem et al 2008 the method allows to quantify the uncertainty related to the use of a particular methodology here smev and regional gev considering the statistical characteristics and the length of the available data record 3 4 extreme daily precipitation in the eastern mediterranean the proposed formulation is applied to the frequency analysis of extreme daily precipitation amounts arising from two classes of synoptic patterns in the eastern mediterranean fig 2 shows very distinct parameter sets to describe the two classes implying that a the identical distribution assumption cannot be regarded as accurate and b the adopted synoptic classification is meaningful in general type 1 lows are characterized by larger scale parameter i e larger average daily precipitation amounts larger shape parameter i e less skewed distribution lighter tailed extremes and larger number of yearly occurrences these observations confirm well known features of the synoptic systems dayan and morin 2006 armon et al 2018 and their separate integration in the framework allows to correctly quantify their relative impact on extremes the spatial consistency of the parameters indirectly provides a positive feedback on the meaningfulness of the approach the spatial patterns in fig 2b c e f h i suggest that the width of the distributions in fig 2a d g is caused by the fact that wide areas characterized by different climatic characteristics are examined rather than by uncertainty in the parameters estimation alone the strong north to south gradient in the number of yearly occurrences fig 2h i and in the weibull scale parameters fig 2b c reflects the climatology of the area the shape parameters show lower values i e heavier tailed distributions in the coastal region and in the arid areas particularly for the type 1 lows confirming prior knowledge about the climatology of extreme precipitation in drylands in general nicholson 2011 and in the eastern mediterranean in particular goldreich 2012 marra et al 2017 such a spatial consistency suggests applicability of the method in the identification of homogeneous regions within regionalization frameworks as well as spatial interpolation of the parameters to derive distributed maps of high quantiles fig 4 shows the frequency curves and relative uncertainty obtained over homogeneous regions using the smev method on individual stations at site and the regionalized gev framework in each region despite the at site application the smev method allows estimates of large quantiles characterized by large spatial consistency among near by homogeneous stations and generally reduced uncertainty with respect to regional gev estimates this supports the use of ordinary events to model extreme precipitation confirming previous studies by marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 and marra et al 2018 3 5 sensitivity analysis to changes in the parameters we explore here the effects of changes in ordinary rainfall regimes on extreme precipitation by exploiting how the mev approach separates the role of the distribution of ordinary rainfall intensity and of the number of events per year and the simplified formulation provided by smev empirical observation of the data shows that the scale and shape parameters of the weibull distributions describing the two synoptic classes in the region are related to each other fig 5 increases in the scale parameter are likely to be associated to increases in the shape parameter and a linear model can provide a first approximation of such relation fig 5 the sensitivity of the 100 year quantiles to changes in the ordinary events intensity following the linear relations between the parameters shown in fig 4 and in the number of yearly occurrences around typical values observed in the area is shown in fig 6 black dots in the figure represent the typical observed conditions λ lows 11 7 κ lows 0 90 λ lows 30 5 λ other 4 11 κ other 0 70 nother 17 9 although fig 6 shows the sensitivity of the 100 year quantiles to changes in the smev parameters any other quantile can be reproduced and site specific figures with the exact parameters of the location of interest can be easily drawn the approach can be used to a quantify the impact of changes in the intensity and number of yearly occurrences of rainy days generated by each synoptic class as well as b understand the uncertainty levels to be associated to uncertainty in the estimated parameters for instance fig 6b shows that changes uncertainty in the intensity of the type 1 lows are expected to affect the 100 year quantiles more than changes uncertainty in the intensity of the type 2 other class but should the intensity of the two classes become comparable changes of both would be expected to impact at the same time fig 6c shows that the intensity of the type 1 lows dominates over their number of yearly occurrences unless this number decreases to less than 10 events per year 3 6 modeling temporal changes in the climatic conditions an example of application of the framework using future projections of the parameters is presented in fig 7 where the response of high quantiles 2 to 100 year quantiles to reasonable temporal changes in the intensity and occurrence of the type 1 lows are simulated specifically initial conditions typical of the observations are parametrized λ lows 11 7 κ lows 0 9 nlows 30 5 and then a a 2 c increase in temperature ipcc 2014 and b a 22 decrease in the average number of yearly type 1 lows hochman et al 2018a rcp4 5 scenario both occurring linearly over an 80 year period are simulated changes in the ordinary events intensity is simulated assuming a 3 5 c scaling of the median intensities with temperature peleg et al 2018a and following the linear relation between scale and shape parameter shown in fig 5 intensity and frequency of the type 2 other events are kept constant λ other 4 11 κ other 0 7 nother 17 9 the factors of change resulting from this example strongly depend on the quantile of interest with 100 year quantiles showing an increase up to 1 and 2 year and 10 year quantiles observing an overall decrease of 2 and 1 respectively fig 7a the response of the 25 year quantiles also reported in fig 7b shows a complex behavior with a slight increase during the first 40 years and a decrease back to its initial value after 80 years it should be pointed out that figs 6 and 7 only show illustrative applications of the framework before extracting quantitative information from such analyses one should consider possible correlations among the parameters and if relevant include them in the formulation for instance in the examined region correlation between the number of occurrences of the two synoptic classes is expected 4 discussion 4 1 modeling multiple underlying processes the synoptic classification used in this study constitutes an example case and in other regions of the world precipitation extremes may emerge from different types of generating mechanisms e g winter summer precipitation tropical typical storms etc despite one of the synoptic classes being greater in intensity and number of occurrences both classes may contribute to the observed extreme daily amounts e g fig 3 confirmed by most of the analyzed stations the i id assumption of extreme value theory is thus violated even if one is only interested in the upper tail of the distribution interestingly the upper tail of a mixture of weibull distributions characterized by similar enough parameters is almost weibull distributed at least within the sampling uncertainties characterizing real datasets see fig 8 a recalling that using the transformation in the figure weibull distributions are linear conversely in presence of increasingly different parameter sets particularly the shape parameter the upper tail fig 8b or the entire compound distribution fig 8c may diverge from a weibull behavior elmahdy and aboutahoun 2013 presence of processes characterized by weibull distributions with similar shape parameter explains the goodness of the weibull model for the upper tail reported by previous studies marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 papalexiou et al 2018 as well as the goodness of the weibull models used in this study to represent synoptic classes grouping different synoptic types together the presence of multiple types of ordinary events that are sampled with varying proportions each year may contribute to the inter annual variability of the weibull parameters observed in previous studies which considered a single type of ordinary events marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 however a single event type formulation would not allow to model individual changes in the occurrences of the different types as the parameters derived for the mixed distribution depend both on the parameters of the individual distributions and on the mixing proportion woodward and gunst 1987 comparing quantiles derived using the here proposed smev formulation and a classic regional gev approach fig 4 shows that at site smev estimates are extremely consistent in space and generally characterized by decreased uncertainty this suggests that ordinary events can provide accurate information on the upper tail and supports the results obtained from multifractal theory by veneziano et al 2009 the parameters representing the upper tail of the distribution can be successfully computed using 25 of the data with significant advantages in terms of data sample and fit accuracy the results by marra et al 2018 who quantified the impact of measurement errors on frequency analyses from extreme value theory and mev provide additional support to the robustness of the formulation due to the limited data sample extracting the parameters from the upper tail alone as done in classic extreme value theory approaches provides estimates characterized by comparable uncertainty even within regionalization approaches based on individual records exceeding 60 years at this regard see also willems 2013 and peleg et al 2018b 4 3 modeling changing conditions the presented method allows to easily quantify the probability of exceedance of extreme quantiles emerging from multiple underlying processes for the case of daily precipitation the formulation makes use of three parameters for each type of underlying process with one of the parameters being the average number of yearly occurrences i e the probability of occurrence of an ordinary event this represents an important improvement with respect to classic extreme value formulations in which the same number of parameters is usually required but the connection with the physical processes generating the extremes is indirect fig 7 shows the combination of projected changes in the yearly occurrences of mediterranean lows hochmann et al 2018a and scaling of the median events intensity with temperature peleg et al 2018a for the eastern mediterranean the obtained response is very instructive and shows how the presence of very simple trends in intensity linear temperature increase exponential temperature intensity scaling and number of yearly occurrences linear decrease may lead to complicated responses in the extreme quantiles as already pointed out by montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 and koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 among others extrapolating trends directly from observations of the target processes e g ganguli et al 2017 serago and vogel 2018 may lead to misleading results e g the black dashed line in fig 7b modeling changing climatic conditions often makes use of global or regional reanalyses and or climate models e g ragno et al 2018 which are generally characterized by coarse resolutions and conditional biases downscaling models can be used to reproduce the required resolutions e g so et al 2017 but strong assumptions on the scale independence of the factors of change need to be adopted smev allows to independently treat temporal changes in the processes intensities e g contractor et al 2018 and on their yearly occurrences which owing to the larger amount of ordinary versus extreme events can be derived in an easier way from observations reanalyses or climate models e g peleg et al 2015b ragno et al 2018 marelle et al 2018 this can be done with the purpose of a modeling future extremes under assumptions of deterministic changes in these components e g fig 7 b investigating temporal changes in past observations or c modeling past nonstationary conditions e g seasonality influence of climatic indices in addition the model allows to d parsimoniously quantify the sensitivity of extreme quantiles to any change in intensity and yearly occurrences of the underlying processes e g fig 6 the extremely limited computational demand required by smev allows stochastic applications which may help understanding how uncertainty in the modelled changes propagate to the target processes and use in combination with ensemble climate models and or reanalyses 5 conclusions a new simplified metastatistical extreme value smev formulation for the analysis of hydro meteorological extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes is provided smev describes extremes by means of parameters directly related to the average properties of the ordinary events such as intensity and average number of yearly occurrences the method is applied to extreme daily precipitation using weibull distributions to model the daily precipitation amounts generated by two classes of synoptic systems this provides an extreme value distribution described by three parameters for each class two parameters describing the events intensity and one related to their probability of occurrence both the classes are observed to contribute extreme daily amounts and distinct parameters sets are required to describe the respective ordinary events meaning that the identical distribution assumption of extreme value theory is violated even when focusing on the upper tail of the distribution smev provides extreme quantiles which are highly consistent among stations in homogenous regions and despite the at site application generally characterized by reduced uncertainty with respect to classic regional gev frameworks simple combinations of trends in the intensity and yearly occurrences of the processes leads to rather complicated responses in the extremes so that extrapolating trends directly from observations of the target process may lead to largely misleading conclusions smev provides a robust framework for frequency analyses of extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes and represents a parsimonious tool for computationally efficient sensitivity analyses explanatory models nonstationary frequency analyses and climate projections data availability daily

679,this paper presents a simplified metastatistical extreme value formulation smev able to model hydro meteorological extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes the formulation explicitly includes the average intensity and probability of occurrence of the processes allowing to parsimoniously model changes in these quantities to quantify changes in the probability of occurrence of extremes smev allows a frequency analyses of extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes and b computationally efficient analyses of the sensitivity of extreme quantiles to changes in the characteristics of the underlying processes moreover c it provides a robust framework for explanatory models nonstationary frequency analyses and climate projections the methodology is applied to daily precipitation data from long recording stations in the eastern mediterranean using weibull distributions to model daily precipitation amounts generated by two classes of synoptic systems at site application of smev provides spatially consistent estimates of extreme quantiles in line with regional gev estimates and generally characterized by reduced uncertainties the sensitivity of extreme quantiles to changes and uncertainty in the intensity and yearly occurrences of events generated by different synoptic classes is examined and an application of smev for the projection of future extremes is provided keywords extreme value analysis metastatistical extreme value nonstationary processes climate change daily precipitation 1 introduction quantifying hydro meteorological extremes in a changing climate is crucial to build resilience and plan water resources management and hydrological design frequency analysis consists in the identification of a cumulative distribution function whose upper tail represents the probability of exceedance of high extreme values of the stochastic process of interest this is generally done assuming no temporal dependence stationarity in the statistical description of the process but evidences of climate change e g hall et al 2014 fisher and knutti 2016 call for the development of models able to cope with changing nonstationary conditions the term nonstationary refers to a time indexed process subject to temporal changes in its statistical description in this study in particular we will address deterministic temporal changes koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 in both a the probability of occurrence of the process and b the parameters describing its cumulative distribution function a review of earlier studies on nonstationary frequency analysis is provided by khaliq et al 2006 recent modelling efforts of future hydro meteorological extremes are based on two main approaches the first one consists of detecting trends in the process of interest from either observations or climate models and extrapolating such trends using extreme value formulations e g villarini et al 2009 westra et al 2013 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 agilan and umamahesh 2017 the second approach relies on the identification and quantification of causative relations between the process of interest and other explanatory variables e g hardwick jones et al 2010 berg et al 2013 lepore et al 2015 serago and vogel 2018 with the intent of gathering information on the future characteristics of extreme processes from the changes in the explanatory variables a relevant example is the scaling relation between temperature and extreme precipitation object of numerous studies in recent years e g westra et al 2014 dobrinski et al 2016 wasko et al 2016 nonetheless these approaches are subject to assumptions uncertainties and overfitting issues that prevent the current models from being fully trusted morin 2011 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2018 serinaldi et al 2018 a common background to these analyses is extreme value theory assuming independence and identical distribution of the examined process i id assumption and large enough n number of occurrences of the process in each year asymptotic assumption the distribution of extremes may only converge to known distribution classes fischer and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 however hydro meteorological extremes may arise from multiple underlying processes e g convective versus stratiform precipitation just to mention a simple example so that the i id assumption is often not met moreover the number of independent events in a year is far from being infinite violating the asymptotic assumption to overcome the violation of the i id assumption some studies included seasonal separation of the events willems 2000 fisher 2018 iliopoulou et al 2018 or multi variate models considering external explanatory variables in the formulation sun et al 2014 pineda and willems 2018 these approaches allow to include external information in the perspective of future climate modeling and were shown to improve the estimation of extreme quantiles for the studied cases this however requires the estimation of a large number of parameters a complicated effort that can give rise to important uncertainties due to the limited data availability and when interested in future projections to the inaccuracy characterizing extremes in climate models e g kendon et al 2017 meresa and romanowicz 2017 the metastatistical extreme value mev framework proposed by marani and ignaccolo 2015 relaxes the asymptotic assumption and allows the identification of the parameters from a largely increased data sample zorzetto et al 2016 moreover it has the potential to model extremes arising from multiple distributions thus providing potential to overcome both of the above highlighted issues marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2018 explicitly nonstationary formulations of the mev approach as well as formulations including extremes arising from multiple types of events however are not available so far the objective of this study is to introduce a simplified mev formulation smev in which inter annual variations are neglected and extremes are described as functions of the average properties of multiple underlying processes specific objectives are a expanding the mev framework to extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes b introducing the smev formulation c applying smev to daily precipitation records in the eastern mediterranean and d providing some example applications to sensitivity analyses and climate projections the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the analytical formulation of smev section 3 describes the application of smev to frequency analysis of daily precipitation in the eastern mediterranean and to sensitivity analyses and future projections section 4 discusses the results of the study and section 5 summarizes the main conclusions 2 formulation 2 1 mev formulation for extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes the mev approach marani and ignaccolo 2015 treats as stochastic variables both the parameters defining the cumulative distribution function of the process magnitudes observed during a given year and the number of times a process hereinafter termed ordinary event or simply event is observed in each of the years denoting with m the number of available years nj the number of events observed during the j th year and f the cumulative distribution function of the distribution class describing the ordinary event magnitude x described by l parameters θ j θ j 1 θ j l the mev cumulative distribution function can be written as a sample average of the cumulative distribution functions observed during the sampled years 1 m e v x 1 m j 1 m f x θ j n j the reader interested in additional details is referred to marani and ignaccolo 2015 and zorzetto et al 2016 the mev approach relaxes the asymptotic assumption of extreme value theory and makes use of all the available data to fit the distribution parameters this drastically decreases the fitting uncertainty with respect to classic extreme value theory which only exploits a small subset of the data i e the annual maxima or the peaks exceeding a high threshold analyses of the performance of the methodology with respect to classic extreme value analyses can be found in marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 and marra et al 2018 on the other hand the formulation in eq 1 requires prior knowledge of the distribution class describing the underlying ordinary events and assumes identical distribution of the ordinary events within each year whilst information on the former can be gained mining the available data identical distribution of the ordinary events within each year can still represent strong requirement the presence of extremes emerging from multiple distributions needs to be considered to accurately use the method marra et al 2018 relaxing the assumption of identical distribution within each year multiple types of ordinary events can be included in the framework let s consider s types of ordinary events and denote with fi the distribution class describing the i th type of ordinary events parametrized at the j th year by θ i j if the i th type of ordinary events is sampled n i j times during the j th year so that n j i 1 s n i j the mev cumulative distribution function can be written as 2 m e v x 1 m j 1 m i 1 s f i x θ i j n i j this formulation allows to explicitly include different types of ordinary events in the frequency analysis of extreme events thus permitting to quantify the probability of occurrence of extremes caused by multiple underlying processes in practice one needs to match each ordinary event to the corresponding type fit each fi to the n i j ordinary events of the i th type occurred during the j th year and then use eq 2 to derive the compound cumulative distribution function describing the resulting extremes this however requires to identify a large number of parameters m i 1 s 1 l i a problematic task in presence of limited data samples e g for situations in which only a limited number of events is observed each year marra et al 2018 which is even emphasized when the ordinary events are divided into multiple types 2 2 simplified mev smev formulation allowing inter annual variability of the parameters describing the ordinary events distribution the mev framework allows to derive accurate frequency analyses able to represent the period over which data is analyzed and implicitly accounting for possible nonstationary conditions however this theoretical advantage needs to be balanced with the practical need to estimate parameters from limited number of yearly ordinary events in fact parameter estimation uncertainty may lead to biased estimates of the quantiles of interest particularly important in situations in which only a limited number of events per year is observed marra et al 2018 in fact it should be noted that the inter annual variations of the ordinary events distribution parameters reported by previous studies e g marani and ignaccolo 2015 are co caused by three effects i inter annual variations of the characteristics of the ordinary events ii parameter estimation uncertainty and iii varying proportions in the occurrence of different types of ordinary events in case the identical distribution assumption within each year is not verified in order to be correctly represented inter annual variations of the parameters need to be larger than the uncertainty introduced by the other effects fig s1 shows the uncertainty related to the parameter estimation method for a typical case which gives a sense of the minimum detectable inter annual variations of the parameters as a function of the number of ordinary events per year in this section we introduce a simplified formulation in which the inter annual variability is neglected both in the ordinary events distributions i e assuming identical distribution of the ordinary events of each type identical distribution assumption and in their number of yearly occurrences mean probability of occurrence approximation for each event type the identical distribution assumption should not come as a surprise as adopted by all classic methods based on extreme value theory and already suggested as a way to decrease the parameter estimation uncertainty by marani and ignaccolo 2015 and marra et al 2018 moreover it allows parsimonious li parameter expressions for the ordinary events note that when multiple types of ordinary events are considered the assumption should be intended as identical distribution of the events of each type during the years different event types will still be described by different distributions the mean probability of occurrence approximation of the traditional mev expression will be analyzed more in detail in the following the identical distribution assumption allows to factorize the terms of eq 2 in which the mean number of ordinary events per year appears in the exponent 3 m e v x i 1 s f i x θ i n i 1 m j 1 m i 1 s f i x θ i δ i j where n i 1 m j 1 m n i j is the mean number of i th type ordinary events occurring in a year δ i j n i j ni are the deviations of the yearly values n i j from the mean ni and the term 4 r 1 m j 1 m i 1 s f i x θ i δ i j contains all the information on the inter annual variability of n i j in addition the identical distribution assumption allows to analytically express r as a function of the compound probability mev x without dependence on the distributions fi and on their parameters as shown in fig 1 taking the limit case f 1 i e analyzing extremes the term r goes to 1 quickly becoming negligible for the estimation of return periods exceeding 10 years for a wide variety of distributions of n i j fig 1 fig s2 the simplified mev smev formulation in which any inter annual variability is neglected is thus written as 5 s m e v x i 1 s f i x θ i n i the smev formulation drastically reduces the number of parameters to i 1 s 1 l i and allows a direct interpretation of their meaning for each event type li parameters describe the ordinary events intensity θ i and one parameter is related to their probability of occurrence ni such parameters have clear physical meaning and can be extracted relatively easily from observation or from either global regional circulation models climate projections and reanalyses e g tabari and willems 2018 which increasingly represent the sources of available information when past data records are analyzed eq 5 provides information for the average conditions observed during the study period while it assumes a prognostic meaning for conditions in which the values of the parameters can be inferred simulated or projected noteworthy the term r can be computed for any distribution of the number of yearly occurrences n i j again with no dependence on the fi and on their parameters when expressed as a function of the estimated return period and in case its impact is considered important used to adjust the smev estimates under nonstationary conditions both the intensity of the ordinary evens i e the θ i parameters if one reasonably assumes no changes in the functional forms fi and their yearly probability of occurrence i e ni can be expressed as a function of time yielding the smev nonstationary formulation 6 s m e v x t i 1 s f i x θ i t n i t in the following we explore the merit of describing changing extremes by incorporating a temporal dependence in a the intensity characteristics of different types of ordinary events θ i t and b their individual probability of occurrence ni t changes in any of the parameters in eq 6 can be easily modeled including simultaneous changes of intensity and occurrence of different types of events 3 application in this section we show an application of smev for a modeling extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes b quantifying the sensitivity of extreme quantiles to potential changes in the intensity and probability of occurrence of the individual type of ordinary event and c providing an illustrative example of future projections based on simple trends in the characteristics of the ordinary events we focus on daily precipitation which is among the most widely investigated hydro meteorological processes the approach however applies to any process for which the characteristics of the upper tail can be described by the ordinary events precipitation is caused by the condensation of atmospheric water vapor due to the lifting and cooling of air masses which can be driven by different synoptic meteorological and local conditions that in turn generate different precipitation patterns e g hirschboeck 1987 yarnal 1993 a classic example is the distinct characteristics of convective and stratiform precipitation but as in this application different types of events can be identified depending on the climatology of the region of interest 3 1 study area and data the eastern mediterranean region focus of this application is characterized by unique climatic conditions in which the mediterranean climate characterizing the coastal region abruptly changes to semiarid and arid in the space of few tens of kilometers fig 2 precipitation occurs in the winter months and transitional seasons with almost no rainfall from mid june to mid september precipitation is usually brought by mediterranean lows with minor but still relevant contributions from the active red sea trough a synoptic system that may bring humidity from the red sea de vries et al 2013 on rare occasions other synoptic systems bring extreme precipitation to the region e g armon et al 2018 we focus on two classes of synoptic systems known to display distinct precipitation characteristics e g dayan and morin 2006 belachsen et al 2017 armon et al 2018 a mediterranean lows hereinafter type 1 lows including both cyprus lows and lows to the east in the classification by belachsen et al 2017 and b active red sea troughs and other synoptic systems hereinafter type 2 other observations and model projections show substantial changes in the precipitation climatology of the region in response to changes in the frequency of occurrence of these synoptic systems making the topic of high relevance e g alpert et al 2002 ziv et al 2010 peleg et al 2015a hochman et al 2018b a large dataset of daily precipitation made available by the israel meteorological service including data from 170 stations with at least 60 year record in the period 1948 2018 is used fig 2 for each station ordinary events are defined as non zero i e above or equal to 0 1 mm daily precipitation amounts zorzetto et al 2016 and labeled according to the generating synoptic class derived from the classification by alpert et al 2004 and hochman et al 2018a 3 2 smev formulation for daily precipitation following the reasoning by wilson and tuomi 2005 and previous findings marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 papalexiou et al 2018 ordinary events are modeled using a weibull distribution weibull 1951 whose cumulative distribution function can be written as 7 w x λ κ 1 e x λ κ where λ 0 and κ 0 are the scale and shape parameters respectively larger scale parameters are associated to larger magnitude of the average events and larger shape parameters to lighter upper tail of the distribution we use the smev formulation assuming the presence of multiple processes underlying the daily precipitation extremes i e multiple event types this leads to a three parameter description λ i κ i ni of each event type i with two parameters describing the events intensity λ i κ i and one representing the number of yearly occurrences ni 8 s m e v x i 1 s w x λ i κ i n i i 1 s 1 e x λ i κ i n i a description that can be easily made nonstationary including temporal dependence in the parameters of interest 3 3 parameters estimation methods 3 3 1 weibull parameters fit application of the mev can be sensitive to the lower tail of the ordinary events distribution marra et al 2018 in fact low intensity ordinary events may diverge from the distribution describing the upper tail e g fig 3 due to the finite precision of the measuring instruments to the subjective definition of rainy non rainy day and to the presence of different physical processes thus the lower tail needs to be disregarded in the computation of the parameters describing the upper tail of the compound distribution following marani and ignaccolo 2015 we propose to left censor the observations i e to exclude from the fit values below a given threshold to avoid these issues given the high variability of precipitation regimes worldwide and the need to treat different types of ordinary events potentially characterized by different magnitudes we propose to left censor the data using a case dependent threshold e g a given quantile of the ordinary events instead of the fixed 10 mm threshold proposed by marani and ignaccolo 2015 sensitivity analyses based on the datasets used in this study showed that left censoring values between the 55th quantile and the 80th quantile all provide virtually indistinguishable results fig s2 while left censoring using different thresholds may cause biases in the estimated parameters due to either the inclusion of low intensity events non representative of the upper tail or to the use of an insufficient data sample from the upper tail itself fig 3 in this study we treat the two types of ordinary events independently and chose a threshold equal to the 75th quantile of the ordinary events the remaining 25 of the data points are observed to well represent the upper tail in all the stations examined in this study and still allow to use a sufficiently large data sample at least 75 data points but usually more than 400 are available in the examined dataset weibull parameters are then derived using the least squares method marani and ignaccolo 2015 on the remaining data points fig 3 and included in the smev formulation in eq 8 3 3 2 regional frequency analysis regional frequency analysis is used to indirectly test the quality of the at site smev analyses homogeneous groups of stations are identified based on climatic classification and geographic proximity homogeneity of the regions is ensured with the test based on the coefficient of l variation recommended by hosking and wallis 1997 a regional frequency analysis based on l moments is then adopted and the gev distribution is used to describe the regional growth curves of the annual maxima series normalized over their mean values hosking and wallis 1997 regional gev frequency curves for each station are then computed 3 3 3 quantification of uncertainty uncertainty related to the frequency analyses is quantified using bootstrap with replacement of m random years out of the m years in the full records 1000 repetitions overeem et al 2008 the method allows to quantify the uncertainty related to the use of a particular methodology here smev and regional gev considering the statistical characteristics and the length of the available data record 3 4 extreme daily precipitation in the eastern mediterranean the proposed formulation is applied to the frequency analysis of extreme daily precipitation amounts arising from two classes of synoptic patterns in the eastern mediterranean fig 2 shows very distinct parameter sets to describe the two classes implying that a the identical distribution assumption cannot be regarded as accurate and b the adopted synoptic classification is meaningful in general type 1 lows are characterized by larger scale parameter i e larger average daily precipitation amounts larger shape parameter i e less skewed distribution lighter tailed extremes and larger number of yearly occurrences these observations confirm well known features of the synoptic systems dayan and morin 2006 armon et al 2018 and their separate integration in the framework allows to correctly quantify their relative impact on extremes the spatial consistency of the parameters indirectly provides a positive feedback on the meaningfulness of the approach the spatial patterns in fig 2b c e f h i suggest that the width of the distributions in fig 2a d g is caused by the fact that wide areas characterized by different climatic characteristics are examined rather than by uncertainty in the parameters estimation alone the strong north to south gradient in the number of yearly occurrences fig 2h i and in the weibull scale parameters fig 2b c reflects the climatology of the area the shape parameters show lower values i e heavier tailed distributions in the coastal region and in the arid areas particularly for the type 1 lows confirming prior knowledge about the climatology of extreme precipitation in drylands in general nicholson 2011 and in the eastern mediterranean in particular goldreich 2012 marra et al 2017 such a spatial consistency suggests applicability of the method in the identification of homogeneous regions within regionalization frameworks as well as spatial interpolation of the parameters to derive distributed maps of high quantiles fig 4 shows the frequency curves and relative uncertainty obtained over homogeneous regions using the smev method on individual stations at site and the regionalized gev framework in each region despite the at site application the smev method allows estimates of large quantiles characterized by large spatial consistency among near by homogeneous stations and generally reduced uncertainty with respect to regional gev estimates this supports the use of ordinary events to model extreme precipitation confirming previous studies by marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 and marra et al 2018 3 5 sensitivity analysis to changes in the parameters we explore here the effects of changes in ordinary rainfall regimes on extreme precipitation by exploiting how the mev approach separates the role of the distribution of ordinary rainfall intensity and of the number of events per year and the simplified formulation provided by smev empirical observation of the data shows that the scale and shape parameters of the weibull distributions describing the two synoptic classes in the region are related to each other fig 5 increases in the scale parameter are likely to be associated to increases in the shape parameter and a linear model can provide a first approximation of such relation fig 5 the sensitivity of the 100 year quantiles to changes in the ordinary events intensity following the linear relations between the parameters shown in fig 4 and in the number of yearly occurrences around typical values observed in the area is shown in fig 6 black dots in the figure represent the typical observed conditions λ lows 11 7 κ lows 0 90 λ lows 30 5 λ other 4 11 κ other 0 70 nother 17 9 although fig 6 shows the sensitivity of the 100 year quantiles to changes in the smev parameters any other quantile can be reproduced and site specific figures with the exact parameters of the location of interest can be easily drawn the approach can be used to a quantify the impact of changes in the intensity and number of yearly occurrences of rainy days generated by each synoptic class as well as b understand the uncertainty levels to be associated to uncertainty in the estimated parameters for instance fig 6b shows that changes uncertainty in the intensity of the type 1 lows are expected to affect the 100 year quantiles more than changes uncertainty in the intensity of the type 2 other class but should the intensity of the two classes become comparable changes of both would be expected to impact at the same time fig 6c shows that the intensity of the type 1 lows dominates over their number of yearly occurrences unless this number decreases to less than 10 events per year 3 6 modeling temporal changes in the climatic conditions an example of application of the framework using future projections of the parameters is presented in fig 7 where the response of high quantiles 2 to 100 year quantiles to reasonable temporal changes in the intensity and occurrence of the type 1 lows are simulated specifically initial conditions typical of the observations are parametrized λ lows 11 7 κ lows 0 9 nlows 30 5 and then a a 2 c increase in temperature ipcc 2014 and b a 22 decrease in the average number of yearly type 1 lows hochman et al 2018a rcp4 5 scenario both occurring linearly over an 80 year period are simulated changes in the ordinary events intensity is simulated assuming a 3 5 c scaling of the median intensities with temperature peleg et al 2018a and following the linear relation between scale and shape parameter shown in fig 5 intensity and frequency of the type 2 other events are kept constant λ other 4 11 κ other 0 7 nother 17 9 the factors of change resulting from this example strongly depend on the quantile of interest with 100 year quantiles showing an increase up to 1 and 2 year and 10 year quantiles observing an overall decrease of 2 and 1 respectively fig 7a the response of the 25 year quantiles also reported in fig 7b shows a complex behavior with a slight increase during the first 40 years and a decrease back to its initial value after 80 years it should be pointed out that figs 6 and 7 only show illustrative applications of the framework before extracting quantitative information from such analyses one should consider possible correlations among the parameters and if relevant include them in the formulation for instance in the examined region correlation between the number of occurrences of the two synoptic classes is expected 4 discussion 4 1 modeling multiple underlying processes the synoptic classification used in this study constitutes an example case and in other regions of the world precipitation extremes may emerge from different types of generating mechanisms e g winter summer precipitation tropical typical storms etc despite one of the synoptic classes being greater in intensity and number of occurrences both classes may contribute to the observed extreme daily amounts e g fig 3 confirmed by most of the analyzed stations the i id assumption of extreme value theory is thus violated even if one is only interested in the upper tail of the distribution interestingly the upper tail of a mixture of weibull distributions characterized by similar enough parameters is almost weibull distributed at least within the sampling uncertainties characterizing real datasets see fig 8 a recalling that using the transformation in the figure weibull distributions are linear conversely in presence of increasingly different parameter sets particularly the shape parameter the upper tail fig 8b or the entire compound distribution fig 8c may diverge from a weibull behavior elmahdy and aboutahoun 2013 presence of processes characterized by weibull distributions with similar shape parameter explains the goodness of the weibull model for the upper tail reported by previous studies marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 papalexiou et al 2018 as well as the goodness of the weibull models used in this study to represent synoptic classes grouping different synoptic types together the presence of multiple types of ordinary events that are sampled with varying proportions each year may contribute to the inter annual variability of the weibull parameters observed in previous studies which considered a single type of ordinary events marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 however a single event type formulation would not allow to model individual changes in the occurrences of the different types as the parameters derived for the mixed distribution depend both on the parameters of the individual distributions and on the mixing proportion woodward and gunst 1987 comparing quantiles derived using the here proposed smev formulation and a classic regional gev approach fig 4 shows that at site smev estimates are extremely consistent in space and generally characterized by decreased uncertainty this suggests that ordinary events can provide accurate information on the upper tail and supports the results obtained from multifractal theory by veneziano et al 2009 the parameters representing the upper tail of the distribution can be successfully computed using 25 of the data with significant advantages in terms of data sample and fit accuracy the results by marra et al 2018 who quantified the impact of measurement errors on frequency analyses from extreme value theory and mev provide additional support to the robustness of the formulation due to the limited data sample extracting the parameters from the upper tail alone as done in classic extreme value theory approaches provides estimates characterized by comparable uncertainty even within regionalization approaches based on individual records exceeding 60 years at this regard see also willems 2013 and peleg et al 2018b 4 3 modeling changing conditions the presented method allows to easily quantify the probability of exceedance of extreme quantiles emerging from multiple underlying processes for the case of daily precipitation the formulation makes use of three parameters for each type of underlying process with one of the parameters being the average number of yearly occurrences i e the probability of occurrence of an ordinary event this represents an important improvement with respect to classic extreme value formulations in which the same number of parameters is usually required but the connection with the physical processes generating the extremes is indirect fig 7 shows the combination of projected changes in the yearly occurrences of mediterranean lows hochmann et al 2018a and scaling of the median events intensity with temperature peleg et al 2018a for the eastern mediterranean the obtained response is very instructive and shows how the presence of very simple trends in intensity linear temperature increase exponential temperature intensity scaling and number of yearly occurrences linear decrease may lead to complicated responses in the extreme quantiles as already pointed out by montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 and koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 among others extrapolating trends directly from observations of the target processes e g ganguli et al 2017 serago and vogel 2018 may lead to misleading results e g the black dashed line in fig 7b modeling changing climatic conditions often makes use of global or regional reanalyses and or climate models e g ragno et al 2018 which are generally characterized by coarse resolutions and conditional biases downscaling models can be used to reproduce the required resolutions e g so et al 2017 but strong assumptions on the scale independence of the factors of change need to be adopted smev allows to independently treat temporal changes in the processes intensities e g contractor et al 2018 and on their yearly occurrences which owing to the larger amount of ordinary versus extreme events can be derived in an easier way from observations reanalyses or climate models e g peleg et al 2015b ragno et al 2018 marelle et al 2018 this can be done with the purpose of a modeling future extremes under assumptions of deterministic changes in these components e g fig 7 b investigating temporal changes in past observations or c modeling past nonstationary conditions e g seasonality influence of climatic indices in addition the model allows to d parsimoniously quantify the sensitivity of extreme quantiles to any change in intensity and yearly occurrences of the underlying processes e g fig 6 the extremely limited computational demand required by smev allows stochastic applications which may help understanding how uncertainty in the modelled changes propagate to the target processes and use in combination with ensemble climate models and or reanalyses 5 conclusions a new simplified metastatistical extreme value smev formulation for the analysis of hydro meteorological extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes is provided smev describes extremes by means of parameters directly related to the average properties of the ordinary events such as intensity and average number of yearly occurrences the method is applied to extreme daily precipitation using weibull distributions to model the daily precipitation amounts generated by two classes of synoptic systems this provides an extreme value distribution described by three parameters for each class two parameters describing the events intensity and one related to their probability of occurrence both the classes are observed to contribute extreme daily amounts and distinct parameters sets are required to describe the respective ordinary events meaning that the identical distribution assumption of extreme value theory is violated even when focusing on the upper tail of the distribution smev provides extreme quantiles which are highly consistent among stations in homogenous regions and despite the at site application generally characterized by reduced uncertainty with respect to classic regional gev frameworks simple combinations of trends in the intensity and yearly occurrences of the processes leads to rather complicated responses in the extremes so that extrapolating trends directly from observations of the target process may lead to largely misleading conclusions smev provides a robust framework for frequency analyses of extremes emerging from multiple underlying processes and represents a parsimonious tool for computationally efficient sensitivity analyses explanatory models nonstationary frequency analyses and climate projections data availability daily
