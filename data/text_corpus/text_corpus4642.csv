23210,in general the equipment failures or accidents of offshore plants during operation and maintenance o m period cause catastrophic damage thus it is necessary to undertake proactive maintenance in advance in order to avoid abnormal situations currently owing to the emergence of information communication technologies icts and sensor technologies it is possible to gather the health status data of important equipment and use this information for maintenance during the o m period it sheds light on condition based maintenance cbm strategy in this study we introduce a case study on the development of a cbm system cbms for an oil and gas offshore plant i e liquefied natural gas floating production storage and offloading vessel lng fpso the study includes the introduction of the system architecture main components diagnostics and prognostics methods of the system as well as a discussion of its implementation keywords condition based maintenance offshore plant maintenance diagnostics prognostics system architecture 1 introduction in general there have been various classifications of maintenance policies corrective maintenance breakdown maintenance regular maintenance such as time based preventive maintenance etc for more details on maintenance types please refer to erbe et al 2005 according to ahmad and kamaruddin 2012 maintenance strategy can be divided into corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance the preventive maintenance has two kinds time based maintenance and condition based maintenance in similar terms predictive maintenance prognostics and health management phm henceforth referred to as cbm among them cbm has been recently highlighted cbm can serve as a means of reducing the uncertainty of maintenance activities and is carried out according to the requirements indicated by the equipment condition peng et al 2010 in recent decades advancements in information communication technology ict have accelerated growth in the cbm technology area by enabling network bandwidth data collection and retrieval data analysis and decision support capabilities for large datasets of time series data prajapati et al 2012 given this new environment we can collect and use data on the status of equipment related to usage conditions failures and maintenance and service events using this information gives us new and challenging issues to improve the efficiency of equipment maintenance operations we can identify and solve problems in advance before damage to equipment occurs by detecting abnormal states throughout monitoring diagnosing abnormal types predicting remaining useful life and undertaking proactive maintenance i e by engaging in cbm capital intensive industries such as offshore plants should be operated with high reliability and high levels of availability because the downtime due to system failure has a significant influence on the manufacturing activity and degree of safety because a critical failure or degradation of equipment can seriously damage the belief of customers regarding equipment reliability maintenance enhancements to prevent failures or instances of degradation in advance should take precedence over other factors offshore plants have normally the long operation times for example an offshore wind power plant is usually operated 25 years m√ºnsterberg 2016 offshore plants have become more complex and vast thus considerable costs and numerous efforts are required in the o m phase of offshore plants the maintenance of an offshore plant during its operation phase involves the provision of support and assessments of problems through inspections that target mechanical defects and corrosion according to heng et al 2009 todays complex manufacturing systems such as on shore and off shore plants require highly sophisticated and costly maintenance policies the oil majors and operating companies are paying increasingly more attention to the costs in the o m phase increased o m costs have become a main topic of conversation by those involved in asset integrity management aim hwang 2015 previously conservative maintenance methods such as time based preventive maintenance and breakdown maintenance were used during the o m phase of an offshore plant however there is an increasing need to reduce operating costs through more proactive and advanced maintenance methods one solution is cbm cbm is currently being utilized in the petrochemical industry with condition monitoring of both onshore and offshore oil and gas wells telford et al 2011 cbm has thus become a very attractive method in the oil and gas industries thus far efforts to enhance the performance of plant maintenance with cbm have drawn the attention of researchers however few studies have introduced instances of the cbm implementation in plant industries and this is especially true for offshore plants cbm remains a challenging area current approaches have limitations given the lack of detailed methods and validated models though data gathering systems are becoming relatively more mature much work remains to be done on reliable and robust for monitoring diagnostics prognostics and decision making methods in relation to maintenance from 2013 to 2016 for implementing a cbm system cbms for a liquefied natural gas floating production storage and offloading vessel lng fpso a korean government funded research project has been carried out an lng fpso is an offshore plant which delivers liquefied gas from a gas field to customers according to zhu et al 2013 the demand for lng fpsos has greatly increased and the demand for lng fpso projects is predicted to continue to grow along with the increased demand for natural gas in this vein this study focuses on the introduction of the case study of the cbms development for an lng fpso in the study we introduce the system architecture main components of cbms diagnostics and prognostics methods and discussion issues required to implement the cbm system the rest of this study is organized as follows in the section entitled related works relevant previous studies are reviewed and their limitations are discussed the section entitled cbm system for an lng fpso introduces the system architecture main components diagnostics and prognostics methods the section discussion issues introduces the subjects to be considered when implementing the cbm system finally this study is concluded with a summary and discussion of its contributions 2 related works 2 1 cbm study in academia there have been several previous works related to cbm concepts or frameworks for example the machinery information management open systems alliance mimosa designed what is known as the open standard architecture condition based maintenance osa cbm approach according to osa cbm thurston 2001 there are seven layers required to implement the cbm concept refer to table 1 sensor modules signal processing condition monitoring health assessments prognostics decision support and presentation djurdjanovic et al 2003 proposed a framework which encompassed a watchdog agent for predictive condition based maintenance by undertaking multi sensor assessments and predictions of machines or process performance levels the concept of the watchdog agent based its degradation assessments on readings from multiple sensors that measure critical properties of the process or machinery under a networked and tether free environment the watchdog agent is an embedded system that uses algorithms which autonomously assess and predict performance degradations and the remaining lifetimes of machines and components bengtsson 2004 investigated standards and standardization proposals related to cbm and described several organizational aspects to be considered when determining whether to implement a cbm kothamasu et al 2006 reviewed the philosophies and techniques of system health monitoring and prognostics they surveyed health monitoring

the initial architecture for the cbm framework as realized in a joint project with sap research they noted several aspects of cbm including the identification measurements modeling and forecasting of indicators as well as considerations when making decisions in addition prajapati et al 2012 provided a brief overview of cbm with definitions of various terms a history review and a summary of recent developments applications and research challenges in the cbm domain they also discussed how cbm could be used to optimize maintenance strategies and increase the feasibility and practicality of a cbm system he and ma 2012 reviewed the history of phm and analyzed the main elements of a general phm system later proposing the phm system architecture for electronic equipment chen et al 2012 presented

implementation of the ed ep concept recently shin and jun 2015 addressed several aspects of the cbm approach including definitions related international standards procedures and techniques table 1 shows a comparison of various system layers for cbm implementation from previous works on the other hand there have been numerous cbm works pertaining to specific domains for example patel and kamrani 1996 introduced a diagnosis and maintenance consultant system for industrial robots called robodoc they introduced the concepts of maintenance artificial intelligence and expert systems with a state of the art review of diagnostic expert systems they also provided the specifications and structure of robodoc and explained the approaches used during its construction lee 1998 introduced a new methodology of predictive maintenance which relied on machinery dynamics and data fusion through remote machinery monitoring they also presented an example of a remote wireless application currently in use for monitoring machinery in industrial plants dieulle et al 2001 proposed a mathematical model for determining a cbm policy efficiently using renewal processes theory in their model they regarded preventive replacement threshold and inspection schedule as decision variables koœÇ and lee 2001 addressed the concept of web enabled predictive maintenance in an intelligent e maintenance system which is implemented via the internet and showed its system elements furthermore yan et al 2004 presented a prognostic method for machine degradation detection which assesses machine performance capabilities while also predicting the remaining useful life of the machine in question in their model real time performance is evaluated by inputting features of online data into a logistics model the remaining life is estimated using an autoregressive moving average arma model based on the machine performance history in addition fu et al 2004 proposed a predictive maintenance framework for a hydroelectric generating unit they presented three key elements for the predictive maintenance monitoring and forecasting diagnosis and prognosis and decision making bansal et al 2004 described a real time predictive maintenance system for machine systems the aim of their system is to localize and detect abnormal electrical conditions in order to predict mechanical abnormalities that indicate or may lead to the failure of a motor they used a neural network approach to predict the parameters of machines more recently lee et al 2006 introduced the emerging field of e maintenance and its critical elements they presented performance assessments and prediction tools such as neural networks fuzzy logic logistic regression hidden markov models and bayesian belief networks for the continuous assessment and prediction of a particular product performance metric 2 2 offshore plant maintenance machinery and parts of facilities and equipment in offshore plants are usually checked and replaced periodically based on time based maintenance methods it is clear that scheduled maintenance such as time based maintenance is smarter than emergency maintenance after an equipment failure although time based preventive maintenance is a good way to maintain the performance of offshore plant equipment however it does not guarantee to avoid any failures or accidents thus it is not suitable considering the massive costs incurred in the event of a breakdown this is a viable area for cbm which can assess the degradation properties of equipment operated in harsh environments such as offshore platforms and which can undertake prognosis and appropriate maintenance activities operating companies with offshore platforms in the us and eu start to consider the change of conventional maintenance systems in order to minimize their maintenance costs to this end converging ict is introduced and applied to offshore plant operation systems nuclear power plants and onshore plants already use facility maintenance information systems such as the computerized maintenance management system cmms cmms is a software package that manages the information about an organization s maintenance operations the information is intended to help maintenance workers do their jobs more effectively and to help management make informed decisions cmms can be defined as information processing of facility management tasks by computers and it aims efficiently to manage tasks and evaluate to performance outcomes of maintenance activities cmms has been actively introduced for use with commercial vessels cmms and cbms are similar in that they perform maintenance management on facilities however cbms provides intelligent functions associated with diagnostics and prognostics not performed in cmms thereby providing the user with useful information related to maintenance decision some previous works already dealt with the maintenance of offshore plants for example arthur and dunn 2001 introduced the application of an optimized cbm approach to large reciprocating compressors on an offshore installation caselitz and giebhardt 2002 introduced results of work in the field of condition monitoring and fault prediction in relation to offshore wind energy converters their work includes not only development hardware and software solutions but also prototype tests and the integration of fault prediction and maintenance and repair scheduling techniques nilsson and bertling 2007 presented a lifecycle cost lcc analysis for a single wind turbine onshore and a wind farm offshore they compared lcc outcomes for different strategies with strategies of a condition monitoring system cms miguel√°nez and lane 2010 presented a recovery system for offshore wind turbines their recovery system takes a broad view of events and sensor values across the complete turbine system and subsystems telford et al 2011 explored the existing literature on the development and applications of cbm in the oil and gas industry although not a few previous research works dealt with various cbm issues there is still a lack of research on the overall implementation of cbm functions most related research works dealt with some parts of cbm functions such as diagnosis or prognosis despite some studies of the cbm framework or system architecture reference works on the implementation of cbm for offshore plants have been insufficient implementing cbm based on gathered sensor data is still an undeveloped area and its current approaches are unreliable thus much effort is still needed for the proper tuning and integration of the functions required for the cbm approach and to implement this approach as a whole to cope with these limitations this study introduces the development of a cbm system for an offshore plant i e lng fpso including an introduction of the system architecture main components diagnostics and prognostics methods 3 cbm system for an lng fpso 3 1 lng fpso in this study as an offshore plant for applying cbm approach an lng fpso is considered due to the fact that accidents at the lng fpso during its operation cause catastrophic damage it is much valuable to deal with the improvement of a maintenance system for an lng fpso a fpso unit is a floating vessel used by the offshore oil and gas industry for the production and processing of hydrocarbons and for the storage of oil floating above an offshore natural gas field lng fpsos will produce liquefy store and transfer lng and potentially lpg and condensate at sea before carriers ship it directly to markets the lng fpso is composed of numerous facilities and equipment from the top side to the hull side and to the subsea side in the developed cbms not only the gas compressors but also pump towers in the hull side and mooring lines in the subsea side have been considered for case studies for cbms among them this study introduces the case study for gas compressors in the top side of the lng tank among the many pieces of equipment in lng fpso facilities the compressor is most widely used and plays a crucial role the compressor is a mechanical device which increases the pressure of the gas and reduces its volume to increase the thermal efficiency of a plant means a reduction of the compressor power and an efficiency enhancement of the compressor drive choi 2011 lng fpso systems need powerful compressors to extract gas efficiently with compressors to assist in the process gas recovery can reach 40 50 effectively doubling the recovery rate of conventional methods any unexpected or prolonged downtime of these units has a large impact on plant availability as a loss of compression capability drastically affects the oil and gas production of the asset arthur and dunn 2001 for this reason the development of a cbm system for compressors is required there are several parameters to be considered when monitoring the status of a compressor the relative shaft vibration and bearing vibration data are usually used to evaluate the status of a compressor of an lng fpso in this study we focus on the shaft vibration parameter as it is widely used to determine the states of rotating equipment generally vibration is the value over time of the magnitude of a quantity that is descriptive of the motion or position of a mechanical system because most normal plant equipment is mechanical vibration monitoring provides the best tool for routine monitoring and the identification of incipient problems mobley 2002 an increase in the amplitude of vibration may be an indication of a deteriorating machine condition and the rate of increase is proportional to the degree of damage therefore it is possible to predict the trend of the deterioration of a machine by monitoring the amplitudes of its fault related vibration features tse and atherton 1999 for more details on the failure definition of shaft vibration data the reader can refer to cho et al 2016 3 2 system architecture and main components in general the cbm system can be completed by 1 gathering the equipment s status data and detecting the abnormality via monitoring 2 diagnosing the equipment status 3 predicting the failure time of the equipment and 4 making appropriate decisions on maintenance options including a suitable schedule and types of actions such as inspections repairs and replacements based on the estimated deterioration level of the equipment hence to implement the cbm approach it is necessary to resolve several research issues related to data gathering monitoring diagnosing predicting and decision making on maintenance in this study the proposed cbm system for an lng fpso is defined as a decision making support solution software assisting with predictions of residual lifetimes and maintenance in advance before a breakdown by diagnosing the conditions of equipment based on acquired data this system consists of supervisory control and data acquisition scada function module cbm platform and cbm function modules as shown in fig 1 the scada function module based on a distributed control system dcs is responsible for collecting numerous types of data transmitted from sensors attached to various pieces of equipment of an lng fpso it also has the function of monitoring the equipment status and assessing its basic performance the cbm function modules have four main functions diagnostics prognostics maintenance and configuration management the first step in the cbm process is diagnostics the diagnostics function utilizes the sensor data of the equipment it identifies the state of the equipment and diagnoses the types of failures that may occur based on this if the diagnostics function identifies a failure mode type it undertakes a prognostics function on the equipment the prognostics function then predicts the remaining useful life rul subsequently the maintenance function utilizes the results of the diagnostics and prognostics functions to provide users with useful information such as the possible maintenance schedules and methods based on accumulated previous data the configuration management function has the ability to keep design standards requirements design configurations and geometrical shapes of equipment constant and consistent at all times when the equipment information is changed through equipment maintenance actions the configuration management function updates and stores the information and then maintains the changed information for use in diagnostics prognostics and maintenance services the cbm platform is responsible for managing and controlling the cbm function modules it acts as a traffic signal between cbm functions the cbm platform has the following features 1 process management and 2 integrated data management 1 process management the cbm platform defines and manages diagnostic predictive and maintenance related data and processes because it is not efficient for diagnostics prognostics and maintenance function modules to respond to a variety of situations in an lng fpso the cbm platform predefines each module s interactions and controls them diagnostics prognostics and maintenance modules support the operation and maintenance activities through events of which coordination is implemented in the cbm platform 2 integrated data management the cbm platform manages the data that must be shared among diagnostics prognostics and maintenance function modules for this it provides the integrated data management the integrated data management enables the consistent and reliable approach for applying cbm function modules by accumulating and managing the normal and failure data in an integrated way based on accumulated data diagnostics prognostics and maintenance function modules will regularly update the parameters needed to carry out each algorithm e g failure rates threshold values for decision making and so on the cbm platform is the basis for four cbm functions and provides comprehensive management of cbm processes and configuration relationships not only does the cbms platform provides access to the operational concepts of the cbm solution it is also used for the general monitoring of routine surveillance and equipment status checks based on information from the scada function module through the cbm platform it is possible to check current sensor signals of the equipment furthermore it is possible to identify the current status and degree of severity of the equipment from the viewpoint of maintenance it is expressed by the traffic light system to simplify recognition by the user in the cbm platform as shown in fig 2 the color of traffic light is green when the condition of a certain equipment is normal and yellow when an abnormality is detected as the monitoring result of scada function module or when a specific failure mode is expected as the result of diagnostics when the equipment is in need of maintenance activity i e when the prognostics result shows a low rul value it is displayed in red so that the user can recognize the degree of severity of the equipment quickly and easily the cbm platform enables diagnostics prognostics and maintenance functions to share the processing results in addition on the cbm platform users can view the status of lng fpso s equipment through the summary screen refer to fig 2 sent from the scada function diagnostics prognostics and maintenance function modules the left side of the screenshot in fig 2 depicts the product breakdown structure pbs of an lng fpso managed by the configuration management function if selecting a piece of equipment in pbs information on the relevant drawings attached sensor signals as well as pictures of the equipment are displayed on the right side for more details about the workflows among the components of the cbm system the reader can refer to fig 3 and table 2 fig 4 also depicts the event process chain diagram describing the interactions among main components of cbms 3 2 1 difference to other architectures the proposed cbm architecture integrates system processes for monitoring diagnostics prognostics and maintenance phases to support cbm decisions the proposed cbm architecture has two difference points compared to other architectures mentioned in table 1 cbm platform and configuration management the proposed architecture has the cbm platform for controlling the cbm processes and managing relevant information at each stage the cbm platform transfers the information provided by the scada system of the lng fpso to diagnostics prognostics and maintenance function it also stores and manages the data associated with cbm processes it drives the cbm process based on detected anomalous events from the scada system this is not presented in the existing cbm architecture in addition the proposed architecture considers the configuration management in order to ensure the consistency of equipment configuration which improves the operational and maintenance accuracy as well as the safety of the lng fpso 3 2 2 technical background of the cbm approach in general the methods for diagnostics and prognostics used in cbm could be classified into data driven approach and physics based approach in general the accuracy of the physics based approach is high when set well however there are limits to universal use in many different environments for this reason in this study we develop the data driven approaches that diagnose or predict the status of a gas compressor through relative shaft vibration data diagnostics has two steps the first step is to determine whether there is an abnormality or not and the second one is to identify the type of abnormality in this study statistical and data mining techniques such as principal component analysis pca and bayes classifier are applied to perform the diagnostics in prognostics we develop several approaches reliability based regression based markov model based and bayesian network based approaches among them the regression based markov based and bayesian network based approaches are data driven methods to predict the rul of the equipment for time series data collected from sensors reliability based approach may also be a data driven approach in that reliability parameters are estimated based on past failure history data in the reliability based approach to predict the rul of the equipment several probability distributions such as exponential distribution log normal distribution and weibull distribution could be used for example under the assumption that the failure pattern follows the weibull distribution based on gathered failure history data we could estimate failure parameter values i e parameters of weibull distribution then we could estimate the failure probability density function and mean time between failures and finally predict the next failure time based on them in the regression based approach when the vibration data evidently differs from the moving average filter and shows increasing trends we predict the next failure time using simple linear regression model iso 7919 international standard for relative shaft vibration of rotating machines suggests the vibration limits of a vibration parameter limit of start up performance limit of good vibration performance limit for warning alarm and limit for trip according to iso 7919 we let the limit for trip as a critical limit for the failure of a compressor then we calculate the point where the simple linear regression line intersects with the limit for trip and considers it the next failure time in the markov model based approach we assume that the vibration state evolves continuously over time and state transition rate does not depend on time based on the interview result with compressor engineers based on this assumption we divide the vibration value into some levels and stochastically predict the next failure time based on the finite state continuous time markov model theory bayesian network based approach is based on bayesian probability and bayesian network model theory bayesian network provides a useful tool for failure inference because it represents the probabilistic relationship between causes and symptoms or between symptoms and faults it can also represent multi fault and multi symptom models moreover it could effectively analyze the complex causal relations with its inference and sensitivity methods based on the conditional probability the relationship model between cause symptom failure can be constructed as a bayesian network model which can be used to predict the failure from the sensor data and furthermore to infer cause based on the gathered data or observed inspection data we can fix the evidence of the specific symptoms fault or cause and hence update the occurrence probabilities of the causes or symptoms or faults 3 3 diagnostics the diagnostics system judges abnormal situations of the equipment based on the sensor data and identifies the types of possible failures in cbm diagnostics methods vary depending on the characteristics of the equipment typical diagnostics methods are to diagnose the abnormality of equipment through signal processing and pattern recognition to this end it is essential to use the sensor data collected from scada after carrying out appropriate pre processing methods such as removing noise removing data corresponding to the shutdown period and removing data that deviates from the trend of the corresponding sensor value it then becomes possible to extract the features that best represent the characteristics of the data using the refined data to do this statistical data is used as basis and various features can be extracted by examining the frequency domain after extracting the features the features that represent the major index variables pertaining to failure modes for the extracted features can be selected during this process pca could be used to reduce the dimension of the gathered data pca is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components or sometimes principal modes of variation after finding the principal component that best represents various variables we can derive two variables from the principal component which ultimately reduces the high dimensional feature vector to a two dimensional feature vector in order to determine the area of the 2d features obtained through dimension reduction via the pca in this study a minimum error bayesian classifier has been used the decision boundary is a line that defines the boundary between features to minimize the probability of error during the classification process refer to fig 5 essentially the bayes error rate represents the minimum point at which two probability density functions meet and this point is the decision boundary obtained from the minimum error bayesian classifier this allows classification of the pattern area according to the failure mode on the 2d plane when a given instance of sensor data is compared to a failure mode pattern and the pattern moves from the steady state region to the failure mode region the system diagnoses the failure indications of the equipment these regions and boundaries can infer the causes of failures e g misalignments leakages this intelligent diagnostics criterion is a more advanced technique than the conventional method widely used in condition monitoring i e warning the symptom over the limit value to verify the proposed diagnostics algorithm we have tested the algorithm for several data on shaft vibrations of a gas compressor generated based on sample vibration data obtained from a compressor manufacturing company in south korea fig 5 shows some test results for the diagnostics algorithm in this example for all three cases we have observed abnormal situations in sensor tag data which requires the diagnostics process for identifying what it is happening in the compressor as the test results of diagnostics the diagnostics algorithm correctly identified the failure modes for three cases although it could not indicate the robustness or superiority of the proposed algorithm due to small test cases we see that the bayes classifier could be a good solution in classifying the failure mode for observed abnormal sensor data fig 6 shows an overview of the diagnostics method and the screenshot of the diagnostics module 3 4 prognostics even when equipment is running in an abnormal state it does not mean that the equipment has failed it may still be possible to use the equipment for a certain amount of time before a failure occurs to handle this situation and predict the degradation state prognostics must be done the prognostics method has the function of estimating the rul by analyzing the state of the equipment in which the abnormality is indicated by the diagnosis module here we use a method which predicts the rul of equipment based on the deteriorated state in order to predict the rul we developed four approaches reliability based approach regression based approach markov model based approach and bayesian network based approach the reliability based approach estimates the rul using the failure parameters and function of the gas compressor of the lng fpso based on reliability theory it is suitable for use in the initial stage of offshore plant equipment because it can be used with the failure parameter values and function provided by the equipment manufacturer in the state where initial failure data does not exist however there is a disadvantage in that the estimated rul is inaccurate because the status data pertaining to the operation and environment of the equipment are not considered in this approach the regression based approach refer to fig 7 is a means of estimating the rul using the moving average method and a simple linear regression model to refer to a predetermined failure threshold value when the time series signal data e g vibration data continuously exhibits an abnormal singularity in this approach continuous monitoring using the moving average method is done to determine when the vibration data continuously exhibits abnormal trends after finding the point at which the abnormality is indicated a regression model is established for k data thereafter and the rul is estimated by finding the point at which the signal threshold value is reached the regression based approach is straightforward and practical and it gives us the relative good performance when the residual life time is closed to the failure time this approach is well suited for predicting the rul values of univariate signal data with trends over time but there is a limit to the rul estimation of equipment with a failure pattern due to additional factors its prediction value is sensitive by a small number of outliers it has the limitation in estimating the next failure time when the residual life time is relatively long since the linear regression model has the tendency in being highly affected by abnormal data the markov model based approach is a method which is used to obtain the rul by modeling the past fault history data and the present signal with a markov model after classifying the state level of the vibration data and obtaining the state transition ratio the next expected failure time is obtained through the formula cho et al 2016 derived from the markov model theory this approach has an advantage in that the accuracy of rul estimation can be high for equipment with low variability in its fault patterns however it has several limitations first this approach requires a sufficient amount of failure history data second this approach assumes that the past fault history data exist and that the oscillation data basically has markovian characteristics that is it is not related to previous data trends if this assumption is violated the markov model based approach is not useful in addition its application formula is somewhat complicated fig 8 shows the markov model based approach for more details on the regression based approach and the markov model based approach the reader can refer to cho et al 2016 the bayesian network based approach is a method for determining the failure status determining the failure type and predicting the rul using a bayesian network an artificial neural network a decision tree and a simple regression model in the developed model after building the bayesian network model we can estimate the conditional probability table cpt based on the processed data for more details on the update of cpt based on the gathered sensor data the reader can refer to jun and kim 2017 the probability of failure can be deduced based on the updated cpt if it is inferred that a failure has occurred the failure type is determined based on the accumulated failure type classification data using a k means algorithm and the decision tree on the other hand if it is inferred that it is not a failure type the rul is estimated using a regression model between accumulated data failure probability remaining lifetime with the inferred failure probability value this approach is suitable for an analysis of sensor based multivariate data it is advantageous in that it can reflect state changes of the dynamically changing equipment system through the update of the cpt of the bayesian network model however there is a disadvantage in that the accuracy of failure analysis and rul estimation can be affected by the causality accuracy of the constructed bayesian network model fig 9 shows an overview of the bayesian network based approach and the results of the case study for example if the remaining life time rul of six days is estimated to remain the failure hazard prediction index h could be calculated as 100 with h min t rul 100 because it is usually less than 15 days which is the minimum period t for preparing maintenance based on this result the user can establish an appropriate maintenance strategy through an economic evaluation in order to verify the proposed algorithms since it is hard to get the actual failure data of an lng fpso enough to statistically validate the algorithms we have tested them with generated failure data based on real data as the test results we could see that the proposed prognostics algorithms have given robust and good solutions for the generated failure data sets for the detailed test results on regression based and markov model based approaches please refer to cho et al 2016 for the detailed test results of bayesian network based approach please refer to jun and kim 2017 since introduction of descriptions on diagnosis and prognosis algorithms with the relevant equations and validated test results is out of the scope in this study we omit them in this study for convenience 4 discussion issues cbm is not a single technique it requires very complex and various interdisciplinary research techniques which needs much time and effort for cbm implementation thus there are many issues to be discussed the following issues may be considered when applying and implementing cbm first offshore plants such as lng fpso consist of a large variety of equipment such as compressors pumps power generators piping valves and vessels it is imperative to build an appropriate maintenance operation model for each piece of equipment and to set a range for the cbm application because the maintenance operation subject and method may differ according to the characteristics of each equipment for each equipment we should always examine the impact of an investment in cbm by identifying the benefits and costs as it is not always effective in all cases depending on the equipment type its lifecycle life time maintenance cost the degree of severity in case of failure and other such factors the economic benefits will differ thus a suitable maintenance method for each equipment should be selected based on an evaluation which takes into consideration such factors as the importance of the equipment its deterioration and failure characteristics failure cost online offline inspection methods and optimal inspection cycle second there are several discussion points in the data for cbm first there is a data resolution issue depending on the resolution of the data collection the cost and accuracy of cbm approach could vary thus we should consider the scale of gathered sensor data in cbm sensor measurements could be taken at regular intervals or even continuously in a real time manner if we monitor and gather the equipment status data in real time it must be best for analyzing the equipment condition in a precise manner however this approach requires a heavy burden of data gathering which increases the cost from a practical viewpoint it is not cost effective to gather the data pertaining to all equipment status continuously and in real time for example depending on the case we may need high resolution e g every 0 1 or 0 01 s shaft or bearing vibration signal data generated by machines rotating at a high speed however for the temperature or pressure data on the vessels we may need low resolution e g every five minutes every one hour data hence it is necessary to decide upon the most suitable time period for data gathering considering the scale of the gathered data another discussion point concerns the data needed for diagnostics and prognostics algorithms the core task of the cbm is to diagnose the current state of equipment based on the collected data and to predict rul in the future the accuracy of these algorithms is mostly affected by the amount and quality of the gathered data when implementing cbm if there are much amount of failure history data along with sensor data there is no problem in developing the cbm algorithms the problem is applying cbm in situations with very little or no data available this is typical for newly commissioned systems where no observed failure data or maintenance information exist si et al 2011 in such a case as noted by si et al 2011 the quantity and completeness of the data are insufficient to fit the full statistical models or machine learning based algorithms if there is not enough data during the initial stage of the operation of the equipment diagnosing and predicting the equipment state reasonably become problematic to resolve this problem one possible solution is to develop physics based models for diagnostics and prognostics with the help of subjective expert knowledge from design and manufacturing or to use the reliability information provided by the equipment manufacturer in this study for the prognostics of the initial stage of the gas compressor equipment we developed the reliability based approach except for reliability based approach diagnostics and other prognostics algorithms are data driven approaches because such approaches are very useful for complex systems where the knowledge of the underlying physics is absent and the health of the system is to be assessed however a critical disadvantage of the data driven approach is that it does not work well without enough data for such cases there have been no tangible solutions thus far however if machine learning techniques e g in our case a diagnostic algorithm and the bayesian network based algorithm in prognostics are used for diagnostics or prognostics in the beginning of equipment operation an unsupervised learning approach may be better to build up reference data with which to identify normal and abnormal states to this end we also need precise definitions of faults or failures i e we must know what the healthy condition of the observed system is subsequently with collected reference data supervised learning and reinforcement learning approach can be applied to make the cbm algorithms more accurate on the other hand we must be careful about what types of data should be collected during the usage period of the equipment and must carefully decide how to collect the data and use it in the diagnostics and prognostics algorithms furthermore recently as various business models that provide cbm as a service have become increasingly practical issues of ownership of the data collected and security issues are newly emerging thus if the information generated through the cbm is of high importance it is important to clarify the criteria related to data ownership and security issues through consultations at the beginning of cbm operation third cbm must be examined and approached from a holistic viewpoint for the entire system beyond simply applying cbm to specific equipment thus far most previous studies on cbm have focused on relatively well known single equipment therefore as noted in a study by koochaki et al 2012 the effect of cbm was not clear for the whole offshore plant composed of multi component systems however owing to the increasing complexity of offshore plants due to automation and the use of unmanned systems it is necessary to consider the application of cbm to more complicated upper systems rather than to single equipment this study introduced the case study of cbm implementation for only single equipment of an lng fpso i e for a gas compressor although not only gas compressors but also pump towers and mooring line equipment were considered as case study equipment in our project they were omitted in this study for convenience in spite of this fact this study is limited in that the cbm method with an integrated view of all equipment of an lng fpso was not addressed fourth because the equipment of an lng fpso is different in terms of service life it is essential that the learning based failure knowledge acquisition technology should be secured based on the collection and integration of information for diagnostics prognostics and maintenance in particular due to the diversity of ship owners and operators the type and operating environment of lng fpso s facilities and equipment are diverse thus it is impossible to fix the failure data for maintenance as the result the following procedure is required to build the learning based failure knowledge 1 obtain normal type data by collecting and learning steady state data during lng fpso operation 2 accumulate the fault state data based on normal type data and reliability data of similar equipment and 3 based on the acquired failure data the reliability of cbm system could be improved automatically by applying the learning based algorithm to diagnostics and prognostics algorithms lastly there is an issue on how we validate the proposed architecture first of all to validate the proposed architecture we have developed an experimental proof of concept system the developed system provides part of functionality hence it is currently being used for validating the efficiency of the proposed approach and architecture to verify and validate the developed system based on the proposed architecture the system has been certified from a korean software certification authority after being tested for sw functionality reliability efficiency usability maintainability portability performance interoperability and suitability based on the relevant international standards iso iec 9126 25041 25051 5 conclusion in this study we introduced a cbm system for an lng fpso we addressed the system architecture and main components as features differentiating the proposed system from other types of system architecture for cbm the configuration management and cbm platform which acts as a traffic signal between cbm functions were newly proposed furthermore we briefly introduced diagnostics and prognostics methods mostly data driven approaches pertaining to identifying or detecting abnormal situations and failure modes as well as predicting rul values based on the gathered sensor data in addition we discussed several issues related to cbm implementation which can serve as insightful references when implementing a cbm system the developed cbms for an lng fpso could analyze the data obtained through various sensors to identify abnormalities of equipment to diagnose fault conditions to predict the deteriorated states of equipment and to provide timely maintenance support the proposed cbms could also provide diagnostics and prognostics functions which are not performed in the cmms such that the lng fpso operator can make the best decisions related to maintenance activities to ensure a better operating environment of an lng fpso although this study does not contain every detail of the development of the cbm system for an lng fpso it could be the cornerstone of cbm research acknowledgments this research was financially supported by korea evaluation institute of industrial

23210,in general the equipment failures or accidents of offshore plants during operation and maintenance o m period cause catastrophic damage thus it is necessary to undertake proactive maintenance in advance in order to avoid abnormal situations currently owing to the emergence of information communication technologies icts and sensor technologies it is possible to gather the health status data of important equipment and use this information for maintenance during the o m period it sheds light on condition based maintenance cbm strategy in this study we introduce a case study on the development of a cbm system cbms for an oil and gas offshore plant i e liquefied natural gas floating production storage and offloading vessel lng fpso the study includes the introduction of the system architecture main components diagnostics and prognostics methods of the system as well as a discussion of its implementation keywords condition based maintenance offshore plant maintenance diagnostics prognostics system architecture 1 introduction in general there have been various classifications of maintenance policies corrective maintenance breakdown maintenance regular maintenance such as time based preventive maintenance etc for more details on maintenance types please refer to erbe et al 2005 according to ahmad and kamaruddin 2012 maintenance strategy can be divided into corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance the preventive maintenance has two kinds time based maintenance and condition based maintenance in similar terms predictive maintenance prognostics and health management phm henceforth referred to as cbm among them cbm has been recently highlighted cbm can serve as a means of reducing the uncertainty of maintenance activities and is carried out according to the requirements indicated by the equipment condition peng et al 2010 in recent decades advancements in information communication technology ict have accelerated growth in the cbm technology area by enabling network bandwidth data collection and retrieval data analysis and decision support capabilities for large datasets of time series data prajapati et al 2012 given this new environment we can collect and use data on the status of equipment related to usage conditions failures and maintenance and service events using this information gives us new and challenging issues to improve the efficiency of equipment maintenance operations we can identify and solve problems in advance before damage to equipment occurs by detecting abnormal states throughout monitoring diagnosing abnormal types predicting remaining useful life and undertaking proactive maintenance i e by engaging in cbm capital intensive industries such as offshore plants should be operated with high reliability and high levels of availability because the downtime due to system failure has a significant influence on the manufacturing activity and degree of safety because a critical failure or degradation of equipment can seriously damage the belief of customers regarding equipment reliability maintenance enhancements to prevent failures or instances of degradation in advance should take precedence over other factors offshore plants have normally the long operation times for example an offshore wind power plant is usually operated 25 years m√ºnsterberg 2016 offshore plants have become more complex and vast thus considerable costs and numerous efforts are required in the o m phase of offshore plants the maintenance of an offshore plant during its operation phase involves the provision of support and assessments of problems through inspections that target mechanical defects and corrosion according to heng et al 2009 todays complex manufacturing systems such as on shore and off shore plants require highly sophisticated and costly maintenance policies the oil majors and operating companies are paying increasingly more attention to the costs in the o m phase increased o m costs have become a main topic of conversation by those involved in asset integrity management aim hwang 2015 previously conservative maintenance methods such as time based preventive maintenance and breakdown maintenance were used during the o m phase of an offshore plant however there is an increasing need to reduce operating costs through more proactive and advanced maintenance methods one solution is cbm cbm is currently being utilized in the petrochemical industry with condition monitoring of both onshore and offshore oil and gas wells telford et al 2011 cbm has thus become a very attractive method in the oil and gas industries thus far efforts to enhance the performance of plant maintenance with cbm have drawn the attention of researchers however few studies have introduced instances of the cbm implementation in plant industries and this is especially true for offshore plants cbm remains a challenging area current approaches have limitations given the lack of detailed methods and validated models though data gathering systems are becoming relatively more mature much work remains to be done on reliable and robust for monitoring diagnostics prognostics and decision making methods in relation to maintenance from 2013 to 2016 for implementing a cbm system cbms for a liquefied natural gas floating production storage and offloading vessel lng fpso a korean government funded research project has been carried out an lng fpso is an offshore plant which delivers liquefied gas from a gas field to customers according to zhu et al 2013 the demand for lng fpsos has greatly increased and the demand for lng fpso projects is predicted to continue to grow along with the increased demand for natural gas in this vein this study focuses on the introduction of the case study of the cbms development for an lng fpso in the study we introduce the system architecture main components of cbms diagnostics and prognostics methods and discussion issues required to implement the cbm system the rest of this study is organized as follows in the section entitled related works relevant previous studies are reviewed and their limitations are discussed the section entitled cbm system for an lng fpso introduces the system architecture main components diagnostics and prognostics methods the section discussion issues introduces the subjects to be considered when implementing the cbm system finally this study is concluded with a summary and discussion of its contributions 2 related works 2 1 cbm study in academia there have been several previous works related to cbm concepts or frameworks for example the machinery information management open systems alliance mimosa designed what is known as the open standard architecture condition based maintenance osa cbm approach according to osa cbm thurston 2001 there are seven layers required to implement the cbm concept refer to table 1 sensor modules signal processing condition monitoring health assessments prognostics decision support and presentation djurdjanovic et al 2003 proposed a framework which encompassed a watchdog agent for predictive condition based maintenance by undertaking multi sensor assessments and predictions of machines or process performance levels the concept of the watchdog agent based its degradation assessments on readings from multiple sensors that measure critical properties of the process or machinery under a networked and tether free environment the watchdog agent is an embedded system that uses algorithms which autonomously assess and predict performance degradations and the remaining lifetimes of machines and components bengtsson 2004 investigated standards and standardization proposals related to cbm and described several organizational aspects to be considered when determining whether to implement a cbm kothamasu et al 2006 reviewed the philosophies and techniques of system health monitoring and prognostics they surveyed health monitoring paradigms and looked into the details of health monitoring tools in addition they introduced previous case studies of system monitoring and control techniques furthermore groba et al 2007 introduced the initial architecture for the cbm framework as realized in a joint project with sap research they noted several aspects of cbm including the identification measurements modeling and forecasting of indicators as well as considerations when making decisions in addition prajapati et al 2012 provided a brief overview of cbm with definitions of various terms a history review and a summary of recent developments applications and research challenges in the cbm domain they also discussed how cbm could be used to optimize maintenance strategies and increase the feasibility and practicality of a cbm system he and ma 2012 reviewed the history of phm and analyzed the main elements of a general phm system later proposing the phm system architecture for electronic equipment chen et al 2012 presented a technical framework of embedded diagnostics and prognostics ed ep for complex mechanical systems as well as underlying opportunities and challenges they also presented an example to demonstrate the implementation of the ed ep concept recently shin and jun 2015 addressed several aspects of the cbm approach including definitions related international standards procedures and techniques table 1 shows a comparison of various system layers for cbm implementation from previous works on the other hand there have been numerous cbm works pertaining to specific domains for example patel and kamrani 1996 introduced a diagnosis and maintenance consultant system for industrial robots called robodoc they introduced the concepts of maintenance artificial intelligence and expert systems with a state of the art review of diagnostic expert systems they also provided the specifications and structure of robodoc and explained the approaches used during its construction lee 1998 introduced a new methodology of predictive maintenance which relied on machinery dynamics and data fusion through remote machinery monitoring they also presented an example of a remote wireless application currently in use for monitoring machinery in industrial plants dieulle et al 2001 proposed a mathematical model for determining a cbm policy efficiently using renewal processes theory in their model they regarded preventive replacement threshold and inspection schedule as decision variables koœÇ and lee 2001 addressed the concept of web enabled predictive maintenance in an intelligent e maintenance system which is implemented via the internet and showed its system elements furthermore yan et al 2004 presented a prognostic method for machine degradation detection which assesses machine performance capabilities while also predicting the remaining useful life of the machine in question in their model real time performance is evaluated by inputting features of online data into a logistics model the remaining life is estimated using an autoregressive moving average arma model based on the machine performance history in addition fu et al 2004 proposed a predictive maintenance framework for a hydroelectric generating unit they presented three key elements for the predictive maintenance monitoring and forecasting diagnosis and prognosis and decision making bansal et al 2004 described a real time predictive maintenance system for machine systems the aim of their system is to localize and detect abnormal electrical conditions in order to predict mechanical abnormalities that indicate or may lead to the failure of a motor they used a neural network approach to predict the parameters of machines more recently lee et al 2006 introduced the emerging field of e maintenance and its critical elements they presented performance assessments and prediction tools such as neural networks fuzzy logic logistic regression hidden markov models and bayesian belief networks for the continuous assessment and prediction of a particular product performance metric 2 2 offshore plant maintenance machinery and parts of facilities and equipment in offshore plants are usually checked and replaced periodically based on time based maintenance methods it is clear that scheduled maintenance such as time based maintenance is smarter than emergency maintenance after an equipment failure although time based preventive maintenance is a good way to maintain the performance of offshore plant equipment however it does not guarantee to avoid any failures or accidents thus it is not suitable considering the massive costs incurred in the event of a breakdown this is a viable area for cbm which can assess the degradation properties of equipment operated in harsh environments such as offshore platforms and which can undertake prognosis and appropriate maintenance activities operating companies with offshore platforms in the us and eu start to consider the change of conventional maintenance systems in order to minimize their maintenance costs to this end converging ict is introduced and applied to offshore plant operation systems nuclear power plants and onshore plants already use facility maintenance information systems such as the computerized maintenance management system cmms cmms is a software package that manages the information about an organization s maintenance operations the information is intended to help maintenance workers do their jobs more effectively and to help management make informed decisions cmms can be defined as information processing of facility management tasks by computers and it aims efficiently to manage tasks and evaluate to performance outcomes of maintenance activities cmms has been actively introduced for use with commercial vessels cmms and cbms are similar in that they perform maintenance management on facilities however cbms provides intelligent functions associated with diagnostics and prognostics not performed in cmms thereby providing the user with useful information related to maintenance decision some previous works already dealt with the maintenance of offshore plants for example arthur and dunn 2001 introduced the application of an optimized cbm approach to large reciprocating compressors on an offshore installation caselitz and giebhardt 2002 introduced results of work in the field of condition monitoring and fault prediction in relation to offshore wind energy converters their work includes not only development hardware and software solutions but also prototype tests and the integration of fault prediction and maintenance and repair scheduling techniques nilsson and bertling 2007 presented a lifecycle cost lcc analysis for a single wind turbine onshore and a wind farm offshore they compared lcc outcomes for different strategies with strategies of a condition monitoring system cms miguel√°nez and lane 2010 presented a recovery system for offshore wind turbines their recovery system takes a broad view of events and sensor values across the complete turbine system and subsystems telford et al 2011 explored the existing literature on the development and applications of cbm in the oil and gas industry although not a few previous research works dealt with various cbm issues there is still a lack of research on the overall implementation of cbm functions most related research works dealt with some parts of cbm functions such as diagnosis or prognosis despite some studies of the cbm framework or system architecture reference works on the implementation of cbm for offshore plants have been insufficient implementing cbm based on gathered sensor data is still an undeveloped area and its current approaches are unreliable thus much effort is still needed for the proper tuning and integration of the functions required for the cbm approach and to implement this approach as a whole to cope with these limitations this study introduces the development of a cbm system for an offshore plant i e lng fpso including an introduction of the system architecture main components diagnostics and prognostics methods 3 cbm system for an lng fpso 3 1 lng fpso in this study as an offshore plant for applying cbm approach an lng fpso is considered due to the fact that accidents at the lng fpso during its operation cause catastrophic damage it is much valuable to deal with the improvement of a maintenance system for an lng fpso a fpso unit is a floating vessel used by the offshore oil and gas industry for the production and processing of hydrocarbons and for the storage of oil floating above an offshore natural gas field lng fpsos will produce liquefy store and transfer lng and potentially lpg and condensate at sea before carriers ship it directly to markets the lng fpso is composed of numerous facilities and equipment from the top side to the hull side and to the subsea side in the developed cbms not only the gas compressors but also pump towers in the hull side and mooring lines in the subsea side have been considered for case studies for cbms among them this study introduces the case study for gas compressors in the top side of the lng tank among the many pieces of equipment in lng fpso facilities the compressor is most widely used and plays a crucial role the compressor is a mechanical device which increases the pressure of the gas and reduces its volume to increase the thermal efficiency of a plant means a reduction of the compressor power and an efficiency enhancement of the compressor drive choi 2011 lng fpso systems need powerful compressors to extract gas efficiently with compressors to assist in the process gas recovery can reach 40 50 effectively doubling the recovery rate of conventional methods any unexpected or prolonged downtime of these units has a large impact on plant availability as a loss of compression capability drastically affects the oil and gas production of the asset arthur and dunn 2001 for this reason the development of a cbm system for compressors is required there are several parameters to be considered when monitoring the status of a compressor the relative shaft vibration and bearing vibration data are usually used to evaluate the status of a compressor of an lng fpso in this study we focus on the shaft vibration parameter as it is widely used to determine the states of rotating equipment generally vibration is the value over time of the magnitude of a quantity that is descriptive of the motion or position of a mechanical system because most normal plant equipment is mechanical vibration monitoring provides the best tool for routine monitoring and the identification of incipient problems mobley 2002 an increase in the amplitude of vibration may be an indication of a deteriorating machine condition and the rate of increase is proportional to the degree of damage therefore it is possible to predict the trend of the deterioration of a machine by monitoring the amplitudes of its fault related vibration features tse and atherton 1999 for more details on the failure definition of shaft vibration data the reader can refer to cho et al 2016 3 2 system architecture and main components in general the cbm system can be completed by 1 gathering the equipment s status data and detecting the abnormality via monitoring 2 diagnosing the equipment status 3 predicting the failure time of the equipment and 4 making appropriate decisions on maintenance options including a suitable schedule and types of actions such as inspections repairs and replacements based on the estimated deterioration level of the equipment hence to implement the cbm approach it is necessary to resolve several research issues related to data gathering monitoring diagnosing predicting and decision making on maintenance in this study the proposed cbm system for an lng fpso is defined as a decision making support solution software assisting with predictions of residual lifetimes and maintenance in advance before a breakdown by diagnosing the conditions of equipment based on acquired data this system consists of supervisory control and data acquisition scada function module cbm platform and cbm function modules as shown in fig 1 the scada function module based on a distributed control system dcs is responsible for collecting numerous types of data transmitted from sensors attached to various pieces of equipment of an lng fpso it also has the function of monitoring the equipment status and assessing its basic performance the cbm function modules have four main functions diagnostics prognostics maintenance and configuration management the first step in the cbm process is diagnostics the diagnostics function utilizes the sensor data of the equipment it identifies the state of the equipment and diagnoses the types of failures that may occur based on this if the diagnostics function identifies a failure mode type it undertakes a prognostics function on the equipment the prognostics function then predicts the remaining useful life rul subsequently the maintenance function utilizes the results of the diagnostics and prognostics functions to provide users with useful information such as the possible maintenance schedules and methods based on accumulated previous data the configuration management function has the ability to keep design standards requirements design configurations and geometrical shapes of equipment constant and consistent at all times when the equipment information is changed through equipment maintenance actions the configuration management function updates and stores the information and then maintains the changed information for use in diagnostics prognostics and maintenance services the cbm platform is responsible for managing and controlling the cbm function modules it acts as a traffic signal between cbm functions the cbm platform has the following features 1 process management and 2 integrated data management 1 process management the cbm platform defines and manages diagnostic predictive and maintenance related data and processes because it is not efficient for diagnostics prognostics and maintenance function modules to respond to a variety of situations in an lng fpso the cbm platform predefines each module s interactions and controls them diagnostics prognostics and maintenance modules support the operation and maintenance activities through events of which coordination is implemented in the cbm platform 2 integrated data management the cbm platform manages the data that must be shared among diagnostics prognostics and maintenance function modules for this it provides the integrated data management the integrated data management enables the consistent and reliable approach for applying cbm function modules by accumulating and managing the normal and failure data in an integrated way based on accumulated data diagnostics prognostics and maintenance function modules will regularly update the parameters needed to carry out each algorithm e g failure rates threshold values for decision making and so on the cbm platform is the basis for four cbm functions and provides comprehensive management of cbm processes and configuration relationships not only does the cbms platform provides access to the operational concepts of the cbm solution it is also used for the general monitoring of routine surveillance and equipment status checks based on information from the scada function module through the cbm platform it is possible to check current sensor signals of the equipment furthermore it is possible to identify the current status and degree of severity of the equipment from the viewpoint of maintenance it is expressed by the traffic light system to simplify recognition by the user in the cbm platform as shown in fig 2 the color of traffic light is green when the condition of a certain equipment is normal and yellow when an abnormality is detected as the monitoring result of scada function module or when a specific failure mode is expected as the result of diagnostics when the equipment is in need of maintenance activity i e when the prognostics result shows a low rul value it is displayed in red so that the user can recognize the degree of severity of the equipment quickly and easily the cbm platform enables diagnostics prognostics and maintenance functions to share the processing results in addition on the cbm platform users can view the status of lng fpso s equipment through the summary screen refer to fig 2 sent from the scada function diagnostics prognostics and maintenance function modules the left side of the screenshot in fig 2 depicts the product breakdown structure pbs of an lng fpso managed by the configuration management function if selecting a piece of equipment in pbs information on the relevant drawings attached sensor signals as well as pictures of the equipment are displayed on the right side for more details about the workflows among the components of the cbm system the reader can refer to fig 3 and table 2 fig 4 also depicts the event process chain diagram describing the interactions among main components of cbms 3 2 1 difference to other architectures the proposed cbm architecture integrates system processes for monitoring diagnostics prognostics and maintenance phases to support cbm decisions the proposed cbm architecture has two difference points compared to other architectures mentioned in table 1 cbm platform and configuration management the proposed architecture has the cbm platform for controlling the cbm processes and managing relevant information at each stage the cbm platform transfers the information provided by the scada system of the lng fpso to diagnostics prognostics and maintenance function it also stores and manages the data associated with cbm processes it drives the cbm process based on detected anomalous events from the scada system this is not presented in the existing cbm architecture in addition the proposed architecture considers the configuration management in order to ensure the consistency of equipment configuration which improves the operational and maintenance accuracy as well as the safety of the lng fpso 3 2 2 technical background of the cbm approach in general the methods for diagnostics and prognostics used in cbm could be classified into data driven approach and physics based approach in general the accuracy of the physics based approach is high when set well however there are limits to universal use in many different environments for this reason in this study we develop the data driven approaches that diagnose or predict the status of a gas compressor through relative shaft vibration data diagnostics has two steps the first step is to determine whether there is an abnormality or not and the second one is to identify the type of abnormality in this study statistical and data mining techniques such as principal component analysis pca and bayes classifier are applied to perform the diagnostics in prognostics we develop several approaches reliability based regression based markov model based and bayesian network based approaches among them the regression based markov based and bayesian network based approaches are data driven methods to predict the rul of the equipment for time series data collected from sensors reliability based approach may also be a data driven approach in that reliability parameters are estimated based on past failure history data in the reliability based approach to predict the rul of the equipment several probability distributions such as exponential distribution log normal distribution and weibull distribution could be used for example under the assumption that the failure pattern follows the weibull distribution based on gathered failure history data we could estimate failure parameter values i e parameters of weibull distribution then we could estimate the failure probability density function and mean time between failures and finally predict the next failure time based on them in the regression based approach when the vibration data evidently differs from the moving average filter and shows increasing trends we predict the next failure time using simple linear regression model iso 7919 international standard for relative shaft vibration of rotating machines suggests the vibration limits of a vibration parameter limit of start up performance limit of good vibration performance limit for warning alarm and limit for trip according to iso 7919 we let the limit for trip as a critical limit for the failure of a compressor then we calculate the point where the simple linear regression line intersects with the limit for trip and considers it the next failure time in the markov model based approach we assume that the vibration state evolves continuously over time and state transition rate does not depend on time based on the interview result with compressor engineers based on this assumption we divide the vibration value into some levels and stochastically predict the next failure time based on the finite state continuous time markov model theory bayesian network based approach is based on bayesian probability and bayesian network model theory bayesian network provides a useful tool for failure inference because it represents the probabilistic relationship between causes and symptoms or between symptoms and faults it can also represent multi fault and multi symptom models moreover it could effectively analyze the complex causal relations with its inference and sensitivity methods based on the conditional probability the relationship model between cause symptom failure can be constructed as a bayesian network model which can be used to predict the failure from the sensor data and furthermore to infer cause based on the gathered data or observed inspection data we can fix the evidence of the specific symptoms fault or cause and hence update the occurrence probabilities of the causes or symptoms or faults 3 3 diagnostics the diagnostics system judges abnormal situations of the equipment based on the sensor data and identifies the types of possible failures in cbm diagnostics methods vary depending on the characteristics of the equipment typical diagnostics methods are to diagnose the abnormality of equipment through signal processing and pattern recognition to this end it is essential to use the sensor data collected from scada after carrying out appropriate pre processing methods such as removing noise removing data corresponding to the shutdown period and removing data that deviates from the trend of the corresponding sensor value it then becomes possible to extract the features that best represent the characteristics of the data using the refined data to do this statistical data is used as basis and various features can be extracted by examining the frequency domain after extracting the features the features that represent the major index variables pertaining to failure modes for the extracted features can be selected during this process pca could be used to reduce the dimension of the gathered data pca is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components or sometimes principal modes of variation after finding the principal component that best represents various variables we can derive two variables from the principal component which ultimately reduces the high dimensional feature vector to a two dimensional feature vector in order to determine the area of the 2d features obtained through dimension reduction via the pca in this study a minimum error bayesian classifier has been used the decision boundary is a line that defines the boundary between features to minimize the probability of error during the classification process refer to fig 5 essentially the bayes error rate represents the minimum point at which two probability density functions meet and this point is the decision boundary obtained from the minimum error bayesian classifier this allows classification of the pattern area according to the failure mode on the 2d plane when a given instance of sensor data is compared to a failure mode pattern and the pattern moves from the steady state region to the failure mode region the system diagnoses the failure indications of the equipment these regions and boundaries can infer the causes of failures e g misalignments leakages this intelligent diagnostics criterion is a more advanced technique than the conventional method widely used in condition monitoring i e warning the symptom over the limit value to verify the proposed diagnostics algorithm we have tested the algorithm for several data on shaft vibrations of a gas compressor generated based on sample vibration data obtained from a compressor manufacturing company in south korea fig 5 shows some test results for the diagnostics algorithm in this example for all three cases we have observed abnormal situations in sensor tag data which requires the diagnostics process for identifying what it is happening in the compressor as the test results of diagnostics the diagnostics algorithm correctly identified the failure modes for three cases although it could not indicate the robustness or superiority of the proposed algorithm due to small test cases we see that the bayes classifier could be a good solution in classifying the failure mode for observed abnormal sensor data fig 6 shows an overview of the diagnostics method and the screenshot of the diagnostics module 3 4 prognostics even when equipment is running in an abnormal state it does not mean that the equipment has failed it may still be possible to use the equipment for a certain amount of time before a failure occurs to handle this situation and predict the degradation state prognostics must be done the prognostics method has the function of estimating the rul by analyzing the state of the equipment in which the abnormality is indicated by the diagnosis module here we use a method which predicts the rul of equipment based on the deteriorated state in order to predict the rul we developed four approaches reliability based approach regression based approach markov model based approach and bayesian network based approach the reliability based approach estimates the rul using the failure parameters and function of the gas compressor of the lng fpso based on reliability theory it is suitable for use in the initial stage of offshore plant equipment because it can be used with the failure parameter values and function provided by the equipment manufacturer in the state where initial failure data does not exist however there is a disadvantage in that the estimated rul is inaccurate because the status data pertaining to the operation and environment of the equipment are not considered in this approach the regression based approach refer to fig 7 is a means of estimating the rul using the moving average method and a simple linear regression model to refer to a predetermined failure threshold value when the time series signal data e g vibration data continuously exhibits an abnormal singularity in this approach continuous monitoring using the moving average method is done to determine when the vibration data continuously exhibits abnormal trends after finding the point at which the abnormality is indicated a regression model is established for k data thereafter and the rul is estimated by finding the point at which the signal threshold value is reached the regression based approach is straightforward and practical and it gives us the relative good performance when the residual life time is closed to the failure time this approach is well suited for predicting the rul values of univariate signal data with trends over time but there is a limit to the rul estimation of equipment with a failure pattern due to additional factors its prediction value is sensitive by a small number of outliers it has the limitation in estimating the next failure time when the residual life time is relatively long since the linear regression model has the tendency in being highly affected by abnormal data the markov model based approach is a method which is used to obtain the rul by modeling the past fault history data and the present signal with a markov model after classifying the state level of the vibration data and obtaining the state transition ratio the next expected failure time is obtained through the formula cho et al 2016 derived from the markov model theory this approach has an advantage in that the accuracy of rul estimation can be high for equipment with low variability in its fault patterns however it has several limitations first this approach requires a sufficient amount of failure history data second this approach assumes that the past fault history data exist and that the oscillation data basically has markovian characteristics that is it is not related to previous data trends if this assumption is violated the markov model based approach is not useful in addition its application formula is somewhat complicated fig 8 shows the markov model based approach for more details on the regression based approach and the markov model based approach the reader can refer to cho et al 2016 the bayesian network based approach is a method for determining the failure status determining the failure type and predicting the rul using a bayesian network an artificial neural network a decision tree and a simple regression model in the developed model after building the bayesian network model we can estimate the conditional probability table cpt based on the processed data for more details on the update of cpt based on the gathered sensor data the reader can refer to jun and kim 2017 the probability of failure can be deduced based on the updated cpt if it is inferred that a failure has occurred the failure type is determined based on the accumulated failure type classification data using a k means algorithm and the decision tree on the other hand if it is inferred that it is not a failure type the rul is estimated using a regression model between accumulated data failure probability remaining lifetime with the inferred failure probability value this approach is suitable for an analysis of sensor based multivariate data it is advantageous in that it can reflect state changes of the dynamically changing equipment system through the update of the cpt of the bayesian network model however there is a disadvantage in that the accuracy of failure analysis and rul estimation can be affected by the causality accuracy of the constructed bayesian network model fig 9 shows an overview of the bayesian network based approach and the results of the case study for example if the remaining life time rul of six days is estimated to remain the failure hazard prediction index h could be calculated as 100 with h min t rul 100 because it is usually less than 15 days which is the minimum period t for preparing maintenance based on this result the user can establish an appropriate maintenance strategy through an economic evaluation in order to verify the proposed algorithms since it is hard to get the actual failure data of an lng fpso enough to statistically validate the algorithms we have tested them with generated failure data based on real data as the test results we could see that the proposed prognostics algorithms have given robust and good solutions for the generated failure data sets for the detailed test results on regression based and markov model based approaches please refer to cho et al 2016 for the detailed test results of bayesian network based approach please refer to jun and kim 2017 since introduction of descriptions on diagnosis and prognosis algorithms with the relevant equations and validated test results is out of the scope in this study we omit them in this study for convenience 4 discussion issues cbm is not a single technique it requires very complex and various interdisciplinary research techniques which needs much time and effort for cbm implementation thus there are many issues to be discussed the following issues may be considered when applying and implementing cbm first offshore plants such as lng fpso consist of a large variety of equipment such as compressors pumps power generators piping valves and vessels it is imperative to build an appropriate maintenance operation model for each piece of equipment and to set a range for the cbm application because the maintenance operation subject and method may differ according to the characteristics of each equipment for each equipment we should always examine the impact of an investment in cbm by identifying the benefits and costs as it is not always effective in all cases depending on the equipment type its lifecycle life time maintenance cost the degree of severity in case of failure and other such factors the economic benefits will differ thus a suitable maintenance method for each equipment should be selected based on an evaluation which takes into consideration such factors as the importance of the equipment its deterioration and failure characteristics failure cost online offline inspection methods and optimal inspection cycle second there are several discussion points in the data for cbm first there is a data resolution issue depending on the resolution of the data collection the cost and accuracy of cbm approach could vary thus we should consider the scale of gathered sensor data in cbm sensor measurements could be taken at regular intervals or even continuously in a real time manner if we monitor and gather the equipment status data in real time it must be best for analyzing the equipment condition in a precise manner however this approach requires a heavy burden of data gathering which increases the cost from a practical viewpoint it is not cost effective to gather the data pertaining to all equipment status continuously and in real time for example depending on the case we may need high resolution e g every 0 1 or 0 01 s shaft or bearing vibration signal data generated by machines rotating at a high speed however for the temperature or pressure data on the vessels we may need low resolution e g every five minutes every one hour data hence it is necessary to decide upon the most suitable time period for data gathering considering the scale of the gathered data another discussion point concerns the data needed for diagnostics and prognostics algorithms the core task of the cbm is to diagnose the current state of equipment based on the collected data and to predict rul in the future the accuracy of these algorithms is mostly affected by the amount and quality of the gathered data when implementing cbm if there are much amount of failure history data along with sensor data there is no problem in developing the cbm algorithms the problem is applying cbm in situations with very little or no data available this is typical for newly commissioned systems where no observed failure data or maintenance information exist si et al 2011 in such a case as noted by si et al 2011 the quantity and completeness of the data are insufficient to fit the full statistical models or machine learning based algorithms if there is not enough data during the initial stage of the operation of the equipment diagnosing and predicting the equipment state reasonably become problematic to resolve this problem one possible solution is to develop physics based models for diagnostics and prognostics with the help of subjective expert knowledge from design and manufacturing or to use the reliability information provided by the equipment manufacturer in this study for the prognostics of the initial stage of the gas compressor equipment we developed the reliability based approach except for reliability based approach diagnostics and other prognostics algorithms are data driven approaches because such approaches are very useful for complex systems where the knowledge of the underlying physics is absent and the health of the system is to be assessed however a critical disadvantage of the data driven approach is that it does not work well without enough data for such cases there have been no tangible solutions thus far however if machine learning techniques e g in our case a diagnostic algorithm and the bayesian network based algorithm in prognostics are used for diagnostics or prognostics in the beginning of equipment operation an unsupervised learning approach may be better to build up reference data with which to identify normal and abnormal states to this end we also need precise definitions of faults or failures i e we must know what the healthy condition of the observed system is subsequently with collected reference data supervised learning and reinforcement learning approach can be applied to make the cbm algorithms more accurate on the other hand we must be careful about what types of data should be collected during the usage period of the equipment and must carefully decide how to collect the data and use it in the diagnostics and prognostics algorithms furthermore recently as various business models that provide cbm as a service have become increasingly practical issues of ownership of the data collected and security issues are newly emerging thus if the information generated through the cbm is of high importance it is important to clarify the criteria related to data ownership and security issues through consultations at the beginning of cbm operation third cbm must be examined and approached from a holistic viewpoint for the entire system beyond simply applying cbm to specific equipment thus far most previous studies on cbm have focused on relatively well known single equipment therefore as noted in a study by koochaki et al 2012 the effect of cbm was not clear for the whole offshore plant composed of multi component systems however owing to the increasing complexity of offshore plants due to automation and the use of unmanned systems it is necessary to consider the application of cbm to more complicated upper systems rather than to single equipment this study introduced the case study of cbm implementation for only single equipment of an lng fpso i e for a gas compressor although not only gas compressors but also pump towers and mooring line equipment were considered as case study equipment in our project they were omitted in this study for convenience in spite of this fact this study is limited in that the cbm method with an integrated view of all equipment of an lng fpso was not addressed fourth because the equipment of an lng fpso is different in terms of service life it is essential that the learning based failure knowledge acquisition technology should be secured based on the collection and integration of information for diagnostics prognostics and maintenance in particular due to the diversity of ship owners and operators the type and operating environment of lng fpso s facilities and equipment are diverse thus it is impossible to fix the failure data for maintenance as the result the following procedure is required to build the learning based failure knowledge 1 obtain normal type data by collecting and learning steady state data during lng fpso operation 2 accumulate the fault state data based on normal type data and reliability data of similar equipment and 3 based on the acquired failure data the reliability of cbm system could be improved automatically by applying the learning based algorithm to diagnostics and prognostics algorithms lastly there is an issue on how we validate the proposed architecture first of all to validate the proposed architecture we have developed an experimental proof of concept system the developed system provides part of functionality hence it is currently being used for validating the efficiency of the proposed approach and architecture to verify and validate the developed system based on the proposed architecture the system has been certified from a korean software certification authority after being tested for sw functionality reliability efficiency usability maintainability portability performance interoperability and suitability based on the relevant international standards iso iec 9126 25041 25051 5 conclusion in this study we introduced a cbm system for an lng fpso we addressed the system architecture and main components as features differentiating the proposed system from other types of system architecture for cbm the configuration management and cbm platform which acts as a traffic signal between cbm functions were newly proposed furthermore we briefly introduced diagnostics and prognostics methods mostly data driven approaches pertaining to identifying or detecting abnormal situations and failure modes as well as predicting rul values based on the gathered sensor data in addition we discussed several issues related to cbm implementation which can serve as insightful references when implementing a cbm system the developed cbms for an lng fpso could analyze the data obtained through various sensors to identify abnormalities of equipment to diagnose fault conditions to predict the deteriorated states of equipment and to provide timely maintenance support the proposed cbms could also provide diagnostics and prognostics functions which are not performed in the cmms such that the lng fpso operator can make the best decisions related to maintenance activities to ensure a better operating environment of an lng fpso although this study does not contain every detail of the development of the cbm system for an lng fpso it could be the cornerstone of cbm research acknowledgments this research was financially supported by korea evaluation institute of industrial

23211,for oscillators with curved contours variation of cylinder amplitude with reynolds number or reduced speed is adequate to accurately identify the extent of resonance branches and critical points marking the transition from one branch to another however in presence of straight edges in body contour the response curve at certain locations of transition exhibits smooth variation the same is seen with smooth contoured oscillators of low mass ratio i e value of mass ratio being close to unity the frequency curves in contrast reflect all the transitions that are not captured in the response variation a simple method is proposed to accurately predict the branching and associated transition points with the aid of oscillation and shedding frequency curves it is noted that the frequency profile undergoes a change of slope at the location of a transition using the proposed method branching is analyzed for elliptic square and truncated circular cylinders of mass ratio 10 each of them executing undamped vortex induced vibrations viv at low reynolds numbers 60 150 simultaneously along and across the flow illustrations are extended for a square cylinder of mass ratio 1 too for the first time viv results are presented for a truncated circular cylinder keywords stabilized finite element vortex induced vibrations branching of response frequency truncated circular cylinder 1 introduction the free or vortex induced vibration of a rigid body in a moving viscous fluid is a type of fluid structure interaction where the solid and fluid media mutually influence the motions of each other the viv is influenced by several dimensionless parameters such as mass ratio m of the oscillator damping coefficient Œ∂ reduced natural frequency f n or reduced speed u force coefficients and reynolds number r e in addition to the oscillator cross section these quantities are defined in sub section 2 2 the feedback between the solid and fluid media is maintained via the fluid forces and no slip condition both at the fluid solid interface owing to the large share of circular geometry in real life applications the circular cylinder has remained the most studied oscillator shape for viv studies khalak and williamson 1996 conducted a series of experiments on transverse only viv of a circular cylinder and introduced the concept of branching of cylinder response from the response curve and also the frequency curve they identified the existence of initial excitation branch upper branch lower branch and desynchronization both experimental brika and laneville 1993 jauvtis and williamson 2004 and numerical prasanth and mittal 2008 investigations at low r e established that the solutions corresponded only to the initial excitation branch lower branch and desynchronization same branching pattern holds for elliptic and square cylinders as well the earlier studies concerning viv of elliptic and square cylinders are presented separately in the following two paragraphs to the best of our knowledge the earliest reported work concerning viv of a rigid elliptic section cylinder is due to franzini et al 2009 for 2000 r e 8000 they experimentally investigated the transverse only vibrations of vertical elliptic and inclined circular cylinders of m 2 5 the axis of the elliptic cylinder is vertical and perpendicular to the free stream for the inclined circular cylinder the axis is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the free stream but resides in a vertical plane parallel to the free stream for the elliptic cylinder franzini et al 2009 identified three distinct branches of response as function of the reduced speed in the first branch the oscillator executes no or extremely low amplitude oscillations the magnitude of normalized response i e maximum displacement of the oscillator normalized by its diameter in the second branch ranges between 0 4 and 0 57 in the third branch the normalized response drops sharply and maintains a nearly constant value of 0 12 for the regime in which the vortex shedding is known to be laminar r e 60 140 navrose et al 2014 presented in depth analysis of branching behaviour for undamped viv of symmetric elliptic cylinders of fixed mass ratio 10 the cylinder aspect ratio a r ranged from 0 7 to 1 43 aspect ratio of an ellipse is the ratio of the length of its cross stream projection to the length of its streamwise projection sourav and sen 2017 overall they identified seven different regimes namely steady state ss desynchronization i dsi initial branch ib with quasi periodicity periodic initial branch lower branch lb with periodicity quasi periodic lower branch and desynchronization ii dsii as the r e was progressively raised from 60 to 140 for elliptic cylinders of various thicknesses a r 0 5 1 2 and orientations incidence angles of 0 45 and 90 to the free stream hasheminejad and jarrahi 2015 performed extensive numerical experiments for 60 r e 400 undamped two degrees of freedom 2 dof viv of m 10 cylinders was considered with focus on response characteristics sourav and sen 2017 recently studied the undamped for transverse only and 2 dof and damped for transverse only viv of a thick elliptic cylinder a r 1 11 of m 1 they discussed the branching with the aid of frequency characteristics for cylinders with curved contours this study possibly for the first time reports response results devoid of secondary hysteresis for a reynolds number range of 2000 8000 amandolese and hemon 2010 conducted aeroelastic experiments on transverse only viv of a rigid square cylinder of m 905 and low structural damping and resolved the initial and lower branches of response for undamped condition 2 dof transverse and in line free hydroelastic vibrations of a rigid square cylinder of m 10 was numerically studied by sen and mittal 2011 for r e 60 250 they found that cylinder response is composed of initial lower and secondary lower or galloping branches and desynchronization regime the transverse only and 2 dof oscillations of an isolated square cylinder was subsequently studied by he et al 2012 through numerical experiments they also resolved the galloping branch of response zhao et al 2013 employed finite element method and presented detailed results at r e 100 for freely vibrating 2 dof inclined at 0 22 5 and 45 square cylinders of m 3 a key observation from their study was that the 0 configuration resulted in lowest value of transverse response and range of synchronization lock in jaiman et al 2015 established that branching of a square cylinder can be significantly altered by rounding its corners the smoothening eliminates the galloping component of response as an extension of their previous work on free vibrations of a square cylinder sen and mittal 2011 without consideration of structural damping sen and mittal 2015 2016 demonstrated that the branching behaviour is a function of oscillator mass ratio for low mass ratio i e m 1 they showed that response is free of the galloping branch for oscillators with smooth contours such as circular and elliptic cylinders the branching behaviour becomes obvious from the response curve alone for such geometries sharp rise or fall of response at the concerned points aids in quick identification of the resonance branches however instances arise where the transition is not much obvious in the response variation this happens even for the elliptic or circular cylinders of low mass ratio for viv of a square cylinder the segments of response prior to and next to lock in are smooth curves fig 13 leading to determination of the exact value of a transition point such as lower branch dsii from response quite difficult the objective of the present work is to establish a simple and reliable method to quickly and accurately predict the transitions for an oscillator of arbitrary shape irrespective of oscillator cross section it is found that the frequency curve displays prominent slope change at the junction of two branches it is also shown that minute details of sub branches such as periodic and quasi periodic components can be accurately obtained by plotting the oscillation and shedding frequency curves together in this paper the proposed method has been employed for a square cylinder and elliptic cylinders of a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 each of them having m 10 to further ascertain its applicability a square cylinder of m 1 as well as a hybrid oscillator shape comprising of both smooth contours and straight edge i e a truncated circular cylinder of m 10 have been considered and branching identified the remaining of this article is organized as follows section 2 presents the governing differential equations for fluid and solid media brief information on stabilized space time finite element formulation is provided in section 3 section 4 addresses the numerical model of the problem considered besides convergence of computed results the results are presented and discussed in section 5 finally in section 6 few concluding remarks are made 2 the governing equations 2 1 the incompressible flow equations let œâ t represents a time varying spatial domain where t stands for

dirichlet and natural neumann type boundary conditions are considered at the boundaries of the computational domain see fig 2a at the inlet of the domain free stream condition on velocity is specified this corresponds to the essential or dirichlet boundary condition at the exit of the domain a zero streamwise gradient of each velocity component is imposed this amounts to stress free or traction free condition rendering the exit boundary as a neumann boundary the velocity across the lateral boundaries is assigned a zero value dirichlet boundary condition while the component of surface traction along these boundaries disappear neumann boundary condition this set is also known as the slip boundary condition at the cylinder surface or no slip fluid structure interface the velocity is specified thus dirichlet condition on velocity applies here a divergence free initial velocity u 0 is specified on œâ t such that 3 u x 0 u 0 on œâ 0 2 2 the equations of rigid body motion the two

temporal scale is normalized by free stream speed u and d the normalized in line displacement x cross stream displacement y and time t t are expressed as x d y d t u d and t u d respectively let f n represents the dimensional natural structural frequency of the oscillator and f n f n d u denotes the normalized f n the reciprocal of reduced normalized natural frequency f n is known as reduced

proposed by tezduyar et al 1992a b c is used in the present study this formulation employs equal order of bilinear interpolation for velocity and pressure thus the primitive variables are arranged in a collocated manner the interpolation functions are bilinear in space and linear in time 4 problem description and convergence 4 1 problem set up the problem statement is very similar for each cross section the mass ratio of each oscillator equals 10 fig 2 a depicts the problem set up for a truncated circular cylinder executing free undamped translations along and across the flow the x y coordinate system is stationary the width of the computational domain is 20d relative to the origin of the coordinate system the upstream and downstream boundaries are located at distances of 12 d and 30 d respectively the boundary conditions employed are free stream inlet slip sidewalls stress free exit and no slip fluid solid interface each condition is shown in fig 2a the no slip condition on velocity at the cylinder surface is time dependent the boundary conditions are already explained in section 2 1 a multi block structured mesh composed of bilinear quadrilateral elements is used for domain discretization the mesh contains 8496 nodes and 8724 bilinear quadrilateral elements the mesh is adaptive in nature it needs reconstruction at each time step such that the outer domain boundary and coordinate system remain fixed with respect to time fig 2b shows part of the deformed mesh along with the cylinder 4 2 mesh sensitivity test for truncated circular cylinder table 1 summarizes the results of mesh sensitivity test conducted at r e 100 on meshes m1 and m2 the resolution of m2 is more than twice the resolution of m1 except for the root mean square or r m s drag close values of flow and viv characteristics from m1 and m2 establish the adequacy of m1 as the optimum mesh to provide mesh independent solutions a normalized time step size t u d of 0 02 has been used for the

results frequency characteristics of undamped viv of five different cross sections having curved surfaces straight edges and their combination are examined over r e 60 150 to predict the response branching these are elliptic cylinders of a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 a square cylinder and a truncated circular cylinder the computations have been performed mostly for integer values of r e 5 1 prediction of branching from oscillation frequency the branching of cylinder response were earlier predicted from frequency ratio f u and y m a x u curves khalak and williamson 1999 for a circular cylinder or from y m a x r e variation navrose et al 2014 for elliptic cylinders f is the ratio of transverse oscillation to natural frequency for circular elliptic cylinders a sharp fall of response at the end of lock in or end of quasi periodic lower branch precisely denotes the beginning of dsii however for square and truncated circular cylinders the lower branch is fully periodic and determination of the demarcating boundary between the lower branch and dsii appears difficult from the response curve as apparent from the combined y m a x r e profiles shown in fig 13 it is instead found that the variation of transverse oscillation frequency see fig 3 for instance precisely predicts every transition we infer that in general f o s c obtained via fast fourier transform or fft of y is a better parameter than y itself to predict the characteristics of branching the fact that transition from one branch to another is reflected by change of slope of the frequency curve is used in the present paper to identify the branching of cylinder response analysis of transverse oscillation frequency f o s c curves near the dsi lower branch transition without with initial branch reveals that two families of curves are possible in this regime in the first case seen for the square cylinder the dsi lower branch transition is accomplished via a single jump and the initial branch does not exist the second type where initial branch exists is seen for elliptic cylinders and a truncated circular cylinder where the dsi lower branch transition takes place via a pair of jumps identification of response branches via analysis of slope changes in f o s c is illustrated in fig 3 the dsi is represented by the initial line segment of the frequency curve the first slope change marks the onset of lower for a square cylinder or initial for elliptic and truncated circular cylinders branch for a square cylinder figs 3a and 10 the initial branch is absent and significant jump discontinuity is noted next to dsi that marks the onset of synchronization as well as dsi lower branch transition the initial branch of an elliptic cylinder on the other hand figs 3b and 9 is wide and involves an appreciable jump discontinuity this discontinuity suggests onset of lock in as well as initial branch the subsequent jump in f o s c associated with change of slope signifies the transition from initial to lower branch the lower branch continues until the oscillation frequency decays to its minimum value the final slope change or lower branch dsii transition occurs at this point the dsii sets in next to the minimum f o s c point the beginning of dsii may involve a change in slope square cylinder or jump discontinuity elliptic cylinder in the foregoing sub sections we present the lock in and response characteristics of a truncated circular cylinder that appear to be unexplored in low r e regime identification of transition points for elliptic and square cylinders follows thereafter 5 2 truncated circular cylinder 5 2 1 the synchronization for a bluff obstacle in free stream the value of stationary vortex shedding frequency remains close to 0 2 over a wide range of reynolds number several earlier studies williamson and roshko 1988 have demonstrated that the fundamental synchronization corresponds to that r e or u at which the vortex shedding frequency as well as oscillation frequency approach the stationary shedding frequency of magnitude 0 2 the classical definition of resonance due to williamson and govardhan 2004 imposes additional constraint on closeness of natural frequency to both the oscillation and shedding frequencies a total of three slope changes or transitions can be traced from fig 4 showing the relationship between f o s c s t and r e for a freely vibrating circular cylinder truncated at the rear end here s t is the non dimensional vortex shedding frequency of the vibrating cylinder the initial slope change occurs at r e 77 the dsi thus continues up to this r e a jump discontinuity is noted at r e 78 that underlines that both lock in and initial branch have started the value of f o s c at this r e is of the order of 0 2 and as apparent from the figure the lock in is soft where the oscillation shedding frequency departs from their natural counterpart the inset i of fig 4 shows in enlarged view the variation of f o s c and s t with r e over 70 r e 80 the subsequent change of slope is found at the initial branch displaying soft lock in therefore stretches from r e 78 to 84 the second discontinuous jump at r e 85 signifies the beginning of lower branch the final slope change seen at r e 110 is indicative of the upper extremity of lower branch this terminal point also corresponds to the least value of the oscillation frequency the dsii regime extends from r e 111 to 150 it may be noted from fig 4 that the oscillation or shedding frequency departs appreciably from the natural frequency both in dsi and dsii it also appears that the f o s c segments in these regimes could be joined by a smooth continuous curve in absence of viv the f o s c or s t registers a slow monotonic rise with r e as noted for the stationary shedding frequency the flow in regimes dsi and dsii is therefore expected to display close resemblance with those obtained from a stationary cylinder as expected the normalized oscillation frequency or frequency ratio f also precisely reflects the branching via slope changes inset ii of fig 4 for viv at low r e the body motion is either periodic with single frequency alternately fluid forces are periodic with multiple frequencies or quasi periodic where multiple frequencies co exist for periodic oscillation with single frequency the peak of f o s c and dominant peak of s t essentially collapse or match quasi periodicity can be of further two types respective peaks of f o s c and s t either collapse or diverge differ for quasi periodic flow the peaks of f o s c and s t generally collapse in the initial branch while in part of initial branch and lower branch they diverge the initial branch may comprise of periodic and quasi periodic regimes navrose et al 2014 using the normalized frequency reynolds number plot one therefore cannot conclusively decide whether a point within r e 79 84 in the initial branch and satisfying f o s c s t belongs to periodic or quasi periodic regime the time series of response or fluid forces aids in the identification for the truncated circular cylinder it is obvious from fig 4 that the onset of lock in is quasi periodic fig 5 illustrates the time trace of y at the onset of lock in the time trace is characterized by the presence of beating that is indicative of low amplitude response with multiple frequencies willden and graham 2006 the spectral content of each of y and c l shown in fig 8b and c respectively is composed of both f o s c and s t table 2 lists the values of frequency and associated power p at r e 78 in addition to the wave form of the y signal incommensurable values of f o s c and s t establish that the onset of lock in at r e 78 is quasi periodic to test that this quasi periodicity is indeed an intrinsic property of flow viv computations were performed at r e 78 on mesh m1 using a smaller normalized time step size of 0 01 as a further check computations were repeated on a much finer mesh m2 using t u d 0 01 and 0 02 the values of s t and f o s c obtained from the fft of y for the three cases along with the reference case first row are summarized in table 3 the frequency values for the four sets of mesh t u d data are very similar but incommensurable thus quasi periodicity is inherent at the onset of lock in of a truncated circular cylinder the initial branch is mostly quasi periodic with the dominant frequencies of y and c l converging in the lower branch and also in dsii the body motion is periodic with single frequency salient transition points and ranges are listed in table 4 changes of slope of the f o s c r e profile occur at r e 77 84 and 110 respectively therefore transition from dsi to ib occurs at r e 78 similarly the ib lb transition and lb dsii transition occur at r e 85 and 111 respectively immediately previous or next r e values of the transition r e have been considered to analyze the time series of y for dsi ib transition the first row fig 6 a and b shows the time series at r e 77 and 79 respectively at r e 77 the oscillations are periodic with single frequency while at r e 79 the oscillations turn quasi periodic the lower branch and dsii are periodic with single frequency the time histories at r e 84 figs 6c and 86 fig 6d bracketing the ib lb transition corroborate this same holds true for the lb dsii transition shown in fig 6e and f for r e 110 and 112 respectively 5 2 2 response a truncation of the circular cylinder in the base region shortens its afterbody this has a strong bearing on the wake flow surface pressure distribution and fluid forces consequently the response is altered significantly the corresponding y m a x r e profile is presented in fig 7 a the effect of shape modification is insignificant in the initial branch but remarkable in the lower branch to illustrate the influence of truncation maximum response of the circular and truncated circular cylinders of m 10 are compared the comparison is shown in fig 7b for the circular cylinder the initial branch stretches from r e 80 to r e 82 in contrast for the truncated circular cylinder the r e range of initial branch is 78 84 a little higher these are highlighted in the figure the extent of lower branch for the circular cylinder is from r e 83 to r e 134 for the truncated circular cylinder the lower branch stretches over the r e range of 85 110 in the lower branch the response of the two sets of cylinders therefore differs drastically thus compared to the lower branch effect of shape modification in the initial branch is insignificant the truncation alters the lower branch to fully periodic and the lower branch dsii transition is smooth as opposed to the abrupt transition for a circular cylinder see fig 7b or fig 13 also the response decays sharply along the lower branch while the magnitude of maximum transverse response 0 56 d is identical to that 0 5598 d of the circular cylinder the extent of lower branch or lock in is significantly narrower than the circular cylinder the quasi periodicity and periodicity in the initial branch are demonstrated via the phase plots and power spectra at r e 78 fig 8 a through 8c and 83 fig 8d through 8f respectively 5 3 elliptic cylinders undamped viv of thick elliptic cylinders a r 1 of a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 at low r e and placed symmetrically relative to the free stream were earlier explored by sen 2010 and navrose et al 2014 for a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 fig 9 a b and 9c respectively plot the variation of oscillation and shedding frequencies as functions of r e and u it may be noted that the extent of dsi shrinks with increasing a r this alternately suggests that as the cylinder turns more bluff the occurrence of lock in and initial branch shifts towards lower r e for a r 0 9 the initial branch comprises of a single point and this branch spans a wider range of r e as a r increases for each cross section beginning of lower branch is bit delayed relative to the onset of lock in the maximum f o s c 0 2 may represent the onset of lock in for a r 10 9 or onset of lower branch for a r 0 9 and 1 for each a r considered the onset of lock in is quasi periodic fig 9d illustrates this for a r 0 9 the power spectra of y and c l are shown in fig 9d iii and 9d iv respectively for r e 82 located in the initial branch each spectrum contains three peaks the f o s c values 0 1894 0 1720 and 0 1546 corresponding to the peaks in the power spectrum of y are identical to those obtained from c l similar to the truncated circular cylinder quasi periodic points exist in the initial branch of elliptic cylinder with dominant oscillating and shedding frequencies collapsing irrespective of a r the viv is quasi periodic towards the closure of lower branch the end of lock in is associated with the least s t for periodic motion and the least f o s c for quasi periodic motion it appears that identification of the transition from periodic to quasi periodic lower branch is not possible from f o s c r e variation alone in the quasi periodic lower branch stretching over r e 123 128 the cylinder oscillates with multiple frequencies including f o s c and s t such that f o s c s t at a representative r e value of 125 in the quasi periodic lower branch f o s c 0 1388 and s t 0 1776 along the lower branch of a r 0 9 cylinder s t becomes minimum at r e 122 this is the terminal point of periodic lower branch the initiation of quasi periodic lower branch at r e 123 is associated with a jump discontinuity in s t and a change of slope of the s t r e profile a further change of slope of s t occurs at r e 129 the regime of second decoherence or dsii starts at this r e post periodic lower branch the s t r e profile therefore comprises of a pair of straight lines for quasi periodic lower branch and dsii respectively of different slopes the first one of this pair indicates soft lock in for the circular cylinder the lower branch is periodic on a range that includes integer values of r e between 83 and 131 inclusive and is quasi periodic at r e 132 133 and 134 thus for a circular cylinder the extent of the periodic part of the lower branch considerably exceeds the extent of its quasi periodic extension the dsii regime initiates at r e 135 for ar 10 9 the only integer value of r e at which quasi periodic response is found on the lower branch is 132 this is the only point experiencing soft lock in and it also denotes the termination of lock in the quasi periodic lower branch weakens with increasing a r salient points relating to lock in boundaries of elliptic cylinders are listed in table 5 from here it follows that the onset of lower branch in thick elliptic cylinders is insensitive to a r 5 4 square cylinder the frequency curve shown in fig 10 a is reproduced from sen and mittal 2011 for r e 150 a total of two changes in slope of the s t r e profile are observed the first one at r e 86 and the final one at r e 100 these r e values respectively denote the end of dsi and lower branch as discussed in section 5 1 the initial branch is absent and onset of lock in involves the dsi lower branch transition such transition does not exist for the truncated circular cylinder and elliptic cylinders of a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 unlike the elliptic and truncated circular cylinders the initiation of lock in and lower branch is synonymous for the square cylinder for m 10 sen and mittal 2011 reported that it happens at r e 87 this r e value immediately follows the first change of slope it may be noted that s t attains its peak at the onset of lock in the corresponding f o s c 0 1609 is however quite smaller than 0 2 sen and mittal 2011 documented that lock in stretches up to r e 100 since viv of the square cylinder is fully periodic with single frequency sen and mittal 2016 s t f o s c throughout and each of these quantities reduces to minimum value of s t at the upper boundary of lock in lower branch the inset of the s t r e plot confirms that the lower branch ends at r e 100 where minimum s t 0 1492 the dsii follows r e 101 onwards where s t rises slowly for r e 80 90 sen and mittal 2011 used an r e increment of unity as apparent from fig 10a one might expect the existence of a transition over r e 85 86 to test if such a transition exists we have resolved the normalized frequency curve of the square section cylinder over r e 83 87 an increment r e of 0 1 in reynolds number has been used for the computations the curve obtained via such fine increment is plotted in fig 10b the frequency variation reveals a continuous change of slope over r e 83 86 this is obvious from the close up shown in fig 10c this underscores the absence of a transition in this interval of reynolds number the regime of dsi therefore extends up to r e 86 and it is at this particular r e the first change of slope of the frequecny curve is found to occur this marks direct transition of dsi to lower branch of response fig 10b indicates that the lower branch initiates at r e 86 1 using a coraser increment in r e sen and mittal 2011 found this r e value to be 87 computations with fine increment in r e reveals a very interesting phenomenon concerning viv of a square cylinder i e absence of the initial branch listed in table 6 are the values of transition reynolds numbers and corresponding frequencies 5 5 illustration for low mass ratio identification of the branching turns difficult for low m viv even with the cylinders having smooth contours for instance the initial lower branch transition from response curve is not very obvious for freely vibrating elliptic cylinders of m 1 this was first explored by sourav and sen 2017 recently they found that the transition occurs at an r e where there exists a trend change of the frequency profile this trend change corresponds to the f o s c attaining its peak value this observation is employed here to predict the branching behaviour of a freely vibrating square cylinder of m 1 previously investigated by sen and mittal 2015 in fig 3a of sen and mittal 2015 the dsii was marked incorrectly as lower branch and initial branch was labelled as part of lower branch figs 6a and 3a of sen and mittal 2015 are combined and reproduced here as fig 11 the dsi regime continues up to r e 53 followed by a change of slope and also the first jump at r e 54 fig 11a this marks the initiation of lock in and initial branch the oscillation frequency attains its highest value at r e 66 signifying the transition from initial to lower branch the lower branch continues till r e 80 where s t or f o s c is minimum the dsii continues thereafter a very contrasting observation from this low m case is that the maximum transverse response occurs within the initial branch instead of the lower branch fig 11b shows this besides labelling the regimes of response 5 6 branching of in line response very recently sourav and sen 2017 in conjunction with their study of viv of elliptic cylinders of low m suggested that unlike y m a x for transverse response x m a x for in line response is not a suitable indicator of streamwise response since the mean of the driving drag force is non zero and positive the time mean x is also non zero and positive the inadequacy of x m a x to represent the streamwise response is an outcome of varying mean x from the fixed reference point i e origin of the coordinate system on the other hand the value of x r m s is independent of the measurement reference therefore x r m s is a more suitable quantity to demonstrate the features of in line translations for each cylinder shape fig 12 plots x r m s with r e each response branch that is identified from y response is also resolved in the x r m s r e variation for the elliptic cylinders fig 12a b and 12c for a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 respectively the branching of response is very much prominent however for the square fig 12d and truncated circular cylinders fig 12e identification of lb dsii transition appears difficult from the x r m s curve analysis of f o s c r e curve provides the precise location of such transition points 5 7 comparison of transverse response characteristics a comparative analysis of transverse response characteristics of oscillators of various shapes but identical mass ratio 10 can be made from fig 13 the response from each oscillator is roughly of comparable and insignificant magnitude in the desynchronization regimes the vibrations are strong for oscillators with curved contours as the cylinder contour reduces to fully straight edged with sharp corners square cylinder the amplitude of cylinder response falls drastically and shrinking of the range of lock in becomes overwhelming over the range of r e considered the square cylinder therefore appears the most stable shape against two degrees of freedom viv the quasi periodicity is generally captured post lock in in the initial branch and close to the end of lock in or lower branch the hump next to dsi in y m a x r e curve denotes quasi periodic regime seen for elliptic and truncated circular cylinders and same is indicated by the horn seen for the elliptic cylinders close to the lock in boundary the initial branch contains both periodic and quasi periodic components if the transition involves a pair of jumps as seen with the truncated circular and elliptic cylinders 5 8 possible applicability to high r e viv the proposed methodology demonstrates its capability to predict the response branches and associated transitions for response curves that are based on computations of viv at low r e based on our study on several geometric configurations it is found that transitions are essentially reflected via changes of slope of the transverse oscillation frequency and sometimes not by certain parts of the response curves irrespective of r e the primary criterion for identification of response branches is therefore the existence of slope change in the oscillation frequency curve response solutions at higher r e are expected to be associated with the appearance of newer branches the pioneering experimental studies by khalak and williamson 1996 1999 concerning transverse only viv of a rigid circular cylinder introduced the concept of response branching and for the first time identified the existence of a high amplitude upper branch in addition to the initial and lower branches fig 1 of khalak and williamson 1996 for m 2 4 Œ∂ 0 0045 and r e 6000 shows the branching pattern followed by the variation of frequency ratio f in this figure slope changes of f at the locations of transition are very prominent using the same experimental set up khalak and williamson 1999 conducted extensive investigations on transverse only viv of the circular cylinder over r e 5000 16000 figure 18 of khalak and williamson 1999 shows for m 3 3 and Œ∂ 0 0026 the variation of f with reduced speed the branching is also shown in the figure and change of slope of f at the transitions is also very clear therefore the condition of identification of the transition appears independent of r e in light of the response and frequency ratio plots reported by khalak and williamson 1996 1999 at high r e it appears that the proposed method may be effective for viv even at higher r e 6 conclusions stabilized space time finite element computations are performed in two dimensions to accurately predict the branching of response for arbitrary shaped oscillators elliptic square and truncated circular cylinders each of mass ratio 10 and executing two degrees of freedom free undamped vibrations are considered it is demonstrated that the branching of cylinder response is best explained using the oscillation frequency with the aid of vortex shedding frequency each transition is predicted by a change of slope of the frequency curve irrespective of oscillator cross section the minimum value of s t signifies closure of periodic lower branch and the minimum f o s c point denotes end of quasi periodic lower branch the maximum value of f o s c may correspond to onset of lock in for square cylinder truncated circular cylinder and a r 10 9 elliptic cylinder or onset of lower branch for a r 0 9 and 1 for elliptic cylinders quasi periodicity in the initial and lower branches is qualitatively different in the initial branch the frequency peaks of response and vortex shedding may or may not collapse but they definitely diverge in the lower branch therefore oscillation and shedding frequencies together can predict the transition from periodic to quasi periodic lower branch but in some cases are unable to locate the transition from quasi periodic to periodic initial branch viv results of a truncated circular cylinder at low r e are presented for the first time no noteworthy effect of base truncation is apparent on the initial branch however the truncation eliminates the quasi periodic lower branch besides shortening the extent of lock in and lowering the cylinder displacement analysis of response of m 1 square cylinder reveals that the maximum transverse response occurs in the initial branch and not in the lower branch this is a contrasting feature relative to the general trend the response of oscillators with curved surfaces overwhelmingly exceeds those with combined curved and straight surfaces or straight edges alone owing to the least response and narrowest synchronization regime the square cross section is the most stable shape against viv at low r e 
23211,for oscillators with curved contours variation of cylinder amplitude with reynolds number or reduced speed is adequate to accurately identify the extent of resonance branches and critical points marking the transition from one branch to another however in presence of straight edges in body contour the response curve at certain locations of transition exhibits smooth variation the same is seen with smooth contoured oscillators of low mass ratio i e value of mass ratio being close to unity the frequency curves in contrast reflect all the transitions that are not captured in the response variation a simple method is proposed to accurately predict the branching and associated transition points with the aid of oscillation and shedding frequency curves it is noted that the frequency profile undergoes a change of slope at the location of a transition using the proposed method branching is analyzed for elliptic square and truncated circular cylinders of mass ratio 10 each of them executing undamped vortex induced vibrations viv at low reynolds numbers 60 150 simultaneously along and across the flow illustrations are extended for a square cylinder of mass ratio 1 too for the first time viv results are presented for a truncated circular cylinder keywords stabilized finite element vortex induced vibrations branching of response frequency truncated circular cylinder 1 introduction the free or vortex induced vibration of a rigid body in a moving viscous fluid is a type of fluid structure interaction where the solid and fluid media mutually influence the motions of each other the viv is influenced by several dimensionless parameters such as mass ratio m of the oscillator damping coefficient Œ∂ reduced natural frequency f n or reduced speed u force coefficients and reynolds number r e in addition to the oscillator cross section these quantities are defined in sub section 2 2 the feedback between the solid and fluid media is maintained via the fluid forces and no slip condition both at the fluid solid interface owing to the large share of circular geometry in real life applications the circular cylinder has remained the most studied oscillator shape for viv studies khalak and williamson 1996 conducted a series of experiments on transverse only viv of a circular cylinder and introduced the concept of branching of cylinder response from the response curve and also the frequency curve they identified the existence of initial excitation branch upper branch lower branch and desynchronization both experimental brika and laneville 1993 jauvtis and williamson 2004 and numerical prasanth and mittal 2008 investigations at low r e established that the solutions corresponded only to the initial excitation branch lower branch and desynchronization same branching pattern holds for elliptic and square cylinders as well the earlier studies concerning viv of elliptic and square cylinders are presented separately in the following two paragraphs to the best of our knowledge the earliest reported work concerning viv of a rigid elliptic section cylinder is due to franzini et al 2009 for 2000 r e 8000 they experimentally investigated the transverse only vibrations of vertical elliptic and inclined circular cylinders of m 2 5 the axis of the elliptic cylinder is vertical and perpendicular to the free stream for the inclined circular cylinder the axis is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the free stream but resides in a vertical plane parallel to the free stream for the elliptic cylinder franzini et al 2009 identified three distinct branches of response as function of the reduced speed in the first branch the oscillator executes no or extremely low amplitude oscillations the magnitude of normalized response i e maximum displacement of the oscillator normalized by its diameter in the second branch ranges between 0 4 and 0 57 in the third branch the normalized response drops sharply and maintains a nearly constant value of 0 12 for the regime in which the vortex shedding is known to be laminar r e 60 140 navrose et al 2014 presented in depth analysis of branching behaviour for undamped viv of symmetric elliptic cylinders of fixed mass ratio 10 the cylinder aspect ratio a r ranged from 0 7 to 1 43 aspect ratio of an ellipse is the ratio of the length of its cross stream projection to the length of its streamwise projection sourav and sen 2017 overall they identified seven different regimes namely steady state ss desynchronization i dsi initial branch ib with quasi periodicity periodic initial branch lower branch lb with periodicity quasi periodic lower branch and desynchronization ii dsii as the r e was progressively raised from 60 to 140 for elliptic cylinders of various thicknesses a r 0 5 1 2 and orientations incidence angles of 0 45 and 90 to the free stream hasheminejad and jarrahi 2015 performed extensive numerical experiments for 60 r e 400 undamped two degrees of freedom 2 dof viv of m 10 cylinders was considered with focus on response characteristics sourav and sen 2017 recently studied the undamped for transverse only and 2 dof and damped for transverse only viv of a thick elliptic cylinder a r 1 11 of m 1 they discussed the branching with the aid of frequency characteristics for cylinders with curved contours this study possibly for the first time reports response results devoid of secondary hysteresis for a reynolds number range of 2000 8000 amandolese and hemon 2010 conducted aeroelastic experiments on transverse only viv of a rigid square cylinder of m 905 and low structural damping and resolved the initial and lower branches of response for undamped condition 2 dof transverse and in line free hydroelastic vibrations of a rigid square cylinder of m 10 was numerically studied by sen and mittal 2011 for r e 60 250 they found that cylinder response is composed of initial lower and secondary lower or galloping branches and desynchronization regime the transverse only and 2 dof oscillations of an isolated square cylinder was subsequently studied by he et al 2012 through numerical experiments they also resolved the galloping branch of response zhao et al 2013 employed finite element method and presented detailed results at r e 100 for freely vibrating 2 dof inclined at 0 22 5 and 45 square cylinders of m 3 a key observation from their study was that the 0 configuration resulted in lowest value of transverse response and range of synchronization lock in jaiman et al 2015 established that branching of a square cylinder can be significantly altered by rounding its corners the smoothening eliminates the galloping component of response as an extension of their previous work on free vibrations of a square cylinder sen and mittal 2011 without consideration of structural damping sen and mittal 2015 2016 demonstrated that the branching behaviour is a function of oscillator mass ratio for low mass ratio i e m 1 they showed that response is free of the galloping branch for oscillators with smooth contours such as circular and elliptic cylinders the branching behaviour becomes obvious from the response curve alone for such geometries sharp rise or fall of response at the concerned points aids in quick identification of the resonance branches however instances arise where the transition is not much obvious in the response variation this happens even for the elliptic or circular cylinders of low mass ratio for viv of a square cylinder the segments of response prior to and next to lock in are smooth curves fig 13 leading to determination of the exact value of a transition point such as lower branch dsii from response quite difficult the objective of the present work is to establish a simple and reliable method to quickly and accurately predict the transitions for an oscillator of arbitrary shape irrespective of oscillator cross section it is found that the frequency curve displays prominent slope change at the junction of two branches it is also shown that minute details of sub branches such as periodic and quasi periodic components can be accurately obtained by plotting the oscillation and shedding frequency curves together in this paper the proposed method has been employed for a square cylinder and elliptic cylinders of a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 each of them having m 10 to further ascertain its applicability a square cylinder of m 1 as well as a hybrid oscillator shape comprising of both smooth contours and straight edge i e a truncated circular cylinder of m 10 have been considered and branching identified the remaining of this article is organized as follows section 2 presents the governing differential equations for fluid and solid media brief information on stabilized space time finite element formulation is provided in section 3 section 4 addresses the numerical model of the problem considered besides convergence of computed results the results are presented and discussed in section 5 finally in section 6 few concluding remarks are made 2 the governing equations 2 1 the incompressible flow equations let œâ t represents a time varying spatial domain where t stands for

dirichlet and natural neumann type boundary conditions are considered at the boundaries of the computational domain see fig 2a at the inlet of the domain free stream condition on velocity is specified this corresponds to the essential or dirichlet boundary condition at the exit of the domain a zero streamwise gradient of each velocity component is imposed this amounts to stress free or traction free condition rendering the exit boundary as a neumann boundary the velocity across the lateral boundaries is assigned a zero value dirichlet boundary condition while the component of surface traction along these boundaries disappear neumann boundary condition this set is also known as the slip boundary condition at the cylinder surface or no slip fluid structure interface the velocity is

proposed by tezduyar et al 1992a b c is used in the present study this formulation employs equal order of bilinear interpolation for velocity and pressure thus the primitive variables are arranged in a collocated manner the interpolation functions are bilinear in space and linear in time 4 problem description and convergence 4 1 problem set up the problem statement is very similar for each cross section the mass ratio of each oscillator equals 10 fig 2 a depicts the problem set up for a truncated circular cylinder executing free undamped translations along and across the flow the x y coordinate system is stationary the width of the computational domain is 20d relative to the origin of the coordinate system the upstream and downstream boundaries are located at distances of 12 d and 30 d respectively the boundary conditions employed are free stream inlet slip sidewalls stress free exit and no slip fluid solid interface each condition is shown in fig 2a the no slip condition on velocity at the cylinder surface is time dependent the boundary conditions are already explained in section 2 1 a multi block structured mesh composed of bilinear quadrilateral elements is used for domain discretization the mesh contains 8496 nodes and 8724 bilinear quadrilateral elements the mesh is adaptive in nature it needs reconstruction at each time step such that the outer domain boundary and coordinate system remain fixed with respect to time fig 2b shows part of the deformed mesh along with the cylinder 4 2 mesh sensitivity test for truncated circular cylinder table 1 summarizes the results of mesh sensitivity test conducted at r e 100 on meshes m1 and m2 the resolution of m2 is more than twice the resolution of m1 except for the root mean square or r m s drag close values of flow and viv characteristics from m1 and m2 establish the adequacy of m1 as the optimum mesh to provide mesh independent solutions a normalized time step size t u d of 0 02 has been used for the

results frequency characteristics of undamped viv of five different cross sections having curved surfaces straight edges and their combination are examined over r e 60 150 to predict the response branching these are elliptic cylinders of a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 a square cylinder and a truncated circular cylinder the computations have been performed mostly for integer values of r e 5 1 prediction of branching from oscillation frequency the branching of cylinder response were earlier predicted from frequency ratio f u and y m a x u curves khalak and williamson 1999 for a circular cylinder or from y m a x r e variation navrose et al 2014 for elliptic cylinders f is the ratio of transverse oscillation to natural frequency for circular elliptic cylinders a sharp fall of response at the end of lock in or end of quasi periodic lower branch precisely denotes the beginning of dsii however for square and truncated circular cylinders the lower branch is fully periodic and determination of the demarcating boundary between the lower branch and dsii appears difficult from the response curve as apparent from the combined y m a x r e profiles shown in fig 13 it is instead found that the variation of transverse oscillation frequency see fig 3 for instance precisely predicts every transition we infer that in general f o s c obtained via fast fourier transform or fft of y is a better parameter than y itself to predict the characteristics of branching the fact that transition from one branch to another is reflected by change of slope of the frequency curve is used in the present paper to identify the branching of cylinder response analysis of transverse oscillation frequency f o s c curves near the dsi lower branch transition without with initial branch reveals that two families of curves are possible in this regime in the first case seen for the square cylinder the dsi lower branch transition is accomplished via a single jump and the initial branch does not exist the second type where initial branch exists is seen for elliptic cylinders and a truncated circular cylinder where the dsi lower branch transition takes place via a pair of jumps identification of response branches via analysis of slope changes in f o s c is illustrated in fig 3 the dsi is represented by the initial line segment of the frequency curve the first slope change marks the onset of lower for a square cylinder or initial for elliptic and truncated circular cylinders branch for a square cylinder figs 3a and 10 the initial branch is absent and significant jump discontinuity is noted next to dsi that marks the onset of synchronization as well as dsi lower branch transition the initial branch of an elliptic cylinder on the other hand figs 3b and 9 is wide and involves an appreciable jump discontinuity this discontinuity suggests onset of lock in as well as initial branch the subsequent jump in f o s c associated with change of slope signifies the transition from initial to lower branch the lower branch continues until the oscillation frequency decays to its minimum value the final slope change or lower branch dsii transition occurs at this point the dsii sets in next to the minimum f o s c point the beginning of dsii may involve a change in slope square cylinder or jump discontinuity elliptic cylinder in the foregoing sub sections we present the lock in and response characteristics of a truncated circular cylinder that appear to be unexplored in low r e regime identification of transition points for elliptic and square cylinders follows thereafter 5 2 truncated circular cylinder 5 2 1 the synchronization for a bluff obstacle in free stream the value of stationary vortex shedding frequency remains close to 0 2 over a wide range of reynolds number several earlier studies williamson and roshko 1988 have demonstrated that the fundamental synchronization corresponds to that r e or u at which the vortex shedding frequency as well as oscillation frequency approach the stationary shedding frequency of magnitude 0 2 the classical definition of resonance due to williamson and govardhan 2004 imposes additional constraint on closeness of natural frequency to both the oscillation and shedding frequencies a total of three slope changes or transitions can be traced from fig 4 showing the relationship between f o s c s t and r e for a freely vibrating circular cylinder truncated at the rear end here s t is the non dimensional vortex shedding frequency of the vibrating cylinder the initial slope change occurs at r e 77 the dsi thus continues up to this r e a jump discontinuity is noted at r e 78 that underlines that both lock in and initial branch have started the value of f o s c at this r e is of the order of 0 2 and as apparent from the figure the lock in is soft where the oscillation shedding frequency departs from their natural counterpart the inset i of fig 4 shows in enlarged view the variation of f o s c and s t with r e over 70 r e 80 the subsequent change of slope is found at the initial branch displaying soft lock in therefore stretches from r e 78 to 84 the second discontinuous jump at r e 85 signifies the beginning of lower branch the final slope change seen at r e 110 is indicative of the upper extremity of lower branch this terminal point also corresponds to the least value of the oscillation frequency the dsii regime extends from r e 111 to 150 it may be noted from fig 4 that the oscillation or shedding frequency departs appreciably from the natural frequency both in dsi and dsii it also appears that the f o s c segments in these regimes could be joined by a smooth continuous curve in absence of viv the f o s c or s t registers a slow monotonic rise with r e as noted for the stationary shedding frequency the flow in regimes dsi and dsii is therefore expected to display close resemblance with those obtained from a stationary cylinder as expected the normalized oscillation frequency or frequency ratio f also precisely reflects the branching via slope changes inset ii of fig 4 for viv at low r e the body motion is either periodic with single frequency alternately fluid forces are periodic with multiple frequencies or quasi periodic where multiple frequencies co exist for periodic oscillation with single frequency the peak of f o s c and dominant peak of s t essentially collapse or match quasi periodicity can be of further two types respective peaks of f o s c and s t either collapse or diverge differ for quasi periodic flow the peaks of f o s c and s t generally collapse in the initial branch while in part of initial branch and lower branch they diverge the initial branch may comprise of periodic and quasi periodic regimes navrose et al 2014 using the normalized frequency reynolds number plot one therefore cannot conclusively decide whether a point within r e 79 84 in the initial branch and satisfying f o s c s t belongs to periodic or quasi periodic regime the time series of response or fluid forces aids in the identification for the truncated circular cylinder it is obvious from fig 4 that the onset of lock in is quasi periodic fig 5 illustrates the time trace of y at the onset of lock in the time trace is characterized by the presence of beating that is indicative of low amplitude response with multiple frequencies willden and graham 2006 the spectral content of each of y and c l shown in fig 8b and c respectively is composed of both f o s c and s t table 2 lists the values of frequency and associated power p at r e 78 in addition to the wave form of the y signal incommensurable values of f o s c and s t establish that the onset of lock in at r e 78 is quasi periodic to test that this quasi periodicity is indeed an intrinsic property of flow viv computations were performed at r e 78 on mesh m1 using a smaller normalized time step size of 0 01 as a further check computations were repeated on a much finer mesh m2 using t u d 0 01 and 0 02 the values of s t and f o s c obtained from the fft of y for the three cases along with the reference case first row are summarized in table 3 the frequency values for the four sets of mesh t u d data are very similar but incommensurable thus quasi periodicity is inherent at the onset of lock in of a truncated circular cylinder the initial branch is mostly quasi periodic with the dominant frequencies of y and c l converging in the lower branch and also in dsii the body motion is periodic with single frequency salient transition points and ranges are listed in table 4 changes of slope of the f o s c r e profile occur at r e 77 84 and 110 respectively therefore transition from dsi to ib occurs at r e 78 similarly the ib lb transition and lb dsii transition occur at r e 85 and 111 respectively immediately previous or next r e values of the transition r e have been considered to analyze the time series of y for dsi ib transition the first row fig 6 a and b shows the time series at r e 77 and 79 respectively at r e 77 the oscillations are periodic with single frequency while at r e 79 the oscillations turn quasi periodic the lower branch and dsii are periodic with single frequency the time histories at r e 84 figs 6c and 86 fig 6d bracketing the ib lb transition corroborate this same holds true for the lb dsii transition shown in fig 6e and f for r e 110 and 112 respectively 5 2 2 response a truncation of the circular cylinder in the base region shortens its afterbody this has a strong bearing on the wake flow surface pressure distribution and fluid forces consequently the response is altered significantly the corresponding y m a x r e profile is presented in fig 7 a the effect of shape modification is insignificant in the initial branch but remarkable in the lower branch to illustrate the influence of truncation maximum response of the circular and truncated circular cylinders of m 10 are compared the comparison is shown in fig 7b for the circular cylinder the initial branch stretches from r e 80 to r e 82 in contrast for the truncated circular cylinder the r e range of initial branch is 78 84 a little higher these are highlighted in the figure the extent of lower branch for the circular cylinder is from r e 83 to r e 134 for the truncated circular cylinder the lower branch stretches over the r e range of 85 110 in the lower branch the response of the two sets of cylinders therefore differs drastically thus compared to the lower branch effect of shape modification in the initial branch is insignificant the truncation alters the lower branch to fully periodic and the lower branch dsii transition is smooth as opposed to the abrupt transition for a circular cylinder see fig 7b or fig 13 also the response decays sharply along the lower branch while the magnitude of maximum transverse response 0 56 d is identical to that 0 5598 d of the circular cylinder the extent of lower branch or lock in is significantly narrower than the circular cylinder the quasi periodicity and periodicity in the initial branch are demonstrated via the phase plots and power spectra at r e 78 fig 8 a through 8c and 83 fig 8d through 8f respectively 5 3 elliptic cylinders undamped viv of thick elliptic cylinders a r 1 of a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 at low r e and placed symmetrically relative to the free stream were earlier explored by sen 2010 and navrose et al 2014 for a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 fig 9 a b and 9c respectively plot the variation of oscillation and shedding frequencies as functions of r e and u it may be noted that the extent of dsi shrinks with increasing a r this alternately suggests that as the cylinder turns more bluff the occurrence of lock in and initial branch shifts towards lower r e for a r 0 9 the initial branch comprises of a single point and this branch spans a wider range of r e as a r increases for each cross section beginning of lower branch is bit delayed relative to the onset of lock in the maximum f o s c 0 2 may represent the onset of lock in for a r 10 9 or onset of lower branch for a r 0 9 and 1 for each a r considered the onset of lock in is quasi periodic fig 9d illustrates this for a r 0 9 the power spectra of y and c l are shown in fig 9d iii and 9d iv respectively for r e 82 located in the initial branch each spectrum contains three peaks the f o s c values 0 1894 0 1720 and 0 1546 corresponding to the peaks in the power spectrum of y are identical to those obtained from c l similar to the truncated circular cylinder quasi periodic points exist in the initial branch of elliptic cylinder with dominant oscillating and shedding frequencies collapsing irrespective of a r the viv is quasi periodic towards the closure of lower branch the end of lock in is associated with the least s t for periodic motion and the least f o s c for quasi periodic motion it appears that identification of the transition from periodic to quasi periodic lower branch is not possible from f o s c r e variation alone in the quasi periodic lower branch stretching over r e 123 128 the cylinder oscillates with multiple frequencies including f o s c and s t such that f o s c s t at a representative r e value of 125 in the quasi periodic lower branch f o s c 0 1388 and s t 0 1776 along the lower branch of a r 0 9 cylinder s t becomes minimum at r e 122 this is the terminal point of periodic lower branch the initiation of quasi periodic lower branch at r e 123 is associated with a jump discontinuity in s t and a change of slope of the s t r e profile a further change of slope of s t occurs at r e 129 the regime of second decoherence or dsii starts at this r e post periodic lower branch the s t r e profile therefore comprises of a pair of straight lines for quasi periodic lower branch and dsii respectively of different slopes the first one of this pair indicates soft lock in for the circular cylinder the lower branch is periodic on a range that includes integer values of r e between 83 and 131 inclusive and is quasi periodic at r e 132 133 and 134 thus for a circular cylinder the extent of the periodic part of the lower branch considerably exceeds the extent of its quasi periodic extension the dsii regime initiates at r e 135 for ar 10 9 the only integer value of r e at which quasi periodic response is found on the lower branch is 132 this is the only point experiencing soft lock in and it also denotes the termination of lock in the quasi periodic lower branch weakens with increasing a r salient points relating to lock in boundaries of elliptic cylinders are listed in table 5 from here it follows that the onset of lower branch in thick elliptic cylinders is insensitive to a r 5 4 square cylinder the frequency curve shown in fig 10 a is reproduced from sen and mittal 2011 for r e 150 a total of two changes in slope of the s t r e profile are observed the first one at r e 86 and the final one at r e 100 these r e values respectively denote the end of dsi and lower branch as discussed in section 5 1 the initial branch is absent and onset of lock in involves the dsi lower branch transition such transition does not exist for the truncated circular cylinder and elliptic cylinders of a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 unlike the elliptic and truncated circular cylinders the initiation of lock in and lower branch is synonymous for the square cylinder for m 10 sen and mittal 2011 reported that it happens at r e 87 this r e value immediately follows the first change of slope it may be noted that s t attains its peak at the onset of lock in the corresponding f o s c 0 1609 is however quite smaller than 0 2 sen and mittal 2011 documented that lock in stretches up to r e 100 since viv of the square cylinder is fully periodic with single frequency sen and mittal 2016 s t f o s c throughout and each of these quantities reduces to minimum value of s t at the upper boundary of lock in lower branch the inset of the s t r e plot confirms that the lower branch ends at r e 100 where minimum s t 0 1492 the dsii follows r e 101 onwards where s t rises slowly for r e 80 90 sen and mittal 2011 used an r e increment of unity as apparent from fig 10a one might expect the existence of a transition over r e 85 86 to test if such a transition exists we have resolved the normalized frequency curve of the square section cylinder over r e 83 87 an increment r e of 0 1 in reynolds number has been used for the computations the curve obtained via such fine increment is plotted in fig 10b the frequency variation reveals a continuous change of slope over r e 83 86 this is obvious from the close up shown in fig 10c this underscores the absence of a transition in this interval of reynolds number the regime of dsi therefore extends up to r e 86 and it is at this particular r e the first change of slope of the frequecny curve is found to occur this marks direct transition of dsi to lower branch of response fig 10b indicates that the lower branch initiates at r e 86 1 using a coraser increment in r e sen and mittal 2011 found this r e value to be 87 computations with fine increment in r e reveals a very interesting phenomenon concerning viv of a square cylinder i e absence of the initial branch listed in table 6 are the values of transition reynolds numbers and corresponding frequencies 5 5 illustration for low mass ratio identification of the branching turns difficult for low m viv even with the cylinders having smooth contours for instance the initial lower branch transition from response curve is not very obvious for freely vibrating elliptic cylinders of m 1 this was first explored by sourav and sen 2017 recently they found that the transition occurs at an r e where there exists a trend change of the frequency profile this trend change corresponds to the f o s c attaining its peak value this observation is employed here to predict the branching behaviour of a freely vibrating square cylinder of m 1 previously investigated by sen and mittal 2015 in fig 3a of sen and mittal 2015 the dsii was marked incorrectly as lower branch and initial branch was labelled as part of lower branch figs 6a and 3a of sen and mittal 2015 are combined and reproduced here as fig 11 the dsi regime continues up to r e 53 followed by a change of slope and also the first jump at r e 54 fig 11a this marks the initiation of lock in and initial branch the oscillation frequency attains its highest value at r e 66 signifying the transition from initial to lower branch the lower branch continues till r e 80 where s t or f o s c is minimum the dsii continues thereafter a very contrasting observation from this low m case is that the maximum transverse response occurs within the initial branch instead of the lower branch fig 11b shows this besides labelling the regimes of response 5 6 branching of in line response very recently sourav and sen 2017 in conjunction with their study of viv of elliptic cylinders of low m suggested that unlike y m a x for transverse response x m a x for in line response is not a suitable indicator of streamwise response since the mean of the driving drag force is non zero and positive the time mean x is also non zero and positive the inadequacy of x m a x to represent the streamwise response is an outcome of varying mean x from the fixed reference point i e origin of the coordinate system on the other hand the value of x r m s is independent of the measurement reference therefore x r m s is a more suitable quantity to demonstrate the features of in line translations for each cylinder shape fig 12 plots x r m s with r e each response branch that is identified from y response is also resolved in the x r m s r e variation for the elliptic cylinders fig 12a b and 12c for a r 0 9 1 and 10 9 respectively the branching of response is very much prominent however for the square fig 12d and truncated circular cylinders fig 12e identification of lb dsii transition appears difficult from the x r m s curve analysis of f o s c r e curve provides the precise location of such transition points 5 7 comparison of transverse response characteristics a comparative analysis of transverse response characteristics of oscillators of various shapes but identical mass ratio 10 can be made from fig 13 the response from each oscillator is roughly of comparable and insignificant magnitude in the desynchronization regimes the vibrations are strong for oscillators with curved contours as the cylinder contour reduces to fully straight edged with sharp corners square cylinder the amplitude of cylinder response falls drastically and shrinking of the range of lock in becomes overwhelming over the range of r e considered the square cylinder therefore appears the most stable shape against two degrees of freedom viv the quasi periodicity is generally captured post lock in in the initial branch and close to the end of lock in or lower branch the hump next to dsi in y m a x r e curve denotes quasi periodic regime seen for elliptic and truncated circular cylinders and same is indicated by the horn seen for the elliptic cylinders close to the lock in boundary the initial branch contains both periodic and quasi periodic components if the transition involves a pair of jumps as seen with the truncated circular and elliptic cylinders 5 8 possible applicability to high r e viv the proposed methodology demonstrates its capability to predict the response branches and associated transitions for response curves that are based on computations of viv at low r e based on our study on several geometric configurations it is found that transitions are essentially reflected via changes of slope of the transverse oscillation frequency and sometimes not by certain parts of the response curves irrespective of r e the primary criterion for identification of response branches is therefore the existence of slope change in the oscillation frequency curve response solutions at higher r e are expected to be associated with the appearance of newer branches the pioneering experimental studies by khalak and williamson 1996 1999 concerning transverse only viv of a rigid circular cylinder introduced the concept of response branching and for the first time identified the existence of a high amplitude upper branch in addition to the initial and lower branches fig 1 of khalak and williamson 1996 for m 2 4 Œ∂ 0 0045 and r e 6000 shows the branching pattern followed by the variation of frequency ratio f in this figure slope changes of f at the locations of transition are very prominent using the same experimental set up khalak and williamson 1999 conducted extensive investigations on transverse only viv of the circular cylinder over r e 5000 16000 figure 18 of khalak and williamson 1999 shows for m 3 3 and Œ∂ 0 0026 the variation of f with reduced speed the branching is also shown in the figure and change of slope of f at the transitions is also very clear therefore the condition of identification of the transition appears independent of r e in light of the response and frequency ratio plots reported by khalak and williamson 1996 1999 at high r e it appears that the proposed method may be effective for viv even at higher r e 6 conclusions stabilized space time finite element computations are performed in two dimensions to accurately predict the branching of response for arbitrary shaped oscillators elliptic square and truncated circular cylinders each of mass ratio 10 and executing two degrees of freedom free undamped vibrations are considered it is demonstrated that the branching of cylinder response is best explained using the oscillation frequency with the aid of vortex shedding frequency each transition is predicted by a change of slope of the frequency curve irrespective of oscillator cross section the minimum value of s t signifies closure of periodic lower branch and the minimum f o s c point denotes end of quasi periodic lower branch the maximum value of f o s c may correspond to onset of lock in for square cylinder truncated circular cylinder and a r 10 9 elliptic cylinder or onset of lower branch for a r 0 9 and 1 for elliptic cylinders quasi periodicity in the initial and lower branches is qualitatively different in the initial branch the frequency peaks of response and vortex shedding may or may not collapse but they definitely diverge in the lower branch therefore oscillation and shedding frequencies together can predict the transition from periodic to quasi periodic lower branch but in some cases are unable to locate the transition from quasi periodic to periodic initial branch viv results of a truncated circular cylinder at low r e are presented for the first time no noteworthy effect of base truncation is apparent on the initial branch however the truncation eliminates the quasi periodic lower branch besides shortening the extent of lock in and lowering the cylinder displacement analysis of response of m 1 square cylinder reveals that the maximum transverse response occurs in the initial branch and not in the lower branch this is a contrasting feature relative to the general trend the response of oscillators with curved surfaces overwhelmingly exceeds those with combined curved and straight surfaces or straight edges alone owing to the least response and narrowest synchronization regime the square cross section is the most stable shape against viv at low r e 
23212,mathematical and simulation models of the nonlinear speed optimization under the influence of irregular winds and waves are established for a 48000dwt oil tanker the objective functions are minimum fuel consumption of the main engine and maximum operating cost reduction the influence of winds and waves on fuel consumption the maximum operating cost reduction under different market

with that at the punctual constant speed the proposed model can be used to significantly improve a ship s operating economy and provide decision support for shipping companies keywords ship given route speed optimization irregular winds and waves 1 introduction international ocean shipping transports more than 80 of global trade shipping is the most efficient and cost effective method of international transportation for most goods providing a low cost and dependable means of transport for global trade imo 2014 however as a transport method ships consume a huge amount of fuel and have low energy efficiency with high speed operations consuming even more fuel and creating significant air pollution emissions with oil and other fossil energy stocks increasingly depleting rising fuel prices and a downturn in the shipping market high speed operations resulting in significant increases in transportation costs for shipping companies and causing serious environmental pollution bunker index 2017 zis and psaraftis 2017 armstrong 2013 adland et al 2017 therefore ship speed must be optimized from the perspectives of energy conservation environmental protection and ship operation economic benefits to reduce pollution emissions and improve cost effectiveness psaraftis and kontovas 2013 the study of ship speed optimization mainly focuses on two aspects saving energy and reducing emissions and maximizing operating economic benefits corbett et al 2009 ronen 2011 cariou and cheaitou 2012 ronen 1982 investigated the effect of fuel prices on a ship s optimal speed and analyzed the tradeoff between fuel savings through slow steaming and loss of revenues due to the increase in voyage time presenting three models to explicitly determine the optimal speed of a ship fagerholt et al 2009 assumed that fuel consumption of the main engine is a cubic function of speed with time as an independent variable to optimize the speed of each leg of a given route to reduce co2 emissions doudnikoff and lacoste 2014 investigated whether an increase in speed outside sulfur emission control areas eca resulted in an increase in co2 emissions of the total cycle and proposed a cost model that estimated a cost minimizing combination of speeds inside and outside the sulfur ecas and the resulting co2 emissions of the liner service fagerholt et al 2015 fagerholt and psaraftis 2015 considered ecas with strict limits on sulfur emissions to optimize the route and speed of ocean going vessels and developed an optimization model for determining sailing paths and speeds that minimized operating costs for a ship in addition the group performed a computational study on realistic shipping routes to evaluate the impact of eca regulations on sailing paths and speeds and hence fuel consumption and costs lu et al 2015 considered the influence of irregular winds and waves on a ship and established a fuel consumption forecasting model for various ship types kim et al 2012 considered the environmental costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions and proposed a ship speed optimization algorithm aimed at minimizing transportation costs noting that ship time costs play the most important role in reducing co2 emissions venturini et al 2017 considered the problem of multi port berth allocation to optimize container ship sailing time and speed to reduce fuel consumption and emissions he et al 2017 proposed an efficient algorithm to find the optimal speed of a ship with the aim of minimizing fuel costs and emissions and optimized the speed of each leg of a given route to study economic benefits alderton 1981 presented a variety of criteria to determine the speed that maximized profit and discussed how sensitive these speeds were to such constraints as voyage distance freight rates and fuel costs norstad et al 2011 presented a tramp ship routing problem with speed optimization where speed was introduced as a decision variable with the main objective of maximizing operating profit the objective of the speed optimization sub problem was to minimize costs on a given leg of the route wang and meng 2012 first calibrated the bunker consumption sailing speed relationship for container ships using historical operating data from a global liner shipping company then proposed a mixed integer nonlinear programming speed optimization model and an exact and efficient outer approximation algorithm to minimize total operating costs wang and xu 2015 analyzed the impact of different carbon emission tax levy schemes on operating profit and optimized ship speed with profit maximization as the objective function psaraftis and kontovas 2010 2014 analyzed the impact of a decrease in speed on operating costs and developed a mathematical model that used total costs as the objective function then also considered the influence of factors such as state of the market and in transit inventory costs lindstad et al 2011 directly used the cost per nautical mile of a vessel as the objective function compared to using only the costs of the main engine fuel consumption thus also considering other factors such as auxiliary engine fuel costs time charter costs cargo storage and cost interest wen et al 2016 proposed a three index mixed integer linear programming formulation with the maximum profit of the route as the goal to optimize the route and speed of a container ship at the same time wen et al 2017 used fuel consumption as a function of payload considering cargo port inventory costs and in transit inventory costs with the minimum total costs of the route as the goal for speed optimization it can be seen from the above analyses that current speed optimization research is less concerned with the impact of sea conditions on fuel consumption of the ship s main engine thus ensuring that any calculation of the main engine fuel consumption of a ship s single voyage has errors this has a significant influence on the total costs of a ship s operation therefore this paper considers the comprehensive influence of irregular marine winds and waves on ship sailing and establishes mathematical and simulink simulation models of ship speed optimization under the influence of irregular winds and waves the main engine minimum fuel consumption and maximum route cost reduction as the objective functions to optimize an operating ship s speed on a given route thereby reducing main engine fuel consumption and reducing shipping costs 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem description in this paper a 48000dwt oil tanker is used as the research object to study speed optimization on a given route between two ports where the ship is constrained to travel within a given time window and is subject to the influence of irregular winds and waves we define the constant speed for which the ship would arrive on time at the port of destination as the punctual constant speed and using the cost reduction of a single voyage to measure the influence of speed changes on ship operating economic benefits under different market conditions compared to a ship sailing at the design speed of the ship or at the punctual constant speed using main engine minimum fuel consumption and maximum route cost reduction as the objective functions a speed optimization is conducted through analysis and statistics of historical meteorological data on the ship s given route combined with a real time weather forecast we obtain actual sea conditions for the target voyage route based on sea conditions and considering the comprehensive effects of irregular winds and waves similar sea areas are grouped into the same sailing leg so that the ship route is divided into several sections fig 1 shows the sea states corresponding beaufort number bn the relation between bn and significant wave height hs or sea state is taken from kwon s research kwon 1981 which described sea state hs and mean wave period tm corresponding to each bn in fully developed sea bn is used in this paper to represent the hs and sea state in a certain range of the sea it is reasonable to assume that the sea state used in this study satisfies this specific hs bn relation 2 2 calculation of main engine fuel consumption main engine fuel consumption per hour is divided into two parts one part is the hourly fuel consumption mf 1 that assumes the ship is sailing in still water and the second part is the additional fuel consumption mf 2 required to maintain an unchanging speed in each leg under the influence of irregular winds and waves with this influence hourly fuel consumption of the ship s main engine can be written as 1 m f h m f 1 m f 2 the main engine fuel consumption per nautical mile is 2 m f n m f h 3600 v 1852 and the total voyage fuel consumption of the

the involuntary speed loss only when hs 3m in general the voluntary speed reduction occurs only when the ship is sailing in critical conditions where the ship s synchronous rolling wavelength Œª s y n

study the maximum bn used is 6 and there are no cases where bn 7 and hs 3 m therefore the voluntary speed loss of ship is not considered in this paper 2 3 calculation of route cost reduction the operating costs of a ship are closely related to its speed and any change in speed will result in a significant change in operating costs for example speed reduction results in a decrease in main engine fuel costs but an increase in fixed operating costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs the cost reductions in each voyage caused by changes in speed have the following relationship 22 s Œ¥ f Œ¥ o

consumption t d t d is the change in sailing time after speed optimization d c a is the auxiliary engine fuel marine diesel oil or mdo price t and c op is the daily fixed operating costs d the formula for calculating the change of sailing time after speed optimization can be written as 25 t d i 1 n d i 24 v b i d i 24 v a i where v bi is the i th sailing leg speed after speed optimization knot and v ai is the design speed or the punctual constant speed of the i th sailing leg knot the fixed operating costs for a ship s sailing are borne by the costs of the shipowner s input which will be

is the daily time charter rate d 3 nonlinear speed optimization model a speed optimization model is developed for a given route between two ports according to ship s actual operation with main engine minimum fuel consumption and maximum cost reduction for the single voyage as the operating objectives the speed is constrained to not exceed the maximum speed or go below the minimum speed and the total sailing time has to be less than the latest allowed arrival time furthermore the main engine cannot work at overloaded capacity based on the above conditions objective functions 27 28 and constraints 29 can be constructed as 27 min m f min i 1 n m f n i d i 28 max s max m f a m f b c m a u c a c h i 1 n d i 24 v b i d i 24 v a i 29 i 1 n d i v i t e 0 v i v max 0 i 1 n v min v i 0 i 1

engine power kw and p max is the main engine rated power kw the mathematical form of the optimization problem is a multivariable nonlinear programming problem with constraints in this research the optimization function is solved by using the internal penalty function and the simulation model for main engine minimum fuel consumption and maximum route cost reduction of a 48000dwt oil tanker is built on the simulink simulation platform of matlab r2016a the simulink model includes four modules still water resistance additional wind and wave power fuel consumption and cost calculation the external input parameter mode is used to simplify the simulink model the parameters of the ship and the wind and wave patterns are written into an m script file and the constraints are written into an m function file since the matlab optimization algorithm has a certain dependence on the initial value the initial vector group v 0 of each leg speed is given before calculations are started and then the matlab optimization toolbox is used to solve the model 4 model verification error in the optimization model arises from calculation of the still water resistance and calculation of the additional power derived from wind and wave action therefore emphasis is to verify the still water resistance and the additional wind and wave power the still water resistance is verified by comparing the model calculation data with ship model test data for the additional wind and wave power the variation trends of hourly fuel consumption under different wind and wave environments are calculated in this paper 4 1 verification of still water resistance simulation module fig 3 and fig 4 show simulation results ship model test results and calculation errors for still water resistance at different speeds of the 48000dwt oil tanker under full load and ballast load respectively the figures show that the calculated still water resistance are highly consistent with the ship model test results under both full load and ballast load conditions with a maximum error of less than 5 fig 5 and fig 6 show simulation results ship model test results and calculation errors for still water resistance power at different speeds of the 48000dwt oil tanker under full load and ballast load respectively note that the resistance power calculated by the model are obtained by multiplying the still water resistance multiplied by the speed the figures illustrate that the resistance power error does not change significantly with changing speed a trend consistent with the still water resistance error the maximum error does not exceed 5 fig 7 and fig 8 show simulation results ship model test results and calculation errors for still water resistance received power at different speeds of the 48000dwt oil tanker under full load and ballast load respectively the figures show that the error of the received power is less than the still water resistance power error the maximum error does not exceed 4 at full load and 3 at ballast load the error is smaller because the propulsion efficiency Œ∑ d uses fitting of ship model test data rather than a fixed value which improves the calculation accuracy of the whole model 4 2 verification of additional wind and wave power simulation module because of the different design and structure parameters of each ship the degree of influence of winds and waves is different for each ship however the influence pattern is similar the additional resistance caused by winds and waves results in a loss of ship speed in order to maintain the original ship speed the main engine must provide additional power resulting in additional fuel consumption since the measurement data of fuel consumption per nautical mile under wind and wave influence is less and shipping companies keep confidential the actual data it is difficult to verify fuel consumption directly therefore the variation trends of hourly fuel consumption under the influence of different winds and waves are calculated shown in fig 9 the additional wind and wave power simulation module has not been verified in the examined vessel due to lack of available data and experiments regardless it has been observed from various studies that the kwon s method kwon 2008 can produce reliable results in various different ship types such as ore carriers nikolopoulos et al 2016 meng and yuan 2016 containerships second imo ghg study 2009 shao et al 2012 m kim et al 2017 and oil tankers second imo ghg study 2009 lu et al 2015 etc in addition the approximation method in kwon 2008 showed good accuracy in comparison to more extensive calculation methods and this method was also recommended by the international maritime organization second imo ghg study 2009 to predict the involuntary speed loss of the ship with the use of the kwon s method the prediction of speed loss can be achieved quickly without complex hydrodynamic calculations shao 2013 the kwon s method kwon 2008 was also adopted to predict added resistance for weather routing in many previous researches such as larsson and simonsen 2014 and shao 2013 it was proved that the kwon s method kwon 2008 is very fast and reliable on ship operational performance prediction in lu et al 2015 fig 9 shows the change in fuel consumption for the 48000dwt oil tanker under different winds and waves at the ship s designed draft the figure shows the degree of influence of four different wind and wave directions on fuel consumption per hour of the oil tanker from the largest influence to the smallest the wind directions are head sea and wind bow sea and wind beam sea and wind and following sea and wind the variation of hourly fuel consumption of the ship under various wind and wave conditions presents a nonlinear trend higher wind and wave levels increase hourly fuel consumption accordingly under four different wind and wave directions the hourly fuel consumption increases significantly at b n 6 compared with other wind and wave levels and the hourly fuel consumption increases rapidly at higher ship speeds it shows that the established wind and wave additional power module can relatively accurately predict the impact of various wind and wave conditions on the ship s main engine fuel consumption 5 speed optimization results and analysis 5 1 sea conditions and route information this paper studies speed optimization for given shipping routes after the route is divided according to sea and weather conditions this approach assumes that information on sea and weather conditions can be obtained through a weather forecast considering the practical use and ocean going navigation characteristics of the 48000dwt oil tanker an ocean route that has only two ports is simulated according to navigation log data and divides the route between port s and port k into 20 sailing legs according to sea condition information the ship data is given in table 5 the ship s other structural parameters are not given because of confidentiality the voyage plan is shown in table 6 the route divisions and sea conditions are shown in table 7 route and sailing leg information is shown in fig 10 5 2 shipping market conditions fuel price and ship time charter rate vary greatly in different shipping market conditions and significantly affect the operating costs of the ship in this study shipping market information from clarkson research shipping intelligence network is used for ship operation research and analysis table 8 lists the time charter rate fuel price and recent shipping market conditions between 2000 and 2016 5 3 speed optimization results and discussion using the sea conditions listed in table 7 the simulink model is used to calculate the speed hourly fuel consumption and total route fuel consumption of the ship under the influence of irregular winds and waves with minimum ship fuel consumption as the goal in addition it is worth noting that the ship inertia may affect the overall calculation result of the model the effect of ship inertia on the overall result is mainly reflected in two aspects first 6 degrees of freedom dof motion of the ship is affected by the ship inertia in the cases with wind and waves the ship will experience surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw movements second the ship inertia causes delays in the adjustment of the speed of the ship and the actual speed of the ship cannot immediately reach the set speed which causes a deviation between the actual fuel consumption or other indicators and the model calculation result for the effect of the 6 dof motion of the ship the additional power of wind and waves is calculated in this study to represent it therefore the effect of the 6 dof motion of the ship is not considered the research object of this paper is an ocean going ship each sailing leg of the route is long and there are few sailing legs with larger bn e g bn 5 however only when the bn is larger the ship speed will change significantly e g speed changes by 1 knots it is assumed that the delay in speed change is 3 min taking the sailing leg with the largest change in fuel consumption per hour in fig 12 as an example the deviation in fuel consumption caused by the delay in speed change is 17 6 kg compared with the total route fuel consumption of 401 34 t this deviation has slight impact on the calculation result of the entire voyage so it can be ignored in the cases with smaller bn sailing leg the deviation of fuel consumption or other indicators due to the delay in speed change caused by ship inertia is relatively small therefore the deviation between the actual fuel consumption and the calculation result of the model caused by the ship inertia can be ignored reasonably it is assumed in this paper that there is no delay in speed adjustment and the slight impact of ship inertia on the overall results is not taken into consideration for the time being fig 11 illustrates the speed over the voyage course of the 48000dwt oil tanker under the influence of winds and waves we can see that in the case of b n 6 the ship cannot reach its design speed of 15 knot due to the rated power limitation of the main engine at this time the main engine is already operating at full workload and the ship is sailing at its fastest possible speed the figure also shows that the optimized speed is less than the design speed in each sailing leg indicating that reducing the sailing speed is conducive to reducing fuel consumption in the sailing legs that experience higher winds and waves the optimized speed is less than the punctual constant speed while in the sailing legs of lower winds and waves the optimized speed is greater than the punctual constant speed this result reveals that the punctual constant speed is not the optimum speed when the ship is sailing under winds and waves even with time window constraints the changes in the optimized speed show that ship sailing should consider the comprehensive influence of winds and waves with a higher reduction in speed in higher winds and waves and using only minimal reduction in speed when winds and waves are smaller fig 12 depicts main engine hourly fuel consumption over the voyage course of the 48000dwt oil tanker under the influence of winds and waves it can be seen from the figure that the hourly fuel consumption in each sailing leg is less than the design speed fuel consumption when the ship is sailing at the optimized speed or at the punctual constant speed when winds and waves are higher the design speed is reduced and the optimized speed is reduced a significant amount at these points in the voyage the hourly fuel consumption for all three speeds significantly increases which indicates that higher winds and waves have a great influence on main engine fuel consumption at b n 6 the fuel consumption of the optimized speed is less than the fuel consumption of the punctual constant speed by at least 0 14 t h and less than the fuel consumption at the design speed of 0 63 t h or more this shows that the energy saving effect of reducing sailing speed under higher winds and waves is remarkable fig 13 illustrates the total route fuel consumption of the 48000dwt oil tanker at three speeds as can be seen from the figure the total route fuel consumption for the three different speed options is from smallest to largest 401 34 t for the optimized speed 405 67 t for the punctual constant speed and 595 69 t for the design speed thus compared with punctual constant speed sailing and design speed sailing ship speed optimization achieves fuel savings of 4 33 t and 194 35 t respectively and fuel saving rates of 1 07 and 32 63 respectively these results show that the fuel savings are considerable when a ship sails at the optimized speed assuming that the wind and wave conditions of the route are relatively constant in each sailing leg and the ship is fault free a ship operating at optimized speeds for one year would experience fuel savings of 77 94 t and 3498 3 t respectively compared with punctual constant speed sailing and design speed sailing it can be seen that speed optimization of the operating ship can significantly reduce fuel consumption during the ship s sailing this paper also studies two different speed optimization scenarios with the goal of maximum route cost reduction scheme 1 studies speed optimization on the basis of the design speed while scheme 2 studies speed optimization on the basis of the punctual constant speed the optimized speed of the two schemes is the same but the route cost reductions are different using the data in table 8 we divide the shipping market for these scenarios into five cases high charter rates and high fuel prices hh low charter rates and high fuel prices lh high charter rates and low fuel prices hl low charter rates and low fuel prices ll and recent markets after speed optimization the change in ship single voyage maximum cost reduction under different market conditions is calculated figs 14 18 show the change in speed over the course of the voyage for the two schemes under different market conditions for the 48000dwt oil tanker it can be seen from the figures that the optimized speed is less than the design speed under hh lh and recent market conditions the optimized speed is less than the punctual constant speed when the influence of the winds and waves is large and is greater than the punctual constant speed when the wind and wave influence is small under these market conditions when ship is sailing at optimized speed the reductions in fuel costs of the main engine are greater than the increases in charter costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs compared to design speed sailing and the reductions in charter costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs are greater than the increases in main engine fuel costs compared to punctual constant speed sailing the figures also show that the design speed and the punctual constant speed are not the optimum speed a speed reduction on the basis of the design speed reduces total ship operating costs however the rate of speed reduction should be adjusted within a reasonable range according to the prevailing wind and wave condition under hl market conditions the optimized speed is greater than the design speed and the ship s main engine operates under full workload to reach its maximum speed of sailing under these conditions reductions in charter costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs are greater than the increase in main engine fuel costs compared to the design speed and punctual constant speed scenarios and full speed sailing reduces the ship s total operation costs under ll market conditions the optimized speed fluctuates near the design speed but remains greater than the punctual constant speed the optimized speed is less than the design speed when wind and wave influence is significant while the optimized speed is greater than the design speed when the influence of winds and waves is small the average optimized speed is slightly greater than the design speed compared with design speed sailing the influence of change of speed on main engine fuel costs charter costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs on total ship operation costs are roughly the same compared with punctual constant speed sailing reductions in charter costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs are greater than the increase in main engine fuel costs all of these results show that sailing at the design speed or at a punctual constant speed does not improve ship operation economics for any set of studied market conditions the ship speed must be optimized where the optimized speed fluctuations shows the effect of different winds and waves on main engine fuel consumption fig 19 shows the route cost reductions of the two schemes after speed optimization under different market conditions for the 48000dwt oil tanker as can be seen from the figure the ship has the highest speed reduction and the largest total cost reduction in scheme 1 under lh market conditions the fuel consumption saving increase as the speed decreases but total cost reduction does not necessarily increase while the speed reduction used for recent market conditions is more than under hh market conditions the total cost reduction is less than under hh market conditions indicating that optimal speed reduction must consider the impact of market conditions in scheme 2 the optimized speed shows the biggest deviation from the punctual constant speed under hl market conditions and results in the largest cost reduction the cost reduction achieved under ll market conditions is second highest on the other hand if the ship sails at a punctual constant speed the economic costs to the shipping company are significantly increase in scheme 1 the cost reductions achieved for a single voyage operation of the ship are 36557 90462 10147 46 and 24622 for the hh lh hl ll and recent market conditions respectively in scheme 2 the cost reductions achieved for a single voyage operation of the ship under the five market conditions are 5794 1934 85865 17999 and 938 respectively assuming that the wind and wave conditions of the route remain relatively constant and the ship is fault free if the ship operates at the optimized speed for one year the cost reductions in scheme 1 are 694583 1628316 213087 966 and 443196 respectively the cost reductions in scheme 2 are 110086 34812 1803165 377979 and 16884 respectively these results show that optimizing ship speed using the proposed model can significantly improve the economics of the ship s operation table 9 shows the total cost savings the fuel savings the cost savings from changes in sailing time and the share of each part under the five market conditions of the two schemes it can be seen from table 9 that there is no case where the fuel of main engine and the changes in sailing time save costs at the same time only one part is cost savings and the cost of other part increases under the various market conditions of the scheme 1 not all main engine fuel costs will decrease and the time related costs will increase for example in hl market conditions the main engine fuel costs increase and the time related costs decrease under the various market conditions of the scheme 2 not all time related costs will decrease and the main engine fuel costs will increase for example in lh market conditions the time related costs increase and the main engine fuel costs decrease it also can be found from the data in table 9 that the market conditions have a significant influence on the operation of the ship and the speed should be chose reasonably 6 conclusions using the 48000dwt oil tanker as the research object the mathematical and simulink models of ship speed optimization are developed under the influence of irregular winds and waves the main engine fuel consumption and operating costs of the ship over the route of an entire voyage are simulated the main conclusions of the study are as follows 1 simulation results of still water resistance and power are compared with ship model test results the calculation errors of the still water resistance and the still water resistance power under different working conditions are less than 5 the error of the still water received power is less than 4 at full load and 3 at ballast load verifying the accuracy and applicability of the still water resistance simulation module of the proposed model the variation trends of hourly fuel consumption show that the additional wind and wave power simulation module of the proposed model can relatively accurately predict the impact of various wind and wave conditions on the ship s main engine fuel consumption 2 the optimized speed is less than the design speed and the punctual constant speed is not the optimum speed the rate of speed reduction is different under different wind and wave conditions at b n 6 fuel consumption at the optimized speed is at least 0 14 t h less than that at the punctual constant speed and at least 0 63 t h less than that at the design speed the energy savings achieved by reducing sailing speed under high winds and waves is remarkable 3 fuel consumption simulation results show that the fuel savings in a single voyage by speed optimization is 4 33 t compared to punctual constant speed sailing a fuel saving rate of 1 07 while the annual total fuel savings would be 77 94 t compared with design speed sailing the optimized speed achieves a single voyage fuel savings of 194 35 t resulting in a fuel saving rate of 32 63 and annual total fuel savings of 3498 3 t it is clear that speed optimization helps to significantly save fuel 4 the rate of speed reduction is different under different shipping markets under low charter rates and high fuel prices market conditions the ship has the highest speed reduction compared to the design speed with an average decrease during the route of 16 4 under high charter rates and low fuel prices market conditions optimized ship speed did not decrease and the ship sails at maximum speed indicating that optimal speed reductions must consider the effect of market conditions furthermore the optimized speeds are not equal to the punctual constant speed further illustrating that the punctual constant speed is not the optimum speed 5 cost simulation results show that the cost reductions after speed optimization for a single voyage operation of the ship are up to 90 462 and 85 865 respectively compared with design speed sailing and punctual constant speed sailing while annual cost reductions of up to 1 628 million and 1 803 million respectively thus the proposed speed optimization model can significantly improve the economic operation of a ship and provide speed decision support for shipping companies acknowledgements this study was sponsored by the high tech ship project intelligent ship 1 0 r d special ship

route speed optimization irregular winds and waves 1 introduction international ocean shipping transports more than 80 of global trade shipping is the most efficient and cost effective method of international transportation for most goods providing a low cost and dependable means of transport for global trade imo 2014 however as a transport method ships consume a huge amount of fuel and have low energy efficiency with high speed operations consuming even more fuel and creating significant air pollution emissions with oil and other fossil energy stocks increasingly depleting rising fuel prices and a downturn in the shipping market high speed operations resulting in significant increases in transportation costs for shipping companies and causing serious environmental pollution bunker index 2017 zis and psaraftis 2017 armstrong 2013 adland et al 2017 therefore ship speed must be optimized from the perspectives of energy conservation environmental protection and ship operation economic benefits to reduce pollution emissions and improve cost effectiveness psaraftis and kontovas 2013 the study of ship speed optimization mainly focuses on two aspects saving energy and reducing emissions and maximizing operating economic benefits corbett et al 2009 ronen 2011 cariou and cheaitou 2012 ronen 1982 investigated the effect of fuel prices on a ship s optimal speed and analyzed the tradeoff between fuel savings through slow steaming and loss of revenues due to the increase in voyage time presenting three models to explicitly determine the optimal speed of a ship fagerholt et al 2009 assumed that fuel consumption of the main engine is a cubic function of speed with time as an independent variable to optimize the speed of each leg of a given route to reduce co2 emissions doudnikoff and lacoste 2014 investigated whether an increase in speed outside sulfur emission control areas eca resulted in an increase in co2 emissions of the total cycle and proposed a cost model that estimated a cost minimizing combination of speeds inside and outside the sulfur ecas and the resulting co2 emissions of the liner service fagerholt et al 2015 fagerholt and psaraftis 2015 considered ecas with strict limits on sulfur emissions to optimize the route and speed of ocean going vessels and developed an optimization model for determining sailing paths and speeds that minimized operating costs for a ship in addition the group performed a computational study on realistic shipping routes to evaluate the impact of eca regulations on sailing paths and speeds and hence fuel consumption and costs lu et al 2015 considered the influence of irregular winds and waves on a ship and established a fuel consumption forecasting model for various ship types kim et al 2012 considered the environmental costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions and proposed a ship speed optimization algorithm aimed at minimizing transportation costs noting that ship time costs play the most important role in reducing co2 emissions venturini et al 2017 considered the problem of multi port berth allocation to optimize container ship sailing time and speed to reduce fuel consumption and emissions he et al 2017 proposed an efficient algorithm to find the optimal speed of a ship with the aim of minimizing fuel costs and emissions and optimized the speed of each leg of a given route to study economic benefits alderton 1981 presented a variety of criteria to determine the speed that maximized profit and discussed how sensitive these speeds were to such constraints as voyage distance freight rates and fuel costs norstad et al 2011 presented a tramp ship routing problem with speed optimization where speed was introduced as a decision variable with the main objective of maximizing operating profit the objective of the speed optimization sub problem was to minimize costs on a given leg of the route wang and meng 2012 first calibrated the bunker consumption sailing speed relationship for container ships using historical operating data from a global liner shipping company then proposed a mixed integer nonlinear programming speed optimization model and an exact and efficient outer approximation algorithm to minimize total operating costs wang and xu 2015 analyzed the impact of different carbon emission tax levy schemes on operating profit and optimized ship speed with profit maximization as the objective function psaraftis and kontovas 2010 2014 analyzed the impact of a decrease in speed on operating costs and developed a mathematical model that used total costs as the objective function then also considered the influence of factors such as state of the market and in transit inventory costs lindstad et al 2011 directly used the cost per nautical mile of a vessel as the objective function compared to using only the costs of the main engine fuel consumption thus also considering other factors such as auxiliary engine fuel costs time charter costs cargo storage and cost interest wen et al 2016 proposed a three index mixed integer linear programming formulation with the maximum profit of the route as the goal to optimize the route and speed of a container ship at the same time wen et al 2017 used fuel consumption as a function of payload considering cargo port inventory costs and in transit inventory costs with the minimum total costs of the route as the goal for speed optimization it can be seen from the above analyses that current speed optimization research is less concerned with the impact of sea conditions on fuel consumption of the ship s main engine thus ensuring that any calculation of the main engine fuel consumption of a ship s single voyage has errors this has a significant influence on the total costs of a ship s operation therefore this paper considers the comprehensive influence of irregular marine winds and waves on ship sailing and establishes mathematical and simulink simulation models of ship speed optimization under the influence of irregular winds and waves the main engine minimum fuel consumption and maximum route cost reduction as the objective functions to optimize an operating ship s speed on a given route thereby reducing main engine fuel consumption and reducing shipping costs 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem description in this paper a 48000dwt oil tanker is used as the research object to study speed optimization on a given route between two ports where the ship is constrained to travel within a given time window and is subject to the influence of irregular winds and waves we define the constant speed for which the ship would arrive on time at the port of destination as the punctual constant speed and using the cost reduction of a single voyage to measure the influence of speed changes on ship operating economic benefits under different market conditions compared to a ship sailing at the design speed of the ship or at the punctual constant speed using main engine minimum fuel consumption and maximum route cost reduction as the objective functions a speed optimization is conducted through analysis and statistics of historical meteorological data on the ship s given route combined with a real time weather forecast we obtain actual sea conditions for the target voyage route based on sea conditions and considering the comprehensive effects of irregular winds and waves similar sea areas are grouped into the same sailing leg so that the ship route is divided into several sections fig 1 shows the sea states corresponding beaufort number bn the relation between bn and significant wave height hs or sea state is taken from kwon s research kwon 1981 which described sea state hs and mean wave period tm corresponding to each bn in fully developed sea bn is used in this paper to represent the hs and sea state in a certain range of the sea it is reasonable to assume that the sea state used in this study satisfies this specific hs bn relation 2 2 calculation of main engine fuel consumption main engine fuel consumption per hour is divided into two parts one part is the hourly fuel consumption mf 1 that assumes the ship is sailing in still water and the second part is the additional fuel consumption mf 2 required to maintain an unchanging speed in each leg under the influence of irregular winds and waves with this influence hourly fuel consumption of the ship s main engine can be written as 1 m f h m f 1 m f 2 the main engine fuel consumption per nautical mile is 2 m f n m f h 3600 v 1852 and the total voyage fuel consumption of the

calculated by the above formula when bn 7 kwon 1981 kepaptsoglou et al 2015 in addition the prpiƒá or≈°iƒá and faltinsen 2012 2016 also showed that the voluntary speed loss is more significant than the involuntary speed loss only when hs 3m in general the voluntary speed reduction occurs only when the ship is sailing in critical conditions where the ship s synchronous rolling wavelength Œª s y n is between the ship s length l and the wavelength Œª max e of the maximum energy wave l Œª max e when hs 3 m Œª max e 40 h s 120 m 184 88 m l there is no critical condition in this sea state in this study the maximum bn used is 6 and there are no cases where bn 7 and hs 3 m therefore the voluntary speed loss of ship is not considered in this paper 2 3 calculation of route cost reduction the operating costs of a ship are closely related to its speed and any change in speed will result in a significant change in operating costs for example speed reduction results in a decrease in main engine fuel costs but an increase in fixed operating costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs the cost reductions in each voyage caused by changes in speed have the following relationship 22 s Œ¥ f Œ¥ o

for calculating the change of sailing time after speed optimization can be written as 25 t d i 1 n d i 24 v b i d i 24 v a i where v bi is the i th sailing leg speed after speed optimization knot and v ai is the design speed or the punctual constant speed of the i th sailing leg knot the fixed operating costs for a ship s sailing are borne by the costs of the shipowner s input which will be

is the daily time charter rate d 3 nonlinear speed optimization model a speed optimization model is developed for a given route between two ports according to ship s actual operation with main engine minimum fuel consumption and maximum cost reduction for the single voyage as the operating objectives the speed is constrained to not exceed the maximum speed or go below the minimum speed and the total sailing time has to be less than the latest allowed arrival time furthermore the main engine cannot work at overloaded capacity based on the above conditions objective functions 27 28 and constraints 29 can be constructed as 27 min m f min i 1 n m f n i d i 28 max s max m f a m f b c m a u c a c h i 1 n d i 24 v b i d i 24 v a i 29 i 1 n d i v i t e 0 v i v max 0 i 1 n v min v i 0 i 1

engine power kw and p max is the main engine rated power kw the mathematical form of the optimization problem is a multivariable nonlinear programming problem with constraints in this research the optimization function is solved by using the internal penalty function and the simulation model for main engine minimum fuel consumption and maximum route cost reduction of a 48000dwt oil tanker is built on the simulink simulation platform of matlab r2016a the simulink model includes four modules still water resistance additional wind and wave power fuel consumption and cost calculation the external input parameter mode is used to simplify the simulink model the parameters of the ship and the wind and wave patterns are written into an m script file and the constraints are written into an m function file since the matlab optimization algorithm has a certain dependence on the initial value the initial vector group v 0 of each leg speed is given before calculations are started and then the matlab optimization toolbox is used to solve the model 4 model verification error in the optimization model arises from calculation of the still water resistance and calculation of the additional power derived from wind and wave action therefore emphasis is to verify the still water resistance and the additional wind and wave power the still water resistance is verified by comparing the model calculation data with ship model test data for the additional wind and wave power the variation trends of hourly fuel consumption under different wind and wave environments are calculated in this paper 4 1 verification of still water resistance simulation module fig 3 and fig 4 show simulation results ship model test results and calculation errors for still water resistance at different speeds of the 48000dwt oil tanker under full load and ballast load respectively the figures show that the calculated still water resistance are highly consistent with the ship model test results under both full load and ballast load conditions with a maximum error of less than 5 fig 5 and fig 6 show simulation results ship model test results and calculation errors for still water resistance power at different speeds of the 48000dwt oil tanker under full load and ballast load respectively note that the resistance power calculated by the model are obtained by multiplying the still water resistance multiplied by the speed the figures illustrate that the resistance power error does not change significantly with changing speed a trend consistent with the still water resistance error the maximum error does not exceed 5 fig 7 and fig 8 show simulation results ship model test results and calculation errors for still water resistance received power at different speeds of the 48000dwt oil tanker under full load and ballast load respectively the figures show that the error of the received power is less than the still water resistance power error the maximum error does not exceed 4 at full load and 3 at ballast load the error is smaller because the propulsion efficiency Œ∑ d uses fitting of ship model test data rather than a fixed value which improves the calculation accuracy of the whole model 4 2 verification of additional wind and wave power simulation module because of the different design and structure parameters of each ship the degree of influence of winds and waves is different for each ship however the influence pattern is similar the additional resistance caused by winds and waves results in a loss of ship speed in order to maintain the original ship speed the main engine must provide additional power resulting in additional fuel consumption since the measurement data of fuel consumption per nautical mile under wind and wave influence is less and shipping companies keep confidential the actual data it is difficult to verify fuel consumption directly therefore the variation trends of hourly fuel consumption under the influence of different winds and waves are calculated shown in fig 9 the additional wind and wave power simulation module has not been verified in the examined vessel due to lack of available data and experiments regardless it has been observed from various studies that the kwon s method kwon 2008 can produce reliable results in various different ship types such as ore carriers nikolopoulos et al 2016 meng and yuan 2016 containerships second imo ghg study 2009 shao et al 2012 m kim et al 2017 and oil tankers second imo ghg study 2009 lu et al 2015 etc in addition the approximation method in kwon 2008 showed good accuracy in comparison to more extensive calculation methods and this method was also recommended by the international maritime organization second imo ghg study 2009 to predict the involuntary speed loss of the ship with the use of the kwon s method the prediction of speed loss can be achieved quickly without complex hydrodynamic calculations shao 2013 the kwon s method kwon 2008 was also adopted to predict added resistance for weather routing in many previous researches such as larsson and simonsen 2014 and shao 2013 it was proved that the kwon s method kwon 2008 is very fast and reliable on ship operational performance prediction in lu et al 2015 fig 9 shows the change in fuel consumption for the 48000dwt oil tanker under different winds and waves at the ship s designed draft the figure shows the degree of influence of four different wind and wave directions on fuel consumption per hour of the oil tanker from the largest influence to the smallest the wind directions are head sea and wind bow sea and wind beam sea and wind and following sea and wind the variation of hourly fuel consumption of the ship under various wind and wave conditions presents a nonlinear trend higher wind and wave levels increase hourly fuel consumption accordingly under four different wind and wave directions the hourly fuel consumption increases significantly at b n 6 compared with other wind and wave levels and the hourly fuel consumption increases rapidly at higher ship speeds it shows that the established wind and wave additional power module can relatively accurately predict the impact of various wind and wave conditions on the ship s main engine fuel consumption 5 speed optimization results and analysis 5 1 sea conditions and route information this paper studies speed optimization for given shipping routes after the route is divided according to sea and weather conditions this approach assumes that information on sea and weather conditions can be obtained through a weather forecast considering the practical use and ocean going navigation characteristics of the 48000dwt oil tanker an ocean route that has only two ports is simulated according to navigation log data and divides the route between port s and port k into 20 sailing legs according to sea condition information the ship data is given in table 5 the ship s other structural parameters are not given because of confidentiality the voyage plan is shown in table 6 the route divisions and sea conditions are shown in table 7 route and sailing leg information is shown in fig 10 5 2 shipping market conditions fuel price and ship time charter rate vary greatly in different shipping market conditions and significantly affect the operating costs of the ship in this study shipping market information from clarkson research shipping intelligence network is used for ship operation research and analysis table 8 lists the time charter rate fuel price and recent shipping market conditions between 2000 and 2016 5 3 speed optimization results and discussion using the sea conditions listed in table 7 the simulink model is used to calculate the speed hourly fuel consumption and total route fuel consumption of the ship under the influence of irregular winds and waves with minimum ship fuel consumption as the goal in addition it is worth noting that the ship inertia may affect the overall calculation result of the model the effect of ship inertia on the overall result is mainly reflected in two aspects first 6 degrees of freedom dof motion of the ship is affected by the ship inertia in the cases with wind and waves the ship will experience surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw movements second the ship inertia causes delays in the adjustment of the speed of the ship and the actual speed of the ship cannot immediately reach the set speed which causes a deviation between the actual fuel consumption or other indicators and the model calculation result for the effect of the 6 dof motion of the ship the additional power of wind and waves is calculated in this study to represent it therefore the effect of the 6 dof motion of the ship is not considered the research object of this paper is an ocean going ship each sailing leg of the route is long and there are few sailing legs with larger bn e g bn 5 however only when the bn is larger the ship speed will change significantly e g speed changes by 1 knots it is assumed that the delay in speed change is 3 min taking the sailing leg with the largest change in fuel consumption per hour in fig 12 as an example the deviation in fuel consumption caused by the delay in speed change is 17 6 kg compared with the total route fuel consumption of 401 34 t this deviation has slight impact on the calculation result of the entire voyage so it can be ignored in the cases with smaller bn sailing leg the deviation of fuel consumption or other indicators due to the delay in speed change caused by ship inertia is relatively small therefore the deviation between the actual fuel consumption and the calculation result of the model caused by the ship inertia can be ignored reasonably it is assumed in this paper that there is no delay in speed adjustment and the slight impact of ship inertia on the overall results is not taken into consideration for the time being fig 11 illustrates the speed over the voyage course of the 48000dwt oil tanker under the influence of winds and waves we can see that in the case of b n 6 the ship cannot reach its design speed of 15 knot due to the rated power limitation of the main engine at this time the main engine is already operating at full workload and the ship is sailing at its fastest possible speed the figure also shows that the optimized speed is less than the design speed in each sailing leg indicating that reducing the sailing speed is conducive to reducing fuel consumption in the sailing legs that experience higher winds and waves the optimized speed is less than the punctual constant speed while in the sailing legs of lower winds and waves the optimized speed is greater than the punctual constant speed this result reveals that the punctual constant speed is not the optimum speed when the ship is sailing under winds and waves even with time window constraints the changes in the optimized speed show that ship sailing should consider the comprehensive influence of winds and waves with a higher reduction in speed in higher winds and waves and using only minimal reduction in speed when winds and waves are smaller fig 12 depicts main engine hourly fuel consumption over the voyage course of the 48000dwt oil tanker under the influence of winds and waves it can be seen from the figure that the hourly fuel consumption in each sailing leg is less than the design speed fuel consumption when the ship is sailing at the optimized speed or at the punctual constant speed when winds and waves are higher the design speed is reduced and the optimized speed is reduced a significant amount at these points in the voyage the hourly fuel consumption for all three speeds significantly increases which indicates that higher winds and waves have a great influence on main engine fuel consumption at b n 6 the fuel consumption of the optimized speed is less than the fuel consumption of the punctual constant speed by at least 0 14 t h and less than the fuel consumption at the design speed of 0 63 t h or more this shows that the energy saving effect of reducing sailing speed under higher winds and waves is remarkable fig 13 illustrates the total route fuel consumption of the 48000dwt oil tanker at three speeds as can be seen from the figure the total route fuel consumption for the three different speed options is from smallest to largest 401 34 t for the optimized speed 405 67 t for the punctual constant speed and 595 69 t for the design speed thus compared with punctual constant speed sailing and design speed sailing ship speed optimization achieves fuel savings of 4 33 t and 194 35 t respectively and fuel saving rates of 1 07 and 32 63 respectively these results show that the fuel savings are considerable when a ship sails at the optimized speed assuming that the wind and wave conditions of the route are relatively constant in each sailing leg and the ship is fault free a ship operating at optimized speeds for one year would experience fuel savings of 77 94 t and 3498 3 t respectively compared with punctual constant speed sailing and design speed sailing it can be seen that speed optimization of the operating ship can significantly reduce fuel consumption during the ship s sailing this paper also studies two different speed optimization scenarios with the goal of maximum route cost reduction scheme 1 studies speed optimization on the basis of the design speed while scheme 2 studies speed optimization on the basis of the punctual constant speed the optimized speed of the two schemes is the same but the route cost reductions are different using the data in table 8 we divide the shipping market for these scenarios into five cases high charter rates and high fuel prices hh low charter rates and high fuel prices lh high charter rates and low fuel prices hl low charter rates and low fuel prices ll and recent markets after speed optimization the change in ship single voyage maximum cost reduction under different market conditions is calculated figs 14 18 show the change in speed over the course of the voyage for the two schemes under different market conditions for the 48000dwt oil tanker it can be seen from the figures that the optimized speed is less than the design speed under hh lh and recent market conditions the optimized speed is less than the punctual constant speed when the influence of the winds and waves is large and is greater than the punctual constant speed when the wind and wave influence is small under these market conditions when ship is sailing at optimized speed the reductions in fuel costs of the main engine are greater than the increases in charter costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs compared to design speed sailing and the reductions in charter costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs are greater than the increases in main engine fuel costs compared to punctual constant speed sailing the figures also show that the design speed and the punctual constant speed are not the optimum speed a speed reduction on the basis of the design speed reduces total ship operating costs however the rate of speed reduction should be adjusted within a reasonable range according to the prevailing wind and wave condition under hl market conditions the optimized speed is greater than the design speed and the ship s main engine operates under full workload to reach its maximum speed of sailing under these conditions reductions in charter costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs are greater than the increase in main engine fuel costs compared to the design speed and punctual constant speed scenarios and full speed sailing reduces the ship s total operation costs under ll market conditions the optimized speed fluctuates near the design speed but remains greater than the punctual constant speed the optimized speed is less than the design speed when wind and wave influence is significant while the optimized speed is greater than the design speed when the influence of winds and waves is small the average optimized speed is slightly greater than the design speed compared with design speed sailing the influence of change of speed on main engine fuel costs charter costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs on total ship operation costs are roughly the same compared with punctual constant speed sailing reductions in charter costs and auxiliary engine fuel costs are greater than the increase in main engine fuel costs all of these results show that sailing at the design speed or at a punctual constant speed does not improve ship operation economics for any set of studied market conditions the ship speed must be optimized where the optimized speed fluctuations shows the effect of different winds and waves on main engine fuel consumption fig 19 shows the route cost reductions of the two schemes after speed optimization under different market conditions for the 48000dwt oil tanker as can be seen from the figure the ship has the highest speed reduction and the largest total cost reduction in scheme 1 under lh market conditions the fuel consumption saving increase as the speed decreases but total cost reduction does not necessarily increase while the speed reduction used for recent market conditions is more than under hh market conditions the total cost reduction is less than under hh market conditions indicating that optimal speed reduction must consider the impact of market conditions in scheme 2 the optimized speed shows the biggest deviation from the punctual constant speed under hl market conditions and results in the largest cost reduction the cost reduction achieved under ll market conditions is second highest on the other hand if the ship sails at a punctual constant speed the economic costs to the shipping company are significantly increase in scheme 1 the cost reductions achieved for a single voyage operation of the ship are 36557 90462 10147 46 and 24622 for the hh lh hl ll and recent market conditions respectively in scheme 2 the cost reductions achieved for a single voyage operation of the ship under the five market conditions are 5794 1934 85865 17999 and 938 respectively assuming that the wind and wave conditions of the route remain relatively constant and the ship is fault free if the ship operates at the optimized speed for one year the cost reductions in scheme 1 are 694583 1628316 213087 966 and 443196 respectively the cost reductions in scheme 2 are 110086 34812 1803165 377979 and 16884 respectively these results show that optimizing ship speed using the proposed model can significantly improve the economics of the ship s operation table 9 shows the total cost savings the fuel savings the cost savings from changes in sailing time and the share of each part under the five market conditions of the two schemes it can be seen from table 9 that there is no case where the fuel of main engine and the changes in sailing time save costs at the same time only one part is cost savings and the cost of other part increases under the various market conditions of the scheme 1 not all main engine fuel costs will decrease and the time related costs will increase for example in hl market conditions the main engine fuel costs increase and the time related costs decrease under the various market conditions of the scheme 2 not all time related costs will decrease and the main engine fuel costs will increase for example in lh market conditions the time related costs increase and the main engine fuel costs decrease it also can be found from the data in table 9 that the market conditions have a significant influence on the operation of the ship and the speed should be chose reasonably 6 conclusions using the 48000dwt oil tanker as the research object the mathematical and simulink models of ship speed optimization are developed under the influence of irregular winds and waves the main engine fuel consumption and operating costs of the ship over the route of an entire voyage are simulated the main conclusions of the study are as follows 1 simulation results of still water resistance and power are compared with ship model test results the calculation errors of the still water resistance and the still water resistance power under different working conditions are less than 5 the error of the still water received power is less than 4 at full load and 3 at ballast load verifying the accuracy and applicability of the still water resistance simulation module of the proposed model the variation trends of hourly fuel consumption show that the additional wind and wave power simulation module of the proposed model can relatively accurately predict the impact of various wind and wave conditions on the ship s main engine fuel consumption 2 the optimized speed is less than the design speed and the punctual constant speed is not the optimum speed the rate of speed reduction is different under different wind and wave conditions at b n 6 fuel consumption at the optimized speed is at least 0 14 t h less than that at the punctual constant speed and at least 0 63 t h less than that at the design speed the energy savings achieved by reducing sailing speed under high winds and waves is remarkable 3 fuel consumption simulation results show that the fuel savings in a single voyage by speed optimization is 4 33 t compared to punctual constant speed sailing a fuel saving rate of 1 07 while the annual total fuel savings would be 77 94 t compared with design speed sailing the optimized speed achieves a single voyage fuel savings of 194 35 t resulting in a fuel saving rate of 32 63 and annual total fuel savings of 3498 3 t it is clear that speed optimization helps to significantly save fuel 4 the rate of speed reduction is different under different shipping markets under low charter rates and high fuel prices market conditions the ship has the highest speed reduction compared to the design speed with an average decrease during the route of 16 4 under high charter rates and low fuel prices market conditions optimized ship speed did not decrease and the ship sails at maximum speed indicating that optimal speed reductions must consider the effect of market conditions furthermore the optimized speeds are not equal to the punctual constant speed further illustrating that the punctual constant speed is not the optimum speed 5 cost simulation results show that the cost reductions after speed optimization for a single voyage operation of the ship are up to 90 462 and 85 865 respectively compared with design speed sailing and punctual constant speed sailing while annual cost reductions of up to 1 628 million and 1 803 million respectively thus the proposed speed optimization model can significantly improve the economic operation of a ship and provide speed decision support for shipping companies acknowledgements this study was sponsored by the high tech ship project intelligent ship 1 0 r d special ship

23213,a wave driven unmanned surface vehicle wusv can sail on the sea simply by utilizing wave energy as its driving power recently many studies have been performed on practical applications of oceanic scientific exploration by a wusv where the estimation criterion of the navigation performance of the wusv is always its sailing velocity although this method is very intuitive but not effective in analyzing the shortcomings in the design of the wusv on this basis a new estimation method which focuses on the efficiency of utilizing wave energy by the wusv is proposed in this paper the theoretical contribution of this paper is that a generalized solution function for the efficiency of utilizing wave energy is obtained and is expressed in the form of the product of several non dimensional parameters in detail algorithms to calculate input power i e wave energy harvested by the surface float and usable power i e the product of sailing velocity and thrust force have been developed the other development presented in this paper is the proposal of some effective ways to improve the ability of the wusv to utilize wave energy then numerical simulations are carried out to validate the proposed method and corresponding experiments are employed to investigate the performance of the method the results show that the four major factors to impact the ability of the wusv utilize wave energy are the thrust force of the propulsor the sailing velocity of the wusv the principal dimensions of structures and the wave environment parameters summarizing the analysis in numerical validations and experimental studies the wusv can generally achieve higher efficiency in utilizing wave energy when it sails in a specific wave environment with certain parameters meanwhile the utilization efficiency of the wusv is not always much higher and the reasons for this phenomenon mainly include two aspects 1 most of the wave energy harvested by the surface float is used to work against the calm water resistance of the propulsor and the umbilical cable and 2 based on the current design the motions of the surface float cannot fully respond to the waves therefore an integrated optimizing design for the propulsive and resistance performance of the propulsor as well as the motion response and resistance performance of the float will be an effective way to improve the ability of the wusv to utilize wave energy in addition the differences in the sailing velocity and heaving amplitude of foils cause different curve trends for the utilizing efficiency between numerical simulations and experiments keywords wave driven unmanned surface vehicle wave energy utilizing efficiency cfd hydrodynamic experiment 1 introduction currently as global land resources are becoming exhausted and the pressure of greenhouse gas emissions is rising humans are paying much more attention to the ocean which has a vast area and stores abundant marine resources and renewable energy magagna and uihlein 2015 in recent years marine scientific surveys and ocean resource exploration are attracting more and more interest from many countries f s liu et al 2017 as a result various forms of marine vehicles and platforms have been developed where the unmanned surface vehicle usv has been one of the hot issues in research because of its excellent environmental adaptability in oceans z x liu et al 2016c unfortunately the conventional usv has limited loads and lower endurance as the usv generally uses oil or batteries as the power source in addition this scheme is much more likely to cause pollution of the marine environment therefore many researchers have actively developed new types of usvs that are driven by renewable clean energy such as solar energy wind energy and wave energy khare and singh 2012 f liu et al 2016a the wave driven unmanned surface vehicle wusv is powered only by wave energy and has advantages of a long operating period for long voyages better mobility and flexibility greater environmental friendliness and a lack of pollution all weather operation etc manley and willcox 2010 many researchers have widely studied the application performance of the wusv to measure the ocean surface height in different areas maqueda et al 2016 2017 installed a geodetic gps receiver on a wusv and combined it with the global navigation satellite system gnss then they demonstrated that this method is capable of mapping geoid heights and performed measurements in the northwestern north sea near great britain with sea states between 1 0 0 1 m wave heights and 5 2 5 4 m wave heights greene et al 2014 developed a new technology for the wusv to collect multi frequency split beam acoustic fish data sets their methods can provide better information for fishermen to reduce the likelihood of overfishing meanwhile these improved observational capabilities would also enable scientists to monitor the responses of different fish stocks more closely to investigate climate variability and change as well as ocean acidification based on the previous research manley and hine 2011 2016 deployed towed instruments behind a wusv to satisfy the need for observation at different ocean depths and this scheme has supported numerous applications including fisheries research and geophysical research goebel goebel et al 2014 combined a wusv and satellite platforms using a fluorometer to measure chlorophyll to investigate the phytoplankton biomass across the pacific ocean for 15 months seegers et al 2017 used an underwater glider a wusv an autonomous underwater vehicle auv and a satellite to make up an observation network to acquire high spatial and temporal coverage of physical and chemical parameters before during and after the wastewater diversion near the outfalls however some researchers have also carried on studying the operation performance of the wusv bingham et al 2012 realized real time prediction and control on the movements of a wusv by building up its six degrees of freedom dynamic model smith et al 2011 forecast the velocity of a wusv in different wave environments by adopting a linear regression model as the wusv speed is not directly controllable ngo et al 2014 created an effective method of gaussian process models to predict the speed of a wusv by observable environmental parameters and then they carried out the experiments to verify the feasibility and accuracy of this method tian et al 2014 proposed a preliminary way to calculate the working efficiency of their simplified wusv model under different simulated sea states in a towing tank taking the tandem foil propulsor of the wusv as the object p liu et al 2016b studied its propulsive performance with different parameters by numerical and experimental methods liu and co workers also proposed an optimum design direction joe et al 2017a b designed a wave energy converter wec for mooring less sensor buoys based on the operation mechanism of the wusv and he then discussed the optimal design parameters and efficiency of the wec summarizing the above studies on wusvs most researchers focused on the performance of the application in its survey work by carrying various sensors or aspects of its navigational performance such as speed thrust force working efficiency etc under different operating conditions however fewer studies have been conducted regarding the ability of the wusv to utilize wave energy and this parameter will be directly related to the working ability of the wusv over a long period of operation on a voyage as well as to the optimum design of molded lines and structure for the wusv therefore the wave energy utilizing efficiency weue has an important impact on the overall performance of the wusv in this paper based on the previous studies we will analyze the results of numerical simulations and experiments and then we will propose the theoretical and experimental methods for solving the weue for the wusv lastly the main factors impacting the weue will be discussed and the optimum directions for future wusv design will be put forward 2 operational mechanism of the wusv the wusv is composed of a surface float an underwater tandem foil propulsor tfp and an umbilical cable that connects the previous two parts when sailing on the sea driven by the surrounding wave motions the surface float will heave and pitch its movements will be transferred to the tfp by the umbilical cable then passed through by vertical direction flows each foil of the tfp arranged in tandem will pitch around its rotational center axis that is usually located at its leading edge therefore driven by the motions of wave and float every foil of the tfp will do heaving and pitching movements periodically in rectangular geodetic coordinates and generate thrust force certainly this force will be passed back to the surface float and cause the wusv to sail forward at last the above process can be simply expressed by 2d sketch of wusv and wave in fig 1 in which Œª h and a denote the wave length wave height and wave amplitude respectively and h 2a l is the length of the surface float and c 0 and s 0 are the chord and span length of each foil in the tfp respectively f l represents the lift force on the foil of tfp as the float constantly encounter a variety of waves wusv can accomplish long periods of voyage navigation without any pollution by harvesting wave energy and transforming this wave energy to its kinetic energy 3 function of wave energy utilizing efficiency as stated above the surface float is used mainly to harvest the wave energy and tfp converts this energy to the kinetic energy of the wusv when analyzing weue we ignore the energy loss in the process of the float responding to wave motions and passing the heaving movement to tfp weue can obviously be achieved from usable power divided by input power in this paper we take total wave energy within a certain range of the flow field that the float passes through in a unit of time as the input power meanwhile the product of thrust force for tfp and sailing speed for the wusv is used as usable power however two challenges will be confronted during the above implementation the first is that input power i e the wave energy harvested by the float is not easy to obtain because the scales of the wave flow field domain that wusv passes through in unit time cannot be calculated correctly by only considering only its sailing velocity the second challenge is how to calculate the usable power because we can only obtain a non dimensional thrust coefficient in numerical simulations or measure sailing speed in experimental simulations 3 1 preliminaries energy of a regular wave to calculate the input power p in we should first know the wave energy in fluid domain units according to the wave theory in hydromechanics the total energy of the waves includes two parts kinetic energy and potential energy in this paper we considered that the wusv sailed in a regular wave environment with infinite water depth therefore the kinetic energy t w of regular waves in the fluid domain œÑ with scales of unit width and one wavelength can be expressed as follows 1 t w œÅ 2 œÜ 2 d œÑ œÅ 2 œÜ œÜ n d s œÅ 2 œÜ œÜ n d l where œÅ is the density of the fluid œÜ is the velocity potential of the traveling wave in an unlimited flow field s is the surface area of the fluid domain n is the unit external normal line of s and l is the perimeter of the fluid domain based on the periodicity of the waves boundary conditions of the fluid domain and the small amplitude wave hypothesis with scales of unit width t w can be simplified as follows 2 t w œÅ 2 0 Œª œÜ œÜ n z 0 d x where the z direction represents the water depth direction and z 0 is the balance position of the wave plane the x direction represents the direction of propagation of the wave we take the calm state of the fluid domain as zero potential energy and then the potential energy increment v w of waves in the above fluid domain can be expressed as follows 3 v w 0 Œª d x Œæ œÅ g z d z 0 œÅ g z d z 0 Œª d x 0 Œæ œÅ g z d z 1 2 œÅ g 0 Œª Œæ 2 d x where Œæ is the wave plane position and can be captured accurately by the equation of the wave the regular wave velocity potential equation and wave equation in an infinite flow field can be defined as follows 4 œÜ a g w e k z sin k x w t 5 Œæ a cos k x w t where w is the circular frequency of the simple harmonic motion of the wave k is the wave number and k 2œÄ Œª next we substitute equations 4 and 5 into equations 2 and 3 to obtain 6 t w v w 1 4 œÅ g a 2 Œª therefore the total energy e of a regular wave with unit width and one wavelength in an unlimited flow field can be written as follows 7 e t w v w 1 2 œÅ g a 2 Œª 3 2 function of input power usable power and utilizing efficiency the average energy of a regular wave with unit length can be deduced from equation 7 8 e 0 e Œª 1 2 œÅ g a 2 e 0 can be treated as the total energy in a unit wave flow field domain and then the key issue for calculating input power is how to confirm the range of the wave domain that the wusv passes through in a unit of time assuming sailing in head regular waves the wave energy that the wusv experiences in a unit of time can be given as follows 9 e w e 0 v c g b where v means the sailing velocity of wusv b is the molded breadth of the float waterline plane c g is the group velocity of the wave that is the transferring velocity of wave energy passing through a certain vertical plane in space and c g equals half of the wave velocity c i e 10 c g c 2 1 2 g k 1 2 g Œª 2 œÄ we have already obtained the input power p in of the wusv in equation 9 according to the meaning of e w in physics that is p in e w to calculate usable power p u we should consider the important issue of how to deduce the solving function of usable power from different simulation output results because thrust and lift force coefficients of every foil will be obtained from numerical simulation and the sailing speed of the wusv from experimental simulation therefore once the corresponding force coefficient has been obtained p u can be calculated as follows 11 p u n f t v 1 2 n c t œÅ v 3 c 0 s 0 where n is the quantity of foils that deployed in the tfp and f t is the average value of the thrust force of n foils averaged in one motion cycle c t represents the corresponding average thrust coefficient and can be calculated via 12 c t i 1 n c t i n i 1 n f t i n œÅ v 2 c 0 s 0 2 where c ti is the average thrust coefficient of no i foil in one motion period and f ti is its corresponding average thrust force that is 13 f t i 1 t f 0 t f f i t d t where f i t is the instantaneous thrust force of no i foil and t f is the motion period of the foils for convenience of analysis a non dimensional coefficient such as c ti is usually needed and solved in numerical simulations therefore in this situation weue of wusv Œ∑ can be deduced from equations 9 11 14 Œ∑ p u e w n c t œÅ v 3 c 0 s 0 2 e 0 v c g b n c t v 3 c 0 s 0 g a 2 v c g b n c t 2 œÄ v v c 2 v c 2 c 0 s 0 b a Œª a then equation 14 can be simplified as a non dimensional form and yields the following expression 15 Œ∑ n c t œÄ k v 3 2 k v 1 k s k w where k v is the non dimensional velocity k s is the non dimensional shape coefficient of the wusv and k w is the non dimensional shape coefficient of the wave and is also the reciprocal of the wave steepness 16 k v v c k s s 0 c 0 b a k w Œª a every part in equation 15 has a clear physical meaning and we can obviously see that there are four main factors affecting the weue of the wusv the thrust force of the tfp the sailing velocity the scales of the wusv and the current wave parameters among these improving the velocity of wusv promoting the propulsive performance of tfp and increasing the projected area of the foils can all benefit in improving the utilizing wave energy ability of wusv in a certain wave environment however c t or f t must have been calculated previously and then Œ∑ can be obtained by employing eq 15 however in practical operation such as in freedom sailing experiments the thrust force of tfp is difficult to measure and only one useful parameter in eq 15 the sailing speed of wusv can be obtained if we can measure the average speed of wusv in a variety of wave environments we can also believe that the average thrust force of tfp is always equal to the average drag force of wusv in one cycle thus we can measure or calculate total resistance of wusv in waves instead of in thrust force c t or f t in eq 15 and then Œ∑ is inferred however as a wave has characteristics of randomness and complexity it is difficult to calculate the added resistance of wusv in waves directly by a theoretical method therefore another challenge must be confronted how to update eq 15 to calculate Œ∑ in these situations in this paper a reserve power method was adopted to solve the above problem and we use this power to consider the effect of waves for wusv instead of calculating the added wave resistance in other words if we want wusv to maintain the same sailing speed in waves as in calm water we must add extra power p e on the basis of power consumed in calm water to compensate for the influence of added resistance in the waves then p e can be calculated by the following equation sheng and liu 2003 17 p e 4 594 2 h 0 152 2 c b l b b where h is the wave height c b is the block coefficient of the surface float and c b lbt where is the displacement of the float then the usable power of wusv p u in eq 11 can be redefined as follows 18 p u p e p s where p s is the usable power of wusv in calm water with the same velocity as in the waves and can be calculated as follows 19 p s r t v v where r tv is the equivalent calm water resistance i e the resistance of wusv with sailing velocity v in calm water and this parameter means other additional experiments need to be performed to measure this calm water resistance with different velocities then we can obtain the weue of the wusv Œ∑ again from equations 9 and 18 20 Œ∑ p u e w p e r t v v e w 4 experimental study of weue function 4 1 experimental prototype of wusv after optimum design of the molded lines and structure we finished the 3d model scheme of the wusv in which the surface float adopted a flat and fat shape then we built the experimental prototype of the wusv according to the above designed scheme the principal dimensions of the float were set as ship length l 2 m molded breadth b 0 6 m molded depth h 0 25 m and designed draft t h 0 15 m as shown in fig 2 a then according to the principal dimensions of the float we can calculate the displacement of the float 0 086 m3 and block coefficient of float c b 0 478 mentioned in eq 17 meanwhile tfp was made up of six of the same foils with chord length c 0 0 16 m and span length s 0 1 08 m and their airfoil profile was naca0012 the foils were arranged in tandem and the distance between two adjacent foils was designed to be l 0 08 m 0 5c 0 every foil has two stoppers to limit its oscillating angle amplitude Œ∏ 0 15 moreover both ends of each foil in the span direction adopt circular bead transitions to slow down the flow field sudden change the experimental prototype of tfp is shown in fig 2 b 4 2 experimental setting and conditions two types of experiments for the wusv were carried out in the towing tank the experiments were a resistance experiment in calm water and a freedom sailing experiment in regular waves as shown in fig 3 a and b respectively the scales of the tank are length width depth 108 m 7 m 3 5 m a push plate wave maker is set at the end of the tank and it can generate regular waves with a wave height of 0 0 4 m and wave period 0 4 4 s we can measure the calm water resistance of the wusv and the single float with different towing velocities in calm water from the resistance experiment and the average velocity of wusv in regular waves from the freedom sailing experiment as discussed in section 3 2 when analyzing the weue of the wusv in experiments we need to know in unit time the wave energy that wusv harvests and transfers to its kinetic energy as well as the total wave energy passed through by wusv that is the usable power and input power of the wusv however the input power can also be calculated by equation 9 and the usable power should be solved by following the process according to eqs 17 19 4 3 experimental data in the following work we measured the resistance of the wusv with different towing speeds v in calm water first as shown in fig 4 in which exp wusv and exp float indicate measured calm water resistance of the wusv and the single float respectively while cal float means that theoretically calm water resistance calculated based on the equivalent plank theory with the same conditions from fig 4 the single float resistance results from theoretical and experimental methods have an excellent agreement with each other which validates our experiments in addition the resistance of the wusv is obviously much higher than the resistance of the single float with certain towing speeds resistance of the float occupies only 10 of the resistance of the wusv most usable power achieved by the tfp is used to work against the resistance of the tfp and the umbilical cable then we carried out the freedom sailing experiments of the wusv in regular head waves and measured its velocity v with different wave heights and wave lengths as shown in fig 5 fig 5 demonstrates the sailing velocity ascending first and then descending with increasing wave length and amplitude it does not always achieve higher sailing velocity with smaller wave length or larger wave amplitude in practical operation although tfp can provide larger thrust force based on later numerical simulations in section 5 the reason for this phenomenon will be analyzed together with other in section 6 4 4 experimental results and analysis after measuring r t and v in figs 4 and 5 we interpolate the calm water resistance curve of wusv in fig 4 by sailing velocity v and then we obtain the equivalent calm water resistance r tv of the wusv at the same velocity v in the waves as shown in fig 6 r tv can also be treated as the calm water resistance part of the total drag force for the wusv when it sailing in the waves from fig 12 a r tv ascends first and then descends with increasing wave length under certain wave amplitudes however the wave length corresponding to the peak value of r tv is not fixed with a different wave amplitude in which the maximum value of r tv is 5 46 n when a 0 07 m corresponding to Œª 7 m and 5 29 n when a 0 09 m corresponding to Œª 9 m then we can infer that the maximum calm water resistance of the wusv usually appears in the situation of Œª 100 a when the wave amplitude is decided similarly in fig 6 b r tv also presents an inverted u shape trend with increasing wave amplitude with a certain wave length in this figure the maximum value of r tv appears at a 0 08 m and this characteristic is not same as that in fig 6 a in addition from fig 6 b the peak value of r tv is 5 77 n when Œª 6 m and r tv increases slightly when a 0 09 m meanwhile r tv can reach 6 45 n when Œª 7 m with measured sailing velocity v and calculated resistance r tv the equivalent usable power of the wusv in calm water p s and reserving power p e can be solved according to eqs 19 and 17 with different wave conditions then the usable power of the wusv in waves p u can be obtained by employing eq 18 and its trends are shown in fig 7 the varying trends of usable power p u for wusv with different wave parameters in fig 7 are obviously very similar to the sailing velocity v trends in fig 5 as well as the resistance r tv trends in fig 6 under the same conditions therefore we can infer that the sailing velocity of the wusv could directly reflect its wave energy harvesting ability moreover p e occupies no more than 10 of p u which means that most of the wave energy harvested by the wusv is used to work against its calm water resistance therefore if we want to improve the navigation performance of the wusv the optimum design of the molded lines of the tfp and float may be the recommended way to decrease its calm water resistance on the precondition of the float maintaining enough response to the waves after the input power e w is calculated by eq 9 the weue of the wusv Œ∑ in the above freedom sailing experiments can be solved by employing eq 20 and its trends with different wave parameters are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 a Œ∑ ascends first and then descends with increasing wave length when a 0 07 m and a 0 09 m the maximum values of Œ∑ appear at wave lengths Œª 7 m and Œª 9 m respectively this character is like the character of calm water resistance r tv and usable power p u of the wusv however in varying tendencies Œ∑ changes more smoothly and not significantly with larger wave amplitude the reasons for the above can be inferred from eqs 1 and 8 10 8 20 and figs 5 a and 7 a from fig 5 a and eq 19 p u can be simplified as proportional to the sailing velocity v of the wusv and then by substituting eqs 8 and 9 into eq 20 and simplifying we can get Œ∑ in experiments proportional to a 2 and c g v respectively later according to eq 10 and fig 5 a c g is also proportional to Œª 1 2 therefore c g v descends first and then ascends with increasing wave length and causes Œ∑ in experiments showing the above trends under certain wave amplitudes as well as its trends tending to change smoothly as seen in fig 8 b Œ∑ in experiments generally descends with increasing wave amplitude and this trend is different from the trend of r tv and p u except all of them can get the maximum value at a 0 08 m therefore combined with fig 8 a the sailing velocity v in the real sea of wusv can partly reflect its ability to harvest wave energy and transfer to usable power efficiency the reason for curve trends in fig 8 b can be explained by eqs 8 10 figs 5 b and 7 b from fig 7 b p u is proportional to the sailing velocity v and c g remains constant with a certain wave length according to eq 10 then we can infer that c g v descends first and then ascends with increasing wave amplitude according to fig 5 b at last based on eqs 8 and 9 a 2 and c g v as part of the denominator ascend and descend with increasing wave amplitude respectively when a 0 08 m therefore under these conditions changes in experimental Œ∑ are not obvious in fig 8 b similarly a 2 and c g v all ascend with increasing wave amplitude when a 0 08 m as a result Œ∑ descends more rapidly in this situation 5 numerical validation of the weue function generally c t in eq 15 or f t is usually obtained by numerical simulations such as the computational fluid dynamics cfd method the potential flow theory method etc in this paper we take a numerical result from common fluent software based on cfd as an example to modify the validation of the above weue function actually according to liu et al p liu et al 2016b we have discussed a method to calculate the thrust force of tfp and analyze its propulsive efficiency which represents the ability of tfp to convert the input power introduced by the umbilical cable into the usable power this input power is different from e w in eqs 14 and 20 which is obtained by the float from the waves the former acting on tfp and the latter e w on the surface float 5 1 computational domain and boundary conditions in the above numerical example tfp was simplified as six 2d foils deployed in tandem because every foil had a large aspect ratio then we assumed the foils operated in an infinite flow field as the length of wusv umbilical cable is 6 m and in following numerical simulations all setting wave length was smaller than 12 m that is it could ignore the influence of the surface waves because the flow field is affected by the surface waves only if depth is less than roughly half a wavelength yan and ellingsena 2016 correspondingly the gravity of tfp was also not considered meanwhile an inflow with constant velocity was employed to replace the forward average velocity of the tfp then a side view of the tfp model coordinate system all boundary conditions and scales of the whole computational domain are shown in fig 9 in fig 9 the distances between each foil and upper and lower boundary are all equal to eight times the chord length of the foil so we define these two boundary wall conditions because we have modified this distance far enough that these boundary definitions have no influence on the flow field near the foils in addition the distance between the water inlet boundary and the leading edge of the left first foil is eight times the chord length and between the outflow boundary and the trailing edge of the first right foil is fifteen times the chord length because a longer wake domain can make the vortex of the tfp develop more fully 5 2 simulation setting and motions of foils as mentioned above the flow field around the tfp is simulated by the fluent software with the pressure based transient solver and second order upwind spatial discretization the second order implicit discretization is employed for the time stepping scheme and the no slip wall boundary condition is used on the foil surface in simulations the user defined function udf is adopted to realize the designed periodic movements of tfp foils by secondary development of cfd software the foils of tfp will do coupled heaving and pitching motions when the surface float encounters wave peaks or valleys and then do a heaving motion during other times in the wave period then instantaneous movements in heave and pitch directions of every foil in one period can be expressed as eq 21 and shown in fig 10 where y 0 and Œ∏ 0 are the amplitude of heaving and pitching motions respectively t f means the motion period of foil and in this numerical simulation t f is assumed to be equal to the wave period and the moving process of every foil is assumed to follow the same rule one can find other details about these motions in the study by liu p liu et al 2016b 21 y t y 0 cos 2 œÄ f t Œ∏ t Œ∏ 0 sin 8 œÄ f t 0 t t f 16 y t y 0 cos 2 œÄ f t Œ∏ t

15 t f 16 t t f 5 3 mesh and sensitivity test to adapt the deforming and reconstructing of the mesh during the movements of each foil unstructured grids were employed to divide the computational domain of the tfp moreover mesh near the foils has been artificially densified to improve the solving accuracy and capture the evolution of the flow field as shown in fig 11 meanwhile tfp has n 6 foils arranged in tandem as its prototype and the distance between two adjacent foils is half of the chord length c 0 before validation we performed comprehensive studies to assess the sensitivity of the numerical solution to the grid and time step size a grid sensitivity study was conducted using three meshes including 46 000 coarse 92 000 nominal and 184 000 fine elements and a time step size Œ¥t t f 200 the test is carried out with Œ∏ 0 15 t f 1 2 s and y 0 c 0 0 5 1 5 to correspond to a later experimental study in numerical simulations we take c 0 0 16 m s 0 1 08 m and b 0 6 m while the distance between two adjacent foils is l 0 08 m 0 5c 0 the variations in the thrust force coefficient c t with y 0 for three different grids are shown in fig 12 a it can be seen that both the nominal and fine meshes generate the reasonable simulation results that are quite close to each other while the coarse mesh cannot resolve the flow well especially when y 0 c 0 1 therefore the computed results based on the nominal grid are insensitive to further refinement of the grid size a sensitivity study on Œ¥t was also carried out using the nominal grid and three different time step sizes of t f 100 t f 200 and t f 400 the resulting plot is shown in fig 12 b where Œ¥t t f 200 proves to be suitable consequently the setup with the nominal grid and the time step size of t f 200 allows a satisfactory computation 6 results and discussion after the above setting the thrust force coefficient of tfp was solved with different regular wave parameters as shown in fig 13 where the longitudinal coordinate in these figures is the thrust force coefficient of tfp that is six times c t while the horizontal coordinate is the wave length and amplitude as mentioned above tfp is assumed to be operating in infinite flow domain so the surface wave cannot impact the movements of the foils however we have also assumed that the wusv can completely respond to the wave so the motion period of the foils is equal to the motion period of the wave and the heaving amplitude of the foils is equal to the wave amplitude based on the dispersion relationship of the regular wave the wave period is decided by its wave length therefore in these numerical simulations wave length and amplitude are used directly as horizontal coordinates for facilitating further analysis from fig 13 a the thrust force coefficient descends with increasing wave length in an arbitrary wave amplitude and from fig 13 b this coefficient monotonically ascends with increasing wave amplitude in an arbitrary wave length actually it is obvious that the thrust force coefficient will be less than zero in some situations such as Œª 5 7 m at a 0 05 m in fig 13 a and the reason for these negative value appearing is that in the numerical simulations as the inflow velocity keeping constant foils can not generate thrust force under above conditions in other words the component of fluid forces operating on tfp in its forward direction will smaller than that in negative direction at this time and result in fluid resistance on tfp then the main reason for the trends of curves in fig 13 is that the thrust force of tfp is decided by the current wave environment which means that this thrust force is proportional to the moving speed of the foils relative to the fluid therefore based on the above the tfp will have a longer motion period with long wave length which means that the moving speed of the foils becomes slower when the wave amplitude remains constant similarly larger wave heights cause a larger heaving amplitude of the foils so the moving speed is quicker with a fixed motion period consequently tfp generates a lower thrust force with longer wave length or smaller wave amplitude according to eq 11 usable power p u of tfp calculated versus wave length and amplitude is shown in fig 14 fig 14 shows that shorter wave length or larger wave amplitude could make tfp achieve higher usable power actually the trends of the curves in fig 14 a and b are very similar to those in fig 13 a and b because inflow velocity remains constant in this numerical simulation in addition when Œª 5 7 m at a 0 05 m in fig 14 a and a 0 05 m at Œª 7 97 m and 8 98 m usable power is less than zero these situations just mean that tfp cannot transfer input power to usable power and correspond to the negative thrust force coefficient in fig 13 and these negative usable powers in fig 14 do not have an exact physical meaning then based on results in figs 13 and 14 combined with eqs 14 and 15 weue can be solved with different wave parameters as shown in fig 15 as seen in fig 15 a the weue of wusv Œ∑ descends with increasing wave length under a certain wave amplitude and the rate of descent of Œ∑ becomes slower with longer wave length in addition Œ∑ 0 when Œª 6 m at a 0 05 m so the wusv cannot harvest wave energy effectively and this phenomenon corresponds to the negative value of the thrust force coefficient and usable power with the same situation in figs 13 a and fig 14 a respectively from fig 15 b Œ∑ ascends with increasing wave amplitude under certain wave lengths and its ascending rate also slows down with the larger wave amplitude the situations i e Œ∑ 0 appears in fig 15 will not appear in nature and do not have physical meanings these negative efficiencies are just for corresponding to the negative thrust force coefficient in fig 13 and negative usable power in fig 14 summarizing fig 15 weue can obtain a higher value under the smaller k w of eq 15 and Œ∑ 10 when k w 100 qualitatively summarizing figs 8 and 15 the weue of the wusv is not higher in most situations and the main factors for this phenomenon can be deduced from eqs 14 20 compared with wave group velocity c g the sailing velocity of the wusv is relatively smaller so the input power e w as the denominator in eqs 14 and 20 can be treated as remaining constant with fixed wave parameters thus the thrust force of the tfp and sailing velocity of the wusv should be the main factors to decide the harvesting wave energy ability of the wusv among them the thrust force of the tfp can be promoted by improving the response of the float to the waves and the propulsive performance of the foils meanwhile increasing velocity should take decreasing the resistance of the wusv in the waves into consideration as seen in fig 4 the calm water resistance of the tfp and the umbilical cable takes the major part of the total for the wusv therefore with the precondition of maintaining better propulsive performance for the tfp optimum design of its molded lines and structures should be an effective way to decrease resistance in addition the surface float plays a role of motivating the response to waves and harvesting wave energy as well as a role of obstruction therefore we should take the integrated optimizing design on the surface float carefully to obtain the best navigation performance of wusv 7 discussion of weue difference theoretically the thrust force generated by the tfp should be equal to the fluid resistance of the wusv in waves therefore thrust and resistance should also have the same changing regulation with different wave parameters however comparing figs 6 and 13 the trends of thrust force ascend or descend monotonically with the corresponding wave parameters in fig 13 from numerical validations but the trends of fluid resistance ascend first and then descend with corresponding wave parameters in fig 6 from experimental studies the reasons for the above phenomenon include the two main following aspects first in numerical validations controlling the variate method is adopted in other words only one variable wave length or wave amplitude is involved in fig 13 when we discuss the effects of wave parameters on the thrust force of the tfp while the inflow velocity always remains constant however in experimental studies the wusv is in the state of freedom sailing in the waves so its velocity is determined by the wave environment then its average velocity will be a variable with different wave parameters as shown in fig 5 thus the factors causing the trends in fig 6 include not only wave parameters but also the sailing velocity of the wusv second we assumed that the float and tfp could completely respond to waves in numerical validations which means that the motion period and heaving amplitude of foils are equal to the period and amplitude of regular waves nevertheless we consider the heaving amplitude of foils should be smaller than the corresponding wave amplitude in experiments as the surface float of wusv can not response to waves completely then we recorded the movements of the float to modify this opinion as shown in fig 16 in fig 16 a heave amp at a 0 07 m means the heave amplitude of float versus wave length at wave amplitude a 0 07 m and the dotted line setting wave amp a 0 07 m means the surrounding wave amplitude is set as 0 07 m in experiments and the similar meanings in fig 16 b in fig 16 a with increasing wave length under a certain wave amplitude the heaving amplitude of the float ascends monotonically while the difference between the float and the wave amplitude setting becomes smaller and smaller as seen in fig 16 b the heaving amplitude of the float also ascends with increasing wave amplitude under certain wave lengths but the difference still exists and further ascends monotonically with increasing wave amplitude the reasons for the above trends in fig 16 can be explained by the certain response time that is needed for the float to adapt to wave movements as a result the response of the float is fuller with longer wave periods or wave lengths and the heaving amplitude of the float is much closer to the corresponding wave amplitude similarly keeping the wave length constant and increasing the wave amplitude the surface float of the wusv must enter the next motion circle despite incompletely responding to the wave movements because the motion period of the float has also been decided then a larger wave amplitude makes a considerable difference between the heaving amplitude of the tfp foils and the wave amplitude therefore the difference between the hypothesized movement amplitude of the foils and the real value is not a negligible factor for the different trends of thrust force in numerical validations and resistance in experimental studies among the reasons for the curving trends in figs 6 and 13 the difference in the sailing velocity is the most significant and the difference in the heaving amplitude for the foils is secondary at the same time the loss of wave energy when the float passes the heaving movements to the tfp by the umbilical cable also has a certain influence on the generation of the thrust force 8 conclusions in this paper we took a newly developed wave driven unmanned surface vehicle as the investigated object and a method was proposed to estimate its efficiency for utilizing wave energy to validate this method based on cfd principles the propulsive performance of tfp was studied by numerical simulations while some experiments were employed to test this method then their results and difference were analyzed in detail in this estimation method two important issues were solved 1 in functions of input power how to decide the area of the domain so that total wave energy in it can be defined as input power and 2 we focused on how to obtain usable power from different parameters such as the thrust force coefficient in numerical simulations or the sailing velocity in experimental simulations then in numerical validation by assuming the heaving amplitude of tfp was equal to the wave amplitude we found that the thrust force coefficient and usable power of the tfp and the wave energy utilizing efficiency of the wusv all descended with increasing wave length and ascended with increasing wave amplitude meanwhile considering the effects of the waves on resistance by reserving power we found that the equivalent calm water resistance usable power and wave energy utilizing efficiency of the wusv all generally ascended first and then descended with increasing wave length and amplitude in the experimental studies in addition under certain wave amplitudes the maximum value of the above parameters in experiments appears in the situation with wave lengths approximately equal to 100 times the wave amplitude differences in sailing velocity and motion responses may be the main reasons for the different trends of the two results obtained from numerical simulations and experiments respectively based on analysis results the lower thrust force of the tfp and the sailing velocity of the wusv should be responsible for lower wave energy utilizing efficiency in the future the optimum design of the float and the tfp molded lines is recommended to improve the navigation performance of the wusv we should focus mainly on the optimal scheme to improve the response of the surface float to the waves and decrease the sailing resistance of the wusv in the sea acknowledgements the authors wish to

23213,a wave driven unmanned surface vehicle wusv can sail on the sea simply by utilizing wave energy as its driving power recently many studies have been performed on practical applications of oceanic scientific exploration by a wusv where the estimation criterion of the navigation performance of the wusv is always its sailing velocity although this method is very intuitive but not effective in analyzing the shortcomings in the design of the wusv on this basis a new estimation method which focuses on the efficiency of utilizing wave energy by the wusv is proposed in this paper the theoretical contribution of this paper is that a generalized solution function for the efficiency of utilizing wave energy is obtained and is expressed in the form of the product of several non dimensional parameters in detail algorithms to calculate input power i e wave energy harvested by the surface float and usable power i e the product of sailing velocity and thrust force have been developed the other development presented in this paper is the proposal of some effective ways to improve the ability of the wusv to utilize wave energy then numerical simulations are carried out to validate the proposed method and corresponding experiments are employed to investigate the performance of the method the results show that the four major factors to impact the ability of the wusv utilize wave energy are the thrust force of the propulsor the sailing velocity of the wusv the principal dimensions of structures and the wave environment parameters summarizing the analysis in numerical validations and experimental studies the wusv can generally achieve higher efficiency in utilizing wave energy when it sails in a specific wave environment with certain parameters meanwhile the utilization efficiency of the wusv is not always much higher and the reasons for this phenomenon mainly include two aspects 1 most of the wave energy harvested by the surface float is used to work against the calm water resistance of the propulsor and the umbilical cable and 2 based on the current design the motions of the surface float cannot fully respond to the waves therefore an integrated optimizing design for the propulsive and resistance performance of the propulsor as well as the motion response and resistance performance of the float will be an effective way to improve the ability of the wusv to utilize wave energy in addition the differences in the sailing velocity and heaving amplitude of foils cause different curve trends for the utilizing efficiency between numerical simulations and experiments keywords wave driven unmanned surface vehicle wave energy utilizing efficiency cfd hydrodynamic experiment 1 introduction currently as global land resources are becoming exhausted and the pressure of greenhouse gas emissions is rising humans are paying much more attention to the ocean which has a vast area and stores abundant marine resources and renewable energy magagna and uihlein 2015 in recent years marine scientific surveys and ocean resource exploration are attracting more and more interest from many countries f s liu et al 2017 as a result various forms of marine vehicles and platforms have been developed where the unmanned surface vehicle usv has been one of the hot issues in research because of its excellent environmental adaptability in oceans z x liu et al 2016c unfortunately the conventional usv has limited loads and lower endurance as the usv generally uses oil or batteries as the power source in addition this scheme is much more likely to cause pollution of the marine environment therefore many researchers have actively developed new types of usvs that are driven by renewable clean energy such as solar energy wind energy and wave energy khare and singh 2012 f liu et al 2016a the wave driven unmanned surface vehicle wusv is powered only by wave energy and has advantages of a long operating period for long voyages better mobility and flexibility greater environmental friendliness and a lack of pollution all weather operation etc manley and willcox 2010 many researchers have widely studied the application performance of the wusv to measure the ocean surface height in different areas maqueda et al 2016 2017 installed a geodetic gps receiver on a wusv and combined it with the global navigation satellite system gnss then they demonstrated that this method is capable of mapping geoid heights and performed measurements in the northwestern north sea near great britain with sea states between 1 0 0 1 m wave heights and 5 2 5 4 m wave heights greene et al 2014 developed a new technology for the wusv to collect multi frequency split beam acoustic fish data sets their methods can provide better information for fishermen to reduce the likelihood of overfishing meanwhile these improved observational capabilities would also enable scientists to monitor the responses of different fish stocks more closely to investigate climate variability and change as well as ocean acidification based on the previous research manley and hine 2011 2016 deployed towed instruments behind a wusv to satisfy the need for observation at different ocean depths and this scheme has supported numerous applications including fisheries research and geophysical research goebel goebel et al 2014 combined a wusv and satellite platforms using a fluorometer to measure chlorophyll to investigate the phytoplankton biomass across the pacific ocean for 15 months seegers et al 2017 used an underwater glider a wusv an autonomous underwater vehicle auv and a satellite to make up an observation network to acquire high spatial and temporal coverage of physical and chemical parameters before during and after the wastewater diversion near the outfalls however some researchers have also carried on studying the operation performance of the wusv bingham et al 2012 realized real time prediction and control on the movements of a wusv by building up its six degrees of freedom dynamic model smith et al 2011 forecast the velocity of a wusv in different wave environments by adopting a linear regression model as the wusv speed is not directly controllable ngo et al 2014 created an effective method of gaussian process models to predict the speed of a wusv by observable environmental parameters and then they carried out the experiments to verify the feasibility and accuracy of this method tian et al 2014 proposed a preliminary way to calculate the working efficiency of their simplified wusv model under different simulated sea states in a towing tank taking the tandem foil propulsor of the wusv as the object p liu et al 2016b studied its propulsive performance with different parameters by numerical and experimental methods liu and co workers also proposed an optimum design direction joe et al 2017a b designed a wave energy converter wec for mooring less sensor buoys based on the operation mechanism of the wusv and he then discussed the optimal design parameters and efficiency of the wec summarizing the above studies on wusvs most researchers focused on the performance of the application in its survey work by carrying various sensors or aspects of its navigational performance such as speed thrust force working efficiency etc under different operating conditions however fewer studies have been conducted regarding the ability of the wusv to utilize wave energy and this parameter will be directly related to the working ability of the wusv over a long period of operation on a voyage as well as to the optimum design of molded lines and structure for the wusv therefore the wave energy utilizing efficiency weue has an important impact on the overall performance of the wusv in this paper based on the previous studies we will analyze the results of numerical simulations and experiments and then we will propose the theoretical and experimental methods for solving the weue for the wusv lastly the main factors impacting the weue will be discussed and the optimum directions for future wusv design will be put forward 2 operational mechanism of the wusv the wusv is composed of a surface float an underwater tandem foil propulsor tfp and an umbilical cable that connects the previous two parts when sailing on the sea driven by the surrounding wave motions the surface float will heave and pitch its movements will be transferred to the tfp by the umbilical cable then passed through by vertical direction flows each foil of the tfp arranged in tandem will pitch around its rotational center axis that is usually located at its leading edge therefore driven by the motions of wave and float every foil of the tfp will do heaving and pitching movements periodically in rectangular geodetic coordinates and generate thrust force certainly this force will be passed back to the surface float and cause the wusv to sail forward at last the above process can be simply expressed by 2d sketch of wusv and wave in fig 1 in which Œª h and a denote the wave length wave height and wave amplitude respectively and h 2a l is the length of the surface float and c 0 and s 0 are the chord and span length of each foil in the tfp respectively f l represents the lift force on the foil of tfp as the float constantly encounter a variety of waves wusv can accomplish long periods of voyage navigation without any pollution by harvesting wave energy and transforming this wave energy to its kinetic energy 3 function of wave energy utilizing efficiency as stated above the surface float is used mainly to harvest the wave energy and tfp converts this energy to the kinetic energy of the wusv when analyzing weue we ignore the energy loss in the process of the float responding to wave motions and passing the heaving movement to tfp weue can obviously be achieved from usable power divided by input power in this paper we take total wave energy within a certain range of the flow field that the float passes through in a unit of time as the input power meanwhile the product of thrust force for tfp and sailing speed for the wusv is used as usable power however two challenges will be confronted during the above implementation the first is that input power i e the wave energy harvested by the float is not easy to obtain because the scales of the wave flow field domain that wusv passes through in unit time cannot be calculated correctly by only considering only its sailing velocity the second challenge is how to calculate the usable power because we can only obtain a non dimensional thrust coefficient in numerical simulations or measure sailing speed in experimental simulations 3 1 preliminaries energy of a regular wave to calculate the input power p in we should first know the wave energy in fluid domain units according to the wave theory in hydromechanics the total energy of the waves includes two parts kinetic energy and potential energy in this paper we considered that the wusv sailed in a regular wave environment with infinite water depth therefore the kinetic energy t w of regular waves in the fluid domain œÑ with scales of unit width and one wavelength can be expressed as follows 1 t w œÅ 2 œÜ 2 d œÑ œÅ 2 œÜ œÜ n d s œÅ 2 œÜ œÜ n d l where œÅ is the density of the fluid œÜ is the velocity potential of the traveling wave in an unlimited flow field s is the surface area of the fluid domain n is the unit external normal line of s and l is the perimeter of the fluid domain based on the periodicity of the waves boundary conditions of the fluid domain and the small amplitude wave hypothesis with scales of unit width t w can be simplified as follows 2 t w œÅ 2 0 Œª œÜ œÜ n z 0 d x where the z direction represents the water depth direction and z 0 is the balance position of the wave plane the x direction represents the direction of propagation of the wave we take the calm state of the fluid domain as zero potential energy and then the potential energy increment v w of waves in the above fluid domain can be expressed as follows 3 v w 0 Œª d x Œæ œÅ g z d z 0 œÅ g z d z 0 Œª d x 0 Œæ œÅ g z d z 1 2 œÅ g 0 Œª Œæ 2 d x where Œæ is the wave plane position and can be captured accurately by the equation of the wave the regular wave velocity potential equation and wave equation in an infinite flow field can be defined as follows 4 œÜ a g w e k z sin k x w t 5 Œæ a cos k x w t where w is the circular frequency of the simple harmonic motion of the wave k is the wave number and k 2œÄ Œª next we substitute equations 4 and 5 into equations 2 and 3 to obtain 6 t w v w 1 4 œÅ g a 2 Œª therefore the total energy e of a regular wave with unit width and one wavelength in an unlimited flow field can be written as follows 7 e t w v w 1 2 œÅ g a 2 Œª 3 2 function of input power usable power and utilizing efficiency the average energy of a regular wave with unit length can be deduced from equation 7 8 e 0 e Œª 1 2 œÅ g a 2 e 0 can be treated as the total energy in a unit wave flow field domain and then the key issue for calculating input power is how to confirm the range of the wave domain that the wusv passes through in a unit of time assuming sailing in head regular waves the wave energy that the wusv experiences in a unit of time can be given as follows 9 e w e 0 v c g b where v means the sailing velocity of wusv b is the molded breadth of the float waterline plane c g is the group velocity of the wave that is the transferring velocity of wave energy passing through a certain vertical plane in space and c g equals half of the wave velocity c i e 10 c g c 2 1 2 g k 1 2 g Œª 2 œÄ we have already obtained the input power p in of the wusv in equation 9 according to the meaning of e w in physics that is p in e w to calculate usable power p u we should consider the important issue of how to deduce the solving function of usable power from different simulation output results because thrust and lift force coefficients of every foil will be obtained from numerical simulation and the sailing speed of the wusv from experimental simulation therefore once the corresponding force coefficient has been obtained p u can be calculated as follows 11 p u n f t v 1 2 n c t œÅ v 3 c 0 s 0 where n is the quantity of foils that deployed in the tfp and f t is the average value of the thrust force of n foils averaged in one motion cycle c t represents the corresponding average thrust coefficient and can be calculated via 12 c t i 1 n c t i n i 1 n f t i n œÅ v 2 c 0 s 0 2 where c ti is the average thrust coefficient of no i foil in one motion period and f ti is its corresponding average thrust force that is 13 f t i 1 t f 0 t f f i t d t where f i t is the instantaneous thrust force of no i foil and t f is the motion period of the foils for convenience of analysis a non dimensional coefficient such as c ti is usually needed and solved in numerical simulations therefore in this situation weue of wusv Œ∑ can be deduced from equations 9 11 14 Œ∑ p u e w n c t œÅ v 3 c 0 s 0 2 e 0 v c g b n c t v 3 c 0 s 0 g a 2 v c g b n c t 2 œÄ v v c 2 v c 2 c 0 s 0 b a Œª a then equation 14 can be simplified as a non dimensional form and yields the following expression 15 Œ∑ n c t œÄ k v 3 2 k v 1 k s k w where k v is the non dimensional velocity k s is the non dimensional shape coefficient of the wusv and k w is the non dimensional shape coefficient of the wave and is also the reciprocal of the wave steepness 16 k v v c k s s 0 c 0 b a k w Œª a every part in equation 15 has a clear physical meaning and we can obviously see that there are four main factors affecting the weue of the wusv the thrust force of the tfp the sailing velocity the scales of the wusv and the current wave parameters among these improving the velocity of wusv promoting the propulsive performance of tfp and increasing the projected area of the foils can all benefit in improving the utilizing wave energy ability of wusv in a certain wave environment however c t or f t must have been calculated previously and then Œ∑ can be obtained by employing eq 15 however in practical operation such as in freedom sailing experiments the thrust force of tfp is difficult to measure and only one useful parameter in eq 15 the sailing speed of wusv can be obtained if we can measure the average speed of wusv in a variety of wave environments we can also believe that the average thrust force of tfp is always equal to the average drag force of wusv in one cycle thus we can measure or calculate total resistance of wusv in waves instead of in thrust force c t or f t in eq 15 and then Œ∑ is inferred however as a wave has characteristics of randomness and complexity it is difficult to calculate the added resistance of wusv in waves directly by a theoretical method therefore another challenge must be confronted how to update eq 15 to calculate Œ∑ in these situations in this paper a reserve power method was adopted to solve the above problem and we use this power to consider the effect of waves for wusv instead of calculating the added wave resistance in other words if we want wusv to maintain the same sailing speed in waves as in calm water we must add extra power p e on the basis of power consumed in calm water to compensate for the influence of added resistance in the waves then p e can be calculated by the following equation sheng and liu 2003 17 p e 4 594 2 h 0 152 2 c b l b b where h is the wave height c b is the block coefficient of the surface float and c b lbt where is the displacement of the float then the usable power of wusv p u in eq 11 can be redefined as follows 18 p u p e p s where p s is the usable power of wusv in calm water with the same velocity as in the waves and can be calculated as follows 19 p s r t v v where r tv is the equivalent calm water resistance i e the resistance of wusv with sailing velocity v in calm water and this parameter means other additional experiments need to be performed to measure this calm water resistance with different velocities then we can obtain the weue of the wusv Œ∑ again from equations 9 and 18 20 Œ∑ p u e w p e r t v v e w 4 experimental study of weue function 4 1 experimental prototype of wusv after optimum design of the molded lines and structure we finished the 3d model scheme of the wusv in which the surface float adopted a flat and fat shape then we built the experimental prototype of the wusv according to the above designed scheme the principal dimensions of the float were set as ship length l 2 m molded breadth b 0 6 m molded depth h 0 25 m and designed draft t h 0 15 m as shown in fig 2 a then according to the principal dimensions of the float we can calculate the displacement of the float 0 086 m3 and block coefficient of float c b 0 478 mentioned in eq 17 meanwhile tfp was made up of six of the same foils with chord length c 0 0 16 m and span length s 0 1 08 m and their airfoil profile was naca0012 the foils were arranged in tandem and the distance between two adjacent foils was designed to be l 0 08 m 0 5c 0 every foil has two stoppers to limit its oscillating angle amplitude Œ∏ 0 15 moreover both ends of each foil in the span direction adopt circular bead transitions to slow down the flow field sudden change the experimental prototype of tfp is shown in fig 2 b 4 2 experimental setting and conditions two types of experiments for the wusv were carried out in the towing tank the experiments were a resistance experiment in calm water and a freedom sailing experiment in regular waves as shown in fig 3 a and b respectively the scales of the tank are length width depth 108 m 7 m 3 5 m a push plate wave maker is set at the end of the tank and it can generate regular waves with a wave height of 0 0 4 m and wave period 0 4 4 s we can measure the calm water resistance of the wusv and the single float with different towing velocities in calm water from the resistance experiment and the average velocity of wusv in regular waves from the freedom sailing experiment as discussed in section 3 2 when analyzing the weue of the wusv in experiments we need to know in unit time the wave energy that wusv harvests and transfers to its kinetic energy as well as the total wave energy passed through by wusv that is the usable power and input power of the wusv however the input power can also be calculated by equation 9 and the usable power should be solved by following the process according to eqs 17 19 4 3 experimental data in the following work we measured the resistance of the wusv with different towing speeds v in calm water first as shown in fig 4 in which exp wusv and exp float indicate measured calm water resistance of the wusv and the single float respectively while cal float means that theoretically calm water resistance calculated based on the equivalent plank theory with the same conditions from fig 4 the single float resistance results from theoretical and experimental methods have an excellent agreement with each other which validates our experiments in addition the resistance of the wusv is obviously much higher than the resistance of the single float with certain towing speeds resistance of the float occupies only 10 of the resistance of the wusv most usable power achieved by the tfp is used to work against the resistance of the tfp and the umbilical cable then we carried out the freedom sailing experiments of the wusv in regular head waves and measured its velocity v with different wave heights and wave lengths as shown in fig 5 fig 5 demonstrates the sailing velocity ascending first and then descending with increasing wave length and amplitude it does not always achieve higher sailing velocity with smaller wave length or larger wave amplitude in practical operation although tfp can provide larger thrust force based on later numerical simulations in section 5 the reason for this phenomenon will be analyzed together with other in section 6 4 4 experimental results and analysis after measuring r t and v in figs 4 and 5 we interpolate the calm water resistance curve of wusv in fig 4 by sailing velocity v and then we obtain the equivalent calm water resistance r tv of the wusv at the same velocity v in the waves as shown in fig 6 r tv can also be treated as the calm water resistance part of the total drag force for the wusv when it sailing in the waves from fig 12 a r tv ascends first and then descends with increasing wave length under certain wave amplitudes however the wave length corresponding to the peak value of r tv is not fixed with a different wave amplitude in which the maximum value of r tv is 5 46 n when a 0 07 m corresponding to Œª 7 m and 5 29 n when a 0 09 m corresponding to Œª 9 m then we can infer that the maximum calm water resistance of the wusv usually appears in the situation of Œª 100 a when the wave amplitude is decided similarly in fig 6 b r tv also presents an inverted u shape trend with increasing wave amplitude with a certain wave length in this figure the maximum value of r tv appears at a 0 08 m and this characteristic is not same as that in fig 6 a in addition from fig 6 b the peak value of r tv is 5 77 n when Œª 6 m and r tv increases slightly when a 0 09 m meanwhile r tv can reach 6 45 n when Œª 7 m with measured sailing velocity v and calculated resistance r tv the equivalent usable power of the wusv in calm water p s and reserving power p e can be solved according to eqs 19 and 17 with different wave conditions then the usable power of the wusv in waves p u can be obtained by employing eq 18 and its trends are shown in fig 7 the varying trends of usable power p u for wusv with different wave parameters in fig 7 are obviously very similar to the sailing velocity v trends in fig 5 as well as the resistance r tv trends in fig 6 under the same conditions therefore we can infer that the sailing velocity of the wusv could directly reflect its wave energy harvesting ability moreover p e occupies no more than 10 of p u which means that most of the wave energy harvested by the wusv is used to work against its calm water resistance therefore if we want to improve the navigation performance of the wusv the optimum design of the molded lines of the tfp and float may be the recommended way to decrease its calm water resistance on the precondition of the float maintaining enough response to the waves after the input power e w is calculated by eq 9 the weue of the wusv Œ∑ in the above freedom sailing experiments can be solved by employing eq 20 and its trends with different wave parameters are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 a Œ∑ ascends first and then descends with increasing wave length when a 0 07 m and a 0 09 m the maximum values of Œ∑ appear at wave lengths Œª 7 m and Œª 9 m respectively this character is like the character of calm water resistance r tv and usable power p u of the wusv however in varying tendencies Œ∑ changes more smoothly and not significantly with larger wave amplitude the reasons for the above can be inferred from eqs 1 and 8 10 8 20 and figs 5 a and 7 a from fig 5 a and eq 19 p u can be simplified as proportional to the sailing velocity v of the wusv and then by substituting eqs 8 and 9 into eq 20 and simplifying we can get Œ∑ in experiments proportional to a 2 and c g v respectively later according to eq 10 and fig 5 a c g is also proportional to Œª 1 2 therefore c g v descends first and then ascends with increasing wave length and causes Œ∑ in experiments showing the above trends under certain wave amplitudes as well as its trends tending to change smoothly as seen in fig 8 b Œ∑ in experiments generally descends with increasing wave amplitude and this trend is different from the trend of r tv and p u except all of them can get the maximum value at a 0 08 m therefore combined with fig 8 a the sailing velocity v in the real sea of wusv can partly reflect its ability to harvest wave energy and transfer to usable power efficiency the reason for curve trends in fig 8 b can be explained by eqs 8 10 figs 5 b and 7 b from fig 7 b p u is proportional to the sailing velocity v and c g remains constant with a certain wave length according to eq 10 then we can infer that c g v descends first and then ascends with increasing wave amplitude according to fig 5 b at last based on eqs 8 and 9 a 2 and c g v as part of the denominator ascend and descend with increasing wave amplitude respectively when a 0 08 m therefore under these conditions changes in experimental Œ∑ are not obvious in fig 8 b similarly a 2 and c g v all ascend with increasing wave amplitude when a 0 08 m as a result Œ∑ descends more rapidly in this situation 5 numerical validation of the weue function generally c t in eq 15 or f t is usually obtained by numerical simulations such as the computational fluid dynamics cfd method the potential flow theory method etc in this paper we take a numerical result from common fluent software based on cfd as an example to modify the validation of the above weue function actually according to liu et al p liu et al 2016b we have discussed a method to calculate the thrust force of tfp and analyze its propulsive efficiency which represents the ability of tfp to convert the input power introduced by the umbilical cable into the usable power this input power is different from e w in eqs 14 and 20 which is obtained by the float from the waves the former acting on tfp and the latter e w on the surface float 5 1 computational domain and boundary conditions in the above numerical example tfp was simplified as six 2d foils deployed in tandem because every foil had a large aspect ratio then we assumed the foils operated in an infinite flow field as the length of wusv umbilical cable is 6 m and in following numerical simulations all setting wave length was smaller than 12 m that is it could ignore the influence of the surface waves because the flow field is affected by the surface waves only if depth is less than roughly half a wavelength yan and ellingsena 2016 correspondingly the gravity of tfp was also not considered meanwhile an inflow with constant velocity was employed to replace the forward average velocity of the tfp then a side view of the tfp model coordinate system all boundary conditions and scales of the whole computational domain are shown in fig 9 in fig 9 the distances between each foil and upper and lower boundary are all equal to eight times the chord length of the foil so we define these two boundary wall conditions because we have modified this distance far enough that these boundary definitions have no influence on the flow field near the foils in addition the distance between the water inlet boundary and the leading edge of the left first foil is eight times the chord length and between the outflow boundary and the trailing edge of the first right foil is fifteen times the chord length because a longer wake domain can make the vortex of the tfp develop more fully 5 2 simulation setting and motions of foils as mentioned above the flow field around the tfp is simulated by the fluent software with the pressure based transient solver and second order upwind spatial discretization the second order implicit discretization is employed for the time stepping scheme and the no slip wall boundary condition is used on the foil surface in simulations the user defined function udf is adopted to realize the designed periodic movements of tfp foils by secondary development of cfd software the foils of tfp will do coupled heaving and pitching motions when the surface float encounters wave peaks or valleys and then do a heaving motion during other times in the wave period then instantaneous movements in heave and pitch directions of every foil in one period can be expressed as eq 21 and shown in fig 10 where y 0 and Œ∏ 0 are the amplitude of heaving and pitching motions respectively t f means the motion period of foil and in this numerical simulation t f is assumed to be equal to the wave period and the moving process of every foil is assumed to follow the same rule one can find other details about these motions in the study by liu p liu et al 2016b 21 y t y 0 cos 2 œÄ f t Œ∏ t Œ∏ 0 sin 8 œÄ f t 0 t t f 16 y t y 0 cos 2 œÄ f t Œ∏ t

15 t f 16 t t f 5 3 mesh and sensitivity test to adapt the deforming and reconstructing of the mesh during the movements of each foil unstructured grids were employed to divide the computational domain of the tfp moreover mesh near the foils has been artificially densified to improve the solving accuracy and capture the evolution of the flow field as shown in fig 11 meanwhile tfp has n 6 foils arranged in tandem as its prototype and the distance between two adjacent foils is half of the chord length c 0 before validation we performed comprehensive studies to assess the sensitivity of the numerical solution to the grid and time step size a grid sensitivity study was conducted using three meshes including 46 000 coarse 92 000 nominal and 184 000 fine elements and a time step size Œ¥t t f 200 the test is carried out with Œ∏ 0 15 t f 1 2 s and y 0 c 0 0 5 1 5 to correspond to a later experimental study in numerical simulations we take c 0 0 16 m s 0 1 08 m and b 0 6 m while the distance between two adjacent foils is l 0 08 m 0 5c 0 the variations in the thrust force coefficient c t with y 0 for three different grids are shown in fig 12 a it can be seen that both the nominal and fine meshes generate the reasonable simulation results that are quite close to each other while the coarse mesh cannot resolve the flow well especially when y 0 c 0 1 therefore the computed results based on the nominal grid are insensitive to further refinement of the grid size a sensitivity study on Œ¥t was also carried out using the nominal grid and three different time step sizes of t f 100 t f 200 and t f 400 the resulting plot is shown in fig 12 b where Œ¥t t f 200 proves to be suitable consequently the setup with the nominal grid and the time step size of t f 200 allows a satisfactory computation 6 results and discussion after the above setting the thrust force coefficient of tfp was solved with different regular wave parameters as shown in fig 13 where the longitudinal coordinate in these figures is the thrust force coefficient of tfp that is six times c t while the horizontal coordinate is the wave length and amplitude as mentioned above tfp is assumed to be operating in infinite flow domain so the surface wave cannot impact the movements of the foils however we have also assumed that the wusv can completely respond to the wave so the motion period of the foils is equal to the motion period of the wave and the heaving amplitude of the foils is equal to the wave amplitude based on the dispersion relationship of the regular wave the wave period is decided by its wave length therefore in these numerical simulations wave length and amplitude are used directly as horizontal coordinates for facilitating further analysis from fig 13 a the thrust force coefficient descends with increasing wave length in an arbitrary wave amplitude and from fig 13 b this coefficient monotonically ascends with increasing wave amplitude in an arbitrary wave length actually it is obvious that the thrust force coefficient will be less than zero in some situations such as Œª 5 7 m at a 0 05 m in fig 13 a and the reason for these negative value appearing is that in the numerical simulations as the inflow velocity keeping constant foils can not generate thrust force under above conditions in other words the component of fluid forces operating on tfp in its forward direction will smaller than that in negative direction at this time and result in fluid resistance on tfp then the main reason for the trends of curves in fig 13 is that the thrust force of tfp is decided by the current wave environment which means that this thrust force is proportional to the moving speed of the foils relative to the fluid therefore based on the above the tfp will have a longer motion period with long wave length which means that the moving speed of the foils becomes slower when the wave amplitude remains constant similarly larger wave heights cause a larger heaving amplitude of the foils so the moving speed is quicker with a fixed motion period consequently tfp generates a lower thrust force with longer wave length or smaller wave amplitude according to eq 11 usable power p u of tfp calculated versus wave length and amplitude is shown in fig 14 fig 14 shows that shorter wave length or larger wave amplitude could make tfp achieve higher usable power actually the trends of the curves in fig 14 a and b are very similar to those in fig 13 a and b because inflow velocity remains constant in this numerical simulation in addition when Œª 5 7 m at a 0 05 m in fig 14 a and a 0 05 m at Œª 7 97 m and 8 98 m usable power is less than zero these situations just mean that tfp cannot transfer input power to usable power and correspond to the negative thrust force coefficient in fig 13 and these negative usable powers in fig 14 do not have an exact physical meaning then based on results in figs 13 and 14 combined with eqs 14 and 15 weue can be solved with different wave parameters as shown in fig 15 as seen in fig 15 a the weue of wusv Œ∑ descends with increasing wave length under a certain wave amplitude and the rate of descent of Œ∑ becomes slower with longer wave length in addition Œ∑ 0 when Œª 6 m at a 0 05 m so the wusv cannot harvest wave energy effectively and this phenomenon corresponds to the negative value of the thrust force coefficient and usable power with the same situation in figs 13 a and fig 14 a respectively from fig 15 b Œ∑ ascends with increasing wave amplitude under certain wave lengths and its ascending rate also slows down with the larger wave amplitude the situations i e Œ∑ 0 appears in fig 15 will not appear in nature and do not have physical meanings these negative efficiencies are just for corresponding to the negative thrust force coefficient in fig 13 and negative usable power in fig 14 summarizing fig 15 weue can obtain a higher value under the smaller k w of eq 15 and Œ∑ 10 when k w 100 qualitatively summarizing figs 8 and 15 the weue of the wusv is not higher in most situations and the main factors for this phenomenon can be deduced from eqs 14 20 compared with wave group velocity c g the sailing velocity of the wusv is relatively smaller so the input power e w as the denominator in eqs 14 and 20 can be treated as remaining constant with fixed wave parameters thus the thrust force of the tfp and sailing velocity of the wusv should be the main factors to decide the harvesting wave energy ability of the wusv among them the thrust force of the tfp can be promoted by improving the response of the float to the waves and the propulsive performance of the foils meanwhile increasing velocity should take decreasing the resistance of the wusv in the waves into consideration as seen in fig 4 the calm water resistance of the tfp and the umbilical cable takes the major part of the total for the wusv therefore with the precondition of maintaining better propulsive performance for the tfp optimum design of its molded lines and structures should be an effective way to decrease resistance in addition the surface float plays a role of motivating the response to waves and harvesting wave energy as well as a role of obstruction therefore we should take the integrated optimizing design on the surface float carefully to obtain the best navigation performance of wusv 7 discussion of weue difference theoretically the thrust force generated by the tfp should be equal to the fluid resistance of the wusv in waves therefore thrust and resistance should also have the same changing regulation with different wave parameters however comparing figs 6 and 13 the trends of thrust force ascend or descend monotonically with the corresponding wave parameters in fig 13 from numerical validations but the trends of fluid resistance ascend first and then descend with corresponding wave parameters in fig 6 from experimental studies the reasons for the above phenomenon include the two main following aspects first in numerical validations controlling the variate method is adopted in other words only one variable wave length or wave amplitude is involved in fig 13 when we discuss the effects of wave parameters on the thrust force of the tfp while the inflow velocity always remains constant however in experimental studies the wusv is in the state of freedom sailing in the waves so its velocity is determined by the wave environment then its average velocity will be a variable with different wave parameters as shown in fig 5 thus the factors causing the trends in fig 6 include not only wave parameters but also the sailing velocity of the wusv second we assumed that the float and tfp could completely respond to waves in numerical validations which means that the motion period and heaving amplitude of foils are equal to the period and amplitude of regular waves nevertheless we consider the heaving amplitude of foils should be smaller than the corresponding wave amplitude in experiments as the surface float of wusv can not response to waves completely then we recorded the movements of the float to modify this opinion as shown in fig 16 in fig 16 a heave amp at a 0 07 m means the heave amplitude of float versus wave length at wave amplitude a 0 07 m and the dotted line setting wave amp a 0 07 m means the surrounding wave amplitude is set as 0 07 m in experiments and the similar meanings in fig 16 b in fig 16 a with increasing wave length under a certain wave amplitude the heaving amplitude of the float ascends monotonically while the difference between the float and the wave amplitude setting becomes smaller and smaller as seen in fig 16 b the heaving amplitude of the float also ascends with increasing wave amplitude under certain wave lengths but the difference still exists and further ascends monotonically with increasing wave amplitude the reasons for the above trends in fig 16 can be explained by the certain response time that is needed for the float to adapt to wave movements as a result the response of the float is fuller with longer wave periods or wave lengths and the heaving amplitude of the float is much closer to the corresponding wave amplitude similarly keeping the wave length constant and increasing the wave amplitude the surface float of the wusv must enter the next motion circle despite incompletely responding to the wave movements because the motion period of the float has also been decided then a larger wave amplitude makes a considerable difference between the heaving amplitude of the tfp foils and the wave amplitude therefore the difference between the hypothesized movement amplitude of the foils and the real value is not a negligible factor for the different trends of thrust force in numerical validations and resistance in experimental studies among the reasons for the curving trends in figs 6 and 13 the difference in the sailing velocity is the most significant and the difference in the heaving amplitude for the foils is secondary at the same time the loss of wave energy when the float passes the heaving movements to the tfp by the umbilical cable also has a certain influence on the generation of the thrust force 8 conclusions in this paper we took a newly developed wave driven unmanned surface vehicle as the investigated object and a method was proposed to estimate its efficiency for utilizing wave energy to validate this method based on cfd principles the propulsive performance of tfp was studied by numerical simulations while some experiments were employed to test this method then their results and difference were analyzed in detail in this estimation method two important issues were solved 1 in functions of input power how to decide the area of the domain so that total wave energy in it can be defined as input power and 2 we focused on how to obtain usable power from different parameters such as the thrust force coefficient in numerical simulations or the sailing velocity in experimental simulations then in numerical validation by assuming the heaving amplitude of tfp was equal to the wave amplitude we found that the thrust force coefficient and usable power of the tfp and the wave energy utilizing efficiency of the wusv all descended with increasing wave length and ascended with increasing wave amplitude meanwhile considering the effects of the waves on resistance by reserving power we found that the equivalent calm water resistance usable power and wave energy utilizing efficiency of the wusv all generally ascended first and then descended with increasing wave length and amplitude in the experimental studies in addition under certain wave amplitudes the maximum value of the above parameters in experiments appears in the situation with wave lengths approximately equal to 100 times the wave amplitude differences in sailing velocity and motion responses may be the main reasons for the different trends of the two results obtained from numerical simulations and experiments respectively based on analysis results the lower thrust force of the tfp and the sailing velocity of the wusv should be responsible for lower wave energy utilizing efficiency in the future the optimum design of the float and the tfp molded lines is recommended to improve the navigation performance of the wusv we should focus mainly on the optimal scheme to improve the response of the surface float to the waves and decrease the sailing resistance of the wusv in the sea acknowledgements the authors wish to

23214,in this study a 76000 dwt 1b ice class panamax bulker attached with model ice was used as a test system for measuring the nominal wake fields based on underwater stereo particle image velocimetry the results show that the attached ice block adds a virtual thickness to the ship s stern that is equal to the thickness of the ice blocks the interferes between ice blocks and ship s wake field results in significant expansions of the ship s axial velocity contours compared with the ice free state which also leads to the formation of severe velocity blockage zones with u u 0 1 within the wake field against the incident flows of the propeller the attachment of model ice to hull leads to interference in the stern s wake fields and disrupts the streamlined in the vicinity of the hull furthermore the non streamlined shape of the model ice generates complex vortices that interfered with the bilge vortices of the bare hull the level of interference varies according to the size and distribution of the model ice attachments and the bilge vortices tends to weaken or shift outwards then the test data were corrected based on momentum theory to be more close to the real phenomena keywords hull attached with model ice nominal wake field flow field characteristics stereo particle image velocimetry 1 introduction navigation in the severe environment of icy waters is a challenging task and the additional load caused by the attachment of ice should be taken into consideration the hull ice current ice propeller current and ice hull propeller current interactions are highly complex and have a direct impact on ship resistance and wake fields in the propeller s working area in the stern during ice breaking navigation level ice is broken up and slides underneath the ship along the keel enveloping the hull before sliding into the front of the propeller plane as the ship sails through pack ice channels and ice floe zones most of the ice blocks floating near the free surface simply slide along the ship towards the stern whereas pack ice or ice floes impact on the hull and slide underneath the ship driven by its wash ice blocks at a certain depth beneath the free surface may also slide towards the front of the propeller s working region any pack ice that attaches to the front of the propeller s working region as it slides along the keel will severely impact the incident flows at the stern and subsequently affect flow fields in the vicinity of the propeller this degrades the propeller s wake and impairs its hydrodynamic performance and may lead to severe noise vibration and cavitation the literature on interactions between ice going ships with flows and ice mainly comprises studies on resistance performance and modes of ice breaking aboulazm and muggeridge 1990 guo et al 2016a jeong and choi 2008 jones 1989 2004 kamarainen 2007 kim et al 2013 lewis 1969 spencer 1992 in the study of propeller ice interactions the effects associated with the relative distance between the ice and propeller are mainly manifested as blockages proximity effects cavitation effects and cutting effects shih and zheng 1992 blockages are primarily caused by the presence of ice blocks that interfere with the incident flow of the propeller leading to a reduction in its velocity coefficient which in turn increases the propeller s thrust and torque coefficient the proximity or boundary effect is caused by an increase in flow velocity in the gap between the propeller and the ice layer above the propeller the interaction between ice in the vicinity and the propeller s blades then induces an unsteady load as for the cavitation effect the presence of ice blocks increases the local flow velocity on the surface of the propeller s blades which reduces the local water pressure on the blades this enhances the likelihood of cavitation which in turn affects the propeller s thrust and torque there have been a number of developments in mechanistic studies on the sliding of attached ice into the propeller zone at the stern and the resulting blockage of the propeller as well as proximity and chiping interactions atlar et al 2003 kinnunen et al 2015 sampson et al 2007a wang 2007 wang et al 2007 measurements and analysis of the wake fields of an ice going ship and flow field variations in the vicinity of the propeller during ice propeller interactions are an important adjunct to analyses on the hull ice and hull propeller interactions walker et al 1997 used the ldv method to measure and analyze the wake behind a blockage during propeller ice interactions sampson et al 2007b used pitot tubes to measure the wake fields associated with propeller ice interactions and found that the blockage from the cutting of ice by the propeller caused changes in the propeller s wake instabilities in the axial flows of the propeller were also identified however few studies have been conducted on the wake field of ice going ships interacting with ice blocks and piv techniques have not yet been used to measure the wake fields of ice going ships in recent years the attachment of ice to the keel has frequently been observed in model experiments of ice going ships fig 1 shows hull ice interactions panels a1 a2 b in the marin tank werff et al 2015 where large quantities of artificial model ice attached to the keel as these experiments used artificial model ice pieces of fixed shape and size the morphology of the ice attached to the keel was highly regular in fig 1 panels c1 c2 metrikin et al 2015a d1 and d2 metrikin et al 2015b show that large quantities of model ice are attached to the keel close to the propeller and the dimensions shapes and distribution densities of the attached ice are different fig 1 e f g are photographs taken during experiments performed by aker solutions on the navigation of ice breaking ships in level ice the ice in panels e and f is densely distributed with small pack ice fragments whereas the ice pictured in g is more scattered and the individual ice blocks are larger in size this study was inspired by the attachment of ice on ships and the images obtained from previous studies of ice blocks attached to the keel and sides of a ship during navigation through ice floe zones a 76000 dwt 1b ice class panamax bulker was used as the test subject for spiv experiments in the ship model tank a towed spiv system was used to measure wake fields of the ship attached with model ice in this experiment model ice was fixed in certain patterns to the hull based on previous experimental findings on the attachment of ice to ship we chose this scheme out of considerations regarding the suitability of using piv equipment in icy environments as towed operations could result in collisions that may damage the equipment and the movements of ice floes around the ship will interfere with the measurements to simulate the attachment of ice to a ship during navigation in icy waters non frozen model ice was attached to the keel and sides of the hull finally based on measurements and analyses of the nominal flow fields associated with the bare hull and with varying ice attachments different sizes and distribution densities we find that the wake flow of attached ice block in fixed or sliding conditions around the hull may be different in order to get the test value be more close to the real phenomena the test data were corrected based on the momentum theory we display the effects of ice attachments on flow fields and provide a reference for the design of wake adapted propellers for ice going ships 2 facility and testing model tests were carried out in the towing tank of harbin engineering university which is 108 m long 7 m wide and 3 5 m deep the main bridge and sub bridge were installed on the towing carriage the maximum speed of the towing carriage is 6 5 m s and has a global speed control tolerance within 0 3 the motion capture system and piv system were attached to the bridge and sub bridge for data measurement the model was manufactured in fiberglass geometric details and parameters are shown in table 1 and fig 2 turbulence stimulators were installed at 5 length between perpendiculars lpp away from the forward perpendicular fp to minimize the scaling effect induced by the conflict between froude and reynolds scaling to prevent the ship motion interfering with the image acquisition the four degrees of freedom were locked the model was painted matte black to minimize laser sheet reflection two right handed cartesian coordinate systems were used the origin of the global xyz coordinate system was placed at the intersection of fp hull centerline and baseline with x along the model centerline to downstream y to starboard and z upward a local cartesian coordinate system was used with the origin located at the propeller center on the station 3 spiv measurements 3 1 spiv system the spiv system used in this study is a customized stereoscopic underwater piv system for towing tanks dantec dynamics inc skovlunde denmark the piv system consists of the following components a piv probe assembled in asymmetrical configuration with streamlined nose and tail b two streamlined struts with consoles and head for supporting the piv probe and for guiding the light and cables to the piv probe c two camera modules with water detection equipped with two flowsense 4m mk ii cameras ccd sensor of 2048 pixel 2048pixel 12 bit resolution 7 4 Œºm pixel pitch supplied by dantec dynamics inc the cameras are equipped with 85 and 50 mm f 1 8 canon ef lenses the scheimpflug angle focus and aperture can be adjusted through the controller box using dynamic studio software d two camera mirror modules with two mirror sections and open windows the mirror sections for cameras 1 and 2 are equipped with big and small mirrors with mirror angles of 56 and 19 respectively thus the angle between the camera axes and views is 68 and 38 respectively e the light sheet unit containing light sheet optics and a window for the light sheet the adopted laser supply was a dualpower 200 mj 15 hz nd yag laser supplied by litron lasers the arrangement of the spiv system is similar to that described in the literature falchi et al 2014 yoon et al 2015 the schematic of the piv setup is shown in fig 3 polyamide seeding particles with a diameter of 50 Œºm and a density of 1 03 g cm3 dantec dynamics inc were used as the tracer particles for this spiv test approximately 150 g m3 of particles were mixed with the water using a motorized stirrer in the particle seeding device to ensure uniformity of particles in the test region a customized rake shaped pipe was used during the particle seeding process 3 2 calibration and vector field calculation of spiv system the submersible piv system for towing tanks was calibrated using a 400 310 mm2 multilevel dot matrix dantec dynamics calibration target before the stereo calibration the multilevel dot matrix calibration target should be installed at the laser sheet plane where the field of views of the two cameras overlap the direct linear transform dlt mathematical model dantec dynamics 2015 of dynamics studio was used to describe the affine transform function that describes the transformational relation from the object space to the image plane the affine transform function created in the stereo calibration plays an important role in reconstructing the 3d velocity vectors of the spiv process the fig 4 shows the stereo reconstruction of the velocity field a dantec dynamics calibration refinement was performed to improve the accuracy of the existing stereo calibration using particle images acquired simultaneously from both cameras in the uniform flow measurement condition at test speed without the test model spiv analysis was conducted in batch processes using dantec studio v 6 0 software the field of view was approximately 310 mm 280 mm width height the distance between the piv probe and test model was 1215 mm the adaptive correlation method dantec dynamics 2015 calculated velocity vectors with a 128 pixel 128 pixel initial interrogation area ia the displacement was calculated based on an initial ia then the initial interrogation area was divided into the intermediary 64 pixel 64 pixel ia and the final 32 pixel 32 pixel ia the intermediary results are treated as information for the next ia of smaller size until the final ia size is reached two passes were performed in each refinement step to further shift and deform the windows in order to minimize in plane particle dropout

calculated through the local interpolation of the vectors present in the area the final stereoscopic resolution is 2025 pixels by 1826 pixels the final spacing of the vector grid of one velocity vector in the time averaged velocity map was 2 45 2 45 mm2 the separation time between two consecutive illuminations of the tracer particles was 400 Œºs this interval makes sure the maximum particle displacement within 1 4 interrogation window for a single towing carriage run 250 particle image pairs yoon et al 2015 seo et al 2016 were acquired fig 5 shows the wake field under uniform flow measurement condition at test speed without the test model the results in our paper are taken from the left hand side of the full field measurements and the results are taken from one single side consistently and reflect for the sake of comparisons the wake field under uniform flow measurement condition at test speed without the test model is in good agreement with the test speed of the towing carriage 3 3 uncertainty and convergence analysis in this study the simplified method adopted for the uncertainty and convergence of the present spiv system is similar to the approach of falchi falchi et al 2014 the bias and peak locking errors were disregarded and only the correlation noise error was estimated in this study formulas were derived to evaluate the root mean square rms error of the three velocity components as a function of the angular displacement between the cameras and the level of correlation noise of the 2c piv fields prasad 2000 the detailed approximation formulas are as follows 1 r m s Œ¥ x r m s Œ¥ x 1 Œ¥ x 2 cos Œ∏ 2 2 cos Œ∏ 1 2 sin Œ∏ 2 Œ∏ 1 2 r m s Œ¥ y r m s Œ¥ x 1 Œ¥ x 2 2 3 r m s Œ¥ z r m s Œ¥ x 1 Œ¥ x 2 sin Œ∏ 2 2 sin Œ∏ 1 2 sin Œ∏ 2 Œ∏ 1 where Œ¥x 1 and Œ¥x 2 are the in disc displacements along the x axis Œ∏ 1 and Œ∏ 2 are the inclinations between the camera axes and views Œ∏ 1 68 Œ∏ 2 38 for the utilized spiv system Œ¥x Œ¥y and Œ¥z are the displacements in the absolute reference frame and rms is a conservative value of the root mean square particle image displacement which is used as an indicator for this kind of error u v and w are the velocities in the x y and z coordinates respectively the percentage uncertainty in the instantaneous velocities derived from approximated formulas and excluding the effect of the statistically converged velocity fields can be expressed as follows 4 r m s u u r m s Œ¥ x Œ¥ x r m s Œ¥ t Œ¥ t where rms Œ¥x Œ¥x represents the error due to the processing software the processing error rms Œ¥x 1 Œ¥x 2 of stereo recombination is 0 1 pixels according to the literature raffel et al 2007 adrian and westerweel 2011 and the mean displacement of the tracer particles in the time interval Œ¥t is about 7 pixels rms Œ¥t Œ¥t represents the error due to the electronic time jitter the jitter for the actual laser used in this study was 1 ns and the actual time interval Œ¥t between the two pulses was 400 Œºs for the dantec spiv equipment used here substituting these values into eq 4 gives rms u u 2 492 rms v u 1 014 rms w u 3 179 as the estimated error for the instantaneous velocity field is approximately 3 of the mean velocity a conservative approximation for the global uncertainty of the current piv measurements would be up to 4 of the estimated flow velocity this is similar to the estimate given by prasad 2000 for the statistical convergence considerations the following section discusses the relationship between the number of required samples n and the desired statistical quantity as well as the corresponding confidence interval according to the literature of random data bendat and piersol 1986 2010 the velocity samples are assumed to follow a normal distribution the confidence interval is u i z Œ± 2 œÉ 0 n and the u i conf is z Œ± 2 œÉ 0 n where u i is the mean free stream velocity in the x y and z coordinates the relationship between the required samples n and the level of precision confidence interval can then be computed as follows 5 n z Œ± 2 2 œÉ 0 2 u i c o n f 2 where u i conf represents the level of precision viz confidence interval is u i u i c o n f with which the desired statistical quantity is evaluated z Œ± 2 1 96 probability 95 Œ± 0 05 for a two tailed normal distribution is the probability of a normal distribution and œÉ 0 0 2 is the standard deviation of the velocity a population of 250 double frame images was recorded in the present study and the level of precision of spiv system was approximately 2 5 the confidence interval is u i 2 5 the following relationship can be used to assess the uncertainty on second order statistical moments the rms of the velocity 6 s 1 z Œ± 2 2 n œÉ 0 s 1 z Œ± 2 2 n where s is the estimated rms value when n 250 and z Œ± 2 1 96 then 0 92s œÉ 0 1 096s it can be seen that the estimation of the confidence interval is used to evaluate second order statistical moments the uncertainty in the above analysis for these quantities is equal to 17 of the exact value which is close to the value of 12 derived by falchi falchi et al 2014 4 preliminary test and experimental arrangement ideally the wake fields of a ship attached with model ice should be measured based on spiv in an ice towing tank but the low temperatures of ice tank may damage the laser devices of the piv system additionally small pack ice fragments in the ice tank have similar imaging characteristics as the seeding particles of the piv system but are tens of times larger resulting in significant interference in the imaging acquisition in the process of determining the final test plan a preliminary test was conducted to define the experimental project at which piv test can be performed 4 1 attempt of piv measurement of ship wake field during sailing through model ice as the 76000 dwt panamax bulker usually sails in summer without ice or in spring and autumn with pack ice the breaking of ice is not considered aboulazm and muggeridge 1990 in the case of spiv measurement in pack ice the ice breaking forces can be neglected provided that the size of the ice pieces is small and there is a low breaking component therefore the design of the model only need to satisfy the similarity criteria namely the froude and reynolds numbers that is it should ensure that the froude number of the real ship is equal to that of the model and the reynolds number is greater than the critical reynolds number as a result paraffin can be used as the model ice for the ship ice interaction the density of paraffin model ice is 0 9 g cm3 its coefficient of friction is 0 15 and the coefficient of friction between the ice and the ship is 0 1 these values closely approximate that of real ice under the dynamic effects of waves and sea wind the pack ice has a highly complex shape and size distribution in marginal ice zones by analyzing the cumulative frequency of the pack ice size within a certain range researchers have found that the pack ice sizes obey a power law distribution williams et al 2013 where the probability is given by 14 p d c d Œ≥ where d is the characteristic dimension p d is the probability of a floe diameter greater than d and c Œ≥ are constants obtained by fitting usually the ice floe characteristic dimension is represented by the average caliper diameter which refers to the mean distance between parallel lines that connect the outer contour lines of the floe ice the power law distribution can be used to form different characteristic dimensions of model ice the specific quantities of the model ice are listed in table 2 and the distribution law is illustrated in fig 6 piv measurements of the wake field were initially performed with the same setup used to measure interactions between the ship and non frozen model ice as the ship interacted with ice floes of varying density some of the paraffin model ice crushed into the piv laser some of the ice slipped into the piv imaging zone which severely interfered with the piv measurements see fig 7 on the other hand the collision between the laser and the ice may damage the precious implement therefore other experimental programme have been proposed 4 2 piv measurement of ship wake field with attached model ice to avoid the drawbacks of preliminary test in section 4 1 polyethylene model ice was attached on the keel shown in fig 1 in section 5 7 we analyzed the blockage effects caused by attached model ice using the momentum theories of propeller the test data correction based on the momentum theory gives a good solution to the problem of unmovable of attached model ice as paraffin ice is reflective and only weakly adhesive we used matte black polyethylene epe extruded foam boards which have a similar friction coefficient to paraffin hagesteijn and brouwer 2014 the dimensions of the model ice were the same as the paraffin ice we used model ice with dimensions of 5 5 2 cm3 10 10 2 cm3 and 15 15 2 cm3 for our experiments referred to hereafter as 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm ice blocks respectively the attached model ice may change the floating state of the ship therefore we adjust the floating state by ballast as ship ice interactions are highly stochastic there is a level of randomicity in the positions attached along the sides and keel of the ship this makes it difficult to accurately model the actual distributions of ice attachments to facilitate comparisons between the states with and without attached ice as well as single variable analyses we systematically simplified the layouts of the ice attachments by positioning model ice blocks to the sides and keel of the ship based on the distribution of ice blocks in fig 1 and the attachment of ice during the hull ice interactions of the panamax bulker 4 3 distribution of attached model ice blocks and conditions fig 8 a shows the high concentration of the 5 cm ice block 5 cm h case distribution starting from 0 2656 lpp where x lpp 0 is the stern and consisting of 11 rows and 9 lines where the interval between each row column of model ice is 10 cm fig 8 a fig 8 b shows the low concentration 5 cm l case in which three rows have been removed from the 5 cm h case fig 8 d shows the 10 cm h case distribution starting from 0 2856 lpp and distributed over 9 rows and 7 lines at intervals of 5 cm fig 8 e is the low concentration 10 cm l case with three rows removed from the 10 cm h case fig 8 g shows the 15 cm h case distribution starting from 0 3156 lpp and distributed across 5 rows and 5 lines at intervals of 5 cm fig 8 h is the low concentration 15 cm l case with two rows removed from the 15 cm h case fig 8 c f l is the shape of the stern under the case with 5 10 15 cm ice blocks attachments respectively table 3 presents the measured sections and conditions for piv measurements of the wake fields with varying densities of attached ice the flow fields were generally measured at the propeller plane the center of the propeller plane in the global cartesian coordinate system is x 0 0199 y 0 z 0 01644 x x lpp and the like while its local cartesian coordinates are x local 0 y local 0 z local 0 x local x local lpp and the like 5 analysis and discussions of experimental results 5 1 ice free condition the results of wake field under ice free condition are shown in fig 9 fig 9 a illustrates the wake field in the whole spiv capture region and fig 9 c d e f illustrates the wake field in the propeller plane which is a part of the spiv capture region fig 9 b shows that the 76000 dwt panamax bulker has an u type stern the incident flows that pass by this u type stern generates intense bilge vortices labeled bv fig 9 a c e f the axial flow velocity u u in the propeller plane is affected by these vortices exhibit distinct hook like axial velocity contours labeled a with a velocity of u u 0 3 the distortion of these hook shaped characteristic which was first proposed by kim kim et al 2001 is caused by flows with less average kinetic energy fig 9 c labeled b being transferred through an intense longitudinal bilge vortex towards the center of the hull which reduces its velocity and creates local hook shaped structures in addition the hub cap vortex which rotates in the opposite direction labeled hcv is situated below the bilge vortex tightly adheres to the hull s longitudinal profile the presence of the hook shaped bilge vortex and counter rotational hub cap vortex has a positive effect on the rotational efficiency of the propeller fig 9 d shows that the positive and negative velocities correspond to the direction of rotation in the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex and the velocity w u has a regular hierarchical distribution fig 9 e shows that the 0 s u s2 v 2 w 2 contour intersection point of the 0 v u and 0 w u contour in fig 9 d is the rotation center of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex fig 9 f shows the contour map of planar 2nd invariant q hunt 1988 and lambda 2 criterion jeong and hussain 1995 there are two sources of vortices the bilge vortex and the hub cap vortex the bilge vortex vector in fig 9 e counter clockwise on the starboard clockwise on the port side is generated from the ship hull and is then shed into the propeller plane thus the vortex is located around the outer boundary layer u u 0 3 0 6 covering a large area the vortex shedding around the shaft is the hub cap vortex the hub cap vortex vector in fig 9 e clockwise on the starboard counter clockwise on the port side forms inside this inner wake field with u u 0 2 the bilge vortex is above the shaft and the hub cap vortex in the low speed area is below the shaft 5 2 5 cm model ice attachments condition fig 10 a and 10 d show that the attachment of 5 cm ice blocks results in a distinct expansion in the axial flow velocity u u contours compared with the ice free state this expansion is greater with the higher density of ice attachments the attachment of ice blocks represents a number of non streamlined objects on the surface of the ship in the high density case the trailing vortices of ice blocks interfere with the bare hull flow fields of the ship resulting in a larger vortex interference zone than in the low density case the ice attachments also result in an increase in the stern s virtual thickness proportional to the thickness of the ice this virtual thickness disrupting the optimal linear design of the ship and causing the stern to present a wide v type section which creates severe flow blockage zones against the incident flows of the propeller the wide v type virtual stern induces a similar wide v type distribution in the wake fields the u u 0 1 velocity blockage zone is larger in the high density case fig 10 d labeled e in the cross flow v w vector map shown in fig 10 b e and the planar lambda 2 criterion in fig 10 f distinct bilge vortices associated with the disruptive wake of the attached ice blocks labeled bv appears in the high density case whereas in the low density case the bilge vortices affected by the disruption of the ice blocks trailing vortex appear as rotational water flows and the downward water flows fig 10 b red line interfere with the axial inflows resulting in oblique inflows that are detrimental to propeller performance the planar lambda 2 criterion are of similar magnitude in both the high density and low density cases hub cap vortex of the dual vortices see fig 9 a e f observed in ice free conditions do not appear when ice is attached with many small ice vortices labeled vice 1 observed instead 5 3 10 cm model ice attachments condition fig 11 a d demonstrates that the wake fields in 10 cm ice blocks attachments condition display significant expansions in the axial flow velocity u u contours as compared with the ice free state but the range of expansion differs from the case with 5 cm ice blocks and even contracts to some extent in the z r 0 region in the low density case as the hull is not fully enveloped the increase in virtual thicknesses is relatively insignificant and this is the main cause of the expansion in observed flows we found that the propagation of bilge vortices is strongly affected by ice block density with the attachment of four rows of 10 cm ice blocks which is equivalent to an aggregated attachment on the ship s surface the edge and trailing vortices of the ice blocks interfered with the wake fields of the bare hull preventing the bilge vortices from propagating smoothly along the hull towards the propeller plane the resultant reduction in swirl strength manifested as water flows with rotational tendencies fig 11a left panel in the high density case the hull becomes enveloped in ice blocks so the increase in virtual thickness is uniform in this case the trailing vortex disruptions are primarily caused by the last row of ice blocks just in front of the propeller the virtual thickness affects the flow field distributions at the propeller plane causing the bilge vortex passage zones to move outwards labeled bv furthermore the swirl zone is affected by the wake of the last row of attached ice which manifests as an increase in the range of the swirl zone fig 11a right panel this wide v type virtual stern and transversely attached ice blocks on the bottom of the shaft in front of the propeller combine to disrupt the wake fields resulting in a severe blockage zone against incident flows of the propeller labeled e as the attachment of 10 cm ice blocks produces a smoother surface than the 5 cm case the expansion of velocity u u contours above the shaft is weaker than 5 cm one and these wake fields ultimately form a rhombic distribution additionally the u u 0 1 velocity blockage zone is larger in the high density case in the cross flow v w vector map shown in fig 10 b e and the planar lambda 2 criterion in fig 11 f the dual vortices see fig 9 a e f present in the ice free state do not occur when 10 cm ice blocks are attached in the low density case only bilge vortex rotational flows weakened by the disruption of ice attachments and an ice block vortex labeled vice 2 are observed in the high density case the bilge vortex moves outwards due to the interference of the hull s virtual thickness and the propeller cap vortex is missing 5 4 15 cm model ice attachments condition fig 12 a d shows that the wake field of 15 cm case undergoes different expansion patterns in the axial velocity u u contours the 15 cm case has the largest and fewest blocks and the mode of attachment of the last row of ice has a significant effect on the wake field distribution the distribution of axial velocity u u contours in fig 12 a is similar to the virtual contour fig 8 of the hull with 15 cm blocks attached in the low density case the ice blocks do not properly envelop the hull the virtual thickness effect is insignificant and simply produces an expansion in the axial flow velocity u u contours in the high density case the ice blocks envelop the hull the interfering trailing vortices are mainly caused by the last row of ice the virtual thickness also affects the flow field distributions in the propeller plane causing the bilge vortex to move outwards labeled bv as the swirl zone is affected by the wake of the last row of attached ice the bilge vortices move downwards because of the edge vortices of the 15 cm ice block transversely attached to the bottom of the shaft the wide u type virtual stern and attached ice on the bottom of the shaft in front of the propeller combine to disrupt the distribution of the wake fields resulting in a severe blockage zone against the incident flows of the propeller labeled e interestingly the 15 cm ice blocks result in different blockages than the 5 cm and 10 cm case in that the low density case gives a larger u u 0 1 velocity blockage zone than the high density case in the cross flow v w map shown in fig 12 b e and the planar lambda 2 criterion in fig 12 f the dual vortices see fig 9 a e f in ice free condition are also not present in 15 case in the low density case only bilge vortex rotational flows and an ice block vortex labeled vice 3 are observed in the high density case the bilge vortex moves outwards under the interference of the hull s virtual thickness and is squeezed towards the vicinity of the upper right blades of the propeller in addition downward flows are present around the center of the propeller 5 5 axial velocity distribution at z r 0 the dimensionless axial velocity u u distribution at z r 0 is shown in fig 13 in ice free condition the axial velocity u u distribution gradually increases from the center of the propeller s axis towards the side of the ship the hook shaped velocity distribution causes the plot to rise descend and finally rise again and the recessed region of the plot labeled n is the hook shaped velocity contour region the attachment of ice blocks results in blockages in the propeller s incident flows in the propeller work region y r 1 all ice attachment condition except 15 cm high concentration condition show the similar blockage in the propeller s inflows and the 15 cm l case is the most serious one in the propeller work marginal region 1 y r 1 2 the 10 cm h ice blocks produces more severe blockages than the 10 cm l case and 5 cm case out of the propeller work region 1 2 y r 2 the axial velocity u u under all conditions gradually increases except 5 cm case which have a strip like low velocity zone towards the side of the ship 5 6 wake distribution with different propeller radii detailed maps of the axial velocity u u distributions in the propeller plane is shown in fig 14 fig 14 a b 14 c d and 14 e f correspond to the high and low density cases with 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm ice blocks attached case respectively in the 5 cm case the perturbations caused by the numerous non streamlined shaped ice blocks create a chaotic vortex region that leads to the formation of distinct low velocity u u 0 1 and recirculation zones the blockage regions that have larger aggregations of forward moving flow velocities then form recirculation zones in the propeller plane in particular the recirculation range increases in the high density case and the maximum recirculation value is u u 0 1 with 10 cm ice blocks both the high and low density cases result in distinct low velocity regions the low velocity region u u 0 1 is larger in the high density case but there is no recirculation zone in the high density case recirculation zones can be observed in the low density case and the maximum recirculation value is u u 0 05 in the 15 cm case the low density case has a larger low velocity region u u 0 1 than the high density case and exhibits recirculation zones with a maximum recirculation velocity of u u 0 1 the high density case however has a smaller low velocity region u u 0 1 and no recirculation zones in summary the disruptions resulting from the attachment of 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm ice blocks cause blockages in the propeller s incident flows and the disruptions in the propeller s incoming velocity lead to a mismatch with the design condition of the propeller this results in a severe mismatch in the flows of the hull engine and propeller axial dimensionless velocities u u were measured along rings with diameters of 0 3 r 0 4 r 0 5 r 0 6 r 0 7 r 0 8 r 0 9 r and1 0 r on the propeller and the resultant wake fraction plots are shown in fig 15 in this figure 0 corresponds to the angular position pointing vertically upwards and the positive direction runs clockwise from the stern to the bow data points were taken every 10 and the other half data from 180 to 360 is the mirror image of the data from 0 to 180 in fig 15 with 5 cm ice blocks of r r 0 7 the axial wakes exhibit states of blockage u u 0 or recirculation u u 1 the maximum recirculation velocity is u u 0 1 and the wake fractions mainly take values of 1 0 1 1 in the range r r 0 7 the axial wakes in the 0 90 range are in a state of blockage u u 0 or recirculation u u 0 whereas axial wakes in the remaining circumferential regions have mean axial wake fractions between 0 7 and 1 0 with 10 cm ice blocks in the range r r 0 5 r r 0 7 for the high density case the axial wakes exhibit states of blockage or recirculation the maximum recirculation velocity is u u 0 05 and the mean axial wake fractions are in the region 1 0 1 05 when r r 0 5 r r 0 7 for the high density case the wake field axial velocities disrupted by the attached 10 cm ice blocks exhibiting a rhombic distribution and the axial velocities gradually recover from u u 0 and u u 0 to u u 0 15 0 35 in the 0 90 range whereas the axial velocities in the 90 180 range recover to u u 0 35 the corresponding mean axial wake fractions are between 0 65 and 0 9 with a valley like distribution around circumference low velocity regions with u u 0 1 are only observed in the 70 110 range and the corresponding wake fractions in these regions are around 0 9 in the low density case with 15 cm ice blocks in the range r r 0 5 the axial wakes are in the states of blockage and recirculation with a maximum recirculation velocity of u u 0 1 and the corresponding wake fractions mainly occur around 1 0 1 1 when r r 0 5 the effects of the axial velocity distribution resulting from the ice attachments interference allow the axial wakes in the 0 60 range to recover rapidly from u u 0 and u u 0 up to u u 0 4 and the wakes display a valley like distribution with respect to circumference a large u u 0 1 low velocity region can be observed in the 60 180 range where the maximum recirculation speed is u u 0 1 and the corresponding wake fractions are around 1 1 for the high density case with 15 cm ice blocks in the range r r 0 4 the axial wakes are in the range u u 0 05 0 1 and the corresponding wake fractions are mainly aggregated around 0 9 0 95 when r r 0 4 the effects of the axial wake velocity distribution resulting from the interference of the ice attachments enables the axial velocities to recover rapidly from u u 0 05 up to u u 0 4 in the 40 150 range and the wakes display a valley like distribution with respect to circumference large u u 0 1 low velocity zones can be observed in the 0 40 and 150 180 ranges and the corresponding wake fractions are mainly around 0 9 0 95 5 7 mean axial wake fraction and wake fraction correction based on the momentum theory the mean axial wake fraction is closely related to a ship s performance and propeller design after obtaining the nominal wake values from each of the measurement points positioned at various radii and circumferential angles the integral method can be used to calculate the mean axial wake fraction in the propeller plane this may be expressed as 15 œâ 0 2 œÄ r h r œâ x r Œ∏ r d r d Œ∏ 0 2 œÄ r h r r d r d Œ∏ where r h is the hub radius and r is the propeller radius the flow fraction is defined as œâ x 1 u u where œâ is the flow fraction u is the piv measured axial velocity and u is the ship s speed the mean axial wake fractions at the propeller plane under different case are presented in table 4 ideally the wake fields of a ship attached with model ice should be measured based on spiv in an ice towing tank and the attached ice will sliding around the hull in our test as the reason mentioned above we had to fix the ice blocks attached under the hull the wake flow of the ice block fixed and sliding around hull may differ in order to get the test value be more close to the real phenomena the test data were corrected based on the momentum theory the momentum theories of propeller were originally due to rankine 1865 greenhill 1888 the ice blocks which cause the blockage effects can be treated as a propeller pushing water backward so we can analysis the blockage effects using the momentum theories of propeller lewis 1988 here we call it the momentum theories of blockage effects the assumption and detailed description can be found in literature lewis 1988 the changes in pressure and velocity in the ice blocks area by momentum theory are shown in fig 16 the reduction in kinetic energy of the fluid suffer from the ice blocks is equal to the total work done per unit time of the blocked force f b the change in kinetic energy suffer from the ice blocks neglecting friction no rotation in unit time can be computed as follows 18 1 2 œÅ q u a 2 u a u b a l l 2 œÅ q u b a l l u a 1 2 u b a l l f b u a 1 2 u b a l l thus we have 19 f b u a u b 1 f b u a 1 2 u b a l l where q is the quantity of the fluid passing through the ice blocks in unit time œÅ is the density of the fluid f b is the ice blocked force u a is the inflow velocity u b1 and u b all is velocity at ice blockage section and the total blockage velocity respectively so the velocity at ice blockage section is half of the total blockage velocity write as u b all 2u b1 the velocity of ice blockage section is mainly cause by the fixed effect of the ice block when the ice block is sliding around the hull the velocity of ice blockage section approximate to zero therefore the total blockage velocity u b all of ship under ice sliding around the hull is half of the ice block fixed case approximately u b all of ice free condition is zero so we treat the u piv under ice free case as u a so in ice attached condition ice fixed case u b all u a u piv in ice attached condition ice sliding case u b all 1 2 u a u piv the corrected mean wake fractions at the propeller plane under different case based on the momentum theory are presented in table 5 in tables 4 and 5 the mean axial wake fraction in the propeller plane of the bare hull is 0 69 which is approximately equivalent to that of large ships such as the kvlcc seo et al 2016 both the original and corrected values of mean axial wake fraction are that œâ n o i c e œâ 15 h œâ 10 l œâ 10 h œâ 5 l œâ 5 h œâ 15 l but the highest corrected mean axial wake fraction is œâ 15 l 0 850 and the original highest mean axial wake fraction is œâ 15 l 1 01 the corrected value which take the ice sliding effect into consideration based on the momentum theory are more close to the real phenomena the variation in mean axial wake fraction with respect to ice attachment conditions is shown in fig 17 in the origin data the 15 cm l have mean axial wake fractions that are tightly concentrated around 1 02 for all r r values indicating that the effects of the wake in all regions of the radius result in a similar blockage a similar concentration of wake fractions occurs for 5 cm ice blocks with a high density distribution although the range is somewhat wider the low density case with 5 cm ice blocks both distributions with 10 cm ice blocks and the high density case with 15 cm ice blocks have scattered mean axial wake fraction distributions with respect to r r indicating that the effects of the wake and blockage vary with the radius in the corrected case the corrected mean axial wake fraction which take the ice sliding effect into consideration based on the momentum theory is similar to the distribution trend of ice free state and has lower blocked effect than the origin data which the ice blocks are fixed attached to the hull furthermore the impact of attached model ice blocks on wake flow can be summarized as four aspects as follows 1 the virtual stern form 2 virtual thickness of the hull 3 the ice blocks of the last row near the stern 4 the distribution concentrations of model ice along the ship when the attached blocks with a relatively small size which means 5 cm 10 cm ice blocks the impact of 3 4 is relatively weak 1 2 plays the leading role therefore the 5 cm and 10 cm ice block have a similar regularity of u u when the attached blocks are 15 cm size there has a great impact on u u compared with ice free condition and the distribution concentration play a major role on u u especially obvious with the low concentration condition the impact of 1 2 is relatively small 3 4 is relatively great this is the reasons why different size ice blocks lead to different blockage 6 conclusions in this work we have compiled experimentally obtained images and those from the relevant literature on the distribution of ice attachments in ice going ships and have used model ice blocks attached in certain patterns across the keel and sides of a ship to display and analyze the effects on the wake fields in comparison with the ice free state we measured the wake fields using the piv technique with non frozen model ice in a towing tank at room temperature moreover in order to get the test value be more close to the real phenomena the test date was corrected based on the momentum theory the conclusions from this study can be stated as follows 1 in this work the hook shaped velocity contours of the wake fields of the u type stern its bilge vortices and the hub cap vortex of the propeller plan were captured in fine detail these measurements of the wake field provide efd data for studying flow field mechanisms especially in studies on the effects of flow fields disrupted by ice attachments on the propulsive performance of ice going ships and hull engine propeller matching 2 the attachment of ice creates a virtual thickness in the stern that is proportional to the thickness of the ice and the ship s wake fields display significant axial velocity contours expansion when ice blocks are attached the presence of this virtual thickness disrupts the optimal linear design of the bare hull and different ice blocks result in different virtual sterns under the effects of these virtual sterns the nominal wake fields of the ship present different distributions the attachment of 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm ice blocks resulted in a wide v type distribution a rhombic distribution and a wide u type distribution respectively the attachment of ice generally resulted in the appearance of severe velocity blockage zones with u u 0 1 against the incident flows of the propeller 3 both the original and corrected values of mean axial wake fraction are that œâ n o i c e œâ 15 h œâ 10 l œâ 10 h œâ 5 l œâ 5 h œâ 15 l but the highest corrected mean axial wake fraction is œâ 15 l 0 850 and the original highest mean axial wake fraction is œâ 15 l 1 01 the corrected value which take the ice sliding effect into consideration based on the momentum theory is similar to the distribution trend of ice free state and has lower blocked effect than the origin data which the ice blocks are fixed attached to the hull and is also more close to the real phenomena 7 future work there is a level of randomicity in the distribution of ice blocks on the sides and keel of a ship and the morphologies are similarly stochastic in nature in this work we used square shaped model ice to facilitate comparative analyses and arranged these blocks in systematic patterns approximately furthermore the actions of the hull will cause movements in ice floes near the free surface and these movements will in turn perturb the flow fields near the free surface similar perturbations will then occur in the free surface close to the stern in future studies to improve the accuracy of our experimental arrangement we will consider ice attachments with multiple shapes and sizes and attach these model ice blocks in random distributions based on statistical theories this should enable test data of ship s flow fields with more accurate furthermore studies on effects associated with the presence of free surface ice floes on the nominal wake fields of ice going ships are also of significant importance acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51379043 41176074 51209048 and 51409063 and

23214,in this study a 76000 dwt 1b ice class panamax bulker attached with model ice was used as a test system for measuring the nominal wake fields based on underwater stereo particle image velocimetry the results show that the attached ice block adds a virtual thickness to the ship s stern that is equal to the thickness of the ice blocks the interferes between ice blocks and ship s wake field results in significant expansions of the ship s axial velocity contours compared with the ice free state which also leads to the formation of severe velocity blockage zones with u u 0 1 within the wake field against the incident flows of the propeller the attachment of model ice to hull leads to interference in the stern s wake fields and disrupts the streamlined in the vicinity of the hull furthermore the non streamlined shape of the model ice generates complex vortices that interfered with the bilge vortices of the bare hull the level of interference varies according to the size and distribution of the model ice attachments and the bilge vortices tends to weaken or shift outwards then the test data were corrected based on momentum theory to be more close to the real phenomena keywords hull attached with model ice nominal wake field flow field characteristics stereo particle image velocimetry 1 introduction navigation in the severe environment of icy waters is a challenging task and the additional load caused by the attachment of ice should be taken into consideration the hull ice current ice propeller current and ice hull propeller current interactions are highly complex and have a direct impact on ship resistance and wake fields in the propeller s working area in the stern during ice breaking navigation level ice is broken up and slides underneath the ship along the keel enveloping the hull before sliding into the front of the propeller plane as the ship sails through pack ice channels and ice floe zones most of the ice blocks floating near the free surface simply slide along the ship towards the stern whereas pack ice or ice floes impact on the hull and slide underneath the ship driven by its wash ice blocks at a certain depth beneath the free surface may also slide towards the front of the propeller s working region any pack ice that attaches to the front of the propeller s working region as it slides along the keel will severely impact the incident flows at the stern and subsequently affect flow fields in the vicinity of the propeller this degrades the propeller s wake and impairs its hydrodynamic performance and may lead to severe noise vibration and cavitation the literature on interactions between ice going ships with flows and ice mainly comprises studies on resistance performance and modes of ice breaking aboulazm and muggeridge 1990 guo et al 2016a jeong and choi 2008 jones 1989 2004 kamarainen 2007 kim et al 2013 lewis 1969 spencer 1992 in the study of propeller ice interactions the effects associated with the relative distance between the ice and propeller are mainly manifested as blockages proximity effects cavitation effects and cutting effects shih and zheng 1992 blockages are primarily caused by the presence of ice blocks that interfere with the incident flow of the propeller leading to a reduction in its velocity coefficient which in turn increases the propeller s thrust and torque coefficient the proximity or boundary effect is caused by an increase in flow velocity in the gap between the propeller and the ice layer above the propeller the interaction between ice in the vicinity and the propeller s blades then induces an unsteady load as for the cavitation effect the presence of ice blocks increases the local flow velocity on the surface of the propeller s blades which reduces the local water pressure on the blades this enhances the likelihood of cavitation which in turn affects the propeller s thrust and torque there have been a number of developments in mechanistic studies on the sliding of attached ice into the propeller zone at the stern and the resulting blockage of the propeller as well as proximity and chiping interactions atlar et al 2003 kinnunen et al 2015 sampson et al 2007a wang 2007 wang et al 2007 measurements and analysis of the wake fields of an ice going ship and flow field variations in the vicinity of the propeller during ice propeller interactions are an important adjunct to analyses on the hull ice and hull propeller interactions walker et al 1997 used the ldv method to measure and analyze the wake behind a blockage during propeller ice interactions sampson et al 2007b used pitot tubes to measure the wake fields associated with propeller ice interactions and found that the blockage from the cutting of ice by the propeller caused changes in the propeller s wake instabilities in the axial flows of the propeller were also identified however few studies have been conducted on the wake field of ice going ships interacting with ice blocks and piv techniques have not yet been used to measure the wake fields of ice going ships in recent years the attachment of ice to the keel has frequently been observed in model experiments of ice going ships fig 1 shows hull ice interactions panels a1 a2 b in the marin tank werff et al 2015 where large quantities of artificial model ice attached to the keel as these experiments used artificial model ice pieces of fixed shape and size the morphology of the ice attached to the keel was highly regular in fig 1 panels c1 c2 metrikin et al 2015a d1 and d2 metrikin et al 2015b show that large quantities of model ice are attached to the keel close to the propeller and the dimensions shapes and distribution densities of the attached ice are different fig 1 e f g are photographs taken during experiments performed by aker solutions on the navigation of ice breaking ships in level ice the ice in panels e and f is densely distributed with small pack ice fragments whereas the ice pictured in g is more scattered and the individual ice blocks are larger in size this study was inspired by the attachment of ice on ships and the images obtained from previous studies of ice blocks attached to the keel and sides of a ship during navigation through ice floe zones a 76000 dwt 1b ice class panamax bulker was used as the test subject for spiv experiments in the ship model tank a towed spiv system was used to measure wake fields of the ship attached with model ice in this experiment model ice was fixed in certain patterns to the hull based on previous experimental findings on the attachment of ice to ship we chose this scheme out of considerations regarding the suitability of using piv equipment in icy environments as towed operations could result in collisions that may damage the equipment and the movements of ice floes around the ship will interfere with the measurements to simulate the attachment of ice to a ship during navigation in icy waters non frozen model ice was attached to the keel and sides of the hull finally based on measurements and analyses of the nominal flow fields associated with the bare hull and with varying ice attachments different sizes and distribution densities we find that the wake flow of attached ice block in fixed or sliding conditions around the hull may be different in order to get the test value be more close to the real phenomena the test data were corrected based on the momentum theory we display the effects of ice attachments on flow fields and provide a reference for the design of wake adapted propellers for ice going ships 2 facility and testing model tests were carried out in the towing tank of harbin engineering university which is 108 m long 7 m wide and 3 5 m deep the main bridge and sub bridge were installed on the towing carriage the maximum speed of the towing carriage is 6 5 m s and has a global speed control tolerance within 0 3 the motion capture system and piv system were attached to the bridge and sub bridge for data measurement the model was manufactured in fiberglass geometric details and parameters are shown in table 1 and fig 2 turbulence stimulators were installed at 5 length between perpendiculars lpp away from the forward perpendicular fp to minimize the scaling effect induced by the conflict between froude and reynolds scaling to prevent the ship motion interfering with the image acquisition the four degrees of freedom were locked the model was painted matte black to minimize laser sheet reflection two right handed cartesian coordinate systems were used the origin of the global xyz coordinate system was placed at the intersection of fp hull centerline and baseline with x along the model centerline to downstream y to starboard and z upward a local cartesian coordinate system was used with the origin located at the propeller center on the station 3 spiv measurements 3 1 spiv system the spiv system used in this study is a customized stereoscopic underwater

consistently and reflect for the sake of comparisons the wake field under uniform flow measurement condition at test speed without the test model is in good agreement with the test speed of the towing carriage 3 3 uncertainty and convergence analysis in this study the simplified method adopted for the uncertainty and convergence of the present spiv system is similar to the approach of falchi falchi et al 2014 the bias and peak locking errors were disregarded and only the correlation noise error was estimated in this study formulas were derived to evaluate the root mean square rms error of the

in the absolute reference frame and rms is a conservative value of the root mean square particle image displacement which is used as an indicator for this kind of error u v and w are the velocities in

the mean velocity a conservative approximation for the global uncertainty of the current piv measurements would be up to 4 of the estimated flow velocity this is similar to the estimate given by prasad 2000 for the statistical convergence considerations the following section discusses the relationship between the number of required samples n and the desired statistical quantity as well as the corresponding confidence interval according to the literature of random data bendat and piersol 1986 2010 the velocity samples are assumed to follow a normal distribution the confidence interval is u

confidence interval can then be computed as follows 5 n z Œ± 2 2 œÉ 0 2 u i c o n f 2 where u i conf represents the level of precision viz confidence interval is u i u i c o n f with which the desired statistical quantity is evaluated z Œ± 2 1 96 probability 95 Œ± 0 05 for a two tailed normal distribution is the probability of a normal distribution and œÉ 0 0 2 is the standard deviation of the velocity a population of 250 double frame images was recorded in the present study and the level of precision of spiv system was approximately 2 5 the confidence interval is u i 2 5 the following relationship can be used to assess the uncertainty on second order statistical moments the rms of the velocity 6 s 1 z Œ± 2 2 n œÉ 0 s 1 z Œ± 2 2 n where s is the estimated rms value when n 250 and z Œ± 2 1 96 then 0 92s œÉ 0 1 096s it can be seen that the estimation of the confidence interval is used to evaluate second order statistical moments the uncertainty in the above analysis for these quantities is equal to 17 of the exact value which is close to the value of 12 derived by falchi falchi et al 2014 4 preliminary test and experimental arrangement ideally the wake fields of a ship attached with model ice should be measured based on spiv in an ice towing tank but the low temperatures of ice tank may damage the laser devices of the piv system additionally small pack ice fragments in the ice tank have similar imaging characteristics as the seeding particles of the piv system but are tens of times larger resulting in significant interference in the imaging acquisition in the process of determining the final test plan a preliminary test was conducted to define the experimental project at which piv test can be performed 4 1 attempt of piv measurement of ship wake field during sailing through model ice as the 76000 dwt panamax bulker usually sails in summer without ice or in spring and autumn with pack ice the breaking of ice is not considered aboulazm and muggeridge 1990 in the case of spiv measurement in pack ice the ice breaking forces can be neglected provided that the size of the ice pieces is small and there is a low breaking component therefore the design of the model only need to satisfy the similarity criteria namely the froude and reynolds numbers that is it should ensure that the froude number of the real ship is equal to that of the model and the reynolds number is greater than the critical reynolds number as a result paraffin can be used as the model ice for the ship ice interaction the density of paraffin model ice is 0 9 g cm3 its coefficient of friction is 0 15 and the coefficient of friction between the ice and the ship is 0 1 these values closely approximate that of real ice under the dynamic effects of waves and sea wind the pack ice has a highly complex shape and size distribution in marginal ice zones by analyzing the cumulative frequency of the pack ice size within a certain range researchers have found that the pack ice sizes obey a power law distribution williams et al 2013 where the probability is given by 14 p d c d Œ≥ where d is the characteristic dimension p d is the probability of a floe diameter greater than d and c Œ≥ are constants obtained by fitting usually the ice floe characteristic dimension is represented by the average caliper diameter which refers to the mean distance between parallel lines that connect the outer contour lines of the floe ice the power law distribution can be used to form different characteristic dimensions of model ice the specific quantities of the model ice are listed in table 2 and the distribution law is illustrated in fig 6 piv measurements of the wake field were initially performed with the same setup used to measure interactions between the ship and non frozen model ice as the ship interacted with ice floes of varying density some of the paraffin model ice crushed into the piv laser some of the ice slipped into the piv imaging zone which severely interfered with the piv measurements see fig 7 on the other hand the collision between the laser and the ice may damage the precious implement therefore other experimental programme have been proposed 4 2 piv measurement of ship wake field with attached model ice to avoid the drawbacks of preliminary test in section 4 1 polyethylene model ice was attached on the keel shown in fig 1 in section 5 7 we analyzed the blockage effects caused by attached model ice using the momentum theories of propeller the test data correction based on the momentum theory gives a good solution to the problem of unmovable of attached model ice as paraffin ice is reflective and only weakly adhesive we used matte black polyethylene epe extruded foam boards which have a similar friction coefficient to paraffin hagesteijn and brouwer 2014 the dimensions of the model ice were the same as the paraffin ice we used model ice with dimensions of 5 5 2 cm3 10 10 2 cm3 and 15 15 2 cm3 for our experiments referred to hereafter as 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm ice blocks respectively the attached model ice may change the floating state of the ship therefore we adjust the floating state by ballast as ship ice interactions are highly stochastic there is a level of randomicity in the positions attached along the sides and keel of the ship this makes it difficult to accurately model the actual distributions of ice attachments to facilitate comparisons between the states with and without attached ice as well as single variable analyses we systematically simplified the layouts of the ice attachments by positioning model ice blocks to the sides and keel of the ship based on the distribution of ice blocks in fig 1 and the attachment of ice during the hull ice interactions of the panamax bulker 4 3 distribution of attached model ice blocks and conditions fig 8 a shows the high concentration of the 5 cm ice block 5 cm h case distribution starting from 0 2656 lpp where x lpp 0 is the stern and consisting of 11 rows and 9 lines where the interval between each row column of model ice is 10 cm fig 8 a fig 8 b shows the low concentration 5 cm l case in which three rows have been removed from the 5 cm h case fig 8 d shows the 10 cm h case distribution starting from 0 2856 lpp and distributed over 9 rows and 7 lines at intervals of 5 cm fig 8 e is the low concentration 10 cm l case with three rows removed from the 10 cm h case fig 8 g shows the 15 cm h case distribution starting from 0 3156 lpp and distributed across 5 rows and 5 lines at intervals of 5 cm fig 8 h is the low concentration 15 cm l case with two rows removed from the 15 cm h case fig 8 c f l is the shape of the stern under the case with 5 10 15 cm ice blocks attachments respectively table 3 presents the measured sections and conditions for piv measurements of the wake fields with varying densities of attached ice the flow fields were generally measured at the propeller plane the center of the propeller plane in the global cartesian coordinate system is x 0 0199 y 0 z 0 01644 x x lpp and the like while its local cartesian coordinates are x local 0 y local 0 z local 0 x local x local lpp and the like 5 analysis and discussions of experimental results 5 1 ice free condition the results of wake field under ice free condition are shown in fig 9 fig 9 a illustrates the wake field in the whole spiv capture region and fig 9 c d e f illustrates the wake field in the propeller plane which is a part of the spiv capture region fig 9 b shows that the 76000 dwt panamax bulker has an u type stern the incident flows that pass by this u type stern generates intense bilge vortices labeled bv fig 9 a c e f the axial flow velocity u u in the propeller plane is affected by these vortices exhibit distinct hook like axial velocity contours labeled a with a velocity of u u 0 3 the distortion of these hook shaped characteristic which was first proposed by kim kim et al 2001 is caused by flows with less average kinetic energy fig 9 c labeled b being transferred through an intense longitudinal bilge vortex towards the center of the hull which reduces its velocity and creates local hook shaped structures in addition the hub cap vortex which rotates in the opposite direction labeled hcv is situated below the bilge vortex tightly adheres to the hull s longitudinal profile the presence of the hook shaped bilge vortex and counter rotational hub cap vortex has a positive effect on the rotational efficiency of the propeller fig 9 d shows that the positive and negative velocities correspond to the direction of rotation in the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex and the velocity w u has a regular hierarchical distribution fig 9 e shows that the 0 s u s2 v 2 w 2 contour intersection point of the 0 v u and 0 w u contour in fig 9 d is the rotation center of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex fig 9 f shows the contour map of planar 2nd invariant q hunt 1988 and lambda 2 criterion jeong and hussain 1995 there are two sources of vortices the bilge vortex and the hub cap vortex the bilge vortex vector in fig 9 e counter clockwise on the starboard clockwise on the port side is generated from the ship hull and is then shed into the propeller plane thus the vortex is located around the outer boundary layer u u 0 3 0 6 covering a large area the vortex shedding around the shaft is the hub cap vortex the hub cap vortex vector in fig 9 e clockwise on the starboard counter clockwise on the port side forms inside this inner wake field with u u 0 2 the bilge vortex is above the shaft and the hub cap vortex in the low speed area is below the shaft 5 2 5 cm model ice attachments condition fig 10 a and 10 d show that the attachment of 5 cm ice blocks results in a distinct expansion in the axial flow velocity u u contours compared with the ice free state this expansion is greater with the higher density of ice attachments the attachment of ice blocks represents a number of non streamlined objects on the surface of the ship in the high density case the trailing vortices of ice blocks interfere with the bare hull flow fields of the ship resulting in a larger vortex interference zone than in the low density case the ice attachments also result in an increase in the stern s virtual thickness proportional to the thickness of the ice this virtual thickness disrupting the optimal linear design of the ship and causing the stern to present a wide v type section which creates severe flow blockage zones against the incident flows of the propeller the wide v type virtual stern induces a similar wide v type distribution in the wake fields the u u 0 1 velocity blockage zone is larger in the high density case fig 10 d labeled e in the cross flow v w vector map shown in fig 10 b e and the planar lambda 2 criterion in fig 10 f distinct bilge vortices associated with the disruptive wake of the attached ice blocks labeled bv appears in the high density case whereas in the low density case the bilge vortices affected by the disruption of the ice blocks trailing vortex appear as rotational water flows and the downward water flows fig 10 b red line interfere with the axial inflows resulting in oblique inflows that are detrimental to propeller performance the planar lambda 2 criterion are of similar magnitude in both the high density and low density cases hub cap vortex of the dual vortices see fig 9 a e f observed in ice free conditions do not appear when ice is attached with many small ice vortices labeled vice 1 observed instead 5 3 10 cm model ice attachments condition fig 11 a d demonstrates that the wake fields in 10 cm ice blocks attachments condition display significant expansions in the axial flow velocity u u contours as compared with the ice free state but the range of expansion differs from the case with 5 cm ice blocks and even contracts to some extent in the z r 0 region in the low density case as the hull is not fully enveloped the increase in virtual thicknesses is relatively insignificant and this is the main cause of the expansion in observed flows we found that the propagation of bilge vortices is strongly affected by ice block density with the attachment of four rows of 10 cm ice blocks which is equivalent to an aggregated attachment on the ship s surface the edge and trailing vortices of the ice blocks interfered with the wake fields of the bare hull preventing the bilge vortices from propagating smoothly along the hull towards the propeller plane the resultant reduction in swirl strength manifested as water flows with rotational tendencies fig 11a left panel in the high density case the hull becomes enveloped in ice blocks so the increase in virtual thickness is uniform in this case the trailing vortex disruptions are primarily caused by the last row of ice blocks just in front of the propeller the virtual thickness affects the flow field distributions at the propeller plane causing the bilge vortex passage zones to move outwards labeled bv furthermore the swirl zone is affected by the wake of the last row of attached ice which manifests as an increase in the range of the swirl zone fig 11a right panel this wide v type virtual stern and transversely attached ice blocks on the bottom of the shaft in front of the propeller combine to disrupt the wake fields resulting in a severe blockage zone against incident flows of the propeller labeled e as the attachment of 10 cm ice blocks produces a smoother surface than the 5 cm case the expansion of velocity u u contours above the shaft is weaker than 5 cm one and these wake fields ultimately form a rhombic distribution additionally the u u 0 1 velocity blockage zone is larger in the high density case in the cross flow v w vector map shown in fig 10 b e and the planar lambda 2 criterion in fig 11 f the dual vortices see fig 9 a e f present in the ice free state do not occur when 10 cm ice blocks are attached in the low density case only bilge vortex rotational flows weakened by the disruption of ice attachments and an ice block vortex labeled vice 2 are observed in the high density case the bilge vortex moves outwards due to the interference of the hull s virtual thickness and the propeller cap vortex is missing 5 4 15 cm model ice attachments condition fig 12 a d shows that the wake field of 15 cm case undergoes different expansion patterns in the axial velocity u u contours the 15 cm case has the largest and fewest blocks and the mode of attachment of the last row of ice has a significant effect on the wake field distribution the distribution of axial velocity u u contours in fig 12 a is similar to the virtual contour fig 8 of the hull with 15 cm blocks attached in the low density case the ice blocks do not properly envelop the hull the virtual thickness effect is insignificant and simply produces an expansion in the axial flow velocity u u contours in the high density case the ice blocks envelop the hull the interfering trailing vortices are mainly caused by the last row of ice the virtual thickness also affects the flow field distributions in the propeller plane causing the bilge vortex to move outwards labeled bv as the swirl zone is affected by the wake of the last row of attached ice the bilge vortices move downwards because of the edge vortices of the 15 cm ice block transversely attached to the bottom of the shaft the wide u type virtual stern and attached ice on the bottom of the shaft in front of the propeller combine to disrupt the distribution of the wake fields resulting in a severe blockage zone against the incident flows of the propeller labeled e interestingly the 15 cm ice blocks result in different blockages than the 5 cm and 10 cm case in that the low density case gives a larger u u 0 1 velocity blockage zone than the high density case in the cross flow v w map shown in fig 12 b e and the planar lambda 2 criterion in fig 12 f the dual vortices see fig 9 a e f in ice free condition are also not present in 15 case in the low density case only bilge vortex rotational flows and an ice block vortex labeled vice 3 are observed in the high density case the bilge vortex moves outwards under the interference of the hull s virtual thickness and is squeezed towards the vicinity of the upper right blades of the propeller in addition downward flows are present around the center of the propeller 5 5 axial velocity distribution at z r 0 the dimensionless axial velocity u u distribution at z r 0 is shown in fig 13 in ice free condition the axial velocity u u distribution gradually increases from the center of the propeller s axis towards the side of the ship the hook shaped velocity distribution causes the plot to rise descend and finally rise again and the recessed region of the plot labeled n is the hook shaped velocity contour region the attachment of ice blocks results in blockages in the propeller s incident flows in the propeller work region y r 1 all ice attachment condition except 15 cm high concentration condition show the similar blockage in the propeller s inflows and the 15 cm l case is the most serious one in the propeller work marginal region 1 y r 1 2 the 10 cm h ice blocks produces more severe blockages than the 10 cm l case and 5 cm case out of the propeller work region 1 2 y r 2 the axial velocity u u under all conditions gradually increases except 5 cm case which have a strip like low velocity zone towards the side of the ship 5 6 wake distribution with different propeller radii detailed maps of the axial velocity u u distributions in the propeller plane is shown in fig 14 fig 14 a b 14 c d and 14 e f correspond to the high and low density cases with 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm ice blocks attached case respectively in the 5 cm case the perturbations caused by the numerous non streamlined shaped ice blocks create a chaotic vortex region that leads to the formation of distinct low velocity u u 0 1 and recirculation zones the blockage regions that have larger aggregations of forward moving flow velocities then form recirculation zones in the propeller plane in particular the recirculation range increases in the high density case and the maximum recirculation value is u u 0 1 with 10 cm ice blocks both the high and low density cases result in distinct low velocity regions the low velocity region u u 0 1 is larger in the high density case but there is no recirculation zone in the high density case recirculation zones can be observed in the low density case and the maximum recirculation value is u u 0 05 in the 15 cm case the low density case has a larger low velocity region u u 0 1 than the high density case and exhibits recirculation zones with a maximum recirculation velocity of u u 0 1 the high density case however has a smaller low velocity region u u 0 1 and no recirculation zones in summary the disruptions resulting from the attachment of 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm ice blocks cause blockages in the propeller s incident flows and the disruptions in the propeller s incoming velocity lead to a mismatch with the design condition of the propeller this results in a severe mismatch in the flows of the hull engine and propeller axial dimensionless velocities u u were measured along rings with diameters of 0 3 r 0 4 r 0 5 r 0 6 r 0 7 r 0 8 r 0 9 r and1 0 r on the propeller and the resultant wake fraction plots are shown in fig 15 in this figure 0 corresponds to the angular position pointing vertically upwards and the positive direction runs clockwise from the stern to the bow data points were taken every 10 and the other half data from 180 to 360 is the mirror image of the data from 0 to 180 in fig 15 with 5 cm ice blocks of r r 0 7 the axial wakes exhibit states of blockage u u 0 or recirculation u u 1 the maximum recirculation velocity is u u 0 1 and the wake fractions mainly take values of 1 0 1 1 in the range r r 0 7 the axial wakes in the 0 90 range are in a state of blockage u u 0 or recirculation u u 0 whereas axial wakes in the remaining circumferential regions have mean axial wake fractions between 0 7 and 1 0 with 10 cm ice blocks in the range r r 0 5 r r 0 7 for the high density case the axial wakes exhibit states of blockage or recirculation the maximum recirculation velocity is u u 0 05 and the mean axial wake fractions are in the region 1 0 1 05 when r r 0 5 r r 0 7 for the high density case the wake field axial velocities disrupted by the attached 10 cm ice blocks exhibiting a rhombic distribution and the axial velocities gradually recover from u u 0 and u u 0 to u u 0 15 0 35 in the 0 90 range whereas the axial velocities in the 90 180 range recover to u u 0 35 the corresponding mean axial wake fractions are between 0 65 and 0 9 with a valley like distribution around circumference low velocity regions with u u 0 1 are only observed in the 70 110 range and the corresponding wake fractions in these regions are around 0 9 in the low density case with 15 cm ice blocks in the range r r 0 5 the axial wakes are in the states of blockage and recirculation with a maximum recirculation velocity of u u 0 1 and the corresponding wake fractions mainly occur around 1 0 1 1 when r r 0 5 the effects of the axial velocity distribution resulting from the ice attachments interference allow the axial wakes in the 0 60 range to recover rapidly from u u 0 and u u 0 up to u u 0 4 and the wakes display a valley like distribution with respect to circumference a large u u 0 1 low velocity region can be observed in the 60 180 range where the maximum recirculation speed is u u 0 1 and the corresponding wake fractions are around 1 1 for the high density case with 15 cm ice blocks in the range r r 0 4 the axial wakes are in the range u u 0 05 0 1 and the corresponding wake fractions are mainly aggregated around 0 9 0 95 when r r 0 4 the effects of the axial wake velocity distribution resulting from the interference of the ice attachments enables the axial velocities to recover rapidly from u u 0 05 up to u u 0 4 in the 40 150 range and the wakes display a valley like distribution with respect to circumference large u u 0 1 low velocity zones can be observed in the 0 40 and 150 180 ranges and the corresponding wake fractions are mainly around 0 9 0 95 5 7 mean axial wake fraction and wake fraction correction based on the momentum theory the mean axial wake fraction is closely related to a ship s performance and propeller design after obtaining the nominal wake values from each of the measurement points positioned at various radii and circumferential angles the integral method can be used to calculate the mean axial wake fraction in the propeller plane this may be expressed as 15 œâ 0 2 œÄ r h r œâ x r Œ∏ r d r d Œ∏ 0 2 œÄ r h r r d r d Œ∏ where r h is the hub radius and r is the propeller radius the flow fraction is defined as œâ x 1 u u where œâ is the flow fraction u is the piv measured axial velocity and u is the ship s speed the mean axial wake fractions at the propeller plane under different case are presented in table 4 ideally the wake fields of a ship attached with model ice should be measured based on spiv in an ice towing tank and the attached ice will sliding around the hull in our test as the reason mentioned above we had to fix the ice blocks attached under the hull the wake flow of the ice block fixed and sliding around hull may differ in order to get the test value be more close to the real phenomena the test data were corrected based on the momentum theory the momentum theories of propeller were originally due to rankine 1865 greenhill 1888 the ice blocks which cause the blockage effects can be treated as a propeller pushing water backward so we can analysis the blockage effects using the momentum theories of propeller lewis 1988 here we call it the momentum theories of blockage effects the assumption and detailed description can be found in literature lewis 1988 the changes in pressure and velocity in the ice blocks area by momentum theory are shown in fig 16 the reduction in kinetic energy of the fluid suffer from the ice blocks is equal to the total work done per unit time of the blocked force f b the change in kinetic energy suffer from the ice blocks neglecting friction no rotation in unit time can be computed as follows 18 1 2 œÅ q u a 2 u a u b a l l 2 œÅ q u b a l l u a 1 2 u b a l l f b u a 1 2 u b a l l thus we have 19 f b u a u b 1 f b u a 1 2 u b a l l where q is the quantity of the fluid passing through the ice blocks in unit time œÅ is the density of the fluid f b is the ice blocked force u a is the inflow velocity u b1 and u b all is velocity at ice blockage section and the total blockage velocity respectively so the velocity at ice blockage section is half of the total blockage velocity write as u b all 2u b1 the velocity of ice blockage section is mainly cause by the fixed effect of the ice block when the ice block is sliding around the hull the velocity of ice blockage section approximate to zero therefore the total blockage velocity u b all of ship under ice sliding around the hull is half of the ice block fixed case approximately u b all of ice free condition is zero so we treat the u piv under ice free case as u a so in ice attached condition ice fixed case u b all u a u piv in ice attached condition ice sliding case u b all 1 2 u a u piv the corrected mean wake fractions at the propeller plane under different case based on the momentum theory are presented in table 5 in tables 4 and 5 the mean axial wake fraction in the propeller plane of the bare hull is 0 69 which is approximately equivalent to that of large ships such as the kvlcc seo et al 2016 both the original and corrected values of mean axial wake fraction are that œâ n o i c e œâ 15 h œâ 10 l œâ 10 h œâ 5 l œâ 5 h œâ 15 l but the highest corrected mean axial wake fraction is œâ 15 l 0 850 and the original highest mean axial wake fraction is œâ 15 l 1 01 the corrected value which take the ice sliding effect into consideration based on the momentum theory are more close to the real phenomena the variation in mean axial wake fraction with respect to ice attachment conditions is shown in fig 17 in the origin data the 15 cm l have mean axial wake fractions that are tightly concentrated around 1 02 for all r r values indicating that the effects of the wake in all regions of the radius result in a similar blockage a similar concentration of wake fractions occurs for 5 cm ice blocks with a high density distribution although the range is somewhat wider the low density case with 5 cm ice blocks both distributions with 10 cm ice blocks and the high density case with 15 cm ice blocks have scattered mean axial wake fraction distributions with respect to r r indicating that the effects of the wake and blockage vary with the radius in the corrected case the corrected mean axial wake fraction which take the ice sliding effect into consideration based on the momentum theory is similar to the distribution trend of ice free state and has lower blocked effect than the origin data which the ice blocks are fixed attached to the hull furthermore the impact of attached model ice blocks on wake flow can be summarized as four aspects as follows 1 the virtual stern form 2 virtual thickness of the hull 3 the ice blocks of the last row near the stern 4 the distribution concentrations of model ice along the ship when the attached blocks with a relatively small size which means 5 cm 10 cm ice blocks the impact of 3 4 is relatively weak 1 2 plays the leading role therefore the 5 cm and 10 cm ice block have a similar regularity of u u when the attached blocks are 15 cm size there has a great impact on u u compared with ice free condition and the distribution concentration play a major role on u u especially obvious with the low concentration condition the impact of 1 2 is relatively small 3 4 is relatively great this is the reasons why different size ice blocks lead to different blockage 6 conclusions in this work we have compiled experimentally obtained images and those from the relevant literature on the distribution of ice attachments in ice going ships and have used model ice blocks attached in certain patterns across the keel and sides of a ship to display and analyze the effects on the wake fields in comparison with the ice free state we measured the wake fields using the piv technique with non frozen model ice in a towing tank at room temperature moreover in order to get the test value be more close to the real phenomena the test date was corrected based on the momentum theory the conclusions from this study can be stated as follows 1 in this work the hook shaped velocity contours of the wake fields of the u type stern its bilge vortices and the hub cap vortex of the propeller plan were captured in fine detail these measurements of the wake field provide efd data for studying flow field mechanisms especially in studies on the effects of flow fields disrupted by ice attachments on the propulsive performance of ice going ships and hull engine propeller matching 2 the attachment of ice creates a virtual thickness in the stern that is proportional to the thickness of the ice and the ship s wake fields display significant axial velocity contours expansion when ice blocks are attached the presence of this virtual thickness disrupts the optimal linear design of the bare hull and different ice blocks result in different virtual sterns under the effects of these virtual sterns the nominal wake fields of the ship present different distributions the attachment of 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm ice blocks resulted in a wide v type distribution a rhombic distribution and a wide u type distribution respectively the attachment of ice generally resulted in the appearance of severe velocity blockage zones with u u 0 1 against the incident flows of the propeller 3 both the original and corrected values of mean axial wake fraction are that œâ n o i c e œâ 15 h œâ 10 l œâ 10 h œâ 5 l œâ 5 h œâ 15 l but the highest corrected mean axial wake fraction is œâ 15 l 0 850 and the original highest mean axial wake fraction is œâ 15 l 1 01 the corrected value which take the ice sliding effect into consideration based on the momentum theory is similar to the distribution trend of ice free state and has lower blocked effect than the origin data which the ice blocks are fixed attached to the hull and is also more close to the real phenomena 7 future work there is a level of randomicity in the distribution of ice blocks on the sides and keel of a ship and the morphologies are similarly stochastic in nature in this work we used square shaped model ice to facilitate comparative analyses and arranged these blocks in systematic patterns approximately furthermore the actions of the hull will cause movements in ice floes near the free surface and these movements will in turn perturb the flow fields near the free surface similar perturbations will then occur in the free surface close to the stern in future studies to improve the accuracy of our experimental arrangement we will consider ice attachments with multiple shapes and sizes and attach these model ice blocks in random distributions based on statistical theories this should enable test data of ship s flow fields with more accurate furthermore studies on effects associated with the presence of free surface ice floes on the nominal wake fields of ice going ships are also of significant importance acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51379043 41176074 51209048 and 51409063 and
