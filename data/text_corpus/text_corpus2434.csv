supplementary irrigation even at the end of rainy and winter and more severely during summer seasons groundwater resource is the main source of irrigation extracting through deep tube wells dtws and shallow tube wells stws jahan et al 2010b according to the barind multipurpose development authority bmda working under ministry of agriculture govt of bangladesh gob responsible for water resource management in the area has identified as an area with a scope for groundwater withdrawal from 8728 dtws 2 cusec capacity bmda 2001 but at present groundwater is withdrawing through almost 15 000 dtws by bmda and nearly 8000 by private owners with a total number of 23 000 the recent declining trend of the gwl is at higher rate than earlier and after 2004 does not return to its original level jahan et al 2015 simultaneously due to excessive withdrawal of groundwater and extension of irrigated agriculture gwt has been declining at an alarming rate which undermines the water availability and put threat on its sustainability rahman et al 2017 alexander 1995 but agricultural and drinking water demands are needed to be balanced for the livelihood and environment and to be focused for the better water resource management planning for management aspects of groundwater resources prediction of gwl trend with desired accuracy is very much necessary for its sustainable use so it is needed to develop a model capable of efficiently forecasting gwl studies on drought and gwl prediction like linear regression mann kendall trend test sen s slope estimator markov chain analysis jahan et al 2010b 2015 rahman 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2018 have been carried out for the study area but dynamically predictive model is needed to cope with non linearity existing between model inputs and output in this context ann as effective black box model a data driven approach has been widely used for forecasting water resource variables within the last decade e g maier et al 2010 recently a significant number of studies in this regards have been carried out but not very common with the innovative approaches of narx modelling in gwl prediction yoon et al 2011 adamowski and chan 2011 trichakis et al

practical implication as a pioneer approach and will provide significant contributions for the implementation of groundwater resource management project for drinking as well as agriculture needs 2 methods and data anns may be used to generalize the behavior of a hydrologic time series by filtering correlated data and can be categorized as i static feed forward network the information moves in one direction from the input to the output target irrespective of time ii dynamic network terzic et al 2010 output target depends on values of the input and or output at previous times i e reflecting inherent memory in the series namely hydrology and meteorology hung et al 2009 more specifically dynamic neural networks can be further divided into time delay output depends on previous values of input and feedback recurrent output depends on previous values of output networks pearlmutter 1990 cirović et al 2012 but for studies with ann account likely auto lagged relationships in the climate variables which is partly remedied by the narx neural network model leontaritis and billings 1985 it is a special type of recurrent ann that describes the modeled process based on lagged input output variables and prediction errors to determine narx structure the training procedure is repeated several times on models with different hidden neurons to decide the number of hidden layers and node and on the optimal nn architecture the process of the narx network training is usually performed in open loop form using known historical values of the inputs i e rainfall temperature humidity and evaporation and that of output i e groundwater level fig 2 that optimizes the training by reducing the iteration time and in closed loop form for subsequent multistep ahead prediction fig 3 network training would be ended based on the cross validation stop criteria to avoid the tendency of the nn to over fit the training data the validation error will normally decrease during the initial phase of training as does the training set error when the validation error increases for a specified number of iterations the training is stopped fig 4 the prediction performance of the network trained br functions is compared using statistical equations of goodness of fit the mse and correlation of determination r2 evaluate the network performance by differencing the observed and predicted values of both training and test data the mean square error mse is selected as the main criterion to measure the performance of the model murrells 2008 for example for nachole upazila table 2 where the selected models exceptionally even have the lowest r2 values the time series regression fit curves and scatter plot of predicted vs measured gwl for tanore are shown in figs 5 7 respectively in the present study daily rainfall data are collected from the rain gauge stations rgs installed in the corresponding upazilas and that of maximum temperature humidity and evaporation for the period 1980 2017 are collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd for the area the gwl data from permanent hydrograph stations phs gt8134016 gt8134018 gt8134020 gt8134024 gt8194046 gt8194047 gt8194048 gt8194049 gt7056006 gt7056007 gt7056008 gt7056009 and gt7037002 gt7037005 out of 34 installed in the study area are also collected from bangladesh water development board bwdb for the period of 1980 2017 based on the availability and continuity of groundwater level time series data locations of phs and rgs in the study area are shown in fig 1 to perform the time series analysis missing value calculations were done by statistical package for social science spss 20 0 0 and matlab r2018a on the other hand ms office 2013 was used for comparative analysis of gwl fluctuation with respect to rainfall and for preparing maps arc gis 10 1 has been used in present study matlab r2018a is used to write script files for developing narx ann model and performance functions for calculating the model performance error statistics such as mse and r2 as well as to identify input delay id feedback delay fd and for missing value calculation by cross correlation function ccf auto correlation function acf and fillmissing methods are implemented in matlab environment respectively the function trainbr in matlab 2018a has used as training algorithm in the narx br model the optimal training parameters i e id fd h hidden neurons etc for models are obtained by trial and error process and training process have iterated several times in order to get the best nn prediction model by keeping the aforementioned parameters constant in present study correlation analysis has not performed but the input parameters have taken based on assumption thus 4 climatological parameters rainfall temperature humidity and evaporation are selected as input variables for each 14 phss and corresponding gwl act as the output variable after gathering input and target data for each phs of 14 data sets is created that includes the aggregation of daily climatic and weekly gwl for the period of 1980 2017 data were divided into 85 for training and 15 for testing sets using random indices dividerand to obtain weekly temporal resolution precipitation values are summed up weekly and for temperature humidity and evaporation measurements the arithmetic mean is applied 3 results and discussion 3 1 time series analysis the acf of gwl data are prepared for godagari tanore nachole and gomostapur upazilas to understand their self correlations the acfs of gwl decrease with increasing lag time and even approaches to 0 zero correlation in phss gt8134024 and gt7037005 in godagari and gomastapur upazilas respectively at lag 5 and again start to increase correlation but all the phss at tanore and nachole upazilas show good correlation over the entire time lag slightly goes down gradually according to the increase of the lag time the decreasing acfs values of gwl at godagari upazila with increasing lag time and that of good correlation at nachole upazila over the entire time lag show slightly declining trend due to increase of the lag time the acf of gwl time series of phss in godagari upazila is shown as representative one in fig 8 on the other hand ccf is used to evaluate the correlation between gwl and rainfall amount for godagari tanore nachole and gomostapur upazilas the ccf between gwl and rainfall time series for nachole upazila is given as representative in fig 9 the maximum ccf values between gwl and rainfall 0 0737 to 0 5183 are at almost the same lags 3 months table 1 moreover it reveals that gwl is mostly influenced by rainfall where their negative values indicate inverse relationship i e increase in rainfall amount effect the declining gwl depth but at a delayed time analogous to lag so gwl curves follow a lagged continuation with corresponding peak and trough with maximum and minimum amount of rainfall indicating its time delayed response to rainfall with a range of 11 25 14 0 weeks in different upazilas with an average value of 12 73 weeks 3 months on the other hand rainfall has directly affected by parameters like temperature humidity and evaporation hence rainfall is one of the potential input parameter influencing gwl in the area but the existence of thick clay layer 10 35 m overlying the aquifer has role for time delay to recharge groundwater rahaman 2018 there is also direct effect of groundwater exploitation on gwl fluctuation but pumping data however are not available during the study period in recent years groundwater withdrawals are higher than the rainwater recharge to aquifer due to the continuous expansion of irrigated agricultural areas in the area rahaman 2018 3 2 groundwater scenario monthly groundwater fluctuation follows a sinusoidal distribution with higher depth during the month of apr jun highest in may and subsequently lower depth during sep nov lowest in october due to lagged response of rainfall to recharge aquifer to have an inside view of groundwater scenario of the study area the monthly gwl for the period of 1980 2017 with respect to rainfall for selected as representative one phss in godagari and nachole upazilas figs 10 and 11 in godagari upazila the fluctuating pattern of rainfall along with monthly gwl trend and lag time indicate the existence of discontinuity in groundwater recharge along with its highest depth 62 m in july 2017 in tanore upazila the gwl trend represents lag time in generally of 3 months some areas with 4 months of the rainfall recharge to groundwater here gwl shows the declining trend with higher slope value some exceptions in different time span mostly during the period of 2000 2010 moreover it has dropped drastically below the trend line since 2010 till present time due to insufficient replenishment of aquifer from rainfall and at the same time over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation purposes in nachole upazila the gwl was at highest depth 33 m in april 2017 with lag time of 14 weeks 3 5 months to rainfall and existed above the trend line during 1993 2005 due to sufficient amount of groundwater recharge in respect to groundwater demand for irrigation the gwl in gomastapur upazila has experienced declining trend during 1993 2005 but with steady state trend after 2010 in some places having minimum depth of 2 54 m in october 1999 with lag response of about 3 months 3 3 performance evaluation the predicted gwl using narx nn model in 14 phss are mostly well fitted with measured data figs 12 15 show the comparison between best achieved predicted results with lower prediction errors of developed narx ann models and the measured gwl data from corresponding phss in upazilas performance of 14 ann models in terms of r2 mse of training testing and prediction along with the optimal number of id fd h and number of the best training epoch for different upazilas are given in table 2 models for phs gt8134018 and gt8134020 in godagari upazila fig 12 show comparatively higher performance than the others with higher r2 values and lower mse in training and testing to get the best nn model it is done by 10 and 7 hidden neurons h with 11 and 6 input delay id and feedback delay fd respectively with their lower prediction errors values in tanore upazila all models fig 13 reached at the best convergence and less number of id fd and h ranges from 3 to 4 with lower mse in training testing ranges from 0 2 to 0 05 and prediction and higher value of r2 the models in nachole upazila fig 14 show more or less satisfactory prediction with lower errors and has reached at the best convergence with lower number of id fd 2 6 and h 5 10 and lower mse in training testing ranges from 0 73 to 0 073 with lower prediction error here models for phss gt7056007 and gt7056009 show the relatively higher performance with lower training and testing error having id fd and h of 6 6 6 and 4 4 5 combinations respectively in gomastapur upazila two models fig 15 show satisfactory prediction results with lower prediction errors here the model of phs gt7037002 with 2 3 4 combination has comparatively higher training and testing error but its prediction error is relatively lower than the other model on the other hand model of phs gt7037005 with 7 7 8 combinations shows the less predictive accuracy in spite of its lower training and testing error 4 conclusions in present study evaluation of ann narx br model shows as efficient tool for predicting weekly gwl time series despite of the presence of strong seasonal trends as input variables here the most efficient training algorithm br has chosen and proved to be more robust based on the findings of reasonable good fit between predicted and observed gwl in selected phs it is revealed that methodology adopted here can be easily applied to groundwater planning and management aspects in water scarce area the narx are remarkably well suited to perform groundwater predictions and prediction of weekly gwl using narx br for water resource management plans for irrigation with efficient use would be much more advantageous moreover the unavailability of required groundwater withdrawal data has the direct effects on gwl fluctuations in some cases might be questioned the prediction efficiency of developed ann

despite of the presence of strong seasonal trends as input variables here the most efficient training algorithm br has chosen and proved to be more robust based on the findings of reasonable good fit between predicted and observed gwl in selected phs it is revealed that methodology adopted here can be easily applied to groundwater planning and management aspects in water scarce area the narx are remarkably well suited to perform groundwater predictions and prediction of weekly gwl using narx br for water resource management plans for irrigation with efficient use would be much more advantageous moreover the unavailability of required groundwater withdrawal data has the direct effects on gwl fluctuations in some cases might be questioned the prediction efficiency of developed ann

majority of the population in the rural and remote areas of india still rely on groundwater channels to fulfill the basic necessity of clean water for drinking and various household purposes clarke et al 1996 ahada and suthar 2018 geochemical processes have emerged as a key factor for the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater chemistry narany et al 2014 panneer et al 2017 rock water interaction anthropogenic activities industrial wastewater and agricultural activities are the primary sources responsible for groundwater contamination duong et al 2015 boateng et al 2016 bouderbala and gharbi 2017 various efforts have been made to investigate the quality of groundwater in india these efforts have mainly involved the physicochemical characterization of samples and determination of relationships between the chemical characteristics of groundwater and hydrogeochemical processes prasad and mondal 2008 puthiyasekar et al 2010 magesh and chandrasekar 2013 masih et al 2014 varghese and jaya 2014 bhowmik et al 2015 bhutiani et al 2016 krishna et al 2009 mahato et al 2016 saravanan et al 2016 loh et al 2020 owamah 2020 according to various reports ionic components are of greater concern compared to other contaminants because the relative strengths of ions in groundwater reflect various aspects of hydrogeochemical processes as well as indicate sources of groundwater contamination singh et al 2013 belkhiri and narany 2015 nematollahi et al 2016 sethy et al 2016 sharifi et al 2016 selvamkumar et al 2017 beyene et al 2019 ismail et al 2020 agriculture is the principal economic activity of the population in the study region in many places surface water is scarce and groundwater serves as the only substitute source of irrigation water nearly 35 of irrigation water has been reported to be sourced from groundwater considering the above issue the present work focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal variability and sources of major ionic species in groundwater samples collected from tribal belt of bastar india to identify possible sources of groundwater contamination and apportion the source contribution principal component analysis pca and positive matrix factorization pmf 5 0 modeling approaches were applied to database of sampled groundwater helena et al 2000 guo et al 2004 dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 gholizadeh et al 2016 pca is a technique that provides information according to the most significant factors with simple data representation it is used for the determination of data structure and also provides qualitative information about potential groundwater pollution sources however pca alone does not provide sufficient information about source contribution estimates guo et al 2004 to obtain detailed information about the relative source contribution estimates the pmf tool is applied 2 field area under observation and hydrogeological framework bastar the southern division of chhattisgarh was selected as the target study area it comprises seven districts namely bastar ba bijapur bj dantewada da kanker kk kondagaon kg narayanpur np and sukma sk fig 1 bastar extends from 80 35 e to 82 15 e latitude and from 17 46 n to 20 35 n longitude covering an area of 39 114 km2 the indravati river is the major river in the region lithologically granitoids granulites gneisses and mafic igneous suites mainly constitute the geology of the study region srivastava and gautam 2009 dora 2014 the soil type in the area is mainly alluvial laterite and loamy and the soil structure varies from clayey to sandy soil the soil ph varies from slightly acidic to slightly basic which favors teak and sal vegetation the forest cover accounts for 75 of the total area of the bastar region rainfall in the region is attributed to the southwest monsoon which usually occurs during june september the average annual rainfall recorded is 1387 mm and the temperature varies from almost 10 c during the winter season to 46 c in the summer season with a sub humid and moist climate the bastar region falls under the agro climatic region of the state of chhattisgarh singh et al 2011 in this region groundwater mostly occurs under phreatic conditions and in some regions it occurs in semi confined conditions the water table of the groundwater lies between 3 02 18 65 mbgl and 2 16 11 21 mbgl in the pre and post rainy seasons respectively ground water year book of chhattisgarh 2017 3 materials and method 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis following the stratified random sampling plan with a pooled study design gilbert 1987 160 water samples were collected from 95 locations 23 dug wells dw and 72 bore wells bw the depths of the dw were approximately 8 20 m and those of the bw were 65 90 m groundwater sampling was conducted in pre monsoon prm and post monsoon pom periods may november 2017 before collecting the bore well water samples column water was pumped out for at least 10 min continuously to remove stagnant water dug well water samples were collected approximately 1 m below the water surface for sample collection acidified pre washed 1 l polyethylene bottles were used physical parameters ph electrical conductivity ec temperature and total dissolved solids tds were measured instantaneously after collecting the sample from the sites using hanna made sensors singh et al 2013 varghese and jaya 2014 guo et al 2004 bottles were then immediately filled up to the rim and tightly sealed in order to avoid exposure to air samples were safely carried to the working place laboratory using an icebox and stored at 4 c in a deep freezer for further analysis major anions such as chloride cl nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 and fluoride f were analyzed using an ion chromatography instrument dionex ics 1100 equipped with anion separator column and dionex aers500 4 mm suppressor as an eluent for anions 23 mm koh was used and a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 was sustained while cations such as sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg were analyzed using the ion chromatography instrument dionex ics 1100 equipped with a cation separator column and dionex cers 500 4 mm suppressor 30 mm methane sulfonic acid was used as the eluent for the cations keesari et al 2016 the acid titration method was used to determine hco3 sethy et al 2016 3 2 data validation and statistical approaches replicate measurements for all selected ionic species were carried out to maintain the relative standard deviation within 10 to validate the analytical data of ionic components of groundwater samples the cation anion balance error was also calculated using charge balance error following the procedure reported by keesari et al 2016 most of the data were found to be within the acceptable limit of 5 analytical data of physicochemical parameters of groundwater samples were documented using geometric mean and standard deviation along with minimum maximum ranges pearson s correlation coefficient values were also computed between the measured physicochemical parameters of groundwater samples the correlation coefficient establishes the correlation among various measured physiochemical parameters responsible for the variation in water chemistry which is attributable to similar sources 3 3 source apportionment using receptor models 3 3 1 principal component analysis principal component analysis is a mathematics based tool used to convert possibly corrected variable sets of observations using orthogonal transformation it is used to evaluate the interrelationship between different data sets to abstract most of the significant factors with minimum loss of actual facts helena et al 2000 belkhiri and narany 2015 a similar tool is factor analysis which is used to address the variance among observed variables principal component analysis is expressed as eq 1 1 z ij α i 1 x 1 j α i 2 x 2 j α i 3 x 3 j α im x mj where z is the component score value x denotes the calculated value of the variable i is designated as a component number while j is the sample number m is the total number of variables and α is the component loading gholizadeh et al 2016 in pca principal components containing eigenvalues 1 are considered in this work pca fa models were applied to normalized hydrochemical data of prm and pom seasons the varimax rotation method was applied to exploit the sum of the square of loading each component to check equal variances in the given data the kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s tests were performed the kmo static values lie between 0 and 1 where values 0 5 are acceptable values between 0 5 and 0 7 are considered average values between 0 8 and 0 9 are good and values 0 9 are the best hutcheson and sofroniou 1999 the scree plot was used to fix the criteria for determining the number of factors pca was performed using the spss software 3 3 2 pmf model 5 0 positive matrix factorization is an analytical tool that splits input sample data matrices into factor contributions g and factor profiles f norris et al 2014 it is the most advanced method for analyzing factors and addresses the problem related to non optimal scaling the factor profiles need to be resolved to identify the sources it is among the most significant receptor models suggested by the usepa for source apportionment and has been used widely by researchers in recent years the method used has been described in more detail elsewhere paatero 1997 gholizadeh et al 2016 through the matrix algorithm of concentration and uncertainty for data sets pmf profiles and factor contributions were obtained by minimizing object function q in eq 2 2 q i 1 n j 1 m x i j k 1 p g i k f k j u i j 2 where uij denotes the uncertainty estimate of the jth size interval measured for the ith sample statistics showing the signal to noise ratio s n are included in pmf5 0 norris et al 2014 the s n ratio is used to classify species as good 1 weak 0 5 1 and bad 0 5 the possible source of pollution for each factor was estimated using the correlation among each variable and their percentage contribution in the particular group gholizadeh et al 2016 matawle et al 2016 the most important and unique feature of pmf is that it can weigh each data point without missing or excluding any species to reduce the effect of the species that is missing or below the detection limit the uncertainty can be adjusted 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater chemical characteristics groundwater geochemistry fluctuates over time as a function of physical and chemical parameters that are mainly influenced by local geology and anthropogenic activities matthess 1982 subramani et al 2010 seasonal variation and geology of the particular area seasonal variation occurs in the form of the rate of groundwater flow surface run off and rate of precipitation which affect groundwater and surface water concentration singh et al 2011 table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of measured ph values dissolved solids electrical conductance and selected ions in 160 groundwater samples collected from 95 locations in the bastar region during prm and pom periods along with the prescribed limits laid down by the world health organization who for groundwater quality who 2011 geometric mean is associated with the logarithmic transformation of the data used to normalize the ranges being averaged such that no ranges dominate the weighting standard deviation was calculated to understand the variation from the mean value separately for the prm and pom periods in the study region in water geochemistry the value of ph is an important factor in regulating the solubility alkalinity and complexation of various ions in groundwater normally ph values are found in the range of 6 0 9 0 in natural uncontaminated groundwater but they are influenced by atmospheric carbon dioxide and microbial activities teikeu et al 2016 keesari et al 2016 measured ph values in groundwater samples slightly varied between 5 4 and 8 1 gm 6 72 0 48 and 5 3 8 2 gm 6 52 0 49 during prm and pom periods respectively this indicates that the slightly acidic nature of groundwater in some areas might be due to the reaction of free atmospheric co2 with rainwater forming acids i e carbonic acid h2co3 nevertheless most of the samples exhibited ph values within the range of permissible limits electrical conductivity ec is another important water quality parameter that indicates the suitability of water for both drinking and irrigation purposes values of ec in the pom period gm 283 1 187 6 μs cm 1 were slightly higher than those during prm periods gm 261 6 155 6 μs cm 1 this trend was similar to tds values which were between 60 50 and 374 0 mg l 1 gm 137 4 83 02 mg l 1 and 40 00 880 0 mg l 1 gm 178 5 145 6 mg l 1 in prm and pom periods respectively this may be due to the increase in ionic concentration resulting from various geochemical processes including dissolution of minerals percolation of salts from soils rainwater infiltration and other effects of anthropogenic activities during the pom period prasanth et al 2012 nematollahi et al 2016 sethy et al 2016 as far as observations of ionic concentrations are concerned the dominance order of major cationic concentrations in the study region follows na ca2 mg2 k sodium na ions are associated with the suitability of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes an increase in the na ion concentration decreases the permeability of the soil na ion concentrations ranged from 3 25 to 139 4 mg l 1 gm 37 88 26 17 mg l 1 in prm and from 6 46 to 137 0 mg l 1 gm 35 08 24 20 mg l 1 in pom no significant change in na ion concentrations was found between prm and pom periods and the values were observed to be within permissible limits mg2 concentration of groundwater in the field area varied from 1 56 to 80 25 mg l 1 gm 13 03 14 88 mg l 1 in prm and from 2 89 to 59 50 mg l 1 gm 14 86 12 47 mg l 1 in pom mg2 is essentially required for the activation of many enzymatic systems but in excess it may lead to diuretic and cathartic diseases keesari et al 2016 the dolomitic rock widely found in the study region might be responsible for the elevated concentration of mg2 in water samples k ion concentrations varied from 0 01 to 10 83 mg l 1 gm 0 40 1 67 mg l 1 in prm and from 0 16 to 7 90 mg l 1 gm 1 10 1 26 mg l 1 in pom all groundwater samples had k ion concentrations within the permissible limit of 12 mg l 1 who 2011 k ions serve as an important nutrient although excessive amounts may produce a laxative effect minerals such as microcline orthoclase and clay are the primary sources of k in groundwater hem 1985 keesari et al 2016 ca2 ion concentrations in the groundwater of the study area ranged from 0 66 to 123 8 mg l 1 gm 13 36 20 91 mg l 1 in prm and from 3 35 to 158 3 mg l 1 gm 20 99 23 04 mg l 1 in pom the ca2 levels in most samples exceeded the permissible limit of 75 mg l 1 who 2011 mineral weathering may be the chief source of ca2 in groundwater rezaei and hassani 2018 the order of anion dominancy in the groundwater of the study area follows hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f fluoride f ion commonly occurs in salts and minerals form in the earth s crust and in groundwater excessive intake of f ions may affect the bones and teeth leading to dental and skeletal fluorosis kumar 2012 ahada and suthar 2018 ali et al 2019 f ion concentrations in the groundwater of the study region ranged from 0 01 to 1 66 mg l 1 gm 0 14 0 30 mg l 1 in prm and from 0 01 to 4 58 mg l 1 gm 0 61 0 84 mg l 1 in pom during pom and prm most of the samples showed f ion concentrations within permissible limits but few samples from bastar sukma kanker and bijapur districts exceeded the limits the cause of f in groundwater is weathering and dissolution of f comprising rock minerals like fluorite cryolite topaz ferromagnesium silicate etc dahariya et al 2015 cl appeared to be distinctly higher in concentration among the anions present in groundwater the presence of cl ions in groundwater may be a consequence of the weathering of chloride containing rocks other source of cl in groundwater may be inorganic fertilizers saline residues in the soil and sewage water mullaney et al 2009 cl ion concentrations in groundwater samples ranged from 0 20 to 77 67 mg l 1 gm 3 70 13 22 mg l 1 in prm and from 1 36 to 140 28 mg l 1 gm 13 09 29 01 mg l 1 in pom sulfate so4 2 ion concentrations in the field area was confined within 0 10 10 83 mg l 1 gm 0 57 2 45 and 0 01 41 27 mg l 1 gm 0 48 6 86 mg l 1 in prm and pom respectively so4 2 ion concentrations were limited to the boundaries of the permissible limit of 200 mg l 1 set up by who for the samples of both prm and pom so4 2 ion in groundwater is derived from the precipitation of pyrite minerals major health issues related to so4 2 ion contamination in groundwater are diarrhea dehydration catharsis and gastrointestinal irritation etc keesari et al 2016 nitrate no3 ion is the most extensive contaminant prevailing in groundwater generally originating from anthropogenic sources such as agricultural activities krishna et al 2009 in the groundwater of the field area it was observed to be between 0 02 and 218 0 mg l 1 gm 1 27 32 77 mg l 1 in prm and between 0 01 and 135 25 mg l 1 gm 2 80 25 63 mg l 1 in pom most of the samples showed no3 ion concentrations within the permissible limit 50 mg l 1 bicarbonate hco3 usually corresponds to the alkalinity of groundwater carbonate rocks are a chief source of hco3 contamination in groundwater hco3 concentration in the field area ranged from 51 00 to 696 00 mg l 1 gm 224 82 129 08 mg l 1 in prm and from 24 to 881 mg l 1 gm 205 2 144 7 mg l 1 in pom most of the parameters of water quality were within the prescribed limits of who 4 2 spatiotemporal variability of major ions to compare the spatial variability of groundwater ionic components from the samples of two different seasonal periods prm and pom across the sites coefficients of spatial variation were calculated for different kinds of groundwater sources dw bw the overall mean of 38 122 and 160 measurements of dw bw and total groundwater sampling sites and the corresponding standard deviation were computed separately for prm and pom measurements the coefficient of spatial variation cv for each selected physicochemical parameter was obtained by dividing the standard deviation by the overall mean röösli et al 2001 and the values are shown in table 1 variations in the spatial variability coefficients of groundwater physicochemical parameters between prm and pom spatiotemporal variability were also plotted to examine the impact of rainfall on the variation of chemical characteristics in groundwater a mathematical factor value 1 was determined by dividing the coefficient of spatial variability for each chemical parameter of prm by the corresponding value of pom or vice versa moreover higher spatial variabilities in a specific seasonal period prm pom with a factor of 1 compared to the other seasonal period prm pom were plotted using origin 8 0 fig 2 so4 2 and tds showed 2 fold and 1 4 fold increments during pom compared to prm in the cases of both dw and bw this might be due to the reception of rainwater attributable to different types of soil chemistry involved spatial variability in bw f concentration was observed to be 1 4 fold higher in pom than prm this may be the reason for increased mineral dissolution during the increase in groundwater table in pom periods other species no3 cl na k ca2 and mg2 showed multi fold higher spatial variability in prm compared to pom in both cases of dw and bw cl k and ca2 showed more than 2 fold higher spatial variability in prm than those observed in pom for dw samples whereas in the case of bw only k showed 3 fold higher spatial variability in prm than in pom 4 3 hydrogeochemical facies the hydrogeological regime of any region can be examined by a piper plot using the concentrations of major anions and cations piper 1944 to understand the geochemical evolution and its chemical relationship with groundwater ionic components measured ionic concentration data of groundwater samples from different field locations were used to construct a piper trilinear diagram using the grapher software piper trilinear plots for prm and pom seasonal periods are shown in fig 3 on the basis of various cation and anion dominances depicted in the diamond plot of the piper diagram hydrogeological water was categorized into the following types i ca2 hco3 ii ca2 cl iii na cl iv na hco3 v ca2 mg2 cl vi ca2 na hco3 moreover cationic and anionic plots categorized the samples as follows i ca2 type ii na k type iii mg2 type iv no dominant type v hco3 type vi cl type vii so4 2 water type the diamond plot reveals that 39 of prm samples and 63 of pom samples fall under the ca2 hco3 facies while few samples fall under the na hco3 facies in contrast the cationic plot shows that 37 prm and 23 pom of the samples fall under the na k type 13 prm and 19 pom fall under the mg2 type and the remaining 50 of the samples of both prm and pom come under the no dominant type the anionic triangle plot reveals that most of the samples in prm and pom fall in the hco3 field the overall observations from the piper diagram address the dominance of ca2 hco3 water type in the study region and indicates that alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 surpass the concentration of na k alkali metals thus the chemical characteristics of groundwater were found to be controlled by weak acids and alkaline earth metals 4 4 hydrogeochemical process the composition of chemical species in groundwater is determined by mechanisms such as chemical weathering precipitation anthropogenic and various geogenic factors sethy et al 2016 gibbs diagram represents the relationship between lithological features of aquifers and groundwater composition gibbs 1970 gibbs plots show three distinct controlling mechanisms and sources of ionic components such as precipitation evaporation dominance and rock dominance gibbs ratio i represents cationic ratio as na k na ca2 whereas gibbs ratio ii shows anionic ratio as cl cl hco3 versus tds the analytical data of groundwater collected from the bastar division in the prm and pom periods were plotted in a gibbs plot fig 4 which shows that most groundwater samples were under the dominance zone of rock weathering for both sampling seasons this indicates that the groundwater of the field area is influenced by chemical weathering of rocks containing minerals which regulates the composition of cationic and anionic species in groundwater some samples also occur in the precipitation dominance zone atmospheric precipitation such as rain snow and hail is a diffusion source of pollution as they contain micro and macro elements which percolate down to the aquifer and influence groundwater chemistry hence the ionic composition of water in the field area is mainly regulated by lithological sources ions such as mg2 ca2 hco3 and so4 2 get dissolved in groundwater through the weathering process and their concentration is influenced by the mineralogy of the groundwater aquifer cation exchange is a major geochemical process that controls the existence and distribution of ions in groundwater cation exchange reflects the inter relationship between na and cl ions a variation in the concentration of na ion pertaining to cl ion indicates a cation exchange reaction a plot was drawn between na vs cl as shown in fig 5 a which shows that many of the samples in prm and pom seasons were near or below the equiline this indicates the depletion of cl with respect to na ion the higher concentration of the na ion indicates that silicate weathering might be a possible source of na in groundwater tiwari et al 2015 some of the sample plots above the equiline indicate that the concentration of cl ion may be probably higher due to the ion exchange process of na for mg2 and ca2 ions the scatter plot of hco3 so4 2 vs ca2 mg2 fig 5b shows that most of the samples fall below the 1 1 equiline for prm and pom accordingly the comparatively higher concentration of hco3 so4 2 ions than ca2 mg2 ions may be due to the presence of non carbonate source contributions towards balancing hco3 so4 2 by alkali ions through the ion exchange process tiwari et al 2015 samples near the equiline indicate that the dissolution of dolomite gypsum and calcite might be a major reaction in that system fisher and mullican 1997 samples above the equiline show that so4 2 and cl ion balances alkaline earth metal ca2 mg2 ions 4 5 correlation analysis the correlation analysis of 12 parameters is given in tables 2 and 3 for the pom and prm periods respectively the correlation coefficients for both prm and pom data were found to be statistically significant p value at 0 00005 and 0 00002 which are well within 0 05 with a 95 confidence limit strong correlation was observed between ca2 mg2 0 91 ec tds 0 88 ca2 f 0 84 mg2 f 0 79 mg2 hco3 0 79 ca2 hco3 0 75 and na hco3 0 61 in prm moderate correlation was observed between hco3 ec 0 59 f hco3 0 56 ec na 0 52 and tds hco3 0 51 the higher value of correlation among ca2 na mg2 and hco3 indicates that carbonate and silicate weathering is an analogous source of these ions in groundwater sethy et al 2016 the strong correlation between ca2 and hco3 illustrates the dissolution of ca rich rocks as the major source of ca2 ion in the groundwater of the study region rezaei and hassani 2018 the higher correlations 0 91 of ca2 and mg2 suggest that the major source of these ions may be dolomite precipitation jeevanandam et al 2007 the positive correlation of ec with tds 0 88 hco3 0 59 and na 0 52 revealed that the variation in the ec of groundwater depends upon the dissolution of salts the strong positive correlation between ca2 and f 0 84 shows that the major source of f in the groundwater of the field area is the weathering of fluoride containing rocks such as fluorite it was noted that during prm water chemistry was influenced by the weathering and dissolution of rock minerals during pom strong correlation was observed among mg2 hco3 0 74 ca2 mg2 0 76 ec tds 0 96 and ca2 f 0 80 moderate correlation was observed among mg2 f 0 55 mg2 no3 0 55 ca2 hco3 0 53 and f no3 0 52 for pom the positively moderate correlation of no3 with mg2 0 55 and f 0 52 indicates weathering of rocks along with leaching of contaminants due to anthropogenic activities rao 2006 weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks was found to be the major common source responsible for the positive correlation among ca2 na mg2 and hco3 ions chebbah and allia 2015 4 6 estimation of water quality for irrigation in the field area the chief source of irrigation is groundwater hence it becomes more important to estimate the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes in order to understand its effect on crop productivity the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes was evaluated by analyzing the ec na and sar values the results of these indices are presented in table s1 4 6 1 electrical conductivity electrical conductivity is an essential parameter which along with na concentration alkali hazard is considered important in categorizing irrigation water quality water used for irrigation has been categorized into five groups according to ec values handa 1969 higher ec promotes the formation of saline soil and higher na concentration in groundwater leads to alkaline soil rezaei and hassani 2018 the classification of irrigation water based on ec values is presented in table s1 it was observed that 47 95 and 52 05 of the water samples for prm and pom respectively fall in an excellent category whereas 52 05 and 54 02 fall in the category of good quality and none of the samples fall in the unsuitable category hence based on the ec values the groundwater of the field area is appropriate for irrigation purposes 4 6 2 sodium adsorption ratio sodium adsorption ratio sar is another major parameter for evaluating the quality of groundwater for irrigation purposes and it expresses the sodium hazard it is the proportion between na and alkaline earth metals i e the sar value of ca2 and mg2 sar signifies the relative extent of sodium absorbed by the soil the accumulation of na ions decreases the permeability of soil which causes an increase in the sar value and hence decreases water intake by plants the sar value is evaluated using the formula described below in eq 3 richards 1954 3 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 it is expressed in meq l 1 the sar value ranged between 0 13 and 5 13 meq l 1 with a mean of 2 05 meq l 1 in prm and it ranged between 0 24 and 7 39 meq l 1 with a mean of 77 meq l 1 in pom all the samples of groundwater throughout the course of prm and pom fell under the excellent category table s1 as shown in fig 6 sar alkali hazard values were plotted against ec salinity hazard on the us salinity diagram ussl 1954 samples plotted on the ussl diagram indicate that most of the samples belong to the c1s1 and c2s1 categories in prm and pom these values correspond to low sodium and low to medium salinity hazard and hence the groundwater of the study region is appropriate for irrigation nevertheless some samples in pom fell in the c3s1 category representing low sodium with moderate to high salinity hazard sethy et al 2016 4 6 3 sodium percentage sodium percentage na is a common index for estimating the water quality for irrigation purposes and it is an important factor for deciding the quality of irrigation water as na exchanges mg2 and ca2 resulting in the reduction of permeability and poor soil drainage system rusan et al 2007 saravanan et al 2016 sodium percentage was calculated using the formula given below and concentration of all the parameters are expressed in meq l 1 4 na n a k n a k c a 2 m g 2 100 the na of irrigation water was found to be between 5 56 and 80 32 with a mean value of 48 27 in prm while it ranged from 7 32 to 83 65 with an average value of 49 49 in pom the result obtained is presented in table s1 for both prm and pom 12 32 and 13 79 of total samples fell in the excellent category while 15 07 and 35 63 fell in the good category respectively in addition 46 57 and 33 33 of samples in prm and pom were in the permissible category whereas the remaining samples were doubtful and unsuitable for irrigation the excessive na in pom indicates the dissolution of rock as its major source saravanan et al 2016 to evaluate the quality of irrigation water na was plotted against ec in the wilcox diagram wilcox 1955 rezaei and hassani 2018 fig 7 most of the samples fell under the excellent and good categories in prm and pom respectively however some samples were in the permissible to doubtful categories 4 7 source apportionment using pca factor analysis of the groundwater geochemical data set was carried out to evaluate preliminary source factors of groundwater ionic contents to ascertain the main variables affecting the groundwater quality of the study region pca was applied to a normalized data set in order to check the appropriateness of the data for pca fa in prm and pom bartlett s sphericity test and kmo test were applied to the respective data set kmo values for prm and pom were 0 656 and 0 540 respectively similarly bartlett s sphericity values for pre and pom were 580 99 and 281 66 p 0 05 respectively this suggests a significant relationship between the variables and accuracy of pca fa varimax rotation was performed to reduce the overlapping of variables over principal components supplementary tables s2 s3 show the initial principal components their cumulative percentage and the percentage of variance of each possible principal component for prm and pom seasons respectively the corresponding varimax orthogonal rotation factor loading of nine groundwater parameters are shown in table 4 on the basis of kaiser s rule the first three components had eigenvalues 1 for both sampling seasons total variances in the prm and pom data sets were 78 and 64 respectively according to selvakumar et al 2017 factor loading values of 0 75 0 5 0 75 and 0 3 0 5 represent strong moderate and weak loading respectively the scree plot shown in fig s1 indicates that up to third component the slope of the scree plot changes from steep to shallow and has eigenvalues greater than 1 in both prm and pom therefore in the present study only the first three component factors were considered the first factor of pca signifies the most significant process regulating the hydrochemistry of the groundwater of the study area as it has a high eigenvalue as well as a high variance compared to all other factors varifactor 1 vf1 accounts for 39 33 and 27 98 of the total variance which shows strong and positive loading of mg2 ca2 and f this factor indicates the dissolution of mineral containing rocks such as fluorite and dolomite as the possible source of alkaline earth metals and f chen et al 2017 varifactor 2 vf2 accounts for 23 07 and 19 90 of the total variance in prm and pom respectively this indicates strong and positive loading for cl and no3 in both the sampling periods which indicates agricultural practices as the common source of these ions in groundwater hudak 2012 sethy et al 2016 the third varifactor vf3 constitutes 15 39 and 16 49 of the total variance in prm and pom respectively this factor represents positive and strong loading of na and k in prm and na and so4 2 in pom this may indicate the percolation of ions through soil due to the penetration of rain and surface water as the major and common source of these ions drever 1997 the rotational component of chemical species for prm and pom is shown in fig s2 4 8 source apportionment using pmf 5 0 pmf5 0 was executed and factor solutions were predicted forty random runs were used to recognize the feasible number of factors and the run with the minimum q value was retained for three factors norris et al 2014 to identify the apparent solution the agreement of estimated q value with its theoretical value qtheotetical was used the estimated q value decreased with an increasing number of factors the absolute number of endowing source factors was calculated by the concentration of loading species to a particular factor profile brown et al 2015 matawle et al 2016 solutions of three factors provided the most feasible results of groundwater to address the sources associated with chemical species datasets the source factor profiles extracted from pmf5 0 for prm and pom are presented using the percentage of individual species with respect to the sum of all species in figs 8 and 9 respectively and the concentration of species accompanying the source factors is given in fig 10 highly contributed species were used as an indicator of the definite source type for particular factors vossler et al 2016 the initial factor f1 was dominated by cl and no3 for prm and pom contributing 22 93 and 24 09 respectively this indicates that agricultural sources especially the percolation of fertilizer rich irrigation water may be a supplementary source of these ions in the groundwater of the field area hudak 2012 loh et al 2020 the second factor f2 showed higher loading of ca2 mg2 and f ions with 36 47 and 30 46 source contributions in the groundwater samples of prm and pom which indicates the source of fluoride rich mineral dissolution dahariya et al 2015 the third factor f3 showed higher loadings of na k so4 2 and hco3 in prm and pom contributing 40 6 and 45 45 of the source profile this indicates natural sources such as percolation of surface and rainwater through the soil as the main cause of the alkalinity of groundwater in both sampling periods narany et al 2014 sethy et al 2016 the average contributions of different sources of groundwater pollution which affect water quality in prm and pom seasons are displayed in fig 11 4 9 inter comparison of pca and pmf results the results of source apportionment estimated from pca and pmf 5 0 were qualitatively similar the results from both models indicate that the main sources are geogenic sources such as rock weathering and rock water interaction and natural sources such as the percolation of rain and surface water through the soil other sources related to the contamination of groundwater are possibly agricultural sources such as the leaching of water containing chemical fertilizers and pesticides and precipitation three contributing source factors were resolved from pmf for contamination of groundwater and each factor may comprise several similar kinds of sources a factor fingerprint was produced using pmf 5 0 fig 10 specified in the percentage factor loading of a particular chemical species in order to predict the marker species for all the obtained factors the kmo values and the scree plot generated from pca were used to select the number of factors or principal components 5 conclusion the fundamental objective of the present work was to analyze the groundwater chemistry of the tribal belt area of bastar india as well as to recognize the potential sources of contamination and their contribution the physiochemical properties show that groundwater in the field area was slightly acidic to mildly alkaline in groundwater samples the dominance order of cations and anions was found to follow na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f respectively in the field area a few regions showed higher concentrations of hco3 f no3 than their corresponding permissible limits the piper diagram discloses that most of the groundwater samples fall in the ca hco3 water type in both prm and pom periods the concentration of alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 in most of the samples exceeded the alkali metal na k concentration a comparative study was conducted on groundwater suitability for irrigation purposes in prm and pom using ec na and sar values together with the wilcox diagram and ussl salinity diagram the results showed that groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation the analysis demonstrated that there were certain sources affecting the water chemistry of the field area pca revealed three major contamination sources namely mineral dissolution agricultural activities and natural rainwater percolation the source factor contributions evaluated using pmf5 0 were found to be 25 30 36 and 40 45 for mineral dissolution agricultural activities and natural rainwater percolation respectively during the course of both prm and pom hence it can be concluded that the overall groundwater of the field area is appropriate for both drinking as well as for irrigation purposes few regions in the field area require groundwater treatment for higher levels of f and no3 nevertheless for improvement of water both quantitatively and qualitatively over exploitation of groundwater should be regulated and rainwater harvesting should be implemented for artificial recharge acknowledgment

cl and so4 2 ionic species exhibited distinct spatial variability patterns at the temporal scale of pre and post monsoon periods two source apportionment modeling techniques pca and pmf 5 0 based on factor analysis were applied to investigate the source routes of ionic components in groundwater three major contributing source routes were identified for the ionic components 1 mineral dissolution 25 2 agricultural activities 30 36 and 3 rainwater percolation 40 45 the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes was also evaluated by analyzing the electrical conductivity sodium percentage and sodium adsorption ratio the study will serve as an important reference for understanding groundwater chemistry and improving sustainable groundwater management planning in the tribal belt of the bastar region graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater spatiotemporal variability source apportionment principal component analysis positive matrix factorization 1 introduction a majority of the population in the rural and remote areas of india still rely on groundwater channels to fulfill the basic necessity of clean water for drinking and various household purposes clarke et al 1996 ahada and suthar 2018 geochemical processes have emerged as a key factor for the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater chemistry narany et al 2014 panneer et al 2017 rock water interaction anthropogenic activities industrial wastewater and agricultural activities are the primary sources responsible for groundwater contamination duong et al 2015 boateng et al 2016 bouderbala and gharbi 2017 various efforts have been made to investigate the quality of groundwater in india these efforts have mainly involved the physicochemical characterization of samples and determination of relationships between the chemical characteristics of groundwater and hydrogeochemical processes prasad and mondal 2008 puthiyasekar et al 2010 magesh and chandrasekar 2013 masih et al 2014 varghese and jaya 2014 bhowmik et al 2015 bhutiani et al 2016 krishna et al 2009 mahato et al 2016 saravanan et al 2016 loh et al 2020 owamah 2020 according to various reports ionic components are of greater concern compared to other contaminants because the relative strengths of ions in groundwater reflect various aspects of hydrogeochemical processes as well as indicate sources of groundwater contamination singh et al 2013 belkhiri and narany 2015 nematollahi et al 2016 sethy et al 2016 sharifi et al 2016 selvamkumar et al 2017 beyene et al 2019 ismail et al 2020 agriculture is the principal economic activity of the population in the study region in many places surface water is scarce and groundwater serves as the only substitute source of irrigation water nearly 35 of irrigation water has been reported to be sourced from groundwater considering the above issue the present work focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal variability and sources of major ionic species in groundwater samples collected from tribal belt of bastar india to identify possible sources of groundwater contamination and apportion the source contribution principal component analysis pca and positive matrix factorization pmf 5 0 modeling approaches were applied to database of sampled groundwater helena et al 2000 guo et al 2004 dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 gholizadeh et al 2016 pca is a technique that provides information according to the most significant factors with simple data representation it is used for the determination of data structure and also provides qualitative information about potential groundwater pollution sources however pca alone does not provide sufficient information about source contribution estimates guo et al 2004 to obtain detailed information about the relative source contribution estimates the pmf tool is applied 2 field area under observation and hydrogeological framework bastar the southern division of chhattisgarh was selected as the target study area it comprises seven districts namely bastar ba bijapur bj dantewada da kanker kk kondagaon kg narayanpur np and sukma sk fig 1 bastar extends from 80 35 e to 82 15 e latitude and from 17 46 n to 20 35 n longitude covering an area of 39 114 km2 the indravati river is the major river in the region lithologically granitoids granulites gneisses and mafic igneous suites mainly constitute the geology of the study region srivastava and gautam 2009 dora 2014 the soil type in the area is mainly alluvial laterite and loamy and the soil structure varies from clayey to sandy soil the soil ph varies from slightly acidic to slightly basic which favors teak and sal vegetation the forest cover accounts for 75 of the total area of the bastar region rainfall in the region is attributed to the southwest monsoon which usually occurs during june september the average annual rainfall recorded is 1387 mm and the temperature varies from almost 10 c during the winter season to 46 c in the summer season with a sub humid and moist climate the bastar region falls under the agro climatic region of the state of chhattisgarh singh et al 2011 in this region groundwater mostly occurs under phreatic conditions and in some regions it occurs in semi confined conditions the water table of the groundwater lies between 3 02 18 65 mbgl and 2 16 11 21 mbgl in the pre and post rainy seasons respectively ground water year book of chhattisgarh 2017 3 materials and method 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis following the stratified random sampling plan with a pooled study design gilbert 1987 160 water samples were collected from 95 locations 23 dug wells dw and 72 bore wells bw the depths of the dw were approximately 8 20 m and those of the bw were 65 90 m groundwater sampling was conducted in pre monsoon prm and post monsoon pom periods may november 2017 before collecting the bore well water samples column water was pumped out for at least 10 min continuously to remove stagnant water dug well water samples were collected approximately 1 m below the water surface for sample collection acidified pre washed 1 l polyethylene bottles were used physical parameters ph electrical conductivity ec temperature and total dissolved solids tds were measured instantaneously after collecting the sample from the sites using hanna made sensors singh et al 2013 varghese and jaya 2014 guo et al 2004 bottles were then immediately filled up to the rim and tightly sealed in order to avoid exposure to air samples were safely carried to the working place laboratory using an icebox and stored at 4 c in a deep freezer for further analysis major anions such as chloride cl nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 and fluoride f were analyzed using an ion chromatography instrument dionex ics 1100 equipped with anion separator column and dionex aers500 4 mm suppressor as an eluent for anions 23 mm koh was used and a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 was sustained while cations such as sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg were analyzed using the ion chromatography instrument dionex ics 1100 equipped with a cation separator column and dionex cers 500 4 mm suppressor 30 mm methane sulfonic acid was used as the eluent for the cations keesari et al 2016 the acid titration method was used to determine hco3 sethy et al 2016 3 2 data validation and statistical approaches replicate measurements for all selected ionic species were carried out to maintain the relative standard deviation within 10 to validate the analytical data of ionic components of groundwater samples the cation anion balance error was also calculated using charge balance error following the procedure reported by keesari et al 2016 most of the data were found to be within the acceptable limit of 5 analytical data of physicochemical parameters of groundwater samples were documented using geometric mean and standard deviation along with minimum maximum ranges pearson s correlation coefficient values were also computed between the measured physicochemical parameters of groundwater samples the correlation coefficient establishes the correlation among various measured physiochemical parameters responsible for the variation in water chemistry which is attributable to similar sources 3 3 source apportionment using receptor models 3 3 1 principal component analysis principal component analysis is a mathematics based tool used to convert possibly corrected variable sets of observations using orthogonal transformation it is used to evaluate the interrelationship between different data sets to abstract most of the significant factors with minimum loss of actual facts helena et al 2000 belkhiri and narany 2015 a similar tool is factor analysis which is used to address the variance among observed variables principal component analysis is expressed as eq 1 1 z ij α i 1 x 1 j α i 2 x 2 j α i 3 x 3 j α im x mj where z is the component score value x denotes the calculated value of the variable i is designated as a component number while j is the sample number m is the total number of variables and α is the component loading gholizadeh et al 2016 in pca principal components containing eigenvalues 1 are considered in this work pca fa models were applied to normalized hydrochemical data of prm and pom seasons the varimax rotation method was applied to exploit the sum of the square of loading each component to check equal variances in the given data the kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s tests were performed the kmo static values lie between 0 and 1 where values 0 5 are acceptable values between 0 5 and 0 7 are considered average values between 0 8 and 0 9 are good and values 0 9 are the best hutcheson and sofroniou 1999 the scree plot was used to fix the criteria for determining the number of factors pca was performed using the spss software 3 3 2 pmf model 5 0 positive matrix factorization is an analytical tool that splits input sample data matrices into factor contributions g and factor profiles f norris et al 2014 it is the most advanced method for analyzing factors and addresses the problem related to non optimal scaling the factor profiles need to be resolved to identify the sources it is among the most significant receptor models suggested by the usepa for source apportionment and has been used widely by researchers in recent years the method used has been described in more detail elsewhere paatero 1997 gholizadeh et al 2016 through the matrix algorithm of concentration and uncertainty for data sets pmf profiles and factor contributions were obtained by minimizing object function q in eq 2 2 q i 1 n j 1 m x i j k 1 p g i k f k j u i j 2 where uij denotes the uncertainty estimate of the jth size interval measured for the ith sample statistics showing the signal to noise ratio s n are included in pmf5 0 norris et al 2014 the s n ratio is used to classify species as good 1 weak 0 5 1 and bad 0 5 the possible source of pollution for each factor was estimated using the correlation among each variable and their percentage contribution in the particular group gholizadeh et al 2016 matawle et al 2016 the most important and unique feature of pmf is that it can weigh each data point without missing or excluding any species to reduce the effect of the species that is missing or below the detection limit the uncertainty can be adjusted 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater chemical characteristics groundwater geochemistry fluctuates over time as a function of physical and chemical parameters that are mainly influenced by local geology and anthropogenic activities matthess 1982 subramani et al 2010 seasonal variation and geology of the particular area seasonal variation occurs in the form of the rate of groundwater flow surface run off and rate of precipitation which affect groundwater and surface water concentration singh et al 2011 table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of measured ph values dissolved solids electrical conductance and selected ions in 160 groundwater samples collected from 95 locations in the bastar region during prm and pom periods along with the prescribed limits laid down by the world health organization who for groundwater quality who 2011 geometric mean is associated with the logarithmic transformation of the data used to normalize the ranges being averaged such that no ranges dominate the weighting standard deviation was calculated to understand the variation from the mean value separately for the prm and pom periods in the study region in water geochemistry the value of ph is an important factor in regulating the solubility alkalinity and complexation of various ions in groundwater normally ph values are found in the range of 6 0 9 0 in natural uncontaminated groundwater but they are influenced by atmospheric carbon dioxide and microbial activities teikeu et al 2016 keesari et al 2016 measured ph values in groundwater samples slightly varied between 5 4 and 8 1 gm 6 72 0 48 and 5 3 8 2 gm 6 52 0 49 during prm and pom periods respectively this indicates that the slightly acidic nature of groundwater in some areas might be due to the reaction of free atmospheric co2 with rainwater forming acids i e carbonic acid h2co3 nevertheless most of the samples exhibited ph values within the range of permissible limits electrical conductivity ec is another important water quality parameter that indicates the suitability of water for both drinking and irrigation purposes values of ec in the pom period gm 283 1 187 6 μs cm 1 were slightly higher than those during prm periods gm 261 6 155 6 μs cm 1 this trend was similar to tds values which were between 60 50 and 374 0 mg l 1 gm 137 4 83 02 mg l 1 and 40 00 880 0 mg l 1 gm 178 5 145 6 mg l 1 in prm and pom periods respectively this may be due to the increase in ionic concentration resulting from various geochemical processes including dissolution of minerals percolation of salts from soils rainwater infiltration and other effects of anthropogenic activities during the pom period prasanth et al 2012 nematollahi et al 2016 sethy et al 2016 as far as observations of ionic concentrations are concerned the dominance order of major cationic concentrations in the study region follows na ca2 mg2 k sodium na ions are associated with the suitability of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes an increase in the na ion concentration decreases the permeability of the soil na ion concentrations ranged from 3 25 to 139 4 mg l 1 gm 37 88 26 17 mg l 1 in prm and from 6 46 to 137 0 mg l 1 gm 35 08 24 20 mg l 1 in pom no significant change in na ion concentrations was found between prm and pom periods and the values were observed to be within permissible limits mg2 concentration of groundwater in the field area varied from 1 56 to 80 25 mg l 1 gm 13 03 14 88 mg l 1 in prm and from 2 89 to 59 50 mg l 1 gm 14 86 12 47 mg l 1 in pom mg2 is essentially required for the activation of many enzymatic systems but in excess it may lead to diuretic and cathartic diseases keesari et al 2016 the dolomitic rock widely found in the study region might be responsible for the elevated concentration of mg2 in water samples k ion concentrations varied from 0 01 to 10 83 mg l 1 gm 0 40 1 67 mg l 1 in prm and from 0 16 to 7 90 mg l 1 gm 1 10 1 26 mg l 1 in pom all groundwater samples had k ion concentrations within the permissible limit of 12 mg l 1 who 2011 k ions serve as an important nutrient although excessive amounts may produce a laxative effect minerals such as microcline orthoclase and clay are the primary sources of k in groundwater hem 1985 keesari et al 2016 ca2 ion concentrations in the groundwater of the study area ranged from 0 66 to 123 8 mg l 1 gm 13 36 20 91 mg l 1 in prm and from 3 35 to 158 3 mg l 1 gm 20 99 23 04 mg l 1 in pom the ca2 levels in most samples exceeded the permissible limit of 75 mg l 1 who 2011 mineral weathering may be the chief source of ca2 in groundwater rezaei and hassani 2018 the order of anion dominancy in the groundwater of the study area follows hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f fluoride f ion commonly occurs in salts and minerals form in the earth s crust and in groundwater excessive intake of f ions may affect the bones and teeth leading to dental and skeletal fluorosis kumar 2012 ahada and suthar 2018 ali et al 2019 f ion concentrations in the groundwater of the study region ranged from 0 01 to 1 66 mg l 1 gm 0 14 0 30 mg l 1 in prm and from 0 01 to 4 58 mg l 1 gm 0 61 0 84 mg l 1 in pom during pom and prm most of the samples showed f ion concentrations within permissible limits but few samples from bastar sukma kanker and bijapur districts exceeded the limits the cause of f in groundwater is weathering and dissolution of f comprising rock minerals like fluorite cryolite topaz ferromagnesium silicate etc dahariya et al 2015 cl appeared to be distinctly higher in concentration among the anions present in groundwater the presence of cl ions in groundwater may be a consequence of the weathering of chloride containing rocks other source of cl in groundwater may be inorganic fertilizers saline residues in the soil and sewage water mullaney et al 2009 cl ion concentrations in groundwater samples ranged from 0 20 to 77 67 mg l 1 gm 3 70 13 22 mg l 1 in prm and from 1 36 to 140 28 mg l 1 gm 13 09 29 01 mg l 1 in pom sulfate so4 2 ion concentrations in the field area was confined within 0 10 10 83 mg l 1 gm 0 57 2 45 and 0 01 41 27 mg l 1 gm 0 48 6 86 mg l 1 in prm and pom respectively so4 2 ion concentrations were limited to the boundaries of the permissible limit of 200 mg l 1 set up by who for the samples of both prm and pom so4 2 ion in groundwater is derived from the precipitation of pyrite minerals major health issues related to so4 2 ion contamination in groundwater are diarrhea dehydration catharsis and gastrointestinal irritation etc keesari et al 2016 nitrate no3 ion is the most extensive contaminant prevailing in groundwater generally originating from anthropogenic sources such as agricultural activities krishna et al 2009 in the groundwater of the field area it was observed to be between 0 02 and 218 0 mg l 1 gm 1 27 32 77 mg l 1 in prm and between 0 01 and 135 25 mg l 1 gm 2 80 25 63 mg l 1 in pom most of the samples showed no3 ion concentrations within the permissible limit 50 mg l 1 bicarbonate hco3 usually corresponds to the alkalinity of groundwater carbonate rocks are a chief source of hco3 contamination in groundwater hco3 concentration in the field area ranged from 51 00 to 696 00 mg l 1 gm 224 82 129 08 mg l 1 in prm and from 24 to 881 mg l 1 gm 205 2 144 7 mg l 1 in pom most of the parameters of water quality were within the prescribed limits of who 4 2 spatiotemporal variability of major ions to compare the spatial variability of groundwater ionic components from the samples of two different seasonal periods prm and pom across the sites coefficients of spatial variation were calculated for different kinds of groundwater sources dw bw the overall mean of 38 122 and 160 measurements of dw bw and total groundwater sampling sites and the corresponding standard deviation were computed separately for prm and pom measurements the coefficient of spatial variation cv for each selected physicochemical parameter was obtained by dividing the standard deviation by the overall mean röösli et al 2001 and the values are shown in table 1 variations in the spatial variability coefficients of groundwater physicochemical parameters between prm and pom spatiotemporal variability were also plotted to examine the impact of rainfall on the variation of chemical characteristics in groundwater a mathematical factor value 1 was determined by dividing the coefficient of spatial variability for each chemical parameter of prm by the corresponding value of pom or vice versa moreover higher spatial variabilities in a specific seasonal period prm pom with a factor of 1 compared to the other seasonal period prm pom were plotted using origin 8 0 fig 2 so4 2 and tds showed 2 fold and 1 4 fold increments during pom compared to prm in the cases of both dw and bw this might be due to the reception of rainwater attributable to different types of soil chemistry involved spatial variability in bw f concentration was observed to be 1 4 fold higher in pom than prm this may be the reason for increased mineral dissolution during the increase in groundwater table in pom periods other species no3 cl na k ca2 and mg2 showed multi fold higher spatial variability in prm compared to pom in both cases of dw and bw cl k and ca2 showed more than 2 fold higher spatial variability in prm than those observed in pom for dw samples whereas in the case of bw only k showed 3 fold higher spatial variability in prm than in pom 4 3 hydrogeochemical facies the hydrogeological regime of any region can be examined by a piper plot using the concentrations of major anions and cations piper 1944 to understand the geochemical evolution and its chemical relationship with groundwater ionic components measured ionic concentration data of groundwater samples from different field locations were used to construct a piper trilinear diagram using the grapher software piper trilinear plots for prm and pom seasonal periods are shown in fig 3 on the basis of various cation and anion dominances depicted in the diamond plot of the piper diagram hydrogeological water was categorized into the following types i ca2 hco3 ii ca2 cl iii na cl iv na hco3 v ca2 mg2 cl vi ca2 na hco3 moreover cationic and anionic plots categorized the samples as follows i ca2 type ii na k type iii mg2 type iv no dominant type v hco3 type vi cl type vii so4 2 water type the diamond plot reveals that 39 of prm samples and 63 of pom samples fall under the ca2 hco3 facies while few samples fall under the na hco3 facies in contrast the cationic plot shows that 37 prm and 23 pom of the samples fall under the na k type 13 prm and 19 pom fall under the mg2 type and the remaining 50 of the samples of both prm and pom come under the no dominant type the anionic triangle plot reveals that most of the samples in prm and pom fall in the hco3 field the overall observations from the piper diagram address the dominance of ca2 hco3 water type in the study region and indicates that alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 surpass the concentration of na k alkali metals thus the chemical characteristics of groundwater were found to be controlled by weak acids and alkaline earth metals 4 4 hydrogeochemical process the composition of chemical species in groundwater is determined by mechanisms such as chemical weathering precipitation anthropogenic and various geogenic factors sethy et al 2016 gibbs diagram represents the relationship between lithological features of aquifers and groundwater composition gibbs 1970 gibbs plots show three distinct controlling mechanisms and sources of ionic components such as precipitation evaporation dominance and rock dominance gibbs ratio i represents cationic ratio as na k na ca2 whereas gibbs ratio ii shows anionic ratio as cl cl hco3 versus tds the analytical data of groundwater collected from the bastar division in the prm and pom periods were plotted in a gibbs plot fig 4 which shows that most groundwater samples were under the dominance zone of rock weathering for both sampling seasons this indicates that the groundwater of the field area is influenced by chemical weathering of rocks containing minerals which regulates the composition of cationic and anionic species in groundwater some samples also occur in the precipitation dominance zone atmospheric precipitation such as rain snow and hail is a diffusion source of pollution as they contain micro and macro elements which percolate down to the aquifer and influence groundwater chemistry hence the ionic composition of water in the field area is mainly regulated by lithological sources ions such as mg2 ca2 hco3 and so4 2 get dissolved in groundwater through the weathering process and their concentration is influenced by the mineralogy of the groundwater aquifer cation exchange is a major geochemical process that controls the existence and distribution of ions in groundwater cation exchange reflects the inter relationship between na and cl ions a variation in the concentration of na ion pertaining to cl ion indicates a cation exchange reaction a plot was drawn between na vs cl as shown in fig 5 a which shows that many of the samples in prm and pom seasons were near or below the equiline this indicates the depletion of cl with respect to na ion the higher concentration of the na ion indicates that silicate weathering might be a possible source of na in groundwater tiwari et al 2015 some of the sample plots above the equiline indicate that the concentration of cl ion may be probably higher due to the ion exchange process of na for mg2 and ca2 ions the scatter plot of hco3 so4 2 vs ca2 mg2 fig 5b shows that most of the samples fall below the 1 1 equiline for prm and pom accordingly the comparatively higher concentration of hco3 so4 2 ions than ca2 mg2 ions may be due to the presence of non carbonate source contributions towards balancing hco3 so4 2 by alkali ions through the ion exchange process tiwari et al 2015 samples near the equiline indicate that the dissolution of dolomite gypsum and calcite might be a major reaction in that system fisher and mullican 1997 samples above the equiline show that so4 2 and cl ion balances alkaline earth metal ca2 mg2 ions 4 5 correlation analysis the correlation analysis of 12 parameters is given in tables 2 and 3 for the pom and prm periods respectively the correlation coefficients for both prm and pom data were found to be statistically significant p value at 0 00005 and 0 00002 which are well within 0 05 with a 95 confidence limit strong correlation was observed between ca2 mg2 0 91 ec tds 0 88 ca2 f 0 84 mg2 f 0 79 mg2 hco3 0 79 ca2 hco3 0 75 and na hco3 0 61 in prm moderate correlation was observed between hco3 ec 0 59 f hco3 0 56 ec na 0 52 and tds hco3 0 51 the higher value of correlation among ca2 na mg2 and hco3 indicates that carbonate and silicate weathering is an analogous source of these ions in groundwater sethy et al 2016 the strong correlation between ca2 and hco3 illustrates the dissolution of ca rich rocks as the major source of ca2 ion in the groundwater of the study region rezaei and hassani 2018 the higher correlations 0 91 of ca2 and mg2 suggest that the major source of these ions may be dolomite precipitation jeevanandam et al 2007 the positive correlation of ec with tds 0 88 hco3 0 59 and na 0 52 revealed that the variation in the ec of groundwater depends upon the dissolution of salts the strong positive correlation between ca2 and f 0 84 shows that the major source of f in the groundwater of the field area is the weathering of fluoride containing rocks such as fluorite it was noted that during prm water chemistry was influenced by the weathering and dissolution of rock minerals during pom strong correlation was observed among mg2 hco3 0 74 ca2 mg2 0 76 ec tds 0 96 and ca2 f 0 80 moderate correlation was observed among mg2 f 0 55 mg2 no3 0 55 ca2 hco3 0 53 and f no3 0 52 for pom the positively moderate correlation of no3 with mg2 0 55 and f 0 52 indicates weathering of rocks along with leaching of contaminants due to anthropogenic activities rao 2006 weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks was found to be the major common source responsible for the positive correlation among ca2 na mg2 and hco3 ions chebbah and allia 2015 4 6 estimation of water quality for irrigation in the field area the chief source of irrigation is groundwater hence it becomes more important to estimate the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes in order to understand its effect on crop productivity the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes was evaluated by analyzing the ec na and sar values the results of these indices are presented in table s1 4 6 1 electrical conductivity electrical conductivity is an essential parameter which along with na concentration alkali hazard is considered important in categorizing irrigation water quality water used for irrigation has been categorized into five groups according to ec values handa 1969 higher ec promotes the formation of saline soil and higher na concentration in groundwater leads to alkaline soil rezaei and hassani 2018 the classification of irrigation water based on ec values is presented in table s1 it was observed that 47 95 and 52 05 of the water samples for prm and pom respectively fall in an excellent category whereas 52 05 and 54 02 fall in the category of good quality and none of the samples fall in the unsuitable category hence based on the ec values the groundwater of the field area is appropriate for irrigation purposes 4 6 2 sodium adsorption ratio sodium adsorption ratio sar is another major parameter for evaluating the quality of groundwater for irrigation purposes and it expresses the sodium hazard it is the proportion between na and alkaline earth metals i e the sar value of ca2 and mg2 sar signifies the relative extent of sodium absorbed by the soil the accumulation of na ions decreases the permeability of soil which causes an increase in the sar value and hence decreases water intake by plants the sar value is evaluated using the formula described below in eq 3 richards 1954 3 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 it is expressed in meq l 1 the sar value ranged between 0 13 and 5 13 meq l 1 with a mean of 2 05 meq l 1 in prm and it ranged between 0 24 and 7 39 meq l 1 with a mean of 77 meq l 1 in pom all the samples of groundwater throughout the course of prm and pom fell under the excellent category table s1 as shown in fig 6 sar alkali hazard values were plotted against ec salinity hazard on the us salinity diagram ussl 1954 samples plotted on the ussl diagram indicate that most of the samples belong to the c1s1 and c2s1 categories in prm and pom these values correspond to low sodium and low to medium salinity hazard and hence the groundwater of the study region is appropriate for irrigation nevertheless some samples in pom fell in the c3s1 category representing low sodium with moderate to high salinity hazard sethy et al 2016 4 6 3 sodium percentage sodium percentage na is a common index for estimating the water quality for irrigation purposes and it is an important factor for deciding the quality of irrigation water as na exchanges mg2 and ca2 resulting in the reduction of permeability and poor soil drainage system rusan et al 2007 saravanan et al 2016 sodium percentage was calculated using the formula given below and concentration of all the parameters are expressed in meq l 1 4 na n a k n a k c a 2 m g 2 100 the na of irrigation water was found to be between 5 56 and 80 32 with a mean value of 48 27 in prm while it ranged from 7 32 to 83 65 with an average value of 49 49 in pom the result obtained is presented in table s1 for both prm and pom 12 32 and 13 79 of total samples fell in the excellent category while 15 07 and 35 63 fell in the good category respectively in addition 46 57 and 33 33 of samples in prm and pom were in the permissible category whereas the remaining samples were doubtful and unsuitable for irrigation the excessive na in pom indicates the dissolution of rock as its major source saravanan et al 2016 to evaluate the quality of irrigation water na was plotted against ec in the wilcox diagram wilcox 1955 rezaei and hassani 2018 fig 7 most of the samples fell under the excellent and good categories in prm and pom respectively however some samples were in the permissible to doubtful categories 4 7 source apportionment using pca factor analysis of the groundwater geochemical data set was carried out to evaluate preliminary source factors of groundwater ionic contents to ascertain the main variables affecting the groundwater quality of the study region pca was applied to a normalized data set in order to check the appropriateness of the data for pca fa in prm and pom bartlett s sphericity test and kmo test were applied to the respective data set kmo values for prm and pom were 0 656 and 0 540 respectively similarly bartlett s sphericity values for pre and pom were 580 99 and 281 66 p 0 05 respectively this suggests a significant relationship between the variables and accuracy of pca fa varimax rotation was performed to reduce the overlapping of variables over principal components supplementary tables s2 s3 show the initial principal components their cumulative percentage and the percentage of variance of each possible principal component for prm and pom seasons respectively the corresponding varimax orthogonal rotation factor loading of nine groundwater parameters are shown in table 4 on the basis of kaiser s rule the first three components had eigenvalues 1 for both sampling seasons total variances in the prm and pom data sets were 78 and 64 respectively according to selvakumar et al 2017 factor loading values of 0 75 0 5 0 75 and 0 3 0 5 represent strong moderate and weak loading respectively the scree plot shown in fig s1 indicates that up to third component the slope of the scree plot changes from steep to shallow and has eigenvalues greater than 1 in both prm and pom therefore in the present study only the first three component factors were considered the first factor of pca signifies the most significant process regulating the hydrochemistry of the groundwater of the study area as it has a high eigenvalue as well as a high variance compared to all other factors varifactor 1 vf1 accounts for 39 33 and 27 98 of the total variance which shows strong and positive loading of mg2 ca2 and f this factor indicates the dissolution of mineral containing rocks such as fluorite and dolomite as the possible source of alkaline earth metals and f chen et al 2017 varifactor 2 vf2 accounts for 23 07 and 19 90 of the total variance in prm and pom respectively this indicates strong and positive loading for cl and no3 in both the sampling periods which indicates agricultural practices as the common source of these ions in groundwater hudak 2012 sethy et al 2016 the third varifactor vf3 constitutes 15 39 and 16 49 of the total variance in prm and pom respectively this factor represents positive and strong loading of na and k in prm and na and so4 2 in pom this may indicate the percolation of ions through soil due to the penetration of rain and surface water as the major and common source of these ions drever 1997 the rotational component of chemical species for prm and pom is shown in fig s2 4 8 source apportionment using pmf 5 0 pmf5 0 was executed and factor solutions were predicted forty random runs were used to recognize the feasible number of factors and the run with the minimum q value was retained for three factors norris et al 2014 to identify the apparent solution the agreement of estimated q value with its theoretical value qtheotetical was used the estimated q value decreased with an increasing number of factors the absolute number of endowing source factors was calculated by the concentration of loading species to a particular factor profile brown et al 2015 matawle et al 2016 solutions of three factors provided the most feasible results of groundwater to address the sources associated with chemical species datasets the source factor profiles extracted from pmf5 0 for prm and pom are presented using the percentage of individual species with respect to the sum of all species in figs 8 and 9 respectively and the concentration of species accompanying the source factors is given in fig 10 highly contributed species were used as an indicator of the definite source type for particular factors vossler et al 2016 the initial factor f1 was dominated by cl and no3 for prm and pom contributing 22 93 and 24 09 respectively this indicates that agricultural sources especially the percolation of fertilizer rich irrigation water may be a supplementary source of these ions in the groundwater of the field area hudak 2012 loh et al 2020 the second factor f2 showed higher loading of ca2 mg2 and f ions with 36 47 and 30 46 source contributions in the groundwater samples of prm and pom which indicates the source of fluoride rich mineral dissolution dahariya et al 2015 the third factor f3 showed higher loadings of na k so4 2 and hco3 in prm and pom contributing 40 6 and 45 45 of the source profile this indicates natural sources such as percolation of surface and rainwater through the soil as the main cause of the alkalinity of groundwater in both sampling periods narany et al 2014 sethy et al 2016 the average contributions of different sources of groundwater pollution which affect water quality in prm and pom seasons are displayed in fig 11 4 9 inter comparison of pca and pmf results the results of source apportionment estimated from pca and pmf 5 0 were qualitatively similar the results from both models indicate that the main sources are geogenic sources such as rock weathering and rock water interaction and natural sources such as the percolation of rain and surface water through the soil other sources related to the contamination of groundwater are possibly agricultural sources such as the leaching of water containing chemical fertilizers and pesticides and precipitation three contributing source factors were resolved from pmf for contamination of groundwater and each factor may comprise several similar kinds of sources a factor fingerprint was produced using pmf 5 0 fig 10 specified in the percentage factor loading of a particular chemical species in order to predict the marker species for all the obtained factors the kmo values and the scree plot generated from pca were used to select the number of factors or principal components 5 conclusion the fundamental objective of the present work was to analyze the groundwater chemistry of the tribal belt area of bastar india as well as to recognize the potential sources of contamination and their contribution the physiochemical properties show that groundwater in the field area was slightly acidic to mildly alkaline in groundwater samples the dominance order of cations and anions was found to follow na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f respectively in the field area a few regions showed higher concentrations of hco3 f no3 than their corresponding permissible limits the piper diagram discloses that most of the groundwater samples fall in the ca hco3 water type in both prm and pom periods the concentration of alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 in most of the samples exceeded the alkali metal na k concentration a comparative study was conducted on groundwater suitability for irrigation purposes in prm and pom using ec na and sar values together with the wilcox diagram and ussl salinity diagram the results showed that groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation the analysis demonstrated that there were certain sources affecting the water chemistry of the field area pca revealed three major contamination sources namely mineral dissolution agricultural activities and natural rainwater percolation the source factor contributions evaluated using pmf5 0 were found to be 25 30 36 and 40 45 for mineral dissolution agricultural activities and natural rainwater percolation respectively during the course of both prm and pom hence it can be concluded that the overall groundwater of the field area is appropriate for both drinking as well as for irrigation purposes few regions in the field area require groundwater treatment for higher levels of f and no3 nevertheless for improvement of water both quantitatively and qualitatively over exploitation of groundwater should be regulated and rainwater harvesting should be implemented for artificial recharge acknowledgment

12172,fresh water is of vital importance and therefore the availability of water in urban areas has been a priority objective in the world for many years one of the greatest challenges related to any natural resource management process is to achieve the best possible compatibility between the ideal and the possible situations nowadays urban water management is a key objective particularly in intermediate cities of developing countries where human and economic resources in governmental agencies are limited so it is necessary to count with a tool as simple as possible in order to allow control efforts to be prioritised the aim of this paper is to develop a hazard index hi in order to identify which point sources of groundwater contamination need to be more frequently controlled and to recognise public supply wells that may be threatened this index was applied in mar del plata city located in the south east of the buenos aires province argentina the hi was defined as a weighted sum of three variables potential contamination load pcl effluent disposal mode ed and the distance from the point source to groundwater supply wells or well protection areas wp hi results for each point source showed that all buried fuel tanks soil and stone quarries present high hi as well as 2 of the industries on the other hand 90 of the inventoried industries and a landfill present the lowest hi values some recommendations based on two strategies mitigation or prevention are proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater contamination groundwater management point sources intermediate cities argentina 1 introduction in recent years environmental scientists planners and decision makers are paying attention to sustainable resource development jothibasu and anbazhagan 2018 within these resources fresh water is of vital importance and therefore the availability of water in urban areas has been a priority objective in the world for many years wwap 2003 wwap 2019 it could also be argued that nowadays management is likely a greater thematic preoccupation for groundwater researchers than climate change vadiati et al 2018 in this sense urban areas represent a challenge particularly in intermediate cities today intermediate cities are home to 20 of the world s population and one third of the total urban population in 2015 approximately 36 of the world s urban population lived in 8923 intermediate cities with population between 50 000 and 1 million inhabitants roberts et al 2016 they are also the fastest growing cities in the developing world and play a fundamental role in connecting both rural and urban areas through the so called peri urban areas which provide basic facilities and services gorelick and moktar 2018 bolay 2018 peri urban areas in these cities consist of informal land use patterns accompanied by impoverished or practically non existent public services with inferior quality of housing and bread line families living in poverty wandl and magoni 2017 in many latin american cities good quality drinking water does not reach all communities especially in peri urban areas pollution and contamination result from intensive land use and the lack of wastewater treatment and eutrophication due to nonpoint and point sources of nutrients water security is related to both water availability and pollution galizia tundisi 2015 in order to achieve water security for an area decision makers need to know not only the resource itself but also the environment and the possible impacts of their management decisions for that reason a good planning process should include social environmental economic and risk assessments van beek and lincklaen arriens 2014 in other words the groundwater resource which is a source of fresh water supply also turns out to be a sink of leachate that comes from the surface and that is generated by human activities in the vicinity of the wells thus to control or reduce the contamination threat to municipal water wells it is essential to take a proactive approach on urban land use foster and chilton 2004 foster et al 2011 foster and sage 2017 one of the strategies widely practiced in some developed countries is to establish protection areas around a well but its adoption has proved to be difficult in argentina massone et al 2011 paris et al 2017 paoli et al 2018 so once the protection areas are defined using simple or complex methodologies the implementation of the regulations and controls needs to identify contamination sources that are located within the perimeters or close to them in general during this step it is important to distinguish between point sources and non point sources the classification of the mode of disposal of potential contaminants as non point source and point source has been widely used despite its difficulties balderacchi et al 2014 the term point source is defined in section 502 14 of the clean water act epa 1972 as any discernible confined and discrete conveyance including but not limited to any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well discrete fissure container rolling stock concentrated animal feeding operation or vessel or other floating craft from which contaminants are or may be discharged this term does not include agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture some authors such as foster et al 2002 and alberti et al 2018 also recognise the so called multiple point sources mps where the contaminant load comes from a series of point sources that release a low contaminant mass are clustered within a relatively large area e g industrial district and consequently are difficult to identify in urban areas point contamination sources are more frequent than non point ones some of these point sources generate sewage or effluents that are discharged via land surface lagoons tanks pipes or in the sewer near or within well protection areas in this case beside the definition of well protection areas it would be necessary to use a decision support tool to define priorities to protect groundwater supply the aim of this paper is to develop a hazard index hi in order to identify which point sources of groundwater contamination need to be more frequently controlled and to recognise public supply wells that may be threatened mar del plata city head of general pueyrredon district argentina is used as a study case 1 1 study area the general pueyrredon district gpd is located by the atlantic ocean in the south east of the buenos aires province argentina fig 1 according to the national statistics and census institute indec it has a population of 618 989 living in an area of 1460 km2 mar del plata the head of this district is an intermediate city with an urban area of approximately 205 km2 sabuda 2018 it presents an important peri urban transitional zone with multiple land uses of about 340 km2 characterized by the advance of urban development on areas that were traditionally agricultural its economy is strongly led by the service sector within which the tourist sector stands out fishing is the main economic activity within the local primary sector that includes any industry involved in primary production e g farming forestry hunting fishing and mining mar del plata unloads tons of fresh fish every year which is then processed in local plants another important activity is the manufacturing industry the main industrial activity is food and beverages processing in which the fishing food industry stands out food industry is followed in order of importance by metalworking chemical textile and clothing manufacturing industries finally the mining activity in the district is related to the quartzite quarries where mar del plata stone is extracted and traded as seawall blocks ornaments etc 1 1 1 hydrogeology mar del plata is located on the north eastern side of the tandilia range which has a maximum altitude of about 400 m above mean sea level in the study area the range consists of lower palaeozoic orthoquartzites called balcarce formation dalla salda and iñiguez 1978 this orthoquartzitic bedrock considered as hydrogeological bedrock is overlain by a sedimentary cover of upper tertiary and quaternary silts and silty sandy sediments loess like sediments that compose the pampean aquifer it is a multi layered phreatic aquifer and the only water resource with sufficient availability to supply human consumption irrigation industrial use and other purposes with a thickness ranging from 40 to 70 m to the east in line with the urban area reaching more than 100 m to the west coinciding with the rural area its hydraulic conductivity is 10 m day its transmissivity is about 400 700 m2 day in the urban area and between 1000 1400 m2 day in the rural area the storage coefficient is 0 001 and the porosity between 5 and 10 auge et al 2004 the average rainfall in 1930 2005 was 895 mm year in this area according to thornthwaite s method the potential evapotranspiration pte is 733 mm year the surplus of rainfall over et is 162 mm year rainfall infiltration occurs between june october groundwater flows show a w e trend fig 2 so the natural discharge is towards the sea whereas artificial discharge takes place due to pumping bocanegra et al 2006 1 1 2 water supply and sanitation system 1 1 2 1 water supply in general pueyrredon district obras sanitarias sociedad de estado osse is responsible for the provision of drinking water service in this area the exploitation of the aquifer for urban supply began around 1913 with wells in the central area of the city and was gradually expanded as the demand grew this extraction relatively concentrated on areas next to the coast gave place to problems of saline intrusion which reached its highest expression between 1960 and 1970 as a result of this process the affected wells located in the city centre were abandoned and a group of new wells were enabled north aqueduct system massone and grondona 2018 according to current information in 2015 the aquifer was exploited through the operation of 284 extraction wells distributed in the north aqueduct system san 96 wells the south aqueduct system sas 26 wells and in other wells that injected their production directly to the distribution network urban wells currently the west aqueduct system sao is under construction fig 2 this is an infrastructure work that will allow the collection and transport of water from the basins located at the northwest end of the district it is planned to build 25 extraction wells in a first stage there will be 74 in total and 32 km of pipelines interconnected with the north and the south aqueduct systems there is another project in the southern area of the district called the austral aqueduct system saa that is under study fig 2 san wells have generated in the northern part of the urban area a depression cone that reaches 15 m fig 2 mérida 2002 nearly 97 of the population of mar del plata is provided with water from the running water system obras sanitarias sociedad de estado 2017 the highest water supply coverage percentages are in the central intermediate and northwest areas although numerous historical political and economic factors have hampered the implementation of a measurement system of household consumption in mar del plata it can be estimated that the per capita consumption is approximately 366 l inhab day massone and grondona 2018 1 1 2 2 sanitation osse also manages the sewage system that covers 97 of mar del plata city which includes 4 maximum collectors that lead to a treatment plant and then to a submarine outfall according to osse the percentage of wastewater receiving treatment following national standards is 100 massone and grondona 2018 2 methodological approach to protect groundwater supply sources in mar del plata city a hazard index hi was proposed equation 1 the hi was defined as a weighted sum of three variables that are intended to answer three questions a what is the potential contamination load of the effluent b how is the effluent disposed c how does the point source spatially relate to supply wells the hazard index hi is defined as 1 hi w pcl v pcl w ed v ed w wp v wp where w variable weight v variable value the potential contamination load pcl the effluent disposal mode ed the distance from the point source to groundwater supply wells or well protection areas wp as a first stage the inventory and spatial location of point sources of potential groundwater contamination was done in arcgis 10 2 esri 2013 from field survey information from government agencies i e local water authority website and previous research papers massone et al 2015 2 1 pcl potential contamination load following mazurek 1979 and foster et al 2002 methodologies a modified rating was assigned to each activity this rating from 1 to 9 considers the contamination potential load of each point source in accordance to the characteristics of the discharged effluent 9 represent the activities that generate a more potentially hazardous effluent table 1 industries were divided in subcategories according to their specific types some of them present in addition to a specific rating a range in which it can vary this is because there are activities that can generate different types of effluents according to the different production processes that they develop an example of this can be the textile industries within which there are industries that perform dyeing of garments effluents in this case differ from others from a textile industry that just manufactures garments without dyeing 2 2 ed effluent disposal mode all the inventoried activities were classified according to their effluent disposal mode ed some of these contaminant sources are located above the land surface and some of them are placed in the subsurface this aspect will affect contaminant transfer to the aquifer based on their effluent discharge mode four classes were considered discharges from land surface it does not include any effluent stabilization phase so it can infiltrate in a direct way subsurface sources it occurs in the unsaturated zone decreasing the possibility of attenuation or delay of the contaminants that can infiltrate foster et al 2002 effluent lagoons in spite of being a type of surface discharge these are usually under a waterproofed controlled system sewer effluents that are connected to the sewage network are isolated from the subsurface limiting effects on the aquifer in the last case the possibility of accidental losses ruptures in the sewer network was not considered in case of identifying a loss in the sewer network that point could be considered as a new point source and the hi could be calculated in this case the ed would get the maximum value which would be equivalent to the value of buried point source for example buried fuel tanks the pcl would get a value of 4 5 and wp should be calculated based on the spatial location of that leakage point 2 3 wp distance to well protection areas to answer the question how does the point source spatially relate to supply wells a relation between location of the point source and design of protection areas to protect public supply wells was carried out this variable as it was aforementioned was called well protection areas wp in a first stage well protection areas were defined using the calculated fixed radius method cfr protection areas for 50 100 and 365 days were designed for each well they represent a circle with centre at the well and radius equivalent to the distance of the horizontal transit time of the water in the saturated zone of the aquifer foster et al 2002 the 50 days area is defined as the microbiological protection according to the type of soil the unsaturated zone thickness and flow catchment these areas usually represent distances between 50 and 300 m carrica et al 2017 the 365 day areas correspond to the moderate protection zone which is intended to mitigate the polluting load of other potential discharges the radius for each zone was determined using equation 2 usepa 1993 2 r q t π b n 2 where r radius distance from well in meters q well maximum pumping rate m3 day t saturated travel times for each well capture zone 50 days 100 days and 365 days b saturated thickness of screened interval n porosity π 3 1416 then to extract the point sources that are within these protection areas a macro in ms excel environment was designed this macro matches the location of the point sources and the defined protection areas and gives as a result the identification of those point sources that are within the mentioned areas and the straight line distance to the well 2 4 hi variables weights and values the 3 variables were brought together in a weighted sum equation to calculate the hi of groundwater contamination for each point source weights and values were assigned as cost variables from 1 to 5 the higher the weight value the worse the situation table 2 ed was given the highest weight because it has been considered as a key variable in former studies foster et al 2002 wp has been weighted as the second most important variable because protection areas are related to contaminant transit time meaning that the lower the contaminant transit time the less likely it is for this contaminant to reduce its hazard finally pcl is the least heavily weighted variable because it is the least precise as can be seen in table 2 the values show that the worst situation is for those point sources of high pollution potential load that discharge in the subsurface and are within a 50 day protection area from the implementation of equation 1 it is possible to obtain the hi results for each point source these hi values range from 10 to 50 and were classified in arcgis 10 2 esri 2013 in 3 categories by natural breaks jenks and assigned qualitative labels that correspond to different priority actions table 3 high moderate and low with a traffic light code finally based on the obtained hi values recommendations are given to improve groundwater management 3 results 3 1 potential contamination load pcl 3 1 1 inventoried point sources of groundwater contamination the inventory of 832 point sources included industries 546 buried fuel tanks 93 cemeteries 4 waste disposal sites 6 soil quarries caves 113 stone quarries 19 and breeding grounds 51 a brief description of the inventoried point sources is made down below a industries 54 of them are dedicated to food production other important industrial fields are metal industries carpentries and textile industries 38 industries are located in an industrial park fig 1 while the rest of the establishments are distributed within the urban area on access routes to mar del plata city and particularly in an area close to the local port 92 are connected to sewer 0 5 count with treatment lagoons and the rest discharge their effluent to septic tanks b buried fuel tanks underground tanks in gpd belong to active and inactive petrol stations most of them are located in the urban area c solid waste disposal sites wds in gpd there are 6 waste disposal sites 5 uncovered dumps and a landfill it is important to mention that currently the landfill is the only operative disposal site for the disposition of approximately 700 tn day of solid wastes d caves and stone quarries mining as an economic activity in gpd has occurred since 1930 currently these activities are based on the exploitation of industrial stone mainly orthoquartzitic nowadays soil removal areas or caves for brick production are important in gpd these caves are of small dimensions from 2 500 m2 to 10 000 m2 and remove between 1 m and 2 5 m of the soil profile while stone quarries occupy more than 10 000 m2 and excavate more than 100 m of thickness of orthoquartzitic rock these are considered as point sources of contamination because of the possibility of becoming clandestine waste disposal sites e breeding grounds of the 51 identified breeding grounds most of them are located near the principal access routes to mar del plata city in the peri urban area except for a chicken breeding ground that is located in the urban area f cemeteries there are 2 public and 2 private cemeteries one of the public cemeteries is located in the urban area while the rest of them are located in the peri urban area recent research has indicated that cemetery soils also contain raised levels of inorganic salts and metals although some of these undoubtedly emanate from bodies a large component of metals might originate from the corrosion of burial materials such as coffins paiqa and delerue matos 2016 3 1 2 value based on table 2 a value was assigned to each identified point source regarding industries the majority are located within the urban area of mar del plata and their values are 1 3 or 5 buried fuel tanks are also located in the urban area and present a value of 5 cemeteries wds breeding grounds soil and stone quarries are located mainly in the peri urban area the first two present rating values of 1 and the last three values of 3 3 2 effluent discharge mode ed based on table 2 buried fuel tanks are assigned with a rating value of 5 breeding grounds 3 and cemeteries 1 wds soil and stone quarries are valued between 2 and 5 respectively 3 3 well protection areas wp the protection areas for 50 100 and 365 days were calculated for the 181 wells that were operating during 2016 21 wells present point sources within the calculated protection areas 24 are industries 7 are buried fuel tanks 2 breeding grounds and 1 soil quarry all of them valued between 3 and 5 3 4 hi calculation regarding hi results for each activity table 4 it can be highlighted that 90 of the inventoried industries and the landfill present the lowest hi class figs 3 and 5 most of these industries are in the urban area and discharge their effluents to the sewer the totality of cemeteries and waste disposal sites 8 of the industries and almost all breeding grounds present a moderate hi figs 3 5 all buried fuel tanks soil and stone quarries present a high hi as well as 2 of the industries mechanical workshops textile and metallurgical factories figs 3 5 the spatial distribution of the point sources shows that in the case of high hi there are three large groupings urban area southwest peri urban route 88 axis and west peri urban route 226 axis in the first one there is a direct threat to 14 supply wells from the urban area in the second group 5 supply wells from the sas are under potential threat while the third grouping could be affecting based on the groundwater flow direction fig 2 some western wells from the san fig 6 sources with moderate hi present a cluster in the northwest area this group is important because it is located in the zone where wells of the new sao are being built point sources with moderate hi located on the southwest peri urban area may threaten wells in the sas finally sources located at the northwestern and southwestern end of the peri urban area could pose a threat to san and future saa wells the low hi sources are concentrated in the urban area and the industrial park fig 1 because these sources industries connected to sewers a threat to the public water supply system is not contemplated 3 4 1 sensitivity analysis in order to analyze how the change of assigned weights in eq 1 can affect the hi result a sensitivity analysis was performed considering three alternatives table 5 the range of values for the hi in the 3 cases is between 10 and 50 the hi alternative with equal weights presents a very important increase in the point sources categorized as moderate which is the most inaccurate category for decision making this shows that the hi index is sensitive to changes in the ed weighting which has been especially suggested with the highest value precisely to highlight the influence of the mode of disposal of pollutant loads caused by specific activities in the definition of the contamination hazard 3 5 recommendations the recommendations are based on 2 strategies mitigation or prevention the first case mitigation consists on favoring a reduction of the hi e g moving from red to yellow prevention is applied to avoid a negative migration of hi yellow to red green to yellow 3 5 1 point sources with high hi industries the high hi is given for not being connected to the sewer having a high pcl value and or falling into well protection areas mitigation for economic reasons the extension of the sewage network is not feasible in the short or medium term but it could be a long term strategy for those that are located within protection areas an option would be to relocate the industry but this would be a measure of very low feasibility mainly for socio economic reasons therefore wells 330 and 332 should be carefully controlled and their replacement should be eventually contemplated prevention proactive monitoring to detect potential contaminant plumes before reaching the water supply well all industries with high hi need more frequent monitoring by government control authorities or agencies e g through audits in the quality and the effluent discharge mode buried fuel tanks the combination of high pcl and subsurface effluent disposition means that these point sources will always present a high hi even if they are not located within a protection area there are 7 wells in the urban area that may be compromised by having point sources within their protection area the worst case is well 209 with 2 point sources in this situation prevention some prevention measures could be establishing a periodic inspection of the tanks tightness implementing measures of tank withdrawal and remediation when the activity ceases and monitoring the compromised wells soil quarries these point sources present a high hi mainly because of the subsurface disposal mode of their effluents refilling the used place and reconstructing the original topography to change this situation is practically impossible the wp variable has a minor incidence in the final index since only one soil quarry is located within a protection area it is necessary to prevent the transformation of these areas into clandestine waste disposal sites by establishing measures such as the emplacement of a perimeter fence to avoid access to them stone quarries as mentioned for soil quarries a prevention measure to avoid the transformation of these areas into clandestine waste disposal sites could be the emplacement of a perimeter fence to prevent the entry of people 3 5 2 point sources with moderate hi industries 11 are located within a protection area in the urban zone the most compromised well is 90 with 3 industries in its protection area and secondly well 139 with 2 the rest 33 industries are not connected to the sewer network and are not present in a protection area the only alternative to migrate from a moderate hi to low hi yellow to green is to extend the sewer network which would be very low feasibility measure in a short period of time so monitoring possible contamination plumes is recommended cemeteries none is located within protection areas waste disposal sites none is located within protection areas however depending on the flow direction there are three wells that could be threatened 214 333 and 330 so proactive monitoring to detect potential contaminant plumes before reaching the water supply well is recommended breeding grounds none of these breeding grounds is located within a protection area the wells that could be more compromised are 216 333 286 148 and 149 taking into account the effluent disposal mode of these point sources some control measures must be considered e g proactive monitoring regarding control of water supply wells it is necessary to prioritize monitoring in the following wells of the urban area and eventually foresee their substitution as a management alternative 209 297 253 250 240 139 90 117 86 325 101 318 277 140 outside the urban area of the sas wells 332 237 330 298 279 and of the san well 157 the presence of 5 point sources in the sao area should be considered for the purposes of avoiding interference with the new wells as a management measure in the medium term future saa well perforations should contemplate the location of the point sources present in the extreme south west sector of the peri urban area 4 discussion and conclusions one of the greatest challenges related to any natural resource management process is to achieve the best possible compatibility between the ideal and the possible situations there is no doubt that the safest way to achieve absolute protection against groundwater contamination would be to stop all type of potentially contaminating activities nevertheless this would be impossible to carry out due to political technical and most of all economic implications wang 2006 expósito et al 2010 fikru 2014 so if it is not feasible to stop contaminating activities it is necessary to count with a tool that allows identifying in which of these activities it is necessary to prioritize control audits by government agencies there is an important diversity of methodological approaches tools to deal with prevention of groundwater contamination issue many of which are entirely quantitative such as mathematical flow models transport and evolution of pollution plumes such approaches can be useful for detailed risk assessment but are of limited value to groundwater managers who need to achieve proactive and timely groundwater protection across extensive groundwater basins somaratne et al 2013 on the other end are the most simple and totally qualitative methodologies of assigning a label depending on the land use zaporozec 2004 and finally a series of intermediate methodologies that are generally known as index methods within them the most popular are those that are used for the assessment of the aquifer vulnerability for example several modifications to the methods of drastic and god given the shortage of technical and human resources that government agencies often have particularly in developing countries this tool should be as simple as possible in order to allow control efforts to be hierarchically concentrated in principle an index composed of the sum of three weighted variables appears as something possible to apply regardless of the limitations discussed before weighted sum methods for obtaining an index have already been used with other applications in aspects related to water management aller et al 1987 foster et al 2002 and are useful because of their balance between simplicity and efficiency and for being flexible enough to facilitate adaptation to different study areas modifications of weights or values can be made from consensus among stakeholders i e delphi method nowadays technology makes spatial localization of point sources and public supply wells a simple process that can be done even with free software pcl and ed variables only need as data source a basic knowledge of the potentially contaminating activity and its effluent disposal mode information that is usually available the wp variable is the most complex to obtain in the first place although the cfr method is the simplest method to design well protection areas it requires specific technical data related to the aquifer and pumped flows in the second place the process of identifying point sources that are within protection areas is very tedious if computer support is not available in this sense a simple ms excel macro developed for this paper turned out to be very effective the improvement of the proposed method with regard to the use of mathematical models is that it is simpler so it adapts to areas where resources of different types are limited by comparing it with qualitative methods the hi calculation is more precise in regard to its advantages with respect to other indexes the approach to the problem is novel because it contemplates the linking of pollutant load with protection areas and it is intended not to identify areas that present greater or lesser potential hazard but punctually sources that require more control by government authorities and or wells that are in a situation of potential pollution risk for example regarding industries of the 546 that were identified there are 53 that should be controlled with prior attention and of these 53 there are 9 that require high priority actions of the 181 wells there are 20 that require immediate control actions while this index is applied to a local study area it is replicable to other intermediate cities at least in latin america and the caribbean where socio economic contexts are similar moreover as mentioned in the introduction these cities share the presence of multi activity peri urban areas where control by the authorities becomes more complex given the number and diversity of point sources of potential groundwater contamination declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12172,fresh water is of vital importance and therefore the availability of water in urban areas has been a priority objective in the world for many years one of the greatest challenges related to any natural resource management process is to achieve the best possible compatibility between the ideal and the possible situations nowadays urban water management is a key objective particularly in intermediate cities of developing countries where human and economic resources in governmental agencies are limited so it is necessary to count with a tool as simple as possible in order to allow control efforts to be prioritised the aim of this paper is to develop a hazard index hi in order to identify which point sources of groundwater contamination need to be more frequently controlled and to recognise public supply wells that may be threatened this index was applied in mar del plata city located in the south east of the buenos aires province argentina the hi was defined as a weighted sum of three variables potential contamination load pcl effluent disposal mode ed and the distance from the point source to groundwater supply wells or well protection areas wp hi results for each point source showed that all buried fuel tanks soil and stone quarries present high hi as well as 2 of the industries on the other hand 90 of the inventoried industries and a landfill present the lowest hi values some recommendations based on two strategies mitigation or prevention are proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater contamination groundwater management point sources intermediate cities argentina 1 introduction in recent years environmental scientists planners and decision makers are paying attention to sustainable resource development jothibasu and anbazhagan 2018 within these resources fresh water is of vital importance and therefore the availability of water in urban areas has been a priority objective in the world for many years wwap 2003 wwap 2019 it could also be argued that nowadays management is likely a greater thematic preoccupation for groundwater researchers than climate change vadiati et al 2018 in this sense urban areas represent a challenge particularly in intermediate cities today intermediate cities are home to 20 of the world s population and one third of the total urban population in 2015 approximately 36 of the world s urban population lived in 8923 intermediate cities with population between 50 000 and 1 million inhabitants roberts et al 2016 they are also the fastest growing cities in the developing world and play a fundamental role in connecting both rural and urban areas through the so called peri urban areas which provide basic facilities and services gorelick and moktar 2018 bolay 2018 peri urban areas in these cities consist of informal land use patterns accompanied by impoverished or practically non existent public services with inferior quality of housing and bread line families living in poverty wandl and magoni 2017 in many latin american cities good quality drinking water does not reach all communities especially in peri urban areas pollution and contamination result from intensive land use and the lack of wastewater treatment and eutrophication due to nonpoint and point sources of nutrients water security is related to both water availability and pollution galizia tundisi 2015 in order to achieve water security for an area decision makers need to know not only the resource itself but also the environment and the possible impacts of their management decisions for that reason a good planning process should include social environmental economic and risk assessments van beek and lincklaen arriens 2014 in other words the groundwater resource which is a source of fresh water supply also turns out to be a sink of leachate that comes from the surface and that is generated by human activities in the vicinity of the wells thus to control or reduce the contamination threat to municipal water wells it is essential to take a proactive approach on urban land use foster and chilton 2004 foster et al 2011 foster and sage 2017 one of the strategies widely practiced in some developed countries is to establish protection areas around a well but its adoption has proved to be difficult in argentina massone et al 2011 paris et al 2017 paoli et al 2018 so once the protection areas are defined using simple or complex methodologies the implementation of the regulations and controls needs to identify contamination sources that are located within the perimeters or close to them in general during this step it is important to distinguish between point sources and non point sources the classification of the mode of disposal of potential contaminants as non point source and point source has been widely used despite its difficulties balderacchi et al 2014 the term point source is defined in section 502 14 of the clean water act epa 1972 as any discernible confined and discrete conveyance including but not limited to any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well discrete fissure container rolling stock concentrated animal feeding operation or vessel or other floating craft from which contaminants are or may be discharged this term does not include agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture some authors such as foster et al 2002 and alberti et al 2018 also recognise the so called multiple point sources mps where the contaminant load comes from a series of point sources that release a low contaminant mass are clustered within a relatively large area e g industrial district and consequently are difficult to identify in urban areas point contamination sources are more frequent than non point ones some of these point sources generate sewage or effluents that are discharged via land surface lagoons tanks pipes or in the sewer near or within well protection areas in this case beside the definition of well protection areas it would be necessary to use a decision support tool to define priorities to protect groundwater supply the aim of this paper is to develop a hazard index hi in order to identify which point sources of groundwater contamination need to be more frequently controlled and to recognise public supply wells that may be threatened mar del plata city head of general pueyrredon district argentina is used as a study case 1 1 study area the general pueyrredon district gpd is located by the atlantic ocean in the south east of the buenos aires province argentina fig 1 according to the national statistics and census institute indec it has a population of 618 989 living in an area of 1460 km2 mar del plata the head of this district is an intermediate city with an urban area of approximately 205 km2 sabuda 2018 it presents an important peri urban transitional zone with multiple land uses of about 340 km2 characterized by the advance of urban development on areas that were traditionally agricultural its economy is strongly led by the service sector within which the tourist sector stands out fishing is the main economic activity within the local primary sector that includes any industry involved in primary production e g farming forestry hunting fishing and mining mar del plata unloads tons of fresh fish every year which is then processed in local plants another important activity is the manufacturing industry the main industrial activity is food and beverages processing in which the fishing food industry stands out food industry is followed in order of importance by metalworking chemical textile and clothing manufacturing industries finally the mining activity in the district is related to the quartzite quarries where mar del plata stone is extracted and traded as seawall blocks ornaments etc 1 1 1 hydrogeology mar del plata is located on the north eastern side of the tandilia range which has a maximum altitude of about 400 m above mean sea level in the study area the range consists of lower palaeozoic orthoquartzites called balcarce formation dalla salda and iñiguez 1978 this orthoquartzitic bedrock considered as hydrogeological bedrock is overlain by a sedimentary cover of upper tertiary and quaternary silts and silty sandy sediments loess like sediments that compose the pampean aquifer it is a multi layered phreatic aquifer and the only water resource with sufficient availability to supply human consumption irrigation industrial use and other purposes with a thickness ranging from 40 to 70 m to the east in line with the urban area reaching more than 100 m to the west coinciding with the rural area its hydraulic conductivity is 10 m day its transmissivity is about 400 700 m2 day in the urban area and between 1000 1400 m2 day in the rural area the storage coefficient is 0 001 and the porosity between 5 and 10 auge et al 2004 the average rainfall in 1930 2005 was 895 mm year in this area according to thornthwaite s method the potential evapotranspiration pte is 733 mm year the surplus of rainfall over et is 162 mm year rainfall infiltration occurs between june october groundwater flows show a w e trend fig 2 so the natural discharge is towards the sea whereas artificial discharge takes place due to pumping bocanegra et al 2006 1 1 2 water supply and sanitation system 1 1 2 1 water supply in general pueyrredon district obras sanitarias sociedad de estado osse is responsible for the provision of drinking water service in this area the exploitation of the aquifer for urban supply began around 1913 with wells in the central area of the city and was gradually expanded as the demand grew this extraction relatively concentrated on areas next to the coast gave place to problems of saline intrusion which reached its highest expression between 1960 and 1970 as a result of this process the affected wells located in the city centre were abandoned and a group of new wells were enabled north aqueduct system massone and grondona 2018 according to current information in 2015 the aquifer was exploited through the operation of 284 extraction wells distributed in the north aqueduct system san 96 wells the south aqueduct system sas 26 wells and in other wells that injected their production directly to the distribution network urban wells currently the west aqueduct system sao is under construction fig 2 this is an infrastructure work that will allow the collection and transport of water from the basins located at the northwest end of the district it is planned to build 25 extraction wells in a first stage there will be 74 in total and 32 km of pipelines interconnected with the north and the south aqueduct systems there is another project in the southern area of the district called the austral aqueduct system saa that is under study fig 2 san wells have generated in the northern part of the urban area a depression cone that reaches 15 m fig 2 mérida 2002 nearly 97 of the population of mar del plata is provided with water from the running water system obras sanitarias sociedad de estado 2017 the highest water supply coverage percentages are in the central intermediate and northwest areas although numerous historical political and economic factors have hampered the implementation of a measurement system of household consumption in mar del plata it can be estimated that the per capita consumption is approximately 366 l inhab day massone and grondona 2018 1 1 2 2 sanitation osse also manages the sewage system that covers 97 of mar del plata city which includes 4 maximum collectors that lead to a treatment plant and then to a submarine outfall according to osse the percentage of wastewater receiving treatment following national standards is 100 massone and grondona 2018 2 methodological approach to protect groundwater supply sources in mar del plata city a hazard index hi was proposed equation 1 the hi was defined as a weighted sum of three variables that are intended to answer three questions a what is the potential contamination load of the effluent b how is the effluent disposed c how does the point source spatially relate to supply wells the hazard index hi is defined as 1 hi w pcl v pcl w ed v ed w wp v wp where w variable weight v variable value the potential contamination load pcl the effluent disposal mode ed the distance from the point source to groundwater supply wells or well protection areas wp as a first stage the inventory and spatial location of point sources of potential groundwater contamination was done in arcgis 10 2 esri 2013 from field survey information from government agencies i e local water authority website and previous research papers massone et al 2015 2 1 pcl potential contamination load following mazurek 1979 and foster et al 2002 methodologies a modified rating was assigned to each activity this rating from 1 to 9 considers the contamination potential load of each point source in accordance to the characteristics of the discharged effluent 9 represent the activities that generate a more potentially hazardous effluent table 1 industries were divided in subcategories according to their specific types some of them present in addition to a specific rating a range in which it can vary this is because there are activities that can generate different types of effluents according to the different production processes that they develop an example of this can be the textile industries within which there are industries that perform dyeing of garments effluents in this case differ from others from a textile industry that just manufactures garments without dyeing 2 2 ed effluent disposal mode all the inventoried activities were classified according to their effluent disposal mode ed some of these contaminant sources are located above the land surface and some of them are placed in the subsurface this aspect will affect contaminant transfer to the aquifer based on their effluent discharge mode four classes were considered discharges from land surface it does not include any effluent stabilization phase so it can infiltrate in a direct way subsurface sources it occurs in the unsaturated zone decreasing the possibility of attenuation or delay of the contaminants that can infiltrate foster et al 2002 effluent lagoons in spite of being a type of surface discharge these are usually under a waterproofed controlled system sewer effluents that are connected to the sewage network are isolated from the subsurface limiting effects on the aquifer in the last case the possibility of accidental losses ruptures in the sewer network was not considered in case of identifying a loss in the sewer network that point could be considered as a new point source and the hi could be calculated in this case the ed would get the maximum value which would be equivalent to the value of buried point source for example buried fuel tanks the pcl would get a value of 4 5 and wp should be calculated based on the spatial location of that leakage point 2 3 wp distance to well protection areas to answer the question how does the point source spatially relate to supply wells a relation between location of the point source and design of protection areas to protect public supply wells was carried out this variable as it was aforementioned was called well protection areas wp in a first stage well protection areas were defined using the calculated fixed radius method cfr protection areas for 50 100 and 365 days were designed for each well they represent a circle with centre at the well and radius equivalent to the distance of the horizontal transit time of the water in the saturated zone of the aquifer foster et al 2002 the 50 days area is defined as the microbiological protection according to the type of soil the unsaturated zone thickness and flow catchment these areas usually represent distances between 50 and 300 m carrica et al 2017 the 365 day areas correspond to the moderate protection zone which is intended to mitigate the polluting load of other potential discharges the radius for each zone was determined using equation 2 usepa 1993 2 r q t π b n 2 where r radius distance from well in meters q well maximum pumping rate m3 day t saturated travel times for each well capture zone 50 days 100 days and 365 days b saturated thickness of screened interval n porosity π 3 1416 then to extract the point sources that are within these protection areas a macro in ms excel environment was designed this macro matches the location of the point sources and the defined protection areas and gives as a result the identification of those point sources that are within the mentioned areas and the straight line distance to the well 2 4 hi variables weights and values the 3 variables were brought together in a weighted sum equation to calculate the hi of groundwater contamination for each point source weights and values were assigned as cost variables from 1 to 5 the higher the weight value the worse the situation table 2 ed was given the highest weight because it has been considered as a key variable in former studies foster et al 2002 wp has been weighted as the second most important variable because protection areas are related to contaminant transit time meaning that the lower the contaminant transit time the less likely it is for this contaminant to reduce its hazard finally pcl is the least heavily weighted variable because it is the least precise as can be seen in table 2 the values show that the worst situation is for those point sources of high pollution potential load that discharge in the subsurface and are within a 50 day protection area from the implementation of equation 1 it is possible to obtain the hi results for each point source these hi values range from 10 to 50 and were classified in arcgis 10 2 esri 2013 in 3 categories by natural breaks jenks and assigned qualitative labels that correspond to different priority actions table 3 high moderate and low with a traffic light code finally based on the obtained hi values recommendations are given to improve groundwater management 3 results 3 1 potential contamination load pcl 3 1 1 inventoried point sources of groundwater contamination the inventory of 832 point sources included industries 546 buried fuel tanks 93 cemeteries 4 waste disposal sites 6 soil quarries caves 113 stone quarries 19 and breeding grounds 51 a brief description of the inventoried point sources is made down below a industries 54 of them are dedicated to food production other important industrial fields are metal industries carpentries and textile industries 38 industries are located in an industrial park fig 1 while the rest of the establishments are distributed within the urban area on access routes to mar del plata city and particularly in an area close to the local port 92 are connected to sewer 0 5 count with treatment lagoons and the rest discharge their effluent to septic tanks b buried fuel tanks underground tanks in gpd belong to active and inactive petrol stations most of them are located in the urban area c solid waste disposal sites wds in gpd there are 6 waste disposal sites 5 uncovered dumps and a landfill it is important to mention that currently the landfill is the only operative disposal site for the disposition of approximately 700 tn day of solid wastes d caves and stone quarries mining as an economic activity in gpd has occurred since 1930 currently these activities are based on the exploitation of industrial stone mainly orthoquartzitic nowadays soil removal areas or caves for brick production are important in gpd these caves are of small dimensions from 2 500 m2 to 10 000 m2 and remove between 1 m and 2 5 m of the soil profile while stone quarries occupy more than 10 000 m2 and excavate more than 100 m of thickness of orthoquartzitic rock these are considered as point sources of contamination because of the possibility of becoming clandestine waste disposal sites e breeding grounds of the 51 identified breeding grounds most of them are located near the principal access routes to mar del plata city in the peri urban area except for a chicken breeding ground that is located in the urban area f cemeteries there are 2 public and 2 private cemeteries one of the public cemeteries is located in the urban area while the rest of them are located in the peri urban area recent research has indicated that cemetery soils also contain raised levels of inorganic salts and metals although some of these undoubtedly emanate from bodies a large component of metals might originate from the corrosion of burial materials such as coffins paiqa and delerue matos 2016 3 1 2 value based on table 2 a value was assigned to each identified point source regarding industries the majority are located within the urban area of mar del plata and their values are 1 3 or 5 buried fuel tanks are also located in the urban area and present a value of 5 cemeteries wds breeding grounds soil and stone quarries are located mainly in the peri urban area the first two present rating values of 1 and the last three values of 3 3 2 effluent discharge mode ed based on table 2 buried fuel tanks are assigned with a rating value of 5 breeding grounds 3 and cemeteries 1 wds soil and stone quarries are valued between 2 and 5 respectively 3 3 well protection areas wp the protection areas for 50 100 and 365 days were calculated for the 181 wells that were operating during 2016 21 wells present point sources within the calculated protection areas 24 are industries 7 are buried fuel tanks 2 breeding grounds and 1 soil quarry all of them valued between 3 and 5 3 4 hi calculation regarding hi results for each activity table 4 it can be highlighted that 90 of the inventoried industries and the landfill present the lowest hi class figs 3 and 5 most of these industries are in the urban area and discharge their effluents to the sewer the totality of cemeteries and waste disposal sites 8 of the industries and almost all breeding grounds present a moderate hi figs 3 5 all buried fuel tanks soil and stone quarries present a high hi as well as 2 of the industries mechanical workshops textile and metallurgical factories figs 3 5 the spatial distribution of the point sources shows that in the case of high hi there are three large groupings urban area southwest peri urban route 88 axis and west peri urban route 226 axis in the first one there is a direct threat to 14 supply wells from the urban area in the second group 5 supply wells from the sas are under potential threat while the third grouping could be affecting based on the groundwater flow direction fig 2 some western wells from the san fig 6 sources with moderate hi present a cluster in the northwest area this group is important because it is located in the zone where wells of the new sao are being built point sources with moderate hi located on the southwest peri urban area may threaten wells in the sas finally sources located at the northwestern and southwestern end of the peri urban area could pose a threat to san and future saa wells the low hi sources are concentrated in the urban area and the industrial park fig 1 because these sources industries connected to sewers a threat to the public water supply system is not contemplated 3 4 1 sensitivity analysis in order to analyze how the change of assigned weights in eq 1 can affect the hi result a sensitivity analysis was performed considering three alternatives table 5 the range of values for the hi in the 3 cases is between 10 and 50 the hi alternative with equal weights presents a very important increase in the point sources categorized as moderate which is the most inaccurate category for decision making this shows that the hi index is sensitive to changes in the ed weighting which has been especially suggested with the highest value precisely to highlight the influence of the mode of disposal of pollutant loads caused by specific activities in the definition of the contamination hazard 3 5 recommendations the recommendations are based on 2 strategies mitigation or prevention the first case mitigation consists on favoring a reduction of the hi e g moving from red to yellow prevention is applied to avoid a negative migration of hi yellow to red green to yellow 3 5 1 point sources with high hi industries the high hi is given for not being connected to the sewer having a high pcl value and or falling into well protection areas mitigation for economic reasons the extension of the sewage network is not feasible in the short or medium term but it could be a long term strategy for those that are located within protection areas an option would be to relocate the industry but this would be a measure of very low feasibility mainly for socio economic reasons therefore wells 330 and 332 should be carefully controlled and their replacement should be eventually contemplated prevention proactive monitoring to detect potential contaminant plumes before reaching the water supply well all industries with high hi need more frequent monitoring by government control authorities or agencies e g through audits in the quality and the effluent discharge mode buried fuel tanks the combination of high pcl and subsurface effluent disposition means that these point sources will always present a high hi even if they are not located within a protection area there are 7 wells in the urban area that may be compromised by having point sources within their protection area the worst case is well 209 with 2 point sources in this situation prevention some prevention measures could be establishing a periodic inspection of the tanks tightness implementing measures of tank withdrawal and remediation when the activity ceases and monitoring the compromised wells soil quarries these point sources present a high hi mainly because of the subsurface disposal mode of their effluents refilling the used place and reconstructing the original topography to change this situation is practically impossible the wp variable has a minor incidence in the final index since only one soil quarry is located within a protection area it is necessary to prevent the transformation of these areas into clandestine waste disposal sites by establishing measures such as the emplacement of a perimeter fence to avoid access to them stone quarries as mentioned for soil quarries a prevention measure to avoid the transformation of these areas into clandestine waste disposal sites could be the emplacement of a perimeter fence to prevent the entry of people 3 5 2 point sources with moderate hi industries 11 are located within a protection area in the urban zone the most compromised well is 90 with 3 industries in its protection area and secondly well 139 with 2 the rest 33 industries are not connected to the sewer network and are not present in a protection area the only alternative to migrate from a moderate hi to low hi yellow to green is to extend the sewer network which would be very low feasibility measure in a short period of time so monitoring possible contamination plumes is recommended cemeteries none is located within protection areas waste disposal sites none is located within protection areas however depending on the flow direction there are three wells that could be threatened 214 333 and 330 so proactive monitoring to detect potential contaminant plumes before reaching the water supply well is recommended breeding grounds none of these breeding grounds is located within a protection area the wells that could be more compromised are 216 333 286 148 and 149 taking into account the effluent disposal mode of these point sources some control measures must be considered e g proactive monitoring regarding control of water supply wells it is necessary to prioritize monitoring in the following wells of the urban area and eventually foresee their substitution as a management alternative 209 297 253 250 240 139 90 117 86 325 101 318 277 140 outside the urban area of the sas wells 332 237 330 298 279 and of the san well 157 the presence of 5 point sources in the sao area should be considered for the purposes of avoiding interference with the new wells as a management measure in the medium term future saa well perforations should contemplate the location of the point sources present in the extreme south west sector of the peri urban area 4 discussion and conclusions one of the greatest challenges related to any natural resource management process is to achieve the best possible compatibility between the ideal and the possible situations there is no doubt that the safest way to achieve absolute protection against groundwater contamination would be to stop all type of potentially contaminating activities nevertheless this would be impossible to carry out due to political technical and most of all economic implications wang 2006 expósito et al 2010 fikru 2014 so if it is not feasible to stop contaminating activities it is necessary to count with a tool that allows identifying in which of these activities it is necessary to prioritize control audits by government agencies there is an important diversity of methodological approaches tools to deal with prevention of groundwater contamination issue many of which are entirely quantitative such as mathematical flow models transport and evolution of pollution plumes such approaches can be useful for detailed risk assessment but are of limited value to groundwater managers who need to achieve proactive and timely groundwater protection across extensive groundwater basins somaratne et al 2013 on the other end are the most simple and totally qualitative methodologies of assigning a label depending on the land use zaporozec 2004 and finally a series of intermediate methodologies that are generally known as index methods within them the most popular are those that are used for the assessment of the aquifer vulnerability for example several modifications to the methods of drastic and god given the shortage of technical and human resources that government agencies often have particularly in developing countries this tool should be as simple as possible in order to allow control efforts to be hierarchically concentrated in principle an index composed of the sum of three weighted variables appears as something possible to apply regardless of the limitations discussed before weighted sum methods for obtaining an index have already been used with other applications in aspects related to water management aller et al 1987 foster et al 2002 and are useful because of their balance between simplicity and efficiency and for being flexible enough to facilitate adaptation to different study areas modifications of weights or values can be made from consensus among stakeholders i e delphi method nowadays technology makes spatial localization of point sources and public supply wells a simple process that can be done even with free software pcl and ed variables only need as data source a basic knowledge of the potentially contaminating activity and its effluent disposal mode information that is usually available the wp variable is the most complex to obtain in the first place although the cfr method is the simplest method to design well protection areas it requires specific technical data related to the aquifer and pumped flows in the second place the process of identifying point sources that are within protection areas is very tedious if computer support is not available in this sense a simple ms excel macro developed for this paper turned out to be very effective the improvement of the proposed method with regard to the use of mathematical models is that it is simpler so it adapts to areas where resources of different types are limited by comparing it with qualitative methods the hi calculation is more precise in regard to its advantages with respect to other indexes the approach to the problem is novel because it contemplates the linking of pollutant load with protection areas and it is intended not to identify areas that present greater or lesser potential hazard but punctually sources that require more control by government authorities and or wells that are in a situation of potential pollution risk for example regarding industries of the 546 that were identified there are 53 that should be controlled with prior attention and of these 53 there are 9 that require high priority actions of the 181 wells there are 20 that require immediate control actions while this index is applied to a local study area it is replicable to other intermediate cities at least in latin america and the caribbean where socio economic contexts are similar moreover as mentioned in the introduction these cities share the presence of multi activity peri urban areas where control by the authorities becomes more complex given the number and diversity of point sources of potential groundwater contamination declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12173,within the tata city region of the moroccan anti atlas mountains groundwater is the only source for drinking and irrigation water supply nevertheless a moderate groundwater quality was already outlined in order to understand the possible extent of groundwater pollution and to develop sustainable groundwater management strategies a groundwater vulnerably assessment was required in this context the overlay index model drastic depth of water net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity was implemented using specific ratings and weightings for each of the parameters in the end areas of greatest potential for groundwater contamination were identified based on geological and hydrogeological parameters as well as on human impact land use the drastic index revealed that most of the study site is characterized by a low geological and hydrogeological vulnerability after implementing the land use parameter a moderate vulnerability was observed indicating a greater groundwater pollution risk caused by human hazards areas of greatest vulnerability occur along agricultural areas and villages a single parameter sensitivity analyses resulted in a rescaling of the different drastic parameters based on this rescaling process most of the study site is of high vulnerability in a second step hydrochemical groundwater data was used as an actual pollution indicator to verify the vulnerability obtained from drastic to this end a new water quality index with respect to drinking and irrigation purposes was developed based on four key parameters specific electrical conductivity chloride nitrate and ammonia thereby nitrate revealed to be the most important chemical parameter reducing the degree of usage elevated nitrate concentrations are restricted to urban areas and derived from manure and septic waste graphical abstract groundwater vulnerability of the tata city region based on a the drastic index di b the drastic land cover index dli and c the rescaled drastic land cover index redli image 1 keywords drastic groundwater management morocco tata city vulnerability mapping water quality index 1 introduction due to increasing climate variations groundwater supply in drylands has gained research focus over the last decades the imbalance between groundwater recharge and extraction resulted in a continuous decline in groundwater reservoirs this is particularly true for morocco as some river basins experience a strong water deficit because of the general decrease in precipitation abahous et al 2017 filahi et al 2016 and thus a lowering of groundwater levels bouchaou et al 2011 ouhamdouch and bahir 2017 in turn climate variability affects groundwater quality both directly and indirectly holman 2006 earman and dettinger 2011 khatri and tyagi 2015 for instance an increase in groundwater temperature caused by global warming might affect temperature dependent biogeochemical processes within aquifer systems figura et al 2011 furthermore morocco is stressed by groundwater deterioration induced by land use changes as well as demographic and urban pressures karmaoui et al 2014 given that access to clean water is the most basic human need the moroccan water law no 10 95 1995 salman and bradlow 2006 has prioritized the protection of the aquatic ecosystems groundwater resources within the arid region of tata city moroccan anti atlas mountains are of major concern since it is the only regional source for drinking and irrigation water supplies nonetheless over the last decade water quality reports of the moroccan ministry for territory water and environment french ministère chargé de l aménagement du territoire de l eau et de l environnement matee 2003 2009 and 2014 already outlined a moderate groundwater quality within the tata city region in this context specific electrical conductivity was of major importance in terms of usage purposes thus an assessment of groundwater vulnerability is very important in order to understand the possible extent of groundwater pollution and to develop sustainable groundwater management strategies in fact groundwater monitoring and mathematical modelling are not applicable on a regional scale in data scarce environments hence a study to evaluate the potential of groundwater contamination over a large geographical area involving a variety of geological hydrogeological and anthropogenic parameters is needed to this end several methods have been developed to evaluate groundwater vulnerability and these can be subdivided into three groups process based statistical and overlay index kumar et al 2015 the selection of an appropriate method depends on each particular study site with its characteristics and data availability one of the most widespread used standard groundwater vulnerability mapping approaches is the overlay index model of drastic introduced by aller et al 1987 this approach combines maps of different geological and hydrogeological parameters that control the movement of contaminants from the surface to the saturated zone the drastic model was applied to arid and semi arid regions hamza et al 2007 al kuisi et al 2014 adjim and bensaoula 2013 as well as to morocco in particular sadiki et al 2018 knouz et al 2018 sinan and razack 2009 ettazarini 2006 jilali et al 2015 furthermore mclay et al 2001 stigter et al 2006 and neshat et al 2014 evaluated the linkage between the drastic model and groundwater chemistry once drastic was applied areas that are more prone to groundwater contamination than others can be identified thus areas that require groundwater monitoring or protective management strategies can be defined and such measures can aid the local communities to protect their groundwater resources this study examines the groundwater vulnerability of the tata city region in the anti atlas mountains of morocco by incorporating geological and hydrogeological parameters into the drastic index moreover to study potential anthropogenic influences the drastic index was extended with the land cover parameter and the drastic land cover index was computed in order to evaluate the influence of each parameter on the aquifer vulnerability single parameter sensitivity analysis was performed based on the new obtained weights the rescaled drastic land cover index was calculated additionally to verify the hydrogeological and anthropogenic vulnerability results hydrochemical data was used in this context a water quality assessment in terms of drinking and irrigation purposes was assigned developing a new water quality index finally the relation between groundwater quality and hydrogeological parameters as well as human impact was evaluated based on these findings recommendations for a sustainable groundwater management can be proposed and developed 2 methods 2 1 study site the wadi tata catchment covers an area of 6000 km2 and is part of the lower drâa catchment in the moroccan anti atlas mountains fig 1 a the catchment is drained by the intermittent wadi tata from n to s as well as from the wadi si rezzoug from e to sw additionally some smaller streams contribute to both wadis discharge is highly variable and strongly dependent on rainfall since the contribution from springs is less than 1 m³ s echogdali et al 2018 the precise study site covers an area of approximately 220 km2 around the city of tata fig 1b the tata plain is surrounded by the mountainous regions of the tagragra de tata inlier in the north and by the jebel tabanit and jebel bani mountain chains in the central parts the southern parts are characterized by the saharan foreland whereas the topographic elevations of the tata plain decrease from 750 m a s l in the north to 550 m a s l in the south the steep slope mountain ridges rise between 1000 and 1200 m a s l fig 1c the climate is influenced by hot and dry air masses from the sahara resulting in continental and arid conditions with an average annual temperature of 23 2 c yazidi et al 2001 precipitation amounts are less than 91 mm a yazidi et al 2001 and highly variable in terms of their frequency duration and intensity as well as associated with orography land use is mainly limited to small hold farmers within palm oases indeed three areas of commercial land use were found in the northern and eastern parts of the study site 2 1 1 geology and hydrogeology the anti atlas mountains form the northern margin of the eburnean west african craton faik et al 2001 in the north of the study site the infra and lower cambrian series discordantly overlie the palaeoproterozoic tagragra de tata inlier benziane et al 2002a generally the lower cambrian units comprise limestones and dolomites with rarer interdigitations of sandstones siltstones and schists buggisch and heinitz 1984 faik et al 2001 a succession of alternating thin bedded dolomites and fine grained clastics is present in the schist carbonate lie de vin series tw1 and tw3 buggisch and heinitz 1984 the barre de tata tw2 is a massive dolomite bank benziane et al 2002b with pseudomorphs of gypsum and halite buggisch and heinitz 1984 the massive dolomites of the upper lower limestone and dolomite series ki1 are overlain by the carbonates and marls of the schist carbonate series ki2 and limestones interlayered with siltstones of the schist series ki3 characterize the upper lower cambrian benziane et al 2002b the top of the lower cambrian is composed of clayey sandstones of the terminal sandstone series ki4 south of tata city the middle cambrian jebel tabanit series ks1 and ks2 is represented by outcrops of sandstones and schists choubert and ennadifi 1970 forming the so called inner feijas faik et al 2001 as typically for the central anti atlas region the upper cambrian is not present in the study site faik et al 2001 the ordovician is characterized by the jebel bani series or4 to or6 a prominent sandstone quartzite massif dividing the anti atlas mountains from the southern external feijas of the wadi drâa faik et al 2001 silurian outcrops are overlain by talus fans and cones qt of the jebel bani and therefore not present in the study site the lower devonian units in the southern parts are represented by the schist sandstone series di3 and di4 choubert and ennadifi 1970 quaternary sediments are widespread across the tata plain along the bed of the wadi tata the lacustrine terrace series ql comprises four different terraces benziane et al 2002a grain sizes of these poorly cemented sediments are highly heterogeneous ranging from silt to gravel with rare carbonates also noted the most abundant terrace is of saltenian age comprising mainly sand and gravel with a prominent carbonate layer of lacustrine origin benziane et al 2002b the alluvial series qa contains gravel and sand and forms the recent wadibeds of the various streams and wadis across the study site benziane et al 2002b in terms of hydrogeology the infra and lower cambrian carbonates and quaternary sediments form the major aquifer systems of the study site yazidi et al 2001 karstification is poorly developed and limited to water movement in fractured zones yazidi et al 2001 the cambrian aquifers are mainly unconfined however the presence of siltstone layers can cause confined conditions within the quaternary sediments unconfined to leaky conditions occur hydraulic conductivities of cambrian units determined for the kerdous inlier range between 10 7 and 10 3 m s heiβ et al 2017 according to the hydraulic basin agency of souss massa and drâa french agence du bassin hydraulique du souss massa et drâa abhsmd 2013 the transmissivity of the quaternary aquifer is estimated to be 10 2 m2 s and wells show productivities ranging from 0 04 to 3 l s 2 2 the drastic index the drastic index is a numerical ranking system to assess groundwater vulnerability by means of seven geological and hydrogeological parameters depth of water d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography slope t impact of vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c aller et al 1987 definitions and characteristics of these parameters were initially specified by aller et al 1987 the most important assumptions made when assessing vulnerability with drastic are that the contaminant is introduced at the ground surface flushed into groundwater by precipitation and has the mobility of water aller et al 1987 according to the relative contribution of each geological and hydrogeological parameter to potential contamination a consensus delphi approach was assigned resulting in weights ranging from 1 to 5 aller et al 1987 moreover each parameter involves several ratings where e g d and t have a large range with values between 1 and 10 the drastic index di is calculated in a linear combination including all weightings w and rankings r of each geological and hydrogeological parameter equation 1 aller et al 1987 1 d i d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w by using this additive model a numerical value for any hydrogeological setting can be defined where the highest index refers to the highest vulnerability and vice versa 2 2 1 land cover parameter given that anthropogenic activities such as industry fertilizer usage in agricultural areas septic tanks and sewer systems can affect groundwater quality and thus increase its pollution risk several authors e g secunda et al 1998 and al hanbali and kondoh 2008 introduced a land use or land cover parameter l into the drastic index this parameter is an extension to the initial drastic index and includes for example a range of land cover classes such as urban agriculture natural vegetation water evaporation pond and bare land al hanbali and kondoh 2008 the l parameter was weighted by 5 due to the potentially high impact on groundwater secunda et al 1998 moreover ratings between 1 and 8 were implemented for each land cover class based on these ratings and weightings the extended calculation of the drastic land cover index dli is expressed as equation 2 2 dl i d i l r l w finally the drastic indices di and drastic land cover indices dli were classified into five vulnerability classes of very low low moderate high and very high table 1 these classes were calculated by dividing the minimum and maximum possible index value by five number of vulnerability classes 2 2 2 parameter determination depth to water d data was collected by direct measurements using electric contact gauges of water levels in 44 wells in march 2018 potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated according to the turc 1961 formula since daily mean relative humidity was greater than 50 equation 3 3 p e t 0 013 t t 15 r g 50 thereby pet is the daily potential evapotranspiration mm day t is the daily mean air temperature c and rg is the daily solar radiation cal cm2 d resultant and in combination with precipitation data from november 2015 to october 2016 net recharge r was estimated aquifer media a in the northern study site was obtained using the 1 50 000 scaled geological maps of zawyat si nisser yazidi et al 2002 and afouzar benziane et al 2002a and the according explanations yazidi et al 2001 benziane et al 2002b for the southern study site a 1 200 000 scaled geological map of akka tafagount tata choubert and ennadifi 1970 was used within the quaternary sediments aquifer media was determined based on drilling logs provided by the moroccan province agency of equipment transport and logistics french direction provinciale de l equipement du transport et de la logistique dpetl further information were gained during the field survey by measuring sedimentological profiles soil media s parameter data was obtained from a 1 1 500 000 scaled soil map cavallar 1950 in combination with field observations using the strm 1 arc second usgs 2018a as a global digital elevation model with a 30 m spatial resolution in combination with qgis terrain analysis slopes topography t were calculated the impact of the vadose zone i was also classified based on the geological maps yazidi et al 2002 benziane et al 2002a choubert and ennadifi 1970 and drilling logs provided by the dpetl of tata hydraulic conductivities c were determined using a variety of methods depending of the specific characteristics of each series as well as on data availability fig 2 for fractured hard rocks cambrian to devonian hydraulic conductivity was calculated following the cubic law e g cook 2003 by measuring fracture aperture and spacing over a 1 m2 scan window pumping tests n 4 infiltration tests n 5 and grain size analysis n 8 were conducted to determine hydraulic conductivities in unconsolidated sediments quaternary land cover l was determined using the 1 100 000 scaled topographic maps of tata ministère l agriculture et de la reforme agraire engl moroccan ministry for agriculture 1970a and tlêta de tagmoûte ministère l agriculture et de la reforme agraire engl moroccan ministry for agriculture 1970b provided by the moroccan agricultural ministry as well as open street map data provided by mapcruzin com in this study the drastic index was implemented using a combination of qgis tools and lithostratigraphical characterizations due to data scarcity for the cambrian to devonian series the presented drastic classification refers to lithostratigraphical series as shown in fig 2 this approach is assumed to be appropriate since a literature review field observations as well as laboratory analyses and interpretations showed similar results for each lithostratigraphic hard rock series since for the quaternary tata plain sufficient representative data was available the drastic parameters were analyzed on the platform of qgis using inverse distance weighted interpolation idw in terms of the idw data points are linearly weighted during raster calculations this means that the influence of one point relative to another declines with distance thus in terms of idw interpolation unevenly spread input data may not adequately represent the desired surface furthermore output values are limited to the range of the input values used to interpolate in this study a raster of 100 m in each direction and a weighting coefficient of five was used as the tata plain is a populated area and thus wells located within are used for drinking and irrigation water supply and the idw would appear to be the more detailed method the presented combination approach is in compliance with the overall aim of the presented study 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis when assessing groundwater vulnerability by using overlay index methods subjectivity is unavoidable in the selection of weights and ranking values gogu and dassargues 2000 although this strongly affects the final vulnerability index in terms of sensitivity analysis this influence is minimized babiker et al 2005 stated that the empirical weights introduced by aller et al 1987 might vary according to the specific geological and hydrogeological characteristics of each study site thus the re calculation of the effective weights is an important analytical step in index based groundwater vulnerability assessments napolitano and fabbri 1996 babiker et al 2005 to this end single parameter sensitivity analysis according to napolitano and fabbri 1996 was performed this evaluation provides an essential tool in order to verify the influence of weights and ratings assigned for each parameter on the drastic index gogu and dassargues 2000 in this study sensitivity analysis was performed using the dratic land cover index the obtained effective weight wx compares the initial empirical weights of the geological and hydrogeological parameters as well as the land cover parameter with their actual effective weights and is calculated as equation 4 napolitano and fabbri 1996 4 w x x r x w dl i 100 where xr and xw are the ratings and weights for parameter x d r a s t i c or l assigned in any subarea and dli is computed from equation 2 hence the obtained effective weights were used to calculate a rescaled drastic land cover index redli representing the proper vulnerability mapping approach for the given geological hydrogeological and land cover characteristics of the tata city region 2 3 water quality assessment in order to verify the aquifer vulnerability obtained from geological hydrogeological and land cover parameters using the drastic model hydrochemical groundwater data was used as an actual pollution indicator this linkage provides a large amount of qualitative data and can therefore be an efficient tool in planning sustainable groundwater management strategies based on groundwater chemistry a new developed water quality index wqi for drinking and irrigation purposes was established the main aim of this approach was to transform a complex set of water quality data into information that is both understandable and useful for the local population 2 3 1 development of a water quality index the wqi was used to evaluate the impact of natural and anthropogenic processes based on key physical and chemical parameters these parameters were selected following the matee 2014 for drinking and irrigation water purposes a newly developed classification scheme for the wqi was computed by using quality classes of ions ci which are based on hydrochemical groundwater data this means that for a certain concentration a quality class table 2 can be assigned for each parameter these parameters are specific electrical conductivity ec chloride cl nitrate no3 and ammonia nh4 in terms of their usage the quality classes can be subdivided into five classes ranging from very good good moderate restricted to very restricted table 2 in terms of drinking water quality the groundwater quality class very good can be used without restriction matee 2003 the quality classes good and moderate need to be treated depending on the specific contaminant in terms of irrigation water the quality classes moderate and restricted are considered to be of sufficient quality matee 2003 the quality class very restricted should not be used for either drinking or irrigation water purposes matee 2003 elevated values of specific electrical conductivity ammonia and chloride in groundwater are not of any concern with regard to drinking water purposes who 2011 in contrast a guideline value for nitrate of 50 mg l was established who 2011 regarding irrigation water purposes the classification of nitrate is in compliance with the one introduced for tunisia by saidi et al 2009 further compliance is given with ayers and westcot 1985 for the ec classification in compliance with pusatli et al 2009 and saidi et al 2009 the wqi is calculated as equation 5 5 wq i c i 2 where ci is the quality class obtained from the chemical concentration of the parameters electrical conductivity chloride nitrate and ammonia following table 2 hence the minimum and maximum wqi values are 5 and 100 respectively this new classification approach has two major advantages i to identify the overall water quality status and ii to detect the parameter of most influence regarding the suitability for usage groundwater samples were taken in march 2018 from 44 wells within the tata plain fig 2 sampling points were chosen for an appropriate spatial cover within the study site moreover samples were collected from different land use and land cover types hence samples were taken in urban areas and agricultural areas as well as in natural vegetation the wells were either pumping wells or draw wells as well as public private or from associations specific electrical conductivity and oxygen contents were measured using the portable multi meter wtw 3420 hydrochemical analyses were carried out at the institute for geosciences university of bonn germany using ion chromatography shimadzu hic 6a for nitrate and chloride concentrations and photometry cadas 100 dr lange for ammonia concentrations additionally measurements of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were conducted using isotope ratio mass spectrometry isoprime tg100 to verify nitrate sources in groundwater for five samples taken in urban areas the isotope notations are expresses as δ per mil relative to the atmospheric n2 air and vienna mean ocean water v smow standards reproducibility is 0 2 for δ15n no3 and 0 4 for δ18o no3 in order to evaluate geological sources of n species and chloride in groundwater cns vario el cube elementar and mineralogical analyses d8 advance bruker axs were carried out for representative rock and sediment samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 the drastic index of the tata city region the geological and hydrogeological parameters of the drastic index were analyzed on the platform of qgis fig 3 a g the depth to groundwater and hydraulic conductivity parameters showed most variations the relative low depth to groundwater north of jebel bani is directly linked to the bottleneck of the jebel bani massif resulting in an elevation of the quaternary aquifer yazidi et al 2002 the differences in hydraulic conductivities of the quaternary sediments are linked to the unconformity of the grain sizes due to changes in sedimentation and depositional environments additionally the bottleneck of the jebel bani might have acted as a natural barrier and thus larger grain sizes were deposited north of the massif and consequently higher hydraulic conductivities were observed net recharge is very low because annual potential evapotranspiration revealed averagely 1061 mm and is thus greater than rainfall thus the net recharge parameter war rated with 1 however in arid regions recharge areas can be linked to the presence of faults and coexisting areas between faults and the drainage system al hanbali and kondoh 2008 in these regions water is assumed to infiltrate directly through the vadose zone and reach the water table consequently since this increases vulnerability higher ratings have to be assigned regions of coexisting areas between faults and drainage system exist in the northern part of the study where the fractured lower cambrian series are present fig 2 correspondingly the ratings were adjusted by the factor of 3 in these regions topography parameter presented as slopes was steep 18 for the hard rock series cambrian to devonian and relatively flat 2 5 for the sediments quaternary soil media was absent for the hard rock series whereas the alluvial series consisted of sand and gravel rating of 9 5 the lacustrine series was characterized as loam and thus rated by 5 the calculated drastic indices in the tata city region were relatively homogeneous in the range of 73 and 133 representing vulnerability classes of low and moderate a distinction in the drastic indices is noticed between the cambrian to devonian hard rock series compared to the unconsolidated quaternary series fig 4 a whereas the drastic indices of the hard rocks series ranged between 70 and 103 representing solely low vulnerability classes the drastic indices of the sediment series ranged between 96 and 133 displaying vulnerability classes of low to moderate with most being moderate in fact within the surrounding cambrian to devonian series the relief is steep t parameter and the groundwater level d parameter is estimated to be very deep 22 8 m leading to the observed low vulnerability class in contrast the groundwater level within the quaternary sediments of the tata plain ranged between 5 2 m and 25 0 m ratings of 3 7 in combination with a rating of 7 for the aquifer media and 6 for the impact of vadose zone media a low to moderate vulnerability class was observed in terms of the spatial distribution of the vulnerability classes within the study site 68 8 151 3 km2 of the total area display a low vulnerability and 31 2 68 7 km2 a moderate vulnerability class table 3 3 2 land cover impact land cover within the tata city region fig 3h was rated according to secunda et al 1998 and al hanbali and kondoh 2008 the cambrian to devonian hard rock series represented bare land most of the quaternary sediments lacustrine series were categorized as natural vegetation due to several villages and oases within the quaternary sediments parts of it displayed the land cover classes urban and agriculture since the wadi tata is intermittent the alluvial series can display bare land as well as water given that throughout most of the year and also during the field survey the wadis were dry these areas were categorized as bare land for further calculations after extending the drastic index fig 4a with the land cover parameter l fig 3h the calculated drastic land cover index showed a different spatial distribution of vulnerability fig 4b generally the drastic land cover index varied between 75 and 172 the vulnerability class for the cambrian and devonian series increased to moderate but the ordovician jebel bani series remained low since all of the hard rock series were classified as bare land this difference could be linked to the geological and hydrogeological parameters of the series for instance the aquifer media and impact of vadose zone for the cambrian series was rated higher compared to the ordovician series compare fig 3c and f in urban and agricultural areas vulnerability remained in the moderate class but displayed values close to the high vulnerability class as both land cover parameters being ranked by 8 on the whole the area of moderate vulnerability increased up to 144 3 km2 65 6 and the area of low vulnerability decreased to 75 7 km2 34 4 table 4 3 3 sensitivity of the tata drastic land cover index the weightings of each parameter and its impact to compute the drastic land cover index was addressed using single parameter sensitivity analysis the analysis revealed that there are some deviations of the initial effective weights of the drastic parameters introduced by aller et al 1987 and secunda et al 1998 when compared to the calculated empirical weights for the tata study site table 5 for the tata city region the rescaled effective weights are in the order of i l a s d c r t compared to the weights introduced by aller et al 1987 the net recharge for the tata city region tends to be less effective since the rescaled weight was 1 4 this can be explained by the fact that recharge is low and thus the assigned ratings were 1 or 3 likewise the depth to groundwater and hydraulic conductivity parameters point to be less effective the low sensitivity towards the groundwater depth is caused by the water table being 22 m below surface in the hard rock series in contrast aquifer media soil media and impact of vadose zone media tend to be more effective parameters due to high ratings assigned for these parameters the topography slope and land cover parameters showed effective weights close to the initial empirical weights see table 5 based on the calculated average effective weights rescaled effective weights were implemented for the specific geological hydrogeological and land cover characteristics of the tata city region table 5 using the new obtained effective weights for equation 1 the rescaled drastic land cover index redli was recomputed generally the rescaled drastic land cover indices increased into the range between 98 and 196 showing low to high vulnerability classes fig 4c the cambrian to devonian hard rock series remained in or increased to the moderate vulnerability class within the quaternary sediments of the tata plain vulnerability increased into moderate to high classes especially in the southern central parts of the study site after the rescaling process the moderate vulnerability class covers most of the study site with 130 7 km2 59 4 high and low vulnerable areas display 41 1 km2 18 7 and 48 2 km2 21 9 respectively table 6 3 4 water quality index as hydrochemical data can be used to verify the computed vulnerability indices the wqi was calculated based on groundwater samples the wqi varied between 7 and 60 indicating a wide range of groundwater quality fig 5 a regarding the spatial distribution of the wqi most groundwater samples showed low wqi s fig 5a nevertheless across the entire study site five elevated spots were noted these are restricted to urban areas namely the villages of ait yassine tammacht ait werkane tiguissalt and el ayoun in terms of correlation analyses it appears that nitrate is the most important chemical parameter on the overall wqi the comparison between the maps of the wqi and nitrate concentrations reveals that areas with high wqi s are related to elevated nitrate concentrations and vice versa fig 5a and b a comparable correlation was not observed in the case of the other hydrochemical quality parameters with one exception in el ayoun south eastern study site a high wqi is related to elevated chloride and sulphate concentrations this elevation is caused by natural increasing salinity conditions towards the saharan foreland yazidi et al 2001 and was confirmed by mineralogical and cns analyses which showed the presence of evaporites within the lacustrine terrace series ammonia was in most cases close to or below the detection limit of 0 03 mg l this is a result of the rapid oxidation of nh4 to no3 in the presence of oxygen stadler et al 2008 thus nh4 input may not be identified separately and was measured as no3 in tigusissalt groundwater showed a low oxygen content 1 8 mg l and thus an elevated nh4 concentration of 4 4 mg l was noticed geological sources for n species in groundwater from hard rocks and sediment can be excluded since cns analyses showed values below the detection limit of 400 ppm nevertheless n input from soil cannot be excluded concerning the suitability of water for drinking and irrigation purposes fig 6 illustrates the correlation between the different physical and chemical water quality parameters in terms of drinking water the quality status is related more to elevated ec s and no3 rather than to cl and nh4 fig 6a however 37 samples 84 1 showed a good to moderate drinking water quality with one or either both parameters being elevated when comparing nitrate with ec chloride and ammonia six samples were of a restricted to very restricted quality regarding all of the parameters in the case of ec and nitrate none and one sample were below the recommended drinking water quality with regard to cl and nh4 concentrations four and five samples showed values above the recommended drinking water quality water quality for irrigation purposes is good for 93 2 of the samples fig 6b three samples showed a restricted degree on irrigation use due to elevated ec s and nitrate concentrations high salinities in this case expressed as ec can cause yield losses if salt accumulates in the root crop zone ayers and westcot 1985 3 5 relation between water quality index drastic and land cover in order to verify if groundwater quality wqi is related to the geological and hydrogeological aquifer vulnerability drastic or to an anthropogenic impact land cover parameter correlations were calculated in this context the spearman rank correlation coefficient was applied since it is not restrained by the general distribution form of the two variables and the sample sizes huan et al 2012 a correlation coefficient of 1 0 or 1 0 indicates perfect positive or negative correlation and 0 0 indicates no correlation the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the di and the wqi was of the order of 0 4 indicating no significant linkage between the hydrogeological aquifer vulnerability and groundwater pollution areas of moderate di s can display areas of low and high wqi s but areas of high wqi s are always linked to areas with high di s compare figs 4a and 5a similary a low correlation was observed between the dli and wqi as the spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 5 again areas of moderate dli s can display areas of low and high wqi s but areas of high wqi s are always linked to areas with high dli s compare figs 4b and 5a in terms of index based vulnerability mapping it was shown that the land cover parameter has a profound impact on groundwater vulnerability e g secunda et al 1998 al hanbali and kondoh 2008 it has been widely recognized that elevated nitrate concentrations can be directly linked to anthropogenic influences of urban and agricultural land cover classes huan et al 2012 thus nitrate concentrations present a good indicator for the impact of the land cover classes on groundwater quality this is also reflected in the results of this study since nitrate was identified as the most influencing parameter regarding water quality fig 7 superimposes nitrate concentrations related to the water quality classes from table 2 on the land cover map generally distinct differences in nitrate concentrations were observed related to land cover fig 7 and table 7 groundwater in urban areas showed highest nitrate concentrations especially nitrate concentrations 100 mg l were restricted to urban areas lower elevated nitrate concentrations were monitored within agriculture oases and natural vegetation land cover classes being on average 15 1 mg l and 14 3 mg l respectively wells were not present in bare land hard rock series nitrate concentrations were not related to groundwater depth moreover no correlation between nitrate concentrations and type of well either being public private or from local associations were noticed since hydrochemical investigations showed most elevated nitrate concentrations in urban areas contamination might be ascribed to missing wastewater treatment systems as well as to waste depositional sites assaf and saadeh 2009 this was proven by isotopic composition of nitrate which ranged between 13 1 and 22 0 for δ15n as well as between 3 2 and 7 8 for δ18o fig 8 this signature is distinctive for manure and septic waste as a potential contamination source kendall and aravena 2000 saadou oumarou et al 2019 in manure the main n compound is urea which is converted to nitrate in the unsaturated zone stadler et al 2008 thus nitrogen may enter from point sources through preferential flow path and is subsequently leached into groundwater since the quaternary aquifer showed hydraulic conductivities in the range of 10 4 m s contaminant transport is rapid within oases nitrate concentrations were generally less elevated and can derive from fertilization and to a certain extent from cattle grazing tagma et al 2009 moreover a mixture of highly contaminated groundwater from urban areas with less contaminated groundwater from agricultural and bare land can be assumed 4 conclusions the drastic index showed that most of the study site is characterized by a low vulnerability thus the characteristic geological and hydrogeological factors within the tata city region provide a natural protection against groundwater contamination however after implementing the land cover parameters the drastic land cover index showed that most of the study site is of moderate vulnerability indicating a greater groundwater pollution risk caused by human hazards thereby more vulnerable areas occur along the oases and villages representing agriculture and urban land cover classes based on the geological hydrogeological and land cover characteristics of the tata city region the results from the single parameter sensitivity analysis showed that the net recharge and topography slope parameters tend to be less significant in contrast the impact of vadose zone media and land cover parameters have a significant impact evaluation of water quality within the tata city region was carried out using a newly developed water quality index thereby groundwater showed mostly a good to moderate status in terms of drinking water quality in terms of irrigation groundwater is of good quality the relation between groundwater quality and vulnerability mapping indicates that groundwater quality is related more to land cover than to the specific geological and hydrogeological setting in terms of hydrochemical data evaluation nitrate was revealed to be the most important chemical parameter reducing the degree of usage elevated nitrate concentrations are restricted to urban areas nitrate isotope composition showed that the contamination source resulted from the lack of a proper sewage system in the villages this was clearly evidenced by the fact that nitrate concentrations in groundwater displayed values below 50 mg l in tata city which has functioning a sewage system finally this study highlighted the absence of waste water treatment systems as the major source of groundwater contamination within the tata city region thus there is a strong need to implement management options in respect to wastewater treatment plants in the surrounding villages of tata city since this implementation is very cost intensive a cheaper and more easily applicable approach would be to increase the distance between the supply wells and domestic waste deposits toilets lavatory kitchen thereby the developed groundwater vulnerability and water quality maps provide fundamental knowledge to identify appropriate locations

12173,within the tata city region of the moroccan anti atlas mountains groundwater is the only source for drinking and irrigation water supply nevertheless a moderate groundwater quality was already outlined in order to understand the possible extent of groundwater pollution and to develop sustainable groundwater management strategies a groundwater vulnerably assessment was required in this context the overlay index model drastic depth of water net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity was implemented using specific ratings and weightings for each of the parameters in the end areas of greatest potential for groundwater contamination were identified based on geological and hydrogeological parameters as well as on human impact land use the drastic index revealed that most of the study site is characterized by a low geological and hydrogeological vulnerability after implementing the land use parameter a moderate vulnerability was observed indicating a greater groundwater pollution risk caused by human hazards areas of greatest vulnerability occur along agricultural areas and villages a single parameter sensitivity analyses resulted in a rescaling of the different drastic parameters based on this rescaling process most of the study site is of high vulnerability in a second step hydrochemical groundwater data was used as an actual pollution indicator to verify the vulnerability obtained from drastic to this end a new water quality index with respect to drinking and irrigation purposes was developed based on four key parameters specific electrical conductivity chloride nitrate and ammonia thereby nitrate revealed to be the most important chemical parameter reducing the degree of usage elevated nitrate concentrations are restricted to urban areas and derived from manure and septic waste graphical abstract groundwater vulnerability of the tata city region based on a the drastic index di b the drastic land cover index dli and c the rescaled drastic land cover index redli image 1 keywords drastic groundwater management morocco tata city vulnerability mapping water quality index 1 introduction due to increasing climate variations groundwater supply in drylands has gained research focus over the last decades the imbalance between groundwater recharge and extraction resulted in a continuous decline in groundwater reservoirs this is particularly true for morocco as some river basins experience a strong water deficit because of the general decrease in precipitation abahous et al 2017 filahi et al 2016 and thus a lowering of groundwater levels bouchaou et al 2011 ouhamdouch and bahir 2017 in turn climate variability affects groundwater quality both directly and indirectly holman 2006 earman and dettinger 2011 khatri and tyagi 2015 for instance an increase in groundwater temperature caused by global warming might affect temperature dependent biogeochemical processes within aquifer systems figura et al 2011 furthermore morocco is stressed by groundwater deterioration induced by land use changes as well as demographic and urban pressures karmaoui et al 2014 given that access to clean water is the most basic human need the moroccan water law no 10 95 1995 salman and bradlow 2006 has prioritized the protection of the aquatic ecosystems groundwater resources within the arid region of tata city moroccan anti atlas mountains are of major concern since it is the only regional source for drinking and irrigation water supplies nonetheless over the last decade water quality reports of the moroccan ministry for territory water and environment french ministère chargé de l aménagement du territoire de l eau et de l environnement matee 2003 2009 and 2014 already outlined a moderate groundwater quality within the tata city region in this context specific electrical conductivity was of major importance in terms of usage purposes thus an assessment of groundwater vulnerability is very important in order to understand the possible extent of groundwater pollution and to develop sustainable groundwater management strategies in fact groundwater monitoring and mathematical modelling are not applicable on a regional scale in data scarce environments hence a study to evaluate the potential of groundwater contamination over a large geographical area involving a variety of geological hydrogeological and anthropogenic parameters is needed to this end several methods have been developed to evaluate groundwater vulnerability and these can be subdivided into three groups process based statistical and overlay index kumar et al 2015 the selection of an appropriate method depends on each particular study site with its characteristics and data availability one of the most widespread used standard groundwater vulnerability mapping approaches is the overlay index model of drastic introduced by aller et al 1987 this approach combines maps of different geological and hydrogeological parameters that control the movement of contaminants from the surface to the saturated zone the drastic model was applied to arid and semi arid regions hamza et al 2007 al kuisi et al 2014 adjim and bensaoula 2013 as well as to morocco in particular sadiki et al 2018 knouz et al 2018 sinan and razack 2009 ettazarini 2006 jilali et al 2015 furthermore mclay et al 2001 stigter et al 2006 and neshat et al 2014 evaluated the linkage between the drastic model and groundwater chemistry once drastic was applied areas that are more prone to groundwater contamination than others can be identified thus areas that require groundwater monitoring or protective management strategies can be defined and such measures can aid the local communities to protect their groundwater resources this study examines the groundwater vulnerability of the tata city region in the anti atlas mountains of morocco by incorporating geological and hydrogeological parameters into the drastic index moreover to study potential anthropogenic influences the drastic index was extended with the land cover parameter and the drastic land cover index was computed in order to evaluate the influence of each parameter on the aquifer vulnerability single parameter sensitivity analysis was performed based on the new obtained weights the rescaled drastic land cover index was calculated additionally to verify the hydrogeological and anthropogenic vulnerability results hydrochemical data was used in this context a water quality assessment in terms of drinking and irrigation purposes was assigned developing a new water quality index finally the relation between groundwater quality and hydrogeological parameters as well as human impact was evaluated based on these findings recommendations for a sustainable groundwater management can be proposed and developed 2 methods 2 1 study site the wadi tata catchment covers an area of 6000 km2 and is part of the lower drâa catchment in the moroccan anti atlas mountains fig 1 a the catchment is drained by the intermittent wadi tata from n to s as well as from the wadi si rezzoug from e to sw additionally some smaller streams contribute to both wadis discharge is highly variable and strongly dependent on rainfall since the contribution from springs is less than 1 m³ s echogdali et al 2018 the precise study site covers an area of approximately 220 km2 around the city of tata fig 1b the tata plain is surrounded by the mountainous regions of the tagragra de tata inlier in the north and by the jebel tabanit and jebel bani mountain chains in the central parts the southern parts are characterized by the saharan foreland whereas the topographic elevations of the tata plain decrease from 750 m a s l in the north to 550 m a s l in the south the steep slope mountain ridges rise between 1000 and 1200 m a s l fig 1c the climate is influenced by hot and dry air masses from the sahara resulting in continental and arid conditions with an average annual temperature of 23 2 c yazidi et al 2001 precipitation amounts are less than 91 mm a yazidi et al 2001 and highly variable in terms of their frequency duration and intensity as well as associated with orography land use is mainly limited to small hold farmers within palm oases indeed three areas of commercial land use were found in the northern and eastern parts of the study site 2 1 1 geology and hydrogeology the anti atlas mountains form the northern margin of the eburnean west african craton faik et al 2001 in the north of the study site the infra and lower cambrian series discordantly overlie the palaeoproterozoic tagragra de tata inlier benziane et al 2002a generally the lower cambrian units comprise limestones and dolomites with rarer interdigitations of sandstones siltstones and schists buggisch and heinitz 1984 faik et al 2001 a succession of alternating thin bedded dolomites and fine grained clastics is present in the schist carbonate lie de vin series tw1 and tw3 buggisch and heinitz 1984 the barre de tata tw2 is a massive dolomite bank benziane et al 2002b with pseudomorphs of gypsum and halite buggisch and heinitz 1984 the massive dolomites of the upper lower limestone and dolomite series ki1 are overlain by the carbonates and marls of the schist carbonate series ki2 and limestones interlayered with siltstones of the schist series ki3 characterize the upper lower cambrian benziane et al 2002b the top of the lower cambrian is composed of clayey sandstones of the terminal sandstone series ki4 south of tata city the middle cambrian jebel tabanit series ks1 and ks2 is represented by outcrops of sandstones and schists choubert and ennadifi 1970 forming the so called inner feijas faik et al 2001 as typically for the central anti atlas region the upper cambrian is not present in the study site faik et al 2001 the ordovician is characterized by the jebel bani series or4 to or6 a prominent sandstone quartzite massif dividing the anti atlas mountains from the southern external feijas of the wadi drâa faik et al 2001 silurian outcrops are overlain by talus fans and cones qt of the jebel bani and therefore not present in the study site the lower devonian units in the southern parts are represented by the schist sandstone series di3 and di4 choubert and ennadifi 1970 quaternary sediments are widespread across the tata plain along the bed of the wadi tata the lacustrine terrace series ql comprises four different terraces benziane et al 2002a grain sizes of these poorly cemented sediments are highly heterogeneous ranging from silt to gravel with rare carbonates also noted the most abundant terrace is of saltenian age comprising mainly sand and gravel with a prominent carbonate layer of lacustrine origin benziane et al 2002b the alluvial series qa contains gravel and sand and forms the recent wadibeds of the various streams and wadis across the study site benziane et al 2002b in terms of hydrogeology the infra and lower cambrian carbonates and quaternary sediments form the major aquifer systems of the study site yazidi et al 2001 karstification is poorly developed and limited to water movement in fractured zones yazidi et al 2001 the cambrian aquifers are mainly unconfined however the presence of siltstone layers can cause confined conditions within the quaternary sediments unconfined to leaky conditions occur hydraulic conductivities of cambrian units determined for the kerdous inlier range between 10 7 and 10 3 m s heiβ et al 2017 according to the hydraulic basin agency of souss massa and drâa french agence du bassin hydraulique du souss massa et drâa abhsmd 2013 the transmissivity of the quaternary aquifer is estimated to be 10 2 m2 s and wells show productivities ranging from 0 04 to 3 l s 2 2 the drastic index the drastic index is a numerical ranking system to assess groundwater vulnerability by means of seven geological and hydrogeological parameters depth of water d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography slope t impact of vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c aller et al 1987 definitions and characteristics of these parameters were initially specified by aller et al 1987 the most important assumptions made when assessing vulnerability with drastic are that the contaminant is introduced at the ground surface flushed into groundwater by precipitation and has the mobility of water aller et al 1987 according to the relative contribution of each geological and hydrogeological parameter to potential contamination a consensus delphi approach was assigned resulting in weights ranging from 1 to 5 aller et al 1987 moreover each parameter involves several ratings where e g d and t have a large range with values between 1 and 10 the drastic index di is calculated in a linear combination including all weightings w and rankings r of each geological and hydrogeological parameter equation 1 aller et al 1987 1 d i d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w by using this additive model a numerical value for any hydrogeological setting can be defined where the highest index refers to the highest vulnerability and vice versa 2 2 1 land cover parameter given that anthropogenic activities such as industry fertilizer usage in agricultural areas septic tanks and sewer systems can affect groundwater quality and thus increase its pollution risk several authors e g secunda et al 1998 and al hanbali and kondoh 2008 introduced a land use or land cover parameter l into the drastic index this parameter is an extension to the initial drastic index and includes for example a range of land cover classes such as urban agriculture natural vegetation water evaporation pond and bare land al hanbali and kondoh 2008 the l parameter was weighted by 5 due to the potentially high impact on groundwater secunda et al 1998 moreover ratings between 1 and 8 were implemented for each land cover class based on these ratings and weightings the extended calculation of the drastic land cover index dli is expressed as equation 2 2 dl i d i l r l w finally the drastic indices di and drastic land cover indices dli were classified into five vulnerability classes of very low low moderate high and very high table 1 these classes were calculated by dividing the minimum and maximum possible index value by five number of vulnerability classes 2 2 2 parameter determination depth to water d data was collected by direct measurements using electric contact gauges of water levels in 44 wells in march 2018 potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated according to the turc 1961 formula since daily mean relative humidity was greater than 50 equation 3 3 p e t 0 013 t t 15 r g 50 thereby pet is the daily potential evapotranspiration mm day t is the daily mean air temperature c and rg is the daily solar radiation cal cm2 d resultant and in combination with precipitation data from november 2015 to october 2016 net recharge r was estimated aquifer media a in the northern study site was obtained using the 1 50 000 scaled geological maps of zawyat si nisser yazidi et al 2002 and afouzar benziane et al 2002a and the according explanations yazidi et al 2001 benziane et al 2002b for the southern study site a 1 200 000 scaled geological map of akka tafagount tata choubert and ennadifi 1970 was used within the quaternary sediments aquifer media was determined based on drilling logs provided by the moroccan province agency of equipment transport and logistics french direction provinciale de l equipement du transport et de la logistique dpetl further information were gained during the field survey by measuring sedimentological profiles soil media s parameter data was obtained from a 1 1 500 000 scaled soil map cavallar 1950 in combination with field observations using the strm 1 arc second usgs 2018a as a global digital elevation model with a 30 m spatial resolution in combination with qgis terrain analysis slopes topography t were calculated the impact of the vadose zone i was also classified based on the geological maps yazidi et al 2002 benziane et al 2002a choubert and ennadifi 1970 and drilling logs provided by the dpetl of tata hydraulic conductivities c were determined using a variety of methods depending of the specific characteristics of each series as well as on data availability fig 2 for fractured hard rocks cambrian to devonian hydraulic conductivity was calculated following the cubic law e g cook 2003 by measuring fracture aperture and spacing over a 1 m2 scan window pumping tests n 4 infiltration tests n 5 and grain size analysis n 8 were conducted to determine hydraulic conductivities in unconsolidated sediments quaternary land cover l was determined using the 1 100 000 scaled topographic maps of tata ministère l agriculture et de la reforme agraire engl moroccan ministry for agriculture 1970a and tlêta de tagmoûte ministère l agriculture et de la reforme agraire engl moroccan ministry for agriculture 1970b provided by the moroccan agricultural ministry as well as open street map data provided by mapcruzin com in this study the drastic index was implemented using a combination of qgis tools and lithostratigraphical characterizations due to data scarcity for the cambrian to devonian series the presented drastic classification refers to lithostratigraphical series as shown in fig 2 this approach is assumed to be appropriate since a literature review field observations as well as laboratory analyses and interpretations showed similar results for each lithostratigraphic hard rock series since for the quaternary tata plain sufficient representative data was available the drastic parameters were analyzed on the platform of qgis using inverse distance weighted interpolation idw in terms of the idw data points are linearly weighted during raster calculations this means that the influence of one point relative to another declines with distance thus in terms of idw interpolation unevenly spread input data may not adequately represent the desired surface furthermore output values are limited to the range of the input values used to interpolate in this study a raster of 100 m in each direction and a weighting coefficient of five was used as the tata plain is a populated area and thus wells located within are used for drinking and irrigation water supply and the idw would appear to be the more detailed method the presented combination approach is in compliance with the overall aim of the presented study 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis when assessing groundwater vulnerability by using overlay index methods subjectivity is unavoidable in the selection of weights and ranking values gogu and dassargues 2000 although this strongly affects the final vulnerability index in terms of sensitivity analysis this influence is minimized babiker et al 2005 stated that the empirical weights introduced by aller et al 1987 might vary according to the specific geological and hydrogeological characteristics of each study site thus the re calculation of the effective weights is an important analytical step in index based groundwater vulnerability assessments napolitano and fabbri 1996 babiker et al 2005 to this end single parameter sensitivity analysis according to napolitano and fabbri 1996 was performed this evaluation provides an essential tool in order to verify the influence of weights and ratings assigned for each parameter on the drastic index gogu and dassargues 2000 in this study sensitivity analysis was performed using the dratic land cover index the obtained effective weight wx compares the initial empirical weights of the geological and hydrogeological parameters as well as the land cover parameter with their actual effective weights and is calculated as equation 4 napolitano and fabbri 1996 4 w x x r x w dl i 100 where xr and xw are the ratings and weights for parameter x d r a s t i c or l assigned in any subarea and dli is computed from equation 2 hence the obtained effective weights were used to calculate a rescaled drastic land cover index redli representing the proper vulnerability mapping approach for the given geological hydrogeological and land cover characteristics of the tata city region 2 3 water quality assessment in order to verify the aquifer vulnerability obtained from geological hydrogeological and land cover parameters using the drastic model hydrochemical groundwater data was used as an actual pollution indicator this linkage provides a large amount of qualitative data and can therefore be an efficient tool in planning sustainable groundwater management strategies based on groundwater chemistry a new developed water quality index wqi for drinking and irrigation purposes was established the main aim of this approach was to transform a complex set of water quality data into information that is both understandable and useful for the local population 2 3 1 development of a water quality index the wqi was used to evaluate the impact of natural and anthropogenic processes based on key physical and chemical parameters these parameters were selected following the matee 2014 for drinking and irrigation water purposes a newly developed classification scheme for the wqi was computed by using quality classes of ions ci which are based on hydrochemical groundwater data this means that for a certain concentration a quality class table 2 can be assigned for each parameter these parameters are specific electrical conductivity ec chloride cl nitrate no3 and ammonia nh4 in terms of their usage the quality classes can be subdivided into five classes ranging from very good good moderate restricted to very restricted table 2 in terms of drinking water quality the groundwater quality class very good can be used without restriction matee 2003 the quality classes good and moderate need to be treated depending on the specific contaminant in terms of irrigation water the quality classes moderate and restricted are considered to be of sufficient quality matee 2003 the quality class very restricted should not be used for either drinking or irrigation water purposes matee 2003 elevated values of specific electrical conductivity ammonia and chloride in groundwater are not of any concern with regard to drinking water purposes who 2011 in contrast a guideline value for nitrate of 50 mg l was established who 2011 regarding irrigation water purposes the classification of nitrate is in compliance with the one introduced for tunisia by saidi et al 2009 further compliance is given with ayers and westcot 1985 for the ec classification in compliance with pusatli et al 2009 and saidi et al 2009 the wqi is calculated as equation 5 5 wq i c i 2 where ci is the quality class obtained from the chemical concentration of the parameters electrical conductivity chloride nitrate and ammonia following table 2 hence the minimum and maximum wqi values are 5 and 100 respectively this new classification approach has two major advantages i to identify the overall water quality status and ii to detect the parameter of most influence regarding the suitability for usage groundwater samples were taken in march 2018 from 44 wells within the tata plain fig 2 sampling points were chosen for an appropriate spatial cover within the study site moreover samples were collected from different land use and land cover types hence samples were taken in urban areas and agricultural areas as well as in natural vegetation the wells were either pumping wells or draw wells as well as public private or from associations specific electrical conductivity and oxygen contents were measured using the portable multi meter wtw 3420 hydrochemical analyses were carried out at the institute for geosciences university of bonn germany using ion chromatography shimadzu hic 6a for nitrate and chloride concentrations and photometry cadas 100 dr lange for ammonia concentrations additionally measurements of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were conducted using isotope ratio mass spectrometry isoprime tg100 to verify nitrate sources in groundwater for five samples taken in urban areas the isotope notations are expresses as δ per mil relative to the atmospheric n2 air and vienna mean ocean water v smow standards reproducibility is 0 2 for δ15n no3 and 0 4 for δ18o no3 in order to evaluate geological sources of n species and chloride in groundwater cns vario el cube elementar and mineralogical analyses d8 advance bruker axs were carried out for representative rock and sediment samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 the drastic index of the tata city region the geological and hydrogeological parameters of the drastic index were analyzed on the platform of qgis fig 3 a g the depth to groundwater and hydraulic conductivity parameters showed most variations the relative low depth to groundwater north of jebel bani is directly linked to the bottleneck of the jebel bani massif resulting in an elevation of the quaternary aquifer yazidi et al 2002 the differences in hydraulic conductivities of the quaternary sediments are linked to the unconformity of the grain sizes due to changes in sedimentation and depositional environments additionally the bottleneck of the jebel bani might have acted as a natural barrier and thus larger grain sizes were deposited north of the massif and consequently higher hydraulic conductivities were observed net recharge is very low because annual potential evapotranspiration revealed averagely 1061 mm and is thus greater than rainfall thus the net recharge parameter war rated with 1 however in arid regions recharge areas can be linked to the presence of faults and coexisting areas between faults and the drainage system al hanbali and kondoh 2008 in these regions water is assumed to infiltrate directly through the vadose zone and reach the water table consequently since this increases vulnerability higher ratings have to be assigned regions of coexisting areas between faults and drainage system exist in the northern part of the study where the fractured lower cambrian series are present fig 2 correspondingly the ratings were adjusted by the factor of 3 in these regions topography parameter presented as slopes was steep 18 for the hard rock series cambrian to devonian and relatively flat 2 5 for the sediments quaternary soil media was absent for the hard rock series whereas the alluvial series consisted of sand and gravel rating of 9 5 the lacustrine series was characterized as loam and thus rated by 5 the calculated drastic indices in the tata city region were relatively homogeneous in the range of 73 and 133 representing vulnerability classes of low and moderate a distinction in the drastic indices is noticed between the cambrian to devonian hard rock series compared to the unconsolidated quaternary series fig 4 a whereas the drastic indices of the hard rocks series ranged between 70 and 103 representing solely low vulnerability classes the drastic indices of the sediment series ranged between 96 and 133 displaying vulnerability classes of low to moderate with most being moderate in fact within the surrounding cambrian to devonian series the relief is steep t parameter and the groundwater level d parameter is estimated to be very deep 22 8 m leading to the observed low vulnerability class in contrast the groundwater level within the quaternary sediments of the tata plain ranged between 5 2 m and 25 0 m ratings of 3 7 in combination with a rating of 7 for the aquifer media and 6 for the impact of vadose zone media a low to moderate vulnerability class was observed in terms of the spatial distribution of the vulnerability classes within the study site 68 8 151 3 km2 of the total area display a low vulnerability and 31 2 68 7 km2 a moderate vulnerability class table 3 3 2 land cover impact land cover within the tata city region fig 3h was rated according to secunda et al 1998 and al hanbali and kondoh 2008 the cambrian to devonian hard rock series represented bare land most of the quaternary sediments lacustrine series were categorized as natural vegetation due to several villages and oases within the quaternary sediments parts of it displayed the land cover classes urban and agriculture since the wadi tata is intermittent the alluvial series can display bare land as well as water given that throughout most of the year and also during the field survey the wadis were dry these areas were categorized as bare land for further calculations after extending the drastic index fig 4a with the land cover parameter l fig 3h the calculated drastic land cover index showed a different spatial distribution of vulnerability fig 4b generally the drastic land cover index varied between 75 and 172 the vulnerability class for the cambrian and devonian series increased to moderate but the ordovician jebel bani series remained low since all of the hard rock series were classified as bare land this difference could be linked to the geological and hydrogeological parameters of the series for instance the aquifer media and impact of vadose zone for the cambrian series was rated higher compared to the ordovician series compare fig 3c and f in urban and agricultural areas vulnerability remained in the moderate class but displayed values close to the high vulnerability class as both land cover parameters being ranked by 8 on the whole the area of moderate vulnerability increased up to 144 3 km2 65 6 and the area of low vulnerability decreased to 75 7 km2 34 4 table 4 3 3 sensitivity of the tata drastic land cover index the weightings of each parameter and its impact to compute the drastic land cover index was addressed using single parameter sensitivity analysis the analysis revealed that there are some deviations of the initial effective weights of the drastic parameters introduced by aller et al 1987 and secunda et al 1998 when compared to the calculated empirical weights for the tata study site table 5 for the tata city region the rescaled effective weights are in the order of i l a s d c r t compared to the weights introduced by aller et al 1987 the net recharge for the tata city region tends to be less effective since the rescaled weight was 1 4 this can be explained by the fact that recharge is low and thus the assigned ratings were 1 or 3 likewise the depth to groundwater and hydraulic conductivity parameters point to be less effective the low sensitivity towards the groundwater depth is caused by the water table being 22 m below surface in the hard rock series in contrast aquifer media soil media and impact of vadose zone media tend to be more effective parameters due to high ratings assigned for these parameters the topography slope and land cover parameters showed effective weights close to the initial empirical weights see table 5 based on the calculated average effective weights rescaled effective weights were implemented for the specific geological hydrogeological and land cover characteristics of the tata city region table 5 using the new obtained effective weights for equation 1 the rescaled drastic land cover index redli was recomputed generally the rescaled drastic land cover indices increased into the range between 98 and 196 showing low to high vulnerability classes fig 4c the cambrian to devonian hard rock series remained in or increased to the moderate vulnerability class within the quaternary sediments of the tata plain vulnerability increased into moderate to high classes especially in the southern central parts of the study site after the rescaling process the moderate vulnerability class covers most of the study site with 130 7 km2 59 4 high and low vulnerable areas display 41 1 km2 18 7 and 48 2 km2 21 9 respectively table 6 3 4 water quality index as hydrochemical data can be used to verify the computed vulnerability indices the wqi was calculated based on groundwater samples the wqi varied between 7 and 60 indicating a wide range of groundwater quality fig 5 a regarding the spatial distribution of the wqi most groundwater samples showed low wqi s fig 5a nevertheless across the entire study site five elevated spots were noted these are restricted to urban areas namely the villages of ait yassine tammacht ait werkane tiguissalt and el ayoun in terms of correlation analyses it appears that nitrate is the most important chemical parameter on the overall wqi the comparison between the maps of the wqi and nitrate concentrations reveals that areas with high wqi s are related to elevated nitrate concentrations and vice versa fig 5a and b a comparable correlation was not observed in the case of the other hydrochemical quality parameters with one exception in el ayoun south eastern study site a high wqi is related to elevated chloride and sulphate concentrations this elevation is caused by natural increasing salinity conditions towards the saharan foreland yazidi et al 2001 and was confirmed by mineralogical and cns analyses which showed the presence of evaporites within the lacustrine terrace series ammonia was in most cases close to or below the detection limit of 0 03 mg l this is a result of the rapid oxidation of nh4 to no3 in the presence of oxygen stadler et al 2008 thus nh4 input may not be identified separately and was measured as no3 in tigusissalt groundwater showed a low oxygen content 1 8 mg l and thus an elevated nh4 concentration of 4 4 mg l was noticed geological sources for n species in groundwater from hard rocks and sediment can be excluded since cns analyses showed values below the detection limit of 400 ppm nevertheless n input from soil cannot be excluded concerning the suitability of water for drinking and irrigation purposes fig 6 illustrates the correlation between the different physical and chemical water quality parameters in terms of drinking water the quality status is related more to elevated ec s and no3 rather than to cl and nh4 fig 6a however 37 samples 84 1 showed a good to moderate drinking water quality with one or either both parameters being elevated when comparing nitrate with ec chloride and ammonia six samples were of a restricted to very restricted quality regarding all of the parameters in the case of ec and nitrate none and one sample were below the recommended drinking water quality with regard to cl and nh4 concentrations four and five samples showed values above the recommended drinking water quality water quality for irrigation purposes is good for 93 2 of the samples fig 6b three samples showed a restricted degree on irrigation use due to elevated ec s and nitrate concentrations high salinities in this case expressed as ec can cause yield losses if salt accumulates in the root crop zone ayers and westcot 1985 3 5 relation between water quality index drastic and land cover in order to verify if groundwater quality wqi is related to the geological and hydrogeological aquifer vulnerability drastic or to an anthropogenic impact land cover parameter correlations were calculated in this context the spearman rank correlation coefficient was applied since it is not restrained by the general distribution form of the two variables and the sample sizes huan et al 2012 a correlation coefficient of 1 0 or 1 0 indicates perfect positive or negative correlation and 0 0 indicates no correlation the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the di and the wqi was of the order of 0 4 indicating no significant linkage between the hydrogeological aquifer vulnerability and groundwater pollution areas of moderate di s can display areas of low and high wqi s but areas of high wqi s are always linked to areas with high di s compare figs 4a and 5a similary a low correlation was observed between the dli and wqi as the spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 5 again areas of moderate dli s can display areas of low and high wqi s but areas of high wqi s are always linked to areas with high dli s compare figs 4b and 5a in terms of index based vulnerability mapping it was shown that the land cover parameter has a profound impact on groundwater vulnerability e g secunda et al 1998 al hanbali and kondoh 2008 it has been widely recognized that elevated nitrate concentrations can be directly linked to anthropogenic influences of urban and agricultural land cover classes huan et al 2012 thus nitrate concentrations present a good indicator for the impact of the land cover classes on groundwater quality this is also reflected in the results of this study since nitrate was identified as the most influencing parameter regarding water quality fig 7 superimposes nitrate concentrations related to the water quality classes from table 2 on the land cover map generally distinct differences in nitrate concentrations were observed related to land cover fig 7 and table 7 groundwater in urban areas showed highest nitrate concentrations especially nitrate concentrations 100 mg l were restricted to urban areas lower elevated nitrate concentrations were monitored within agriculture oases and natural vegetation land cover classes being on average 15 1 mg l and 14 3 mg l respectively wells were not present in bare land hard rock series nitrate concentrations were not related to groundwater depth moreover no correlation between nitrate concentrations and type of well either being public private or from local associations were noticed since hydrochemical investigations showed most elevated nitrate concentrations in urban areas contamination might be ascribed to missing wastewater treatment systems as well as to waste depositional sites assaf and saadeh 2009 this was proven by isotopic composition of nitrate which ranged between 13 1 and 22 0 for δ15n as well as between 3 2 and 7 8 for δ18o fig 8 this signature is distinctive for manure and septic waste as a potential contamination source kendall and aravena 2000 saadou oumarou et al 2019 in manure the main n compound is urea which is converted to nitrate in the unsaturated zone stadler et al 2008 thus nitrogen may enter from point sources through preferential flow path and is subsequently leached into groundwater since the quaternary aquifer showed hydraulic conductivities in the range of 10 4 m s contaminant transport is rapid within oases nitrate concentrations were generally less elevated and can derive from fertilization and to a certain extent from cattle grazing tagma et al 2009 moreover a mixture of highly contaminated groundwater from urban areas with less contaminated groundwater from agricultural and bare land can be assumed 4 conclusions the drastic index showed that most of the study site is characterized by a low vulnerability thus the characteristic geological and hydrogeological factors within the tata city region provide a natural protection against groundwater contamination however after implementing the land cover parameters the drastic land cover index showed that most of the study site is of moderate vulnerability indicating a greater groundwater pollution risk caused by human hazards thereby more vulnerable areas occur along the oases and villages representing agriculture and urban land cover classes based on the geological hydrogeological and land cover characteristics of the tata city region the results from the single parameter sensitivity analysis showed that the net recharge and topography slope parameters tend to be less significant in contrast the impact of vadose zone media and land cover parameters have a significant impact evaluation of water quality within the tata city region was carried out using a newly developed water quality index thereby groundwater showed mostly a good to moderate status in terms of drinking water quality in terms of irrigation groundwater is of good quality the relation between groundwater quality and vulnerability mapping indicates that groundwater quality is related more to land cover than to the specific geological and hydrogeological setting in terms of hydrochemical data evaluation nitrate was revealed to be the most important chemical parameter reducing the degree of usage elevated nitrate concentrations are restricted to urban areas nitrate isotope composition showed that the contamination source resulted from the lack of a proper sewage system in the villages this was clearly evidenced by the fact that nitrate concentrations in groundwater displayed values below 50 mg l in tata city which has functioning a sewage system finally this study highlighted the absence of waste water treatment systems as the major source of groundwater contamination within the tata city region thus there is a strong need to implement management options in respect to wastewater treatment plants in the surrounding villages of tata city since this implementation is very cost intensive a cheaper and more easily applicable approach would be to increase the distance between the supply wells and domestic waste deposits toilets lavatory kitchen thereby the developed groundwater vulnerability and water quality maps provide fundamental knowledge to identify appropriate locations

12174,groundwater is a primary drinking water source in various parts of indo gangetic plain many rural agglomerations in this alluvial plain face scarcity of safe drinking water yet there is a lack of public awareness and scientific studies in these areas and raebareli district is one of them groundwater samples collected from handpumps dugwells and tubewells were analysed for various physico chemical parameters and compared with drinking standards for drinking suitability the elevated concentrations of nitrate can be attributed towards heavy fertilizer application and irrigation practices whereas rock water interaction can be a cause for higher fluoride concentrations in groundwater the ionic abundance was in order of hco3 na cl so4 2 mg2 ca2 no3 k f and hco3 na cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 no3 k f during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively irrigation suitability of groundwater was also assessed using sodium absorption ratio wilcox diagram doneen s plot kelley s index magnesium hazard and other suitable indices the analysis suggested that there is a medium to high salinity hazard in the area as per kelley s index approximately 57 of the samples were found unsuitable for irrigation practices non carcinogenic health hazards associated with nitrate and fluoride and their impacts on adult men and children were also assessed the total hazard index values ranged from 0 4 to 14 5 in children and 0 3 to 10 8 in adult men the results also suggested that more than 82 of the samples for children and 77 for adult men could possibly impart non carcinogenic

easily available and accessible raw material with withdrawal rates as high as 982 km3 year margat and gun 2013 globally groundwater is one of the most important sources of water for domestic agricultural and industrial applications in india approximately 68 of the population census 2011 is rural which depends primarily on groundwater for their routine activities more importantly groundwater is used on the 50 80 of the irrigated land raju 1998 selvakumar et al 2017a 2017b the increasing population and subsequently increasing water demand has brought about the quantitative decline in groundwater resources moreover many pollutants have affected the qualitative aspects of groundwater as well bob et al 2016 the chemical quality of groundwater in its natural state is generally good however for a particular region the groundwater quality is primarily governed through the natural process such as precipitation and dissolution of minerals groundwater flow and its direction residence time and intra inter aquifer interactions andrade et al 2008 mehdi et al 2014 moreover leaching of various pollutants as a result of numerous anthropogenic activities industrial waste domestic waste agricultural waste etc also degrade the groundwater quality batabyal and chakraborty 2015 sakizadeh et al 2016 the geographical and geological arrangement of a region greatly govern the natural quality of groundwater shuxian 2013 taheri et al 2017 tahmasebi et al 2018 moreover the data for geochemistry of groundwater and sediments provide crucial insights into the geologic origin and history of rocks groundwater recharge and its movement selvakumar et al 2017a 2017b saha et al 2018 among all the groundwater contaminants nitrate and fluoride are the most widespread pollutants which may have adverse health impacts on humans nitrate contamination in shallow groundwater specially in the agricultural regions has been an increasingly reported problem around the world vinod et al 2015 antiguedad et al 2016 wang et al 2016 beutel et al 2017 ransom et al 2017 consumption of water having high concentrations of nitrate 45 mg l may cause blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia cancer shortness of breath etc deroos et al 2003 ashok and hait 2015 sahoo et al 2016 on the other hand dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals fluorite biotite muscovite etc is reported to be the most common origin of fluoride in groundwater kumar and saxena 2011 li et al 2016b chen et al 2017 globally more than 260 million people are reported to be suffering from high fluoride 1 5 mg l through ingestion of drinking water rao 2018 adimalla and li 2018 narsimha et al 2018 world health organization who has recommended a guideline value of 1 5 mg l as a level for fluoride at which there shall be minimal risk of dental fluorosis who 2011 adimalla 2019 hence provisioning of safe drinking water requires understanding of occurrence and extent of the nitrate and fluoride contamination in drinking water and health risks associated with these contaminants similarly the toxicity in the groundwater for irrigation suitability can be assessed through various indices the primary toxic ions are sodium chlorine and boron as these are toxic to some crops even at very low concentrations ravikumar et al 2011 large quantities of dissolved ions decrease the osmotic pressure and hence preventing water from reaching the branches and leaves which subsequently affect the plant metabolism bouderbala 2015 irrigation water quality indices also help in determining the fertility needs irrigation system performance other than the crop yield etc hence it become important to assess the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes the selected sites under investigation in this study are mostly rural and it was found that there is very little awareness among people pertaining to quality standards of water they are consuming moreover despite the importance of safe drinking water there is a lack of scientific studies to assess the groundwater quality and the associated human health risks in the study area especially among the rural agglomerations the primary objective of this paper is to discuss the suitability of groundwater for human consumption based on compliance of physicochemical parameters with drinking water standards proposed by bis 2012 and who 2011 furthermore since the study area is predominantly an agricultural area irrigation suitability of the water was also evaluated the study also attempts to quantify the human health risks associated with nitrate and fluoride contaminated water via ingestion pathway for different age groups 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area raebareli lies under the central indo gangetic alluvial plain between latitude 25 49 north and 26 36 north and longitude 100 41 east and 81 34 east fig 1 the water samples were collected from khiron lalganj and amawa blocks of raebareli district the district is a fairly compact tract of gently undulating land and drained by river ganga sai and their tributaries the elevation varies from 86 9 m to 120 4 m above sea level the climate is sub humid with average annual rainfall of 1150 mm the sediments of indo gangetic basin have generally been classified as older and newer alluvium and the raebareli district is underlain by alluvial sediments of quaternary age the upper layer of alluvium is composed of sandy loam silty clays and clays in varying proportions and minor sand beds are also seen the thickness of this zone ranges from 5 to 16 m on an average with kankar is interspersed in clay khanna 1992 cgwb 2012 2 2 sample collection and analysis groundwater samples were collected during the pre monsoon february may monsoon june september and post monsoon october january seasons in 2016 17 from hand pumps dugwells and tubewells the samples were collected in pre washed polyethylene bottles 1 l capacity after 3 min pumping of the hand pump and bore well rinsing the bottles twice only the analytical study grade chemicals merck and sigma aldrich germany were used and glassware was washed with dilute nitric acid 1 15 n followed by distilled water all the samples were preserved and stored at 4 c until the analysis was going on ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were taken at the field immediately after the sample collection furthermore the major cations ammonium nh4 lithium li sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 and major anions chloride cl nitrate no3 nitrite no2 sulfate so4 2 fluoride f phosphate po4 2 and bromide br were analysed using ion chromatography metrohm 850 as outlined in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 bicarbonate and total hardness were analysed using the titrimetric method apha 2012 2 3 data quality assurance the validity and quality of water quality data was assessed by calculating a the charge balance error cbe for each sample and b the ec tds ratio the cbe was calculated using eq 1 1 c b e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 where cations and anions were expressed in mg l in general a cbe in the range of 5 is assumed perfect in case of water quality analysis however cbe less than 10 is also acceptable for such studies apha 2012 chen et al 2017 the cbe was in the range of 5 except for three samples where cbe was 6 53 5 38 and 5 68 which was acceptable for this study whereas the ec tds ratio was in the range of 0 55 0 7 indicating that the analytical data has good precision apha 2012 2 4 statistical analysis the hydrochemical evaluations of contaminated groundwater systems are usually based on the availability collection of data on groundwater chemistry however contaminant and water chemistry can be statistically interpreted using the tools such as bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis correlation analysis etc singh et al 2005 devic et al 2014 in india the use of these tools to understand the groundwater chemistry and process controlling the contaminant chemistry is well documented lakshmanan et al 2003 rajesh et al 2012 chidambaram et al 2013 however studies investigating the status of groundwater quality in uttar pradesh are very limited sahu et al 2018 in this study pearson s correlation matrix was generated for the analysed physico chemical parameters using origin pro 2019b software pearson s correlation coefficient analysis is widely and extensively used to evaluate and assess the linear dependence between two or more variables the analysis also helps in identifying the adequacy of one variable to predict the behaviour of other batabyal and chakraborty 2015 a positive correlation between the pair of parameters exists when an increase in one parameter causes an increase in the other parameter as well and vice versa for negative correlation the value of pearson s correlation coefficient r lies in the range of 1 there is no correlation between the parameters if the value of r is zero a strong correlation is said to exist for values ranging between 0 9 and 1 similarly a good correlation is there for values between 0 51 and 0 89 and low degree of correlation exists when values of r lies in the range of 0 and 0 50 batabyal and chakraborty 2015 2 5 non carcinogenic human health risk assessment the groundwater quality affects the human health in many ways studies investigating the effect of groundwater quality on the human health proves to be beneficial to assess the possible health impacts in local population consuming the affected water in this study the non carcinogenic human health risks evaluation associated with nitrate and fluoride was done by employing the methods proposed by united state environmental protection agency usepa 1989 li et al 2019 for adult men and children the average daily oral intake dosage is computed by eq 2 2 c d i c c i r e f e d b w a t where cdi is chronic daily intake of water mg kg day c c is the concentration for a particular contaminant in water mg l ir denotes the ingestion rate which is taken as 2 5 l day for adult man and 0 78 l day for children karunanidhi et al 2019 ef is the exposure frequency and taken as 365 days per year ed is the exposure duration taken as 64 years for adult men and 12 years for children b w average body weight is taken as 65 kg for adult men and 15 kg for children and at signifies the average time duration in days for the non carcinogenic effects 23360 and 4380 respectively for adult men and children as per norms usepa 2014 f and no3 are declared as non carcinogenic and the non carcinogenic effect of these contaminants can be computed as hazard quotient hq computed by eq 3 3 h q c d i r f d where rfd is the reference dose 1 6 mg kg day for nitrate 0 04 mg kg day for fluoride li et al 2016a the values of hq 1 suggests that non carcinogenic human health risks exceed the acceptable limit for the particular contaminant in groundwater finally the total hazard index thi is computed using eq 4 4 t h i h q n i t r a t e h q f l u o r i d e 2 6 irrigation suitability of groundwater irrigation suitability of groundwater was examined based upon the following parameters and ratios ec sodium adsorption ratio sar in association with ec values sodium percentage na salinity hazard residual sodium bicarbonates rsbc exchangeable sodium ratio or kelley s index ki permeability index pi and magnesium hazard mh united state salinity laboratory ussl diagram doneen s plot and wilcox plot were also used to determine the various irrigation classes of groundwater these plots were prepared using aqua chem software 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater compliance with respect to drinking water standards the statistical summary of various physico chemical parameters analysed for the water samples are listed in table 1 the percent compliance of these parameters with respect to the drinking water standards bis 2012 who 2011 is summarised in table 2 the presented data confirms the drinking suitability of groundwater samples across the study area out of the selected parameters nitrite bromide lithium ammonium and phosphate were not detected in any of the sampling locations in any season hence these parameters were excluded from further calculations the ph values ranged from 7 21 to 8 69 pre monsoon and 7 16 to 8 63 post monsoon suggesting slightly alkaline nature of groundwater in the study area there is very little variation in the ph values showing a 78 6 compliance with the drinking standards across the seasons whereas there was high variation in the values of electrical conductivity with maximum value recorded in the sample collected from dug well the values being 4200 μs cm pre monsoon 4100 μs cm monsoon and 4150 μs cm during post monsoon season which is in direct coherence with the presence of ionic concentrations in the groundwater and its higher values indicates higher salinity and total dissolved solids concentration the areas with higher ec values also indicate towards high mineralization the values of tds ranged between 260 mg l during monsoon season to 3010 mg l during post monsoon season however the tds is within permissible limit bis 2012 only in 21 4 pre monsoon and post monsoon of the collected samples similarly total hardness is within the permissible limits in only 28 6 pre monsoon and 35 7 post monsoon respectively with mean values for groundwater samples being in the class of very hard water type sawyer and mccarty 1967 this pattern suggests towards the presence of thick layered topsoil and limestone formations in the study area consumption of water with hardness levels in the range of 150 300 mg l and above may aid kidney stone formation also it causes an unpleasant taste in the water sengupta 2013 mostafa et al 2017 moreover a plot between tds and th was also prepared gao et al 2019 to assess the water classification based on these parameters fig 2 it can be seen that almost 43 of the samples were in hard fresh water and hard brackish water category across the seasons 3 2 major ion chemistry the abundance of cations and anions can be verified as k ca2 mg2 na and f no3 so4 2 cl hco3 respectively during pre monsoon however the cationic abundance in post monsoon was found to be k mg2 ca2 na and anionic abundance remains the same in post monsoon season among all the cations mg2 had the lowest compliance i e 42 9 in pre monsoon and 50 in post monsoon seasons the elevated levels of magnesium ion in drinking water are associated with hypertension and cardiovascular problems which may also prove to be fatal saris et al 2000 sengupta 2013 the compliance of ca2 ion was very high 85 7 across the seasons with mean values of 47 9 mg l and 42 1 mg l during pre monsoon and post monsoon respectively the increased calcium intake is found to interact and subsequently reduce the adsorption of other minerals iron zinc and phosphorus in the intestine rishi et al 2019 wasilewski et al 2019 na is also a very important cation related with human health because of its dietary requirements and high intake of na may result in congenital diseases kidney issues and neurological problems who 2011 rao et al 2012 high sodium concentration in groundwater is often associated with dissolution of minerals such as halite silicate etc and cation exchange capacity of soil rajesh et al 2012 li et al 2016b hco3 was found to be the prevailing ion with a maximum value of 636 mg l during post monsoon season and mean values of 387 4 mg l pre monsoon and 393 4 mg l post monsoon the minimum chloride concentration was recorded as low as 3 46 mg l during monsoon season to as high as 571 mg l with a mean value of 135 3 mg l annual average only 15 of the samples were found to be having chloride content of more than 250 mg l chloride is a major inorganic anion present in the water and high chloride content in drinking water may impart some salty taste in it presence of elevated levels of cl is an indicator of erosion and weathering of crystalline rocks mismanagement of industrial discharge etc rajesh et al 2012 selvakumar et al 2017a presence of sulfate ions in water may cause temporary taste impairment and have a laxative effect the so4 2 had the highest compliance with the drinking standards 92 86 across the seasons with mean values of 88 6 mg l and 82 5 mg l during pre monsoon and post monsoon season respectively among the anions f ion showed the lowest compliance of 42 9 across the season as per indian standards this suggests that the study area is adversely affected by fluoride contamination in groundwater excess fluoride 1 5 mg l may cause dental fluorosis and higher fluoride concentrations may even cause skeletal fluorosis and non skeletal fluorosis amalraj and pius 2013 raj and shaji 2017 the concentration of nitrate varied from below detectable limits to 164 2 mg l with a mean value of 35 7 and 31 2 mg l during pre monsoon and post monsoon respectively the highest value of nitrate were reported in the sample collected from dugwell indicating anthropogenic intervention bhattacharya et al 2006 since the area is mostly agriculture dominated excessive fertilizer usage might be the reason behind elevated level of nitrate in groundwater nitrate beyond permissible limits may cause blue baby syndrome thyroid problems etc shukla and saxena 2018 sulfate and nitrate levels in an aquifer are also affected by the microbial degradation of organic matter ahmed et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 2004 a stiff plot stiff 1951 was prepared for the study area fig 3 using grapher software for both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the stiff plot is used to assess the pattern of cations and anions present in the groundwater the distinctive feature of this plot is that it retains the pattern even after the dilution of the sample stiff 1951 the pattern for pre monsoon season is mostly overlapped by the pattern for post monsoon season it can be observed that the dominant type is hco3 na category for both seasons suggesting the groundwater is affected by cation exchange and or silicate interaction process venturelli et al 2003 lima et al 2019 moreover ca2 mg2 cl water was more dominant in post monsoon season this water type suggests mixing of high salinity water effects of domestic wastewater and septic tank effluents jeyaraj et al 2016 selvakumar et al 2017a as the reason behind the high concentration of these ions in the study area moreover the dominance of na and cl water type also indicates the presence of chemical fertilizer and sewage influences egbi et al 2020 which is coherent with high nitrate concentration in the dugwell the overall concentration array of major ions can be summarised as hco3 na cl so4 2 mg2 ca2 no3 k f during pre monsoon and hco3 na cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 no3 k f during post monsoon season 3 3 interrelationships between water quality parameters the correlation analysis shows a comparable trend during monsoon and post monsoon periods tables 3 and 4 the values suggesting a strong correlation r 0 9 are highlighted in the tables ph shows negative correlation with all parameters except for f so4 2 and na during all the seasons ec shows a strong correlation with tds th cl hco3 so4 2 na and mg2 during all the seasons whereas tds has strong correlation with th na cl hco3 mg2 and so4 2 th shows a strong correlation with so4 2 and mg2 although only mg2 is a primary hardness causing cation among those ions cl shows good 0 9 r 0 5 to strong correlation with all the parameters except for ca2 good correlation can be seen between mg2 with na and k suggesting that these parameters might have originated from same source electrical conductivity shows a strong correlation with tds and th in all the seasons which indicates the fact that conductivity increases with concentration of dissolved ions in water moreover ec also shows strong to good correlation with na k mg2 so4 2 f and no3 indicating the involvement of most of the ions in the geochemical reactions such as oxidation reduction ion exchange in the aquifer system additionally it can also be deducted that these ions are mainly originated by heavy fertilizer application and domestic discharges selvakumar et al 2017a 2017b şener et al 2017 3 4 irrigation suitability electrical conductivity is one of the most important parameters along with tds which regulates the irrigation suitability of groundwater high concentration of dissolved salts such as sodium calcium magnesium etc in the irrigation water affect the osmotic pressure in the root zone which in turn affects the water intake capacity by the roots the soil quality and crop yield bob et al 2016 hence evaluation of water in terms of its irrigation suitability prior to its use will help in increasing the plant productivity and crop yield several methods such as wilcox 1955 ussl plot wilcox 1955 kelley 1940 magnesium hazard paliwal 1972 etc have been extensively used to classify the irrigation water to evaluate the irrigation suitability the average value of the parameters of concern for pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon were taken into consideration and the important indices to assess the irrigation suitability in the study area are as follows all the ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l 3 4 1 sodium percent the reaction of na with soil is an important process to assess the irrigation suitability of groundwater the sodium percent na can be used using the following formula eq 5 5 n a n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 high na concentration in irrigation water is absorbed by clay particles displacing the ca2 and mg2 ions which reduces the permeability of soil and subsequently resulting in poor internal drainage selvakumar et al 2017b wilcox plot fig 4 suggests that 28 6 of the samples falling into the category of very good to good which can be readily used for irrigation whereas 42 9 of the samples were in the category permissible to doubtful soils in these locations might be having poor internal drainage only one sample was in the class of unsuitable for irrigation purposes 3 4 2 sodium absorption ratio sar the excessive sodium content relative to calcium and magnesium inhibits the water supply needed for crop growth bouwer 1978 this excess sodium or limited calcium and magnesium content can be used to classify the irrigation waters using the following formula eq 6 6 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 a sar value of less than 6 is categorised as groundwater having no problem for irrigation purpose in this study 71 4 of the samples were found in this category whereas none of the samples were found to be in the category of severe problem for irrigation sar 9 however 28 6 of the studied sample were in the category of increasing problem for irrigation purposes 6 sar 9 for a detailed analysis and understanding sar as sodium hazard can be plotted against ec fig 5 on the ussl diagram ussl 1954 wilcox 1955 as per ussl diagram water samples can be classified into sixteen categories with samples in c1s1 class being the most suitable for irrigation purposes and samples in class c4s4 being the worst in this present study none of the samples were falling in c1s1 category 28 6 of the samples were found in c2s1 category which indicates medium salinity low alkalinity content 64 3 of the samples in c3s1 category indicating the high salinity low alkalinity and only one sample falling under c4s1 category which signifies very high salinity low alkalinity content in the groundwater samples the results suggest that water samples are having low alkalinity conditions but varying level of salinity which are suitable for crops with high salt tolerance these results are also in coherence with results of salinity hazard 3 4 3 residual sodium bicarbonates when the concentration of bicarbonate ion is more than the concentration of calcium ion there is some residual sodium bicarbonate in the water generally sodium aggregation takes place in soil when the high water with high rsbc content is used for irrigation purpose which results in destruction of soil structure in soils with clay content increased salinity and reduced crop productivity naseem et al 2010 the rsbc can be calculated using the following formula eq 7 7 r s b c h c o 3 c a 2 in the study area 78 6 of the samples were in category of low and medium alkalinity table 5 whereas one sample from dugwell was in the class of very high alkalinity the positive values of rsbc suggests that the soluble content of calcium and magnesium ions are less than the carbonate and bicarbonate ions 3 4 4 permeability index sodium bicarbonate calcium and magnesium content in the soil affect the permeability of the soil doneen 1964 evolved a formula eq 8 for calculating the value of permeability index pi which is a significant parameter to assess the groundwater suitability for irrigation 8 p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 doneen 1964 suggested a three class categorization for assessing the suitability where permeability index values are plotted against the total ionic concentrations in the water fig 6 in the present study 78 6 of the samples were in the class i pi 75 and 14 3 in class ii pi 25 75 which of the maximum permeability water samples in class i and ii are the water types with 75 or more of maximum permeability and are suitable for irrigation purposes only one sample was in class iii which is unsuitable for irrigation purpose 3 4 5 kelley s index kelley 1940 provided guidelines for the water to be used for irrigation purposes he also investigated the effects of using saline water for irrigation and developed an index kelley 1963 to assess the irrigation suitability of saline water the kelley s index ki can be calculated using the following formula eq 9 9 k i n a c a 2 m g 2 water with ki 1 are classified as unsuitable for irrigation and the 57 1 of the studied samples falls in this category moreover 42 9 of the samples were found suitable for irrigation ki 1 3 4 6 magnesium ratio and magnesium hazard water can be placed in three classes safe moderate and unsafe for irrigation purpose based on the ratio of mg2 to ca2 ravikumar et al 2011 high levels of mg2 is because of exchangeable na ions in water particularly in case of highly saline water with dominance of na and it causes destruction of soil structure tahmasebi et al 2018 in the present study 71 4 of the studied samples were in the category safe for irrigation purpose mr 1 5 whereas 7 1 of the samples were in moderate category 1 5 mr 3 and 21 4 of the samples were unsafe mr 3 to be used for irrigation purposes moreover paliwal 1972 introduced an important ratio of magnesium ion to calcium and magnesium ion known as magnesium hazard mh which can be calculated using the following formula eq 10 10 m h m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 an mh value of more than 50 would make the soil alkaline affect the crop productivity and hence considered unsuitable for irrigation purpose in the present study only 21 4 of the samples were considered suitable for irrigation purposes mh 50 whereas 78 6 of the samples were found to be unsuitable 3 5 health risk the non carcinogenic health risks associated with the consumption of fluoride and nitrate contaminated water are very well documented and present a worrisome picture globally the effects are even more pronounced in india where majority of the rural population depends upon groundwater for drinking and other domestic purposes adimalla 2019 karunanidhi et al 2019 rishi et al 2019 since the study area mostly comprises rural agglomerations and results suggests that there is elevated concentration of fluoride and nitrate in the study area it becomes important to assess the non carcinogenic human health risks associated with fluoride and nitrate in groundwater in the study area the hq for fluoride and nitrate were calculated for adult men and children and the results are summarised in table 6 the hqnitrate for children varied from 0 002 to 5 07 with a mean value of 0 4 and the respective values for adult men were 0 001 3 74 and mean value of 0 3 similarly hqfluoride for children and adult men varied from 0 33 to 10 77 and 0 25 to 7 96 respectively the mean values were recorded as 2 3 and 1 7 for children and adult men respectively moreover the non carcinogenic risk is said to be present when hq and thi is more than unity and the results are summarised in table 7 it can be seen that more than 11 of groundwater samples for hqnitrate were above the acceptable limit whereas 80 of the groundwater samples for hqfluoride were above the acceptable limit in case of exposure to children the corresponding values in case of adult men for hqnitrate and hqfluoride were 5 7 and 71 4 respectively suggesting that children were more vulnerable towards the non carcinogenic health risks associated with fluoride and nitrate the total hazard index thi was also calculated which depicts the combined non carcinogenic health risks associated with fluoride and nitrate the thi values for adult men and children at all sampling sites are depicted in fig 7 the mean values of thi were found to be 2 0 and 2 7 for adult men and children respectively moreover thi of more than 77 samples for adult men and 82 of the samples for children were found to be more than 1 signifying that majority of groundwater samples are susceptible to impart potential health risks both in adult male and children hence children in the study area are found to be more vulnerable compared to adult men in the study area this might be because of their lower body weight moreover fluoride concentration has more impact in shaping the thi values as can be seen at site rb20 and rb21 however the highest non carcinogenic risk corresponds to locations with highest fluoride and nitrate content in groundwater rb31 the awareness among the rural residents regarding the human health risks is very low there is almost negligible public information related to drinking water safety in these rural areas moreover there is no metering for withdrawal of groundwater which makes the quantitative decline an aggravated issue in these areas as well the current health risks shall be addressed with immediate importance and necessary actions shall be taken by the groundwater policy makers and key stakeholders in the study area 4 conclusion groundwater serves as the primary source for drinking and irrigation purpose in the study area since the region is predominantly rural a groundwater quality evaluation was performed to assess its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes the physico chemical parameters were compared with drinking water standards to assess the compliance for drinking purposes whereas several indices were used for the assessment of irrigation suitability of the groundwater samples moreover non carcinogenic human health risks associated with consumption of nitrate and fluoride contaminated water was also assessed in this study following conclusions can be drawn in the study area after this study groundwater in the study region was found to be slightly alkaline in nature majority of the groundwater samples with respect to cl so4 2 hco3 and ca2 were in the compliance with drinking water standards by bis 2012 and who 2011 the ionic abundance can be verified as hco3 na cl so4 2 mg2 ca2 no3 k f during the pre monsoon season and hco3 na cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 no3 k f during the post monsoon sampling fluoride showed the lowest compliance 42 9 among the cations suggesting that the study area is adversely affected by elevated fluoride levels in groundwater moreover nitrate concentration in the study area varied from below detection limit to 164 3 mg l intensive fertilizer application and irrigation activities could be the source of elevated nitrate levels in the studied samples whereas the high fluoride concentration can be attributed to rock water interactions in the aquifer and dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals in the study area groundwater in the study area is mostly hco3 na type which suggests that the groundwater is affected by cation exchange and silicate interaction could also be going on in the study area correlation analysis suggested that mg2 na and k might have originated from same source a good to strong correlation of ec with na k mg2 so4 2 f and no3 suggests that these ions are primarily originated by heavy fertilizer application and domestic discharges and other anthropogenic interventions the results from assessment of irrigation suitability suggest that groundwater in the study area is in medium to high salinity hazard but alkalinity hazard is low moreover as per the evaluation through wilcox diagram almost 43 of the samples were in permissible to doubtful category magnesium hazard and kelley s ratio suggests that majority of the water samples were unsuitable for irrigation purpose the results for non carcinogenic human health risks suggested that children are more vulnerable against the non carcinogenic risks associated with consumption of nitrate and fluoride contaminated water results also suggested that hazard quotient of fluoride had more impact on thi values than hqnitrate in the study area approximately 83 of the children and 77 of the adult mean were found to be at non carcinogenic health risks the study could play a key role for various stakeholders and policy makers in shaping the future policies regarding access to safe drinking water moreover it will also create awareness among the residents and medical professionals in these rural areas about the health hazards of consuming contaminated water funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors

12174,groundwater is a primary drinking water source in various parts of indo gangetic plain many rural agglomerations in this alluvial plain face scarcity of safe drinking water yet there is a lack of public awareness and scientific studies in these areas and raebareli district is one of them groundwater samples collected from handpumps dugwells and tubewells were analysed for various physico chemical parameters and compared with drinking standards for drinking suitability the elevated concentrations of nitrate can be attributed towards heavy fertilizer application and irrigation practices whereas rock water interaction can be a cause for higher fluoride concentrations in groundwater the ionic abundance was in order of hco3 na cl so4 2 mg2 ca2 no3 k f and hco3 na cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 no3 k f during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively irrigation suitability of groundwater was also assessed using sodium absorption ratio wilcox diagram doneen s plot kelley s index magnesium hazard and other suitable indices the analysis suggested that there is a medium to high salinity hazard in the area as per kelley s index approximately 57 of the samples were found unsuitable for irrigation practices non carcinogenic health hazards associated with nitrate and fluoride and their impacts on adult men and children were also assessed the total hazard index values ranged from 0 4 to 14 5 in children and 0 3 to 10 8 in adult men the results also suggested that more than 82 of the samples for children and 77 for adult men could possibly impart non carcinogenic

easily available and accessible raw material with withdrawal rates as high as 982 km3 year margat and gun 2013 globally groundwater is one of the most important sources of water for domestic agricultural and industrial applications in india approximately 68 of the population census 2011 is rural which depends primarily on groundwater for their routine activities more importantly groundwater is used on the 50 80 of the irrigated land raju 1998 selvakumar et al 2017a 2017b the increasing population and subsequently increasing water demand has brought about the quantitative decline in groundwater resources moreover many pollutants have affected the qualitative aspects of groundwater as well bob et al 2016 the chemical quality of groundwater in its natural state is generally good however for a particular region the groundwater quality is primarily governed through the natural process such as precipitation and dissolution of minerals groundwater flow and its direction residence time and intra inter aquifer interactions andrade et al 2008 mehdi et al 2014 moreover leaching of various pollutants as a result of numerous anthropogenic activities industrial waste domestic waste agricultural waste etc also degrade the groundwater quality batabyal and chakraborty 2015 sakizadeh et al 2016 the geographical and geological arrangement of a region greatly govern the natural quality of groundwater shuxian 2013 taheri et al 2017 tahmasebi et al 2018 moreover the data for geochemistry of groundwater and sediments provide crucial insights into the geologic origin and history of rocks groundwater recharge and its movement selvakumar et al 2017a 2017b saha et al 2018 among all the groundwater contaminants nitrate and fluoride are the most widespread pollutants which may have adverse health impacts on humans nitrate contamination in shallow groundwater specially in the agricultural regions has been an increasingly reported problem around the world vinod et al 2015 antiguedad et al 2016 wang et al 2016 beutel et al 2017 ransom et al 2017 consumption of water having high concentrations of nitrate 45 mg l may cause blue baby syndrome or methemoglobinemia cancer shortness of breath etc deroos et al 2003 ashok and hait 2015 sahoo et al 2016 on the other hand dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals fluorite biotite muscovite etc is reported to be the most common origin of fluoride in groundwater kumar and saxena 2011 li et al 2016b chen et al 2017 globally more than 260 million people are reported to be suffering from high fluoride 1 5 mg l through ingestion of drinking water rao 2018 adimalla and li 2018 narsimha et al 2018 world health organization who has recommended a guideline value of 1 5 mg l as a level for fluoride at which there shall be minimal risk of dental fluorosis who 2011 adimalla 2019 hence provisioning of safe drinking water requires understanding of occurrence and extent of the nitrate and fluoride contamination in drinking water and health risks associated with these contaminants similarly the toxicity in the groundwater for irrigation suitability can be assessed through various indices the primary toxic ions are sodium chlorine and boron as these are toxic to some crops even at very low concentrations ravikumar et al 2011 large quantities of dissolved ions decrease the osmotic pressure and hence preventing water from reaching the branches and leaves which subsequently affect the plant metabolism bouderbala 2015 irrigation water quality indices also help in determining the fertility needs irrigation system performance other than the crop yield etc hence it become important to assess the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes the selected sites under investigation in this study are mostly rural and it was found that there is very little awareness among people pertaining to quality standards of water they are consuming moreover despite the importance of safe drinking water there is a lack of scientific studies to assess the groundwater quality and the associated human health risks in the study area especially among the rural agglomerations the primary objective of this paper is to discuss the suitability of groundwater for human consumption based on compliance of physicochemical parameters with drinking water standards proposed by bis 2012 and who 2011 furthermore since the study area is predominantly an agricultural area irrigation suitability of the water was also evaluated the study also attempts to quantify the human health risks associated with nitrate and fluoride contaminated water via ingestion pathway for different age groups 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area raebareli lies under the central indo gangetic alluvial plain between latitude 25 49 north and 26 36 north and longitude 100 41 east and 81 34 east fig 1 the water samples were collected from khiron lalganj and amawa blocks of raebareli district the district is a fairly compact tract of gently undulating land and drained by river ganga sai and their tributaries the elevation varies from 86 9 m to 120 4 m above sea level the climate is sub humid with average annual rainfall of 1150 mm the sediments of indo gangetic basin have generally been classified as older and newer alluvium and the raebareli district is underlain by alluvial sediments of quaternary age the upper layer of alluvium is composed of sandy loam silty clays and clays in varying proportions and minor sand beds are also seen the thickness of this zone ranges from 5 to 16 m on an average with kankar is interspersed in clay khanna 1992 cgwb 2012 2 2 sample collection and analysis groundwater samples were collected during the pre monsoon february may monsoon june september and post monsoon october january seasons in 2016 17 from hand pumps dugwells and tubewells the samples were collected in pre washed polyethylene bottles 1 l capacity after 3 min pumping of the hand pump and bore well rinsing the bottles twice only the analytical study grade chemicals merck and sigma aldrich germany were used and glassware was washed with dilute nitric acid 1 15 n followed by distilled water all the samples were preserved and stored at 4 c until the analysis was going on ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were taken at the field immediately after the sample collection furthermore the major cations ammonium nh4 lithium li sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 and major anions chloride cl nitrate no3 nitrite no2 sulfate so4 2 fluoride f phosphate po4 2 and bromide br were analysed using ion chromatography metrohm 850 as outlined in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 bicarbonate and total hardness were analysed using the titrimetric method apha 2012 2 3 data quality assurance the validity and quality of water quality data was assessed by calculating a the charge balance error cbe for each sample and b the ec tds ratio the cbe was calculated using eq 1 1 c b e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 where cations and anions were expressed in mg l in general a cbe in the range of 5 is assumed perfect in case of water quality analysis however cbe less than 10 is also acceptable for such studies apha 2012 chen et al 2017 the cbe was in the range of 5 except for three samples where cbe was 6 53 5 38 and 5 68 which was acceptable for this study whereas the ec tds ratio was in the range of 0 55 0 7 indicating that the analytical data has good precision apha 2012 2 4 statistical analysis the hydrochemical evaluations of contaminated groundwater systems are usually based on the availability collection of data on groundwater chemistry however contaminant and water chemistry can be statistically interpreted using the tools such as bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis correlation analysis etc singh et al 2005 devic et al 2014 in india the use of these tools to understand the groundwater chemistry and process controlling the contaminant chemistry is well documented lakshmanan et al 2003 rajesh et al 2012 chidambaram et al 2013 however studies investigating the status of groundwater quality in uttar pradesh are very limited sahu et al 2018 in this study pearson s correlation matrix was generated for the analysed physico chemical parameters using origin pro 2019b software pearson s correlation coefficient analysis is widely and extensively used to evaluate and assess the linear dependence between two or more variables the analysis also helps in identifying the adequacy of one variable to predict the behaviour of other batabyal and chakraborty 2015 a positive correlation between the pair of parameters exists when an increase in one parameter causes an increase in the other parameter as well and vice versa for negative correlation the value of pearson s correlation coefficient r lies in the range of 1 there is no correlation between the parameters if the value of r is zero a strong correlation is said to exist for values ranging between 0 9 and 1 similarly a good correlation is there for values between 0 51 and 0 89 and low degree of correlation exists when values of r lies in the range of 0 and 0 50 batabyal and chakraborty 2015 2 5 non carcinogenic human health risk assessment the groundwater quality affects the human health in many ways studies investigating the effect of groundwater quality on the human health proves to be beneficial to assess the possible health impacts in local population consuming the affected water in this study the non carcinogenic human health risks evaluation associated with nitrate and fluoride was done by employing the methods proposed by united state environmental protection agency usepa 1989 li et al 2019 for adult men and children the average daily oral intake dosage is computed by eq 2 2 c d i c c i r e f e d b w a t where cdi is chronic daily intake of water mg kg day c c is the concentration for a particular contaminant in water mg l ir denotes the ingestion rate which is taken as 2 5 l day for adult man and 0 78 l day for children karunanidhi et al 2019 ef is the exposure frequency and taken as 365 days per year ed is the exposure duration taken as 64 years for adult men and 12 years for children b w average body weight is taken as 65 kg for adult men and 15 kg for children and at signifies the average time duration in days for the non carcinogenic effects 23360 and 4380 respectively for adult men and children as per norms usepa 2014 f and no3 are declared as non carcinogenic and the non carcinogenic effect of these contaminants can be computed as hazard quotient hq computed by eq 3 3 h q c d i r f d where rfd is the reference dose 1 6 mg kg day for nitrate 0 04 mg kg day for fluoride li et al 2016a the values of hq 1 suggests that non carcinogenic human health risks exceed the acceptable limit for the particular contaminant in groundwater finally the total hazard index thi is computed using eq 4 4 t h i h q n i t r a t e h q f l u o r i d e 2 6 irrigation suitability of groundwater irrigation suitability of groundwater was examined based upon the following parameters and ratios ec sodium adsorption ratio sar in association with ec values sodium percentage na salinity hazard residual sodium bicarbonates rsbc exchangeable sodium ratio or kelley s index ki permeability index pi and magnesium hazard mh united state salinity laboratory ussl diagram doneen s plot and wilcox plot were also used to determine the various irrigation classes of groundwater these plots were prepared using aqua chem software 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater compliance with respect to drinking water standards the statistical summary of various physico chemical parameters analysed for the water samples are listed in table 1 the percent compliance of these parameters with respect to the drinking water standards bis 2012 who 2011 is summarised in table 2 the presented data confirms the drinking suitability of groundwater samples across the study area out of the selected parameters nitrite bromide lithium ammonium and phosphate were not detected in any of the sampling locations in any season hence these parameters were excluded from further calculations the ph values ranged from 7 21 to 8 69 pre monsoon and 7 16 to 8 63 post monsoon suggesting slightly alkaline nature of groundwater in the study area there is very little variation in the ph values showing a 78 6 compliance with the drinking standards across the seasons whereas there was high variation in the values of electrical conductivity with maximum value recorded in the sample collected from dug well the values being 4200 μs cm pre monsoon 4100 μs cm monsoon and 4150 μs cm during post monsoon season which is in direct coherence with the presence of ionic concentrations in the groundwater and its higher values indicates higher salinity and total dissolved solids concentration the areas with higher ec values also indicate towards high mineralization the values of tds ranged between 260 mg l during monsoon season to 3010 mg l during post monsoon season however the tds is within permissible limit bis 2012 only in 21 4 pre monsoon and post monsoon of the collected samples similarly total hardness is within the permissible limits in only 28 6 pre monsoon and 35 7 post monsoon respectively with mean values for groundwater samples being in the class of very hard water type sawyer and mccarty 1967 this pattern suggests towards the presence of thick layered topsoil and limestone formations in the study area consumption of water with hardness levels in the range of 150 300 mg l and above may aid kidney stone formation also it causes an unpleasant taste in the water sengupta 2013 mostafa et al 2017 moreover a plot between tds and th was also prepared gao et al 2019 to assess the water classification based on these parameters fig 2 it can be seen that almost 43 of the samples were in hard fresh water and hard brackish water category across the seasons 3 2 major ion chemistry the abundance of cations and anions can be verified as k ca2 mg2 na and f no3 so4 2 cl hco3 respectively during pre monsoon however the cationic abundance in post monsoon was found to be k mg2 ca2 na and anionic abundance remains the same in post monsoon season among all the cations mg2 had the lowest compliance i e 42 9 in pre monsoon and 50 in post monsoon seasons the elevated levels of magnesium ion in drinking water are associated with hypertension and cardiovascular problems which may also prove to be fatal saris et al 2000 sengupta 2013 the compliance of ca2 ion was very high 85 7 across the seasons with mean values of 47 9 mg l and 42 1 mg l during pre monsoon and post monsoon respectively the increased calcium intake is found to interact and subsequently reduce the adsorption of other minerals iron zinc and phosphorus in the intestine rishi et al 2019 wasilewski et al 2019 na is also a very important cation related with human health because of its dietary requirements and high intake of na may result in congenital diseases kidney issues and neurological problems who 2011 rao et al 2012 high sodium concentration in groundwater is often associated with dissolution of minerals such as halite silicate etc and cation exchange capacity of soil rajesh et al 2012 li et al 2016b hco3 was found to be the prevailing ion with a maximum value of 636 mg l during post monsoon season and mean values of 387 4 mg l pre monsoon and 393 4 mg l post monsoon the minimum chloride concentration was recorded as low as 3 46 mg l during monsoon season to as high as 571 mg l with a mean value of 135 3 mg l annual average only 15 of the samples were found to be having chloride content of more than 250 mg l chloride is a major inorganic anion present in the water and high chloride content in drinking water may impart some salty taste in it presence of elevated levels of cl is an indicator of erosion and weathering of crystalline rocks mismanagement of industrial discharge etc rajesh et al 2012 selvakumar et al 2017a presence of sulfate ions in water may cause temporary taste impairment and have a laxative effect the so4 2 had the highest compliance with the drinking standards 92 86 across the seasons with mean values of 88 6 mg l and 82 5 mg l during pre monsoon and post monsoon season respectively among the anions f ion showed the lowest compliance of 42 9 across the season as per indian standards this suggests that the study area is adversely affected by fluoride contamination in groundwater excess fluoride 1 5 mg l may cause dental fluorosis and higher fluoride concentrations may even cause skeletal fluorosis and non skeletal fluorosis amalraj and pius 2013 raj and shaji 2017 the concentration of nitrate varied from below detectable limits to 164 2 mg l with a mean value of 35 7 and 31 2 mg l during pre monsoon and post monsoon respectively the highest value of nitrate were reported in the sample collected from dugwell indicating anthropogenic intervention bhattacharya et al 2006 since the area is mostly agriculture dominated excessive fertilizer usage might be the reason behind elevated level of nitrate in groundwater nitrate beyond permissible limits may cause blue baby syndrome thyroid problems etc shukla and saxena 2018 sulfate and nitrate levels in an aquifer are also affected by the microbial degradation of organic matter ahmed et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 2004 a stiff plot stiff 1951 was prepared for the study area fig 3 using grapher software for both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the stiff plot is used to assess the pattern of cations and anions present in the groundwater the distinctive feature of this plot is that it retains the pattern even after the dilution of the sample stiff 1951 the pattern for pre monsoon season is mostly overlapped by the pattern for post monsoon season it can be observed that the dominant type is hco3 na category for both seasons suggesting the groundwater is affected by cation exchange and or silicate interaction process venturelli et al 2003 lima et al 2019 moreover ca2 mg2 cl water was more dominant in post monsoon season this water type suggests mixing of high salinity water effects of domestic wastewater and septic tank effluents jeyaraj et al 2016 selvakumar et al 2017a as the reason behind the high concentration of these ions in the study area moreover the dominance of na and cl water type also indicates the presence of chemical fertilizer and sewage influences egbi et al 2020 which is coherent with high nitrate concentration in the dugwell the overall concentration array of major ions can be summarised as hco3 na cl so4 2 mg2 ca2 no3 k f during pre monsoon and hco3 na cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 no3 k f during post monsoon season 3 3 interrelationships between water quality parameters the correlation analysis shows a comparable trend during monsoon and post monsoon periods tables 3 and 4 the values suggesting a strong correlation r 0 9 are highlighted in the tables ph shows negative correlation with all parameters except for f so4 2 and na during all the seasons ec shows a strong correlation with tds th cl hco3 so4 2 na and mg2 during all the seasons whereas tds has strong correlation with th na cl hco3 mg2 and so4 2 th shows a strong correlation with so4 2 and mg2 although only mg2 is a primary hardness causing cation among those ions cl shows good 0 9 r 0 5 to strong correlation with all the parameters except for ca2 good correlation can be seen between mg2 with na and k suggesting that these parameters might have originated from same source electrical conductivity shows a strong correlation with tds and th in all the seasons which indicates the fact that conductivity increases with concentration of dissolved ions in water moreover ec also shows strong to good correlation with na k mg2 so4 2 f and no3 indicating the involvement of most of the ions in the geochemical reactions such as oxidation reduction ion exchange in the aquifer system additionally it can also be deducted that these ions are mainly originated by heavy fertilizer application and domestic discharges selvakumar et al 2017a 2017b şener et al 2017 3 4 irrigation suitability electrical conductivity is one of the most important parameters along with tds which regulates the irrigation suitability of groundwater high concentration of dissolved salts such as sodium calcium magnesium etc in the irrigation water affect the osmotic pressure in the root zone which in turn affects the water intake capacity by the roots the soil quality and crop yield bob et al 2016 hence evaluation of water in terms of its irrigation suitability prior to its use will help in increasing the plant productivity and crop yield several methods such as wilcox 1955 ussl plot wilcox 1955 kelley 1940 magnesium hazard paliwal 1972 etc have been extensively used to classify the irrigation water to evaluate the irrigation suitability the average value of the parameters of concern for pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon were taken into consideration and the important indices to assess the irrigation suitability in the study area are as follows all the ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l 3 4 1 sodium percent the reaction of na with soil is an important process to assess the irrigation suitability of groundwater the sodium percent na can be used using the following formula eq 5 5 n a n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 high na concentration in irrigation water is absorbed by clay particles displacing the ca2 and mg2 ions which reduces the permeability of soil and subsequently resulting in poor internal drainage selvakumar et al 2017b wilcox plot fig 4 suggests that 28 6 of the samples falling into the category of very good to good which can be readily used for irrigation whereas 42 9 of the samples were in the category permissible to doubtful soils in these locations might be having poor internal drainage only one sample was in the class of unsuitable for irrigation purposes 3 4 2 sodium absorption ratio sar the excessive sodium content relative to calcium and magnesium inhibits the water supply needed for crop growth bouwer 1978 this excess sodium or limited calcium and magnesium content can be used to classify the irrigation waters using the following formula eq 6 6 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 a sar value of less than 6 is categorised as groundwater having no problem for irrigation purpose in this study 71 4 of the samples were found in this category whereas none of the samples were found to be in the category of severe problem for irrigation sar 9 however 28 6 of the studied sample were in the category of increasing problem for irrigation purposes 6 sar 9 for a detailed analysis and understanding sar as sodium hazard can be plotted against ec fig 5 on the ussl diagram ussl 1954 wilcox 1955 as per ussl diagram water samples can be classified into sixteen categories with samples in c1s1 class being the most suitable for irrigation purposes and samples in class c4s4 being the worst in this present study none of the samples were falling in c1s1 category 28 6 of the samples were found in c2s1 category which indicates medium salinity low alkalinity content 64 3 of the samples in c3s1 category indicating the high salinity low alkalinity and only one sample falling under c4s1 category which signifies very high salinity low alkalinity content in the groundwater samples the results suggest that water samples are having low alkalinity conditions but varying level of salinity which are suitable for crops with high salt tolerance these results are also in coherence with results of salinity hazard 3 4 3 residual sodium bicarbonates when the concentration of bicarbonate ion is more than the concentration of calcium ion there is some residual sodium bicarbonate in the water generally sodium aggregation takes place in soil when the high water with high rsbc content is used for irrigation purpose which results in destruction of soil structure in soils with clay content increased salinity and reduced crop productivity naseem et al 2010 the rsbc can be calculated using the following formula eq 7 7 r s b c h c o 3 c a 2 in the study area 78 6 of the samples were in category of low and medium alkalinity table 5 whereas one sample from dugwell was in the class of very high alkalinity the positive values of rsbc suggests that the soluble content of calcium and magnesium ions are less than the carbonate and bicarbonate ions 3 4 4 permeability index sodium bicarbonate calcium and magnesium content in the soil affect the permeability of the soil doneen 1964 evolved a formula eq 8 for calculating the value of permeability index pi which is a significant parameter to assess the groundwater suitability for irrigation 8 p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 doneen 1964 suggested a three class categorization for assessing the suitability where permeability index values are plotted against the total ionic concentrations in the water fig 6 in the present study 78 6 of the samples were in the class i pi 75 and 14 3 in class ii pi 25 75 which of the maximum permeability water samples in class i and ii are the water types with 75 or more of maximum permeability and are suitable for irrigation purposes only one sample was in class iii which is unsuitable for irrigation purpose 3 4 5 kelley s index kelley 1940 provided guidelines for the water to be used for irrigation purposes he also investigated the effects of using saline water for irrigation and developed an index kelley 1963 to assess the irrigation suitability of saline water the kelley s index ki can be calculated using the following formula eq 9 9 k i n a c a 2 m g 2 water with ki 1 are classified as unsuitable for irrigation and the 57 1 of the studied samples falls in this category moreover 42 9 of the samples were found suitable for irrigation ki 1 3 4 6 magnesium ratio and magnesium hazard water can be placed in three classes safe moderate and unsafe for irrigation purpose based on the ratio of mg2 to ca2 ravikumar et al 2011 high levels of mg2 is because of exchangeable na ions in water particularly in case of highly saline water with dominance of na and it causes destruction of soil structure tahmasebi et al 2018 in the present study 71 4 of the studied samples were in the category safe for irrigation purpose mr 1 5 whereas 7 1 of the samples were in moderate category 1 5 mr 3 and 21 4 of the samples were unsafe mr 3 to be used for irrigation purposes moreover paliwal 1972 introduced an important ratio of magnesium ion to calcium and magnesium ion known as magnesium hazard mh which can be calculated using the following formula eq 10 10 m h m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 an mh value of more than 50 would make the soil alkaline affect the crop productivity and hence considered unsuitable for irrigation purpose in the present study only 21 4 of the samples were considered suitable for irrigation purposes mh 50 whereas 78 6 of the samples were found to be unsuitable 3 5 health risk the non carcinogenic health risks associated with the consumption of fluoride and nitrate contaminated water are very well documented and present a worrisome picture globally the effects are even more pronounced in india where majority of the rural population depends upon groundwater for drinking and other domestic purposes adimalla 2019 karunanidhi et al 2019 rishi et al 2019 since the study area mostly comprises rural agglomerations and results suggests that there is elevated concentration of fluoride and nitrate in the study area it becomes important to assess the non carcinogenic human health risks associated with fluoride and nitrate in groundwater in the study area the hq for fluoride and nitrate were calculated for adult men and children and the results are summarised in table 6 the hqnitrate for children varied from 0 002 to 5 07 with a mean value of 0 4 and the respective values for adult men were 0 001 3 74 and mean value of 0 3 similarly hqfluoride for children and adult men varied from 0 33 to 10 77 and 0 25 to 7 96 respectively the mean values were recorded as 2 3 and 1 7 for children and adult men respectively moreover the non carcinogenic risk is said to be present when hq and thi is more than unity and the results are summarised in table 7 it can be seen that more than 11 of groundwater samples for hqnitrate were above the acceptable limit whereas 80 of the groundwater samples for hqfluoride were above the acceptable limit in case of exposure to children the corresponding values in case of adult men for hqnitrate and hqfluoride were 5 7 and 71 4 respectively suggesting that children were more vulnerable towards the non carcinogenic health risks associated with fluoride and nitrate the total hazard index thi was also calculated which depicts the combined non carcinogenic health risks associated with fluoride and nitrate the thi values for adult men and children at all sampling sites are depicted in fig 7 the mean values of thi were found to be 2 0 and 2 7 for adult men and children respectively moreover thi of more than 77 samples for adult men and 82 of the samples for children were found to be more than 1 signifying that majority of groundwater samples are susceptible to impart potential health risks both in adult male and children hence children in the study area are found to be more vulnerable compared to adult men in the study area this might be because of their lower body weight moreover fluoride concentration has more impact in shaping the thi values as can be seen at site rb20 and rb21 however the highest non carcinogenic risk corresponds to locations with highest fluoride and nitrate content in groundwater rb31 the awareness among the rural residents regarding the human health risks is very low there is almost negligible public information related to drinking water safety in these rural areas moreover there is no metering for withdrawal of groundwater which makes the quantitative decline an aggravated issue in these areas as well the current health risks shall be addressed with immediate importance and necessary actions shall be taken by the groundwater policy makers and key stakeholders in the study area 4 conclusion groundwater serves as the primary source for drinking and irrigation purpose in the study area since the region is predominantly rural a groundwater quality evaluation was performed to assess its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes the physico chemical parameters were compared with drinking water standards to assess the compliance for drinking purposes whereas several indices were used for the assessment of irrigation suitability of the groundwater samples moreover non carcinogenic human health risks associated with consumption of nitrate and fluoride contaminated water was also assessed in this study following conclusions can be drawn in the study area after this study groundwater in the study region was found to be slightly alkaline in nature majority of the groundwater samples with respect to cl so4 2 hco3 and ca2 were in the compliance with drinking water standards by bis 2012 and who 2011 the ionic abundance can be verified as hco3 na cl so4 2 mg2 ca2 no3 k f during the pre monsoon season and hco3 na cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 no3 k f during the post monsoon sampling fluoride showed the lowest compliance 42 9 among the cations suggesting that the study area is adversely affected by elevated fluoride levels in groundwater moreover nitrate concentration in the study area varied from below detection limit to 164 3 mg l intensive fertilizer application and irrigation activities could be the source of elevated nitrate levels in the studied samples whereas the high fluoride concentration can be attributed to rock water interactions in the aquifer and dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals in the study area groundwater in the study area is mostly hco3 na type which suggests that the groundwater is affected by cation exchange and silicate interaction could also be going on in the study area correlation analysis suggested that mg2 na and k might have originated from same source a good to strong correlation of ec with na k mg2 so4 2 f and no3 suggests that these ions are primarily originated by heavy fertilizer application and domestic discharges and other anthropogenic interventions the results from assessment of irrigation suitability suggest that groundwater in the study area is in medium to high salinity hazard but alkalinity hazard is low moreover as per the evaluation through wilcox diagram almost 43 of the samples were in permissible to doubtful category magnesium hazard and kelley s ratio suggests that majority of the water samples were unsuitable for irrigation purpose the results for non carcinogenic human health risks suggested that children are more vulnerable against the non carcinogenic risks associated with consumption of nitrate and fluoride contaminated water results also suggested that hazard quotient of fluoride had more impact on thi values than hqnitrate in the study area approximately 83 of the children and 77 of the adult mean were found to be at non carcinogenic health risks the study could play a key role for various stakeholders and policy makers in shaping the future policies regarding access to safe drinking water moreover it will also create awareness among the residents and medical professionals in these rural areas about the health hazards of consuming contaminated water funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors
