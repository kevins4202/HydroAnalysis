5140,understanding water storage changes in lake poyang the largest freshwater lake in china is essential for local hydro ecological assessments and water resource management the integration of multi mission satellite data hydrological models and in situ measurements allows for a comprehensive estimate of lake poyang s storage variations we here estimated lake poyang water storage changes during the recent decade by using inundation areas mapped from optical satellite imagery and water levels measured by satellite radar altimetry and gauging stations the amplitudes of seasonal variation from altimetry data are smaller than those from station measurements this is likely attributed to their low temporal resolutions and limited footprint coverage together with a complex surface gradient over lake poyang the residual fields between land water storage changes assessed by the grace satellites and simulated by two hydrological models gldas noah and wghm were applied to estimate poyang water storage changes leakage errors in the grace model residuals are further corrected by a constrained forward modeling method resulting in recovered water storage trends 66 times of the uncorrected signals water level changes estimated by different methods are then compared results show that level changes inverted from recovered storage variations by grace gldas and grace wghm are significantly larger than those from satellite altimetry and in situ measurements this indicates that the combination of grace observation and global hydrological modeling is likely insufficient to estimate accurate water storage changes in lake poyang our methods and results provide a valuable example of using integrated methods for monitoring water storage changes in highly dynamic fluvial lake systems

dried areas liu et al 2013 ma et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 surrounding lake poyang about 10 million people and 10 thousand km2 of farmland in the peripheral floodplain are protected by about 6400 km of levees shankman et al 2006 shankman and liang 2003 in response to local precipitation changes the inundation area in lake poyang varies significantly in short and long term time scales feng et al 2012c 2013a han et al 2015 wang et al 2014 in addition water regulation from the three gorges dam tgd affects the water flow and level at the yangze poyang confluence which further complicates accurate estimation of water storage changes in lake poyang guo et al 2008 wang et al 2011 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015b frequent extreme floods e g in 2010 and 2012 li et al 2015 and droughts e g in 2011 and 2016 wang et al 2014 and http www globaltimes cn content 1010691 shtml have seriously affected the everyday life of local residents and the ecological system and caused enormous social and economic losses thus accurate assessment of seasonal and inter annual water storage changes in lake poyang is critical to not only understanding its responses to climate variability but also managing local water resources and making prompt decisions for flood control water safety and ecological conservation as important indicators to climate change and human activities inundation area and level of lake poyang have been investigated using satellite images and altimetry numerous studies have shown that modis images are useful in monitoring inundation areas of large inland lakes ma et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 for instance feng et al 2012a and wu and liu 2015a applied moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis imagery to estimate the inundation changes in lake poyang during 2000 2011 chen et al 2014 identified the abrupt area change in lake poyang using modis imagery during 2000 2012 zhang et al 2013 monitored both water level and area changes in lake poyang during 2003 2009 using icesat and landsat observations wu and liu 2015b reported lake poyang s level changes using modis images and in situ topographic data during 2000 2012 these studies indicated that lake poyang has experienced expansions and shrinkages during both short and long term time scales in the recent decades the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites obtain spatial variations of earth s gravity field and provide a new remote sensing device for monitoring mass redistribution in the earth system tapley et al 2004 since 2002 grace has been widely used in other research studies related to terrestrial water storage tws changes cazenave and chen 2010 chen et al 2017 famiglietti and rodell 2013 forootan et al 2014 long et al 2013 2014 2015a b 2017 rodell et al 2009 2018 reager and famiglietti 2009 grace observed tws variation provides a potential means to better understand water dynamics of lake poyang several recent studies have tried to document water storage variations of lake poyang cai et al 2015 and zhang et al 2015a used trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission and grace data to estimate water exchange in lake poyang zhou et al 2016 combined grace observations gldas global land data assimilation system model simulations and satellite altimetry data to assess water storage changes in lake poyang during 2003 2014 however their grace tws estimations did not consider leakage error correction zhou et al 2018 used multiple satellite remote sensing observations gldas and pcr globwb pcraster global water balance models and in situ data from 24 metrological stations in the poyang lake basin to identifying the food events over the poyang lake basin about 162200 km2 during 2003 2016 our research focused on the lake poyang about 3500 km2 which is more challenging as lakes that experience rapid and significant short term fluctuations the coarse temporal monthly sampling from grace may not be adequate to capture these signals in this study we give a comprehensive analysis of water storage changes in lake poyang by integrating i remote sensing observations from optical altimetry and grace satellites ii hydrological models and iii in situ measurements specifically we explore two methods for estimating the time series of lake poyang water storage during the past decade the first method combines lake poyang s inundation extents mapped from daily modis imagery and water levels measured by satellite altimetry and gauging stations in the second method we correct leakage effect in grace observations using constrained forward modeling approach and then derive lake poyang s water storage changes as residuals between leakage corrected grace observations and simulations from two hydrological models gldas noah and wghm watergap global hydrology model then we evaluate the feasibility of water storage monitoring with grace and hydrological models for lake poyang 2 study area lake poyang is located in the north of jiangxi province china fig 1 as its water level is higher in the south lake poyang usually flows northward and discharges to the yangtze river from hukou cai and ji 2009 wu and liu 2014 the main water supply of the lake includes local precipitation inflows from five main tributaries i e ganjiang xiushui fuhe xinjiang and raohe and partially flows from the yangtze river in summer feng et al 2012a the inundation extent of lake poyang fluctuates dramatically between the wet and dry seasons during the summer the water level reaches the highest around july and slightly drops during august and september in october the water level recedes steadily followed by the dry season between november and march lake poyang is an important water storage zone for the yangtze river with an annual average water intake of about 15 6 of the yangtze river s runoff ye et al 2011 2013 water quantity and quality of lake poyang are directly related to water security in the catchment and the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river however the size of lake poyang has shown a decreasing trend in the recent years feng et al 2013b wang et al 2014 2017 3 data sets 3 1 optical satellite images in this study the 250 m resolution surface reflectance imagery mod 09 from modis terra accessed from https modis gsfc nasa gov were used to extract daily inundation areas of lake poyang from february 2000 to december 2011 a total of 494 high quality image granules were selected during our study period 2000 2011 so that there is one cloud free observation in each month and most months have two and more observations an advanced thematic mapping scheme was employed to optimize automated delineation of water surfaces in each selected image open water inundation extents were next extracted from these images using an automated dynamic thresholding algorithm the segmented lake spatial extents were next meticulously examined our mapped poyang inundation areas using modis imagery were validated by 30 m landsat tm and etm images detailed validation can be seen in wang et al 2014 in brief lake areas obtained from modis agree with landsat mapping with an r2 value for linear cross validation reaching 0 96 our mapped area time series also follows a similar inundation pattern with the result in feng et al 2012a although the latter is relatively small in magnitude for example in both results the maximum inundation area was found in the year of 2000 while the minimum was in 2011 it is worth noting that our mapped inundation extents went through a rigorous quality assurance and quality control and are considered to have reached the optimal accuracy using 250 m modis imagery 3 2 satellite altimetry levels satellite altimetry can monitor lake water levels huang et al 2018a huang et al 2018b song et al 2013 yi et al 2016 2017 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 yao et al 2018 li et al 2019 in this study altimetry data for lake poyang were gathered from the legos hydroweb database cr√©taux et al 2011 http hydroweb theia land fr hydroweb archives water level for over 200 major lakes and larger reservoirs in the world based on altimetry data from jason 1 jason 2 jason 3 topex poseidon gfo saral altika ers 1 2 envisat sentinel 3a sentinel 3b icesat 1 and cryosat 2 data a full description of the altimetry data processing for lakes was provided in cretaux et al 2016 the legos water level data have been performed waveform retracking and the systematical error between different altimetry missions has also been removed the time series for lake poyang includes 183 water levels averaged across the lake surface roughly on monthly basis from june 21 1995 to june 22 2016 here we used the temporal subset during 2000 2015 the available level series are not always evenly distributed in time so there could be multiple or no observations in certain months 3 3 in situ level measurements in situ water level measurements vary among different gauging stations across lake poyang yao et al 2016 similar to many large fluvial lake systems lake poyang exhibits a natural surface gradient due to different influences of the tributary inflows and the confluence condition in the yangtze river wang et al 2017 the water level gradient is particularly strong in the dry season additionally the lake water level is further complicated by the combined effect of spatial variations in bathymetry and surface wind due to lack of observation networks spatially continuous water levels across the entire lake surface are difficult to obtain alternatively water levels measured at several discrete gauging stations are often applied to reflect the average lake water level cai et al 2015 wu and liu 2015b ye et al 2014 in this study we collected daily level measurements at the five gauging stations hukou xingzi tangyin duchang and kunshan see the marked locations in fig 1 distributed along the south to north lake surface gradient from january 1 2000 to december 31 2015 in wusong datum 3 4 grace satellite gravimetry data the grace rl05 time variable gravity solutions from csr center for space research at university of texas austin were used in this study bettadpur and grace 2012 these solutions represent gravity changes of each month from april 2002 to december 2015 and consist of sh spherical harmonic coefficients which are up to degree 60 the c20 terms were replaced by the slr estimates for higher accuracy cheng et al 2013 the degree 1 terms were not contained in the calculations since their contribution is minor to regional mass estimates for relatively small spatial scales such as the lake poyang as an alternative the grace mascon mass concentration solutions were provided by jpl jet propulsion laboratory of nasa watkins et al 2015 the 3 3 equal area mascons offer improved spatial resolution with less signal leakage however the mascon size 100 000 km2 is still too coarse for our studied lake poyang region under 4000 km2 and as a result substantial leakage correction may be required 3 5 hydrological models 3 5 1 gldas simulations the gldas tws estimates used here are from the noah land surface models 10 lsm10 at 1 spatial resolution ek et al 2003 rodell et al 2004 the noah lsm simulations from 2002 to 2015 were gathered from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center tws changes were integrated from total soil moisture tsm up to the depth of 2 m snow water equivalent swe and canopy water storage cws but groundwater changes are excluded due to absent of groundwater component in the gldas lsms 3 5 2 wghm simulations the wghm outputs include four major storage components surface water water stored in surface reservoirs and rivers snow water soil moisture and groundwater doll et al 2003 doll and fiedler 2008 m√ºller schmied et al 2014 water storage changes are analyzed for period from 1961 to the present with 0 5 spatial resolution for most climate zones and the 30 huge river basins worldwide guntner et al 2007 wghm calculates the land water cycle by theoretic formulations for most hydrological processes including surface and groundwater storages and anthropogenic processes e g human water use of groundwater that were not modeled by gldas in this study we used simulation outputs from the wghm 2 1 covering the period from january 2002 to december 2012 4 methods 4 1 deriving water storage changes from inundation extents and levels as described in section 1 we applied two methods for estimating water storage variations in lake poyang the first method combines the time series of 1 inundation extents mapped from modis imagery refer back to section 3 1 and 2 water levels measured by satellite altimeters section 3 2 and the five gauging stations section 3 3 volume variations were determined with the assumption that between two successive measurements at t1 and t2 the lake bathymetry follows a regular pyramidal shape abileah et al 2011 as formulated in eq 1 1 Œ¥ v h 2 h 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 3 10 3 where Œ¥v denotes water volume variation between t1 and t2 s1 and s2 inundation extents at t1 and t2 and h1 and h2 their associated water levels as further illustrated in fig 2 we first interpolated acquired altimetry water levels and modis derived inundation areas into daily time series by linear interpolation in order to match the temporal frequency of gauging level observations daily time series were then averaged to calculate the monthly mean water levels and inundation areas we then derived the monthly water storage change according to eq 1 using altimetry levels and gauging levels respectively as the in situ water levels measurements have daily data and can be obtained from five different gauging stations the spatial and temporal resolution of in situ water levels measurements is higher than satellite altimetry data grace data and hydrology models simulations the in situ water levels measurements were taken as the reference for inferring the baseline water storage changes 4 2 estimating water storage changes from model simulations and grace observations water storage changes in lake poyang were next obtained using tws variations observed by grace satellites and simulated by gldas and wghm models fig 3 in the lake poyang catchment grace observed mass variations represent the integrated tws changes in surface water soil moisture and groundwater however the applied grace sh solution is subject to large leakage errors associated with the limited sh range degree order of 60 and further gaussian spatial smoothing chen et al 2015 leakage effect can result in significant attenuation of mass change signals when mass changes in the surrounding regions are relatively small forward modeling has been proved as a useful method for correcting or reducing leakage bias especially when the source locations of the mass change are known e g chen et al 2007 wouters et al 2008 ivins et al 2011 long et al 2016 during the forward modeling numerical iterations are applied to seek the true mass change redistribution that best fits the mass change observed from grace given that the identical data processing procedure is applied to the modeled data as that used to the grace data the forward modeling with and without constraint can be found in chen et al 2015 the constrained forward modeling was employed for lake poyang to correct leakage biases in grace observed monthly tws changes to isolate water storage changes in lake poyang we then subtracted monthly changes in soil moisture and groundwater simulated by the applied hydrological models from the leakage corrected grace observations as described in section 3 5 monthly soil moisture changes were simulated by both gldas noah and wghm whereas groundwater changes were only simulated in wghm due to lack of groundwater compartments in gldas however since groundwater flux only provides a tiny fraction 1 2 of the total water variation around the lake poyang region wan and xu 2010 lian et al 2011 we here consider the influence of missing groundwater changes in noah to be small see section 5 2 1 the primary contributions from water changes in lake poyang therefore were estimated as the residual fields between the grace tws changes and available non surface water changes from gldas noah thereafter grace gldas or wghm thereafter grace wghm the detailed processing procedure is outlined in fig 3 a 300 km gaussian smoothing was used to the monthly grace solutions and no decorrelation filter was applied in this study the 1 1 water storage changes simulated by gldas and wghm models were then converted into sh coefficients with the truncation to degree and order 60 and then were smoothed by the same 300 km gaussian filter the months in which grace data were absent were excluded from this conversion the obtained time series were then represented by anomalies with respect to the mean values during april 2002 to december 2015 as the residual fields grace gldas or grace wghm are assumed to be mainly contributed by poyang water changes the constrained forward modeling leakage corrections were applied to the residual fields by constraining the mass changes within the lake poyang areas as denoted by the lake mask then the recovered monthly mass change series were obtained the total water storage change in lake poyang were then calculated by summing the gridded area weighted mass changes within then calculated by summing the gridded area weighted mass changes within the lake poyang areas denoted by the lake mask in the calculations for each month during april 2002 to december 2011 an average inundation area for the lake poyang was derived from the modis images over that month to represent the monthly lake mask 5 results 5 1 poyang storage changes from satellite imagery altimetry and in situ measurements 5 1 1 inundation areas fig 4 shows the modis derived time series of inundation area of lake poyang during the period of 2000 2011 inundation areas in lake poyang exhibit strong intra annual variability from september to march the inundation area reaches a minimum of 1000 km2 or below as a result the lake surface is disaggregated to several sections and a fluvial channel connecting the five tributaries to the yangtze main stem is well exposed along the central axis of the lake from june to august the lake inundation area expands to a maximum of over 3000 km2 and reconnects individual lake sections to a continuous water surface the average intra annual maximum minimum ratio is about 3 evident inter annual variations are also observed during our study period 2000 to 2011 the maximum inundation area occurred in 2010 which concurs with the flooding event in june 2010 feng et al 2016 wang et al 2014 2017 by contrast minimum areas are observed in 2003 and 2011 which are consistent with recorded meteorological droughts in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin feng et al 2012b wang et al 2014 2017 5 1 1 1 water levels fig 5 reveals water level time series for lake poyang acquired from the five gauging stations from 2000 to 2015 the lake level displays evident annual cycles similar to those in inundation area fig 4 more drastic level changes were found at the northern stations e g hukou and xingzi for example the annual amplitudes of water level changes at hukou and xingzi stations are about 10 82 m and 10 49 m respectively table 1 the level changes at southern stations also show a clear annual cycle the annual amplitudes of the water level changes at tangyin and kangshan stations are about 7 32 m and 5 81 m respectively which are obviously lower than those at the northern stations the time series from satellite altimetry observations as shown in fig 5f also reveals dramatic water level changes in lake poyang which agree with the in situ measurements from the five stations during the same period however the lake level series from satellite altimetry has smaller annual amplitude 4 09 m this is likely related to the low temporal resolution of altimetry measurements and their sparse footprints e g with major inter track gaps across lake poyang in addition there are temporal gaps of up to a few months in the altimetry level time series all these factors likely led to under represented observations of the lake level variation during the study period 5 1 1 2 water storage changes fig 6 presents water storage changes in lake poyang during the 2002 2011 derived synergistically from modis imagery and water level measurements similar to inundation areas fig 4 and water levels fig 5 water storage changes in lake poyang exhibit evident seasonal and also inter annual variations water storage changes derived from in situ level measurements generally agree with those from satellite altimetry levels in both annual amplitudes and inter annual variations however the annual amplitudes of the storage changes from altimetry are smaller than those of gauging derived result similar as the case as shown by the water level comparisons fig 5 with coefficient of determination root mean square error rmse and mean absolute bias mab of 0 52 2 47 km3 and 1 77 km3 respectively 5 2 the water storage monitoring with grace and hydrological model in lake poyang 5 2 1 recovered water storage changes of lake poyang from hydrological models and grace fig 7 a shows the tws time series from grace observations and gldas and wghm simulations in lake poyang from april 2002 to april 2015 these results were smoothed by the 300 km gaussian filter but leakage errors were not corrected yet by constrained forward modeling the residual between grace and gldas during 2002 2015 grace gldas and between grace and wghm during 2002 2012 grace wghm are presented in fig 7b the water storage trends in grace gldas and grace wghm are fairly consistent which are 0 046 km3 yr and 0 047 km3 yr respectively after 300 iterations of constrained forward modeling the leakage corrected storage trends for lake poyang became much larger fig 8 the corrected storage trends reach 3 07 and 3 14 km3 yr for grace gldas and grace wghm after constrained fm correction respectively which are over 66 3 times of the trends in the original signals table 2 again the two corrected lake water storage trends rates with different hydrological models gldas and wghm are close with a minor difference of only 2 this consistency further implies that model variations such as lake of groundwater compartments in gldas do not substantially affect the estimation of surface water changes in lake poyang the uncertainty of constrained forward modeling is about 1 and the details can be seen in chen et al 2015 the unconstrained fm correction has also been tested in this area however we find it doesn t work the signal after iterations by unconstrained fm correction is not convergent even though we have expanded and shrunk the area range for case studies in the testing the unconstrained forward modeling still doesn t work in these cases the amplitudes of leakage corrected lake water storages from both grace gldas and grace wghm fig 8 considerably exceed those estimated from the area level relationships fig 6 this discrepancy suggests the residual between grace observations and hydrological model simulations may yield unrealistic water storage changes in lake poyang however this method has proven to be feasible for flood identification across the entire lake poyang catchment a total area of 1 622 105 km2 much larger than lake poyang as recently demonstrated by zhou et al 2018 to further assess the reliability of lake poyang storage changes estimated by grace model residuals we then compared their equivalent water height ewh values in the lake region with those derived from satellite and in situ observations 5 2 2 comparison of equivalent water heights from the two methods following the same procedure as in calculating the grace model residuals we converted the water storage changes estimated from optical satellite imagery and in situ measurements into sh coefficients with the truncation to degree and order 60 and then smoothed them by the same 300 km gaussian filter by doing so we ensured that water storage changes from the above mentioned two methods i e area level relations and grace model residuals are distributed in the consistent spatial domain and resolution then we converted both results into ewh values in order to better understand how much of the grace model residuals are actually contributed by observed water storage changes in lake poyang ewh values are calculated according to the equations in wahr et al 1998 with the mask of lake poyang an area of 6605 8 km2 then compared with the water level change from the recovered grace gldas and grace wghm water storage time series in the point 29 0 n and 116 3 e fig 9 as presented in fig 9 the magnitudes of ewh inverted from water storage time series from optical satellite imagery and in situ measurements account for about 30 of the recovered grace gldas and grace wghm levels this illustrates that most of the grace model residuals stem form signals that are likely exogenous to poyang water storage changes the coefficient of determination rmse and mab for grace gldas is 0 79 2 34 cm and 1 96 cm respectively while the coefficient of determination rmse and mab for grace wghm is 0 47 4 26 cm and 3 22 cm thus isolating surface water storage changes in lake poyang using grace observations and hydrological models may be practically difficult 6 discussions 6 1 reasons for overestimated lake water storage changes from hydrological models and grace we identify several possible reasons for that grace model residuals figs 8 and 9 failed to capture the signal of water storage changes in lake poyang but are overall effective for the lake poyang catchment zhou et al 2018 on one hand water storage changes in lake poyang only account for a tiny proportion of the tws signals in the entire lake poyang catchment the grace observation noise see the high frequency undulations of the red or blue curves in fig 9 itself probably makes it difficult to detect the relatively smaller lake poyang water storage change signal moreover the large uncertainties of present hydrology models further increase the difficulty of surface water signal extraction from the total tws variations over the lake poyang basin our applied hydrological models underestimate the amplitudes of non surface water storage changes scanlon et al 2018 leading to exaggerated residuals in grace gldas and grace wghm the three gorges dam upstream of lake poyang with the impoundment of world s largest hydropower plant began to store water in june 2003 where the seasonal annual water regulations may affect the signal of grace lian et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 6 2 relationships between water level and inundation area to further test the reliability of our results we explore the hypsometric relationships between modis derived inundation areas and station water levels for lake poyang as seen in fig 10 a e a strong hypsometric relation r2 close to 0 90 or greater was identified for each of the five gauging stations the average water levels from all five stations respond to 95 of the lake area changes fig 10f fig 10e and 10 g show that the coefficient of determination with the monthly water level changes from the hukou station is close to the coefficient of determination with the daily water level changes from this station however the r2 value for the hypsometry with the satellite altimetry fig 10h is lower than those with daily or monthly water level changes from the stations this further implies possible measurement errors in satellite altimetry due to its low temporal resolution and limited observation footprints over lake poyang in general fig 10 suggests that our mapped inundation areas and acquired station water levels are well correlated and thus reliable for deriving lake water storage changes 6 3 uncertainties of using inundation areas and levels for estimating lake water storage changes two primary sources contributed to the uncertainties in our estimated lake poyang water storage changes using inundation areas and altimetry water levels first our applied hydroweb water levels were acquired from different radar altimetry missions the combination of these multi mission measurements may lead to certain biases and uncertainties for some large lakes with relatively flat surface terrain radar altimetry measurements can reach to a few centimeters cheng et al 2010 cretaux et al 2016 cretaux et al 2009 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 riƒçko et al 2012 however this does not apply to lake poyang where surface gradient is usually evident up to 4 to 5 m as shown in fig 5 second our water mapping accuracy is limited to the 250 m spatial resolution in the modis imagery despite being a sizable water bodies lake poyang is irregularly shaped and often disaggregated into small water bodies during the dry seasons such factors pose additional challenges to the extent mapping using modis image 7 conclusions the combination of inundation areas mapped from optical remote sensing and water levels measured by satellite altimetry and hydrological stations enables a comprehensive estimation of three dimensional lake water storage changes similar to inundation area and water level water storage in lake poyang shows an evident seasonality and reaches the peak during the summer months and the minimum between september and march nevertheless the amplitudes of seasonal variation from altimetry data are smaller than those from station measurements the underestimate of lake poyang s level variation by satellite altimeters is likely attributed to their low temporal resolutions and limited footprint coverage together with a complex surface gradient over lake poyang mass observations from the grace satellites and water storage simulations from wghm and gldas hydrological models also provide a means of estimating storage changes given that the residual fields between grace observations and model simulations grace gldas or grace wghm are dominantly affected by water storage changes in lake poyang the known geography of lake poyang allows us to apply constrained forward modeling to determine leakage biases in the water storage trend the recovered storage trend after forward modeling is about 66 times of the original trend without leakage correction from the residual signals however the recovered level changes from grace gldas and grace wghm are significantly larger than those inverted from water storage changes estimated from satellite altimetry observations in situ measurements and modis data on one hand the size of lake poyang 2000 5000 km2 is smaller than the intrinsic grace spatial resolution 100 000 km2 on the other hand the exaggerated level amplitudes in grace gldas and grace wghm are caused by the underestimations of non surface water storage changes in the hydrological models this study demonstrates that the combination of multi mission remote sensing data hydrological models and in situ measurements are useful for quantifying short term and long term water storage variations in highly dynamic fluvial lake systems it also suggests that the integration of grace satellite gravimetry data and hydrological models is still inadequate in estimating water storage change of lake poyang our methods and results provide a valuable example for monitoring storage changes in other similar water bodies credit authorship contribution statement

5140,understanding water storage changes in lake poyang the largest freshwater lake in china is essential for local hydro ecological assessments and water resource management the integration of multi mission satellite data hydrological models and in situ measurements allows for a comprehensive estimate of lake poyang s storage variations we here estimated lake poyang water storage changes during the recent decade by using inundation areas mapped from optical satellite imagery and water levels measured by satellite radar altimetry and gauging stations the amplitudes of seasonal variation from

2012c 2013a han et al 2015 wang et al 2014 in addition water regulation from the three gorges dam tgd affects the water flow and level at the yangze poyang confluence which further complicates accurate estimation of water storage changes in lake poyang guo et al 2008 wang et al 2011 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015b frequent extreme floods e g in 2010 and 2012 li et al 2015 and droughts e g in 2011 and 2016 wang et al 2014 and http www globaltimes cn content 1010691 shtml have seriously affected the everyday life of local residents and the ecological system and caused enormous social and economic losses thus accurate assessment of seasonal and inter annual water storage changes in lake poyang is critical to not only understanding its responses to climate variability but also managing local water resources and making prompt decisions for flood control water safety and ecological conservation as important indicators to climate change and human activities inundation area and level of lake poyang have been investigated using satellite images and altimetry numerous studies have shown that modis images are useful in monitoring inundation areas of large inland lakes ma et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 for instance feng et al 2012a and wu and liu 2015a applied moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis imagery to estimate the inundation changes in lake poyang during 2000 2011 chen et al 2014 identified the abrupt area change in lake poyang using modis imagery during 2000 2012 zhang et al 2013 monitored both water level and area changes in lake poyang during 2003 2009 using icesat and landsat observations wu and liu 2015b reported lake poyang s level changes using modis images and in situ topographic data during 2000 2012 these studies indicated that lake poyang has experienced expansions and shrinkages during both short and long term time scales in the recent decades the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites obtain spatial variations of earth s gravity field and provide a new remote sensing device for monitoring mass redistribution in the earth system tapley et al 2004 since 2002 grace has been widely used in other research studies related to terrestrial water storage tws changes cazenave and chen 2010 chen et al 2017 famiglietti and rodell 2013 forootan et al 2014 long et al 2013 2014 2015a b 2017 rodell et al 2009 2018 reager and famiglietti 2009 grace observed tws variation provides a potential means to better understand water dynamics of lake poyang several recent studies have tried to document water storage variations of lake poyang cai et al 2015 and zhang et al 2015a used trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission and grace data to estimate water exchange in lake poyang zhou et al 2016 combined grace observations gldas global land data assimilation system model simulations and satellite altimetry data to assess water storage changes in lake poyang during 2003 2014 however their grace tws estimations did not consider leakage error correction zhou et al 2018 used multiple satellite remote sensing observations gldas and pcr globwb pcraster global water balance models and in situ data from 24 metrological stations in the poyang lake basin to identifying the food events over the poyang lake basin about 162200 km2 during 2003 2016 our research focused on the lake poyang about 3500 km2 which is more challenging as lakes that experience rapid and significant short term fluctuations the coarse temporal monthly sampling from grace may not be adequate to capture these signals in this study we give a comprehensive analysis of water storage changes in lake poyang by integrating i remote sensing observations from optical altimetry and grace satellites ii hydrological models and iii in situ measurements specifically we explore two methods for estimating the time series of lake poyang water storage during the past decade the first method combines lake poyang s inundation extents mapped from daily modis imagery and water levels measured by satellite altimetry and gauging stations in the second method we correct leakage effect in grace observations using constrained forward modeling approach and then derive lake poyang s water storage changes as residuals between leakage corrected grace observations and simulations from two hydrological models gldas noah and wghm watergap global hydrology model then we evaluate the feasibility of water storage monitoring with grace and hydrological models for lake poyang 2 study area lake poyang is located in the north of jiangxi province china fig 1 as its water level is higher in the south lake poyang usually flows northward and discharges to the yangtze river from hukou cai and ji 2009 wu and liu 2014 the main water supply of the lake includes local precipitation inflows from five main tributaries i e ganjiang xiushui fuhe xinjiang and raohe and partially flows from the yangtze river in summer feng et al 2012a the inundation extent of lake poyang fluctuates dramatically between the wet and dry seasons during the summer the water level reaches the highest around july and slightly drops during august and september in october the water level recedes steadily followed by the dry season between november and march lake poyang is an important water storage zone for the yangtze river with an annual average water intake of about 15 6 of the yangtze river s runoff ye et al 2011 2013 water quantity and quality of lake poyang are directly related to water security in the catchment and the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river however the size of lake poyang has shown a decreasing trend in the recent years feng et al 2013b wang et al 2014 2017 3 data sets 3 1 optical satellite images in this study the 250 m resolution surface reflectance imagery mod 09 from modis terra accessed from https modis gsfc nasa gov were used to extract daily inundation areas of lake poyang from february 2000 to december 2011 a total of 494 high quality image granules were selected during our study period 2000 2011 so that there is one cloud free observation in each month and most months have two and more observations an advanced thematic mapping scheme was employed to optimize automated delineation of water surfaces in each selected image open water inundation extents were next extracted from these images using an automated dynamic thresholding algorithm the segmented lake spatial extents were next meticulously examined our mapped poyang inundation areas using modis imagery were validated by 30 m landsat tm and etm images detailed validation can be seen in wang et al 2014 in brief lake areas obtained from modis agree with landsat mapping with an r2 value for linear cross validation reaching 0 96 our mapped area time series also follows a similar inundation pattern with the result in feng et al 2012a although the latter is relatively small in magnitude for example in both results the maximum inundation area was found in the year of 2000 while the minimum was in 2011 it is worth noting that our mapped inundation extents went through a rigorous quality assurance and quality control and are considered to have reached the optimal accuracy using 250 m modis imagery 3 2 satellite altimetry levels satellite altimetry can monitor lake water levels huang et al 2018a huang et al 2018b song et al 2013 yi et al 2016 2017 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 yao et al 2018 li et al 2019 in this study altimetry data for lake poyang were gathered from the legos hydroweb database cr√©taux et al 2011 http hydroweb theia land fr hydroweb archives water level for over 200 major lakes and larger reservoirs in the world based on altimetry data from jason 1 jason 2 jason 3 topex poseidon gfo saral altika ers 1 2 envisat sentinel 3a sentinel 3b icesat 1 and cryosat 2 data a full description of the altimetry data processing for lakes was provided in cretaux et al 2016 the legos water level data have been performed waveform retracking and the systematical error between different altimetry missions has also been removed the time series for lake poyang includes 183 water levels averaged across the lake surface roughly on monthly basis from june 21 1995 to june 22 2016 here we used the temporal subset during 2000 2015 the available level series are not always evenly distributed in time so there could be multiple or no observations in certain months 3 3 in situ level measurements in situ water level measurements vary among different gauging stations across lake poyang yao et al 2016 similar to many large fluvial lake systems lake poyang exhibits a natural surface gradient due to different influences of the tributary inflows and the confluence condition in the yangtze river wang et al 2017 the water level gradient is particularly strong in the dry season additionally the lake water level is further complicated by the combined effect of spatial variations in bathymetry and surface wind due to lack of observation networks spatially continuous water levels across the entire lake surface are difficult to obtain alternatively water levels measured at several discrete gauging stations are often applied to reflect the average lake water level cai et al 2015 wu and liu 2015b ye et al 2014 in this study we collected daily level measurements at the five gauging stations hukou xingzi tangyin duchang and kunshan see the marked locations in fig 1 distributed along the south to north lake surface gradient from january 1 2000 to december 31 2015 in wusong datum 3 4 grace satellite gravimetry data the grace rl05 time variable gravity solutions from csr center for space research at university of texas austin were used in this study bettadpur and grace 2012 these solutions represent gravity changes of each month from april 2002 to december 2015 and consist of sh spherical harmonic coefficients which are up to degree 60 the c20 terms were replaced by the slr estimates for higher accuracy cheng et al 2013 the degree 1 terms were not contained in the calculations since their contribution is minor to regional mass estimates for relatively small spatial scales such as the lake poyang as an alternative the grace mascon mass concentration solutions were provided by jpl jet propulsion laboratory of nasa watkins et al 2015 the 3 3 equal area mascons offer improved spatial resolution with less signal leakage however the mascon size 100 000 km2 is still too coarse for our studied lake poyang region under 4000 km2 and as a result substantial leakage correction may be required 3 5 hydrological models 3 5 1 gldas simulations the gldas tws estimates used here are from the noah land surface models 10 lsm10 at 1 spatial resolution ek et al 2003 rodell et al 2004 the noah lsm simulations from 2002 to 2015 were gathered from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center tws changes were integrated from total soil moisture tsm up to the depth of 2 m snow water equivalent swe and canopy water storage cws but groundwater changes are excluded due to absent of groundwater component in the gldas lsms 3 5 2 wghm simulations the wghm outputs include four major storage components surface water water stored in surface reservoirs and rivers snow water soil moisture and groundwater doll et al 2003 doll and fiedler 2008 m√ºller schmied et al 2014 water storage changes are analyzed for period from 1961 to the present with 0 5 spatial resolution for most climate zones and the 30 huge river basins worldwide guntner et al 2007 wghm calculates the land water cycle by theoretic formulations for most hydrological processes including surface and groundwater storages and anthropogenic processes e g human water use of groundwater that were not modeled by gldas in this study we used simulation outputs from the wghm 2 1 covering the period from january 2002 to december 2012 4 methods 4 1 deriving water storage changes from inundation extents and levels as described in section 1 we applied two methods for estimating water storage variations in lake poyang the first method combines the time series of 1 inundation extents mapped from modis imagery refer back to section 3 1 and 2 water levels measured by satellite altimeters section 3 2 and the five gauging stations section 3 3 volume variations were determined with the assumption that between two successive measurements at t1 and t2 the lake bathymetry follows a regular pyramidal shape abileah et al 2011 as formulated in eq 1 1 Œ¥ v h 2 h 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 3 10 3 where Œ¥v denotes water volume variation between t1 and t2 s1 and s2 inundation extents at t1 and t2 and h1 and h2 their associated water levels as further illustrated in fig 2 we first interpolated acquired altimetry water levels and modis derived inundation areas into daily time series by linear interpolation in order to match the temporal frequency of gauging level observations daily time series were then averaged to calculate the monthly mean water levels and inundation areas we then derived the monthly water storage change according to eq 1 using altimetry levels and gauging levels respectively as the in situ water levels measurements have daily data and can be obtained from five different gauging stations the spatial and temporal resolution of in situ water levels measurements is higher than satellite altimetry data grace data and hydrology models simulations the in situ water levels measurements were taken as the reference for inferring the baseline water storage changes 4 2 estimating water storage changes from model simulations and grace observations water storage changes in lake poyang were next obtained using tws variations observed by grace satellites and simulated by gldas and wghm models fig 3 in the lake poyang catchment grace observed mass variations represent the integrated tws changes in surface water soil moisture and groundwater however the applied grace sh solution is subject to large leakage errors associated with the limited sh range degree order of 60 and further gaussian spatial smoothing chen et al 2015 leakage effect can result in significant attenuation of mass change signals when mass changes in the surrounding regions are relatively small forward modeling has been proved as a useful method for correcting or reducing leakage bias especially when the source locations of the mass change are known e g chen et al 2007 wouters et al 2008 ivins et al 2011 long et al 2016 during the forward modeling numerical iterations are applied to seek the true mass change redistribution that best fits the mass change observed from grace given that the identical data processing procedure is applied to the modeled data as that used to the grace data the forward modeling with and without constraint can be found in chen et al 2015 the constrained forward modeling was employed for lake poyang to correct leakage biases in grace observed monthly tws changes to isolate water storage changes in lake poyang we then subtracted monthly changes in soil moisture and groundwater simulated by the applied hydrological models from the leakage corrected grace observations as described in section 3 5 monthly soil moisture changes were simulated by both gldas noah and wghm whereas groundwater changes were only simulated in wghm due to lack of groundwater compartments in gldas however since groundwater flux only provides a tiny fraction 1 2 of the total water variation around the lake poyang region wan and xu 2010 lian et al 2011 we here consider the influence of missing groundwater changes in noah to be small see section 5 2 1 the primary contributions from water changes in lake poyang therefore were estimated as the residual fields between the grace tws changes and available non surface water changes from gldas noah thereafter grace gldas or wghm thereafter grace wghm the detailed processing procedure is outlined in fig 3 a 300 km gaussian smoothing was used to the monthly grace solutions and no decorrelation filter was applied in this study the 1 1 water storage changes simulated by gldas and wghm models were then converted into sh coefficients with the truncation to degree and order 60 and then were smoothed by the same 300 km gaussian filter the months in which grace data were absent were excluded from this conversion the obtained time series were then represented by anomalies with respect to the mean values during april 2002 to december 2015 as the residual fields grace gldas or grace wghm are assumed to be mainly contributed by poyang water changes the constrained forward modeling leakage corrections were applied to the residual fields by constraining the mass changes within the lake poyang areas as denoted by the lake mask then the recovered monthly mass change series were obtained the total water storage change in lake poyang were then calculated by summing the gridded area weighted mass changes within then calculated by summing the gridded area weighted mass changes within the lake poyang areas denoted by the lake mask in the calculations for each month during april 2002 to december 2011 an average inundation area for the lake poyang was derived from the modis images over that month to represent the monthly lake mask 5 results 5 1 poyang storage changes from satellite imagery altimetry and in situ measurements 5 1 1 inundation areas fig 4 shows the modis derived time series of inundation area of lake poyang during the period of 2000 2011 inundation areas in lake poyang exhibit strong intra annual variability from september to march the inundation area reaches a minimum of 1000 km2 or below as a result the lake surface is disaggregated to several sections and a fluvial channel connecting the five tributaries to the yangtze main stem is well exposed along the central axis of the lake from june to august the lake inundation area expands to a maximum of over 3000 km2 and reconnects individual lake sections to a continuous water surface the average intra annual maximum minimum ratio is about 3 evident inter annual variations are also observed during our study period 2000 to 2011 the maximum inundation area occurred in 2010 which concurs with the flooding event in june 2010 feng et al 2016 wang et al 2014 2017 by contrast minimum areas are observed in 2003 and 2011 which are consistent with recorded meteorological droughts in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin feng et al 2012b wang et al 2014 2017 5 1 1 1 water levels fig 5 reveals water level time series for lake poyang acquired from the five gauging stations from 2000 to 2015 the lake level displays evident annual cycles similar to those in inundation area fig 4 more drastic level changes were found at the northern stations e g hukou and xingzi for example the annual amplitudes of water level changes at hukou and xingzi stations are about 10 82 m and 10 49 m respectively table 1 the level changes at southern stations also show a clear annual cycle the annual amplitudes of the water level changes at tangyin and kangshan stations are about 7 32 m and 5 81 m respectively which are obviously lower than those at the northern stations the time series from satellite altimetry observations as shown in fig 5f also reveals dramatic water level changes in lake poyang which agree with the in situ measurements from the five stations during the same period however the lake level series from satellite altimetry has smaller annual amplitude 4 09 m this is likely related to the low temporal resolution of altimetry measurements and their sparse footprints e g with major inter track gaps across lake poyang in addition there are temporal gaps of up to a few months in the altimetry level time series all these factors likely led to under represented observations of the lake level variation during the study period 5 1 1 2 water storage changes fig 6 presents water storage changes in lake poyang during the 2002 2011 derived synergistically from modis imagery and water level measurements similar to inundation areas fig 4 and water levels fig 5 water storage changes in lake poyang exhibit evident seasonal and also inter annual variations water storage changes derived from in situ level measurements generally agree with those from satellite altimetry levels in both annual amplitudes and inter annual variations however the annual amplitudes of the storage changes from altimetry are smaller than those of gauging derived result similar as the case as shown by the water level comparisons fig 5 with coefficient of determination root mean square error rmse and mean absolute bias mab of 0 52 2 47 km3 and 1 77 km3 respectively 5 2 the water storage monitoring with grace and hydrological model in lake poyang 5 2 1 recovered water storage changes of lake poyang from hydrological models and grace fig 7 a shows the tws time series from grace observations and gldas and wghm simulations in lake poyang from april 2002 to april 2015 these results were smoothed by the 300 km gaussian filter but leakage errors were not corrected yet by constrained forward modeling the residual between grace and gldas during 2002 2015 grace gldas and between grace and wghm during 2002 2012 grace wghm are presented in fig 7b the water storage trends in grace gldas and grace wghm are fairly consistent which are 0 046 km3 yr and 0 047 km3 yr respectively after 300 iterations of constrained forward modeling the leakage corrected storage trends for lake poyang became much larger fig 8 the corrected storage trends reach 3 07 and 3 14 km3 yr for grace gldas and grace wghm after constrained fm correction respectively which are over 66 3 times of the trends in the original signals table 2 again the two corrected lake water storage trends rates with different hydrological models gldas and wghm are close with a minor difference of only 2 this consistency further implies that model variations such as lake of groundwater compartments in gldas do not substantially affect the estimation of surface water changes in lake poyang the uncertainty of constrained forward modeling is about 1 and the details can be seen in chen et al 2015 the unconstrained fm correction has also been tested in this area however we find it doesn t work the signal after iterations by unconstrained fm correction is not convergent even though we have expanded and shrunk the area range for case studies in the testing the unconstrained forward modeling still doesn t work in these cases the amplitudes of leakage corrected lake water storages from both grace gldas and grace wghm fig 8 considerably exceed those estimated from the area level relationships fig 6 this discrepancy suggests the residual between grace observations and hydrological model simulations may yield unrealistic water storage changes in lake poyang however this method has proven to be feasible for flood identification across the entire lake poyang catchment a total area of 1 622 105 km2 much larger than lake poyang as recently demonstrated by zhou et al 2018 to further assess the reliability of lake poyang storage changes estimated by grace model residuals we then compared their equivalent water height ewh values in the lake region with those derived from satellite and in situ observations 5 2 2 comparison of equivalent water heights from the two methods following the same procedure as in calculating the grace model residuals we converted the water storage changes estimated from optical satellite imagery and in situ measurements into sh coefficients with the truncation to degree and order 60 and then smoothed them by the same 300 km gaussian filter by doing so we ensured that water storage changes from the above mentioned two methods i e area level relations and grace model residuals are distributed in the consistent spatial domain and resolution then we converted both results into ewh values in order to better understand how much of the grace model residuals are actually contributed by observed water storage changes in lake poyang ewh values are calculated according to the equations in wahr et al 1998 with the mask of lake poyang an area of 6605 8 km2 then compared with the water level change from the recovered grace gldas and grace wghm water storage time series in the point 29 0 n and 116 3 e fig 9 as presented in fig 9 the magnitudes of ewh inverted from water storage time series from optical satellite imagery and in situ measurements account for about 30 of the recovered grace gldas and grace wghm levels this illustrates that most of the grace model residuals stem form signals that are likely exogenous to poyang water storage changes the coefficient of determination rmse and mab for grace gldas is 0 79 2 34 cm and 1 96 cm respectively while the coefficient of determination rmse and mab for grace wghm is 0 47 4 26 cm and 3 22 cm thus isolating surface water storage changes in lake poyang using grace observations and hydrological models may be practically difficult 6 discussions 6 1 reasons for overestimated lake water storage changes from hydrological models and grace we identify several possible reasons for that grace model residuals figs 8 and 9 failed to capture the signal of water storage changes in lake poyang but are overall effective for the lake poyang catchment zhou et al 2018 on one hand water storage changes in lake poyang only account for a tiny proportion of the tws signals in the entire lake poyang catchment the grace observation noise see the high frequency undulations of the red or blue curves in fig 9 itself probably makes it difficult to detect the relatively smaller lake poyang water storage change signal moreover the large uncertainties of present hydrology models further increase the difficulty of surface water signal extraction from the total tws variations over the lake poyang basin our applied hydrological models underestimate the amplitudes of non surface water storage changes scanlon et al 2018 leading to exaggerated residuals in grace gldas and grace wghm the three gorges dam upstream of lake poyang with the impoundment of world s largest hydropower plant began to store water in june 2003 where the seasonal annual water regulations may affect the signal of grace lian et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 6 2 relationships between water level and inundation area to further test the reliability of our results we explore the hypsometric relationships between modis derived inundation areas and station water levels for lake poyang as seen in fig 10 a e a strong hypsometric relation r2 close to 0 90 or greater was identified for each of the five gauging stations the average water levels from all five stations respond to 95 of the lake area changes fig 10f fig 10e and 10 g show that the coefficient of determination with the monthly water level changes from the hukou station is close to the coefficient of determination with the daily water level changes from this station however the r2 value for the hypsometry with the satellite altimetry fig 10h is lower than those with daily or monthly water level changes from the stations this further implies possible measurement errors in satellite altimetry due to its low temporal resolution and limited observation footprints over lake poyang in general fig 10 suggests that our mapped inundation areas and acquired station water levels are well correlated and thus reliable for deriving lake water storage changes 6 3 uncertainties of using inundation areas and levels for estimating lake water storage changes two primary sources contributed to the uncertainties in our estimated lake poyang water storage changes using inundation areas and altimetry water levels first our applied hydroweb water levels were acquired from different radar altimetry missions the combination of these multi mission measurements may lead to certain biases and uncertainties for some large lakes with relatively flat surface terrain radar altimetry measurements can reach to a few centimeters cheng et al 2010 cretaux et al 2016 cretaux et al 2009 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 riƒçko et al 2012 however this does not apply to lake poyang where surface gradient is usually evident up to 4 to 5 m as shown in fig 5 second our water mapping accuracy is limited to the 250 m spatial resolution in the modis imagery despite being a sizable water bodies lake poyang is irregularly shaped and often disaggregated into small water bodies during the dry seasons such factors pose additional challenges to the extent mapping using modis image 7 conclusions the combination of inundation areas mapped from optical remote sensing and water levels measured by satellite altimetry and hydrological stations enables a comprehensive estimation of three dimensional lake water storage changes similar to inundation area and water level water storage in lake poyang shows an evident seasonality and reaches the peak during the summer months and the minimum between september and march nevertheless the amplitudes of seasonal variation from altimetry data are smaller than those from station measurements the underestimate of lake poyang s level variation by satellite altimeters is likely attributed to their low temporal resolutions and limited footprint coverage together with a complex surface gradient over lake poyang mass observations from the grace satellites and water storage simulations from wghm and gldas hydrological models also provide a means of estimating storage changes given that the residual fields between grace observations and model simulations grace gldas or grace wghm are dominantly affected by water storage changes in lake poyang the known geography of lake poyang allows us to apply constrained forward modeling to determine leakage biases in the water storage trend the recovered storage trend after forward modeling is about 66 times of the original trend without leakage correction from the residual signals however the recovered level changes from grace gldas and grace wghm are significantly larger than those inverted from water storage changes estimated from satellite altimetry observations in situ measurements and modis data on one hand the size of lake poyang 2000 5000 km2 is smaller than the intrinsic grace spatial resolution 100 000 km2 on the other hand the exaggerated level amplitudes in grace gldas and grace wghm are caused by the underestimations of non surface water storage changes in the hydrological models this study demonstrates that the combination of multi mission remote sensing data hydrological models and in situ measurements are useful for quantifying short term and long term water storage variations in highly dynamic fluvial lake systems it also suggests that the integration of grace satellite gravimetry data and hydrological models is still inadequate in estimating water storage change of lake poyang our methods and results provide a valuable example for monitoring storage changes in other similar water bodies credit authorship contribution statement

5141,the natural hydrological regime of the yangtze river has been influenced by dam construction over past decades more reservoirs are being built and have been planned in the upper reach of the yangtze river uryr to investigate the effects of reservoirs in the uryr and the three gorges reservoir tgr on the water temperature regime a reservoir water heat model combined with the soil and water assessment tool is used to simulate the water temperature change under different scenarios the results show that the water temperature regime has been dramatically altered by reservoir operation especially in spring and autumn reservoir operations impose a noticeable hysteresis effect on water temperature rising and falling processes thereby resulting in a delay of the suitable temperature date for the chinese sturgeon acipenser sinensis and four famous major carps when more reservoirs are put into use the delays in the target spawning times of these fishes will be further exacerbated modifying operation modes of these reservoirs and depth of water release is necessary during fish spawning seasons which could facilitate a better balance between ecological and socioeconomic demands

water temperature change caused by the keepit dam on the namoi river australia and indicated that the change disrupted thermal spawning cues for select australian native fish species olden and naiman 2010 analyzed the ecological consequences of dam induced modifications to riverine thermal regimes and suggested incorporating water temperature targets into environmental flows standards for water abstraction practices however few studies have been done to assess the impacts of the cascade reservoirs on river water temperature the yangtze river is one of the most important rivers in the world and has become one of the most highly impacted rivers due to human activity many studies have been implemented to assess the hydrological regime changes caused by dams and reservoirs zhang et al 2009 2012a dai and liu 2013 ban et al 2016 wang et al 2016 2018 zhang et al 2012a analyzed the long monthly streamflow and sediment load series change using a scanning t test and f test and indicated that the construction of water storage reservoirs exerted a massive influence on sediment load variations wang et al 2018 assessed the impacts of cascade dam development in the upper reaches of the yangtze river on its natural flows by using a hydrological model the soil and water assessment tool cai et al 2018 indicated that the thermal effect caused by the three gorges dam tgd was large at yichang station immediately downstream of the dam by using the air2stream model however the potential impacts of cascade hydropower development in the upper reaches of the yangtze river on water temperature remain unknown more large dams are being built and have been planned in the upper reaches of the yangtze river uryr these new reservoirs will further affect the water temperature of the middle and lower yangtze river therefore the objectives of this paper are to a examine water temperature regime changes caused by cascade reservoirs in the uryr and the tgr and b assess the potential ecological impacts of water temperature regime changes caused by reservoirs in the uryr and the tgr 2 materials and methods 2 1 cascade reservoirs construction in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the yangtze which is 6 380 km long is the longest river in asia and the third longest in the world the upper reaches of the yangtze river covers an area of 10 56 105 km2 which is approximately 58 9 of the entire yangtze river basin fig 1 and is rich in water resources with large headwaters and abundant opportunities for hydropower wang et al 2018 according to the major rivers cascade development plan in the uryr the layout of major river cascade reservoirs in the uryr will be completed by 2020 zhang et al 2012b the capacity of reservoirs under construction is more than 700 108m3 while the capacity of reservoirs that have been planned is more than 2 000 108m3 wang et al 2018 water temperature regime has been influenced by dam construction wang et al 2012a 2014 cai et al 2018 consequently the water temperature regime will be further influenced by the cascade reservoirs construction in the uryr in the present study 38 reservoirs are considered in the uryr 2 2 important fishes the yangtze river is a major pool of fish resources a major habitat for rare aquatic animals and the cradle of chinese freshwater aquaculture for many years the yangtze river basin has produced approximately 60 of the freshwater fish in china li 2001 chinese sturgeon acipenser sinensis is an anadromous protected species that migrates from brackish water or the water of the east china sea to jinsha river spawning grounds in the upper reaches of the yangtze river fig 2 dam construction blocked their migration paths and the spawning grounds have shrunk from a length of 600 km to only 30 km in the yichang reach downstream of the gezhouba dam wang et al 2012b due to human activity and changes in environmental factors the spawning rate of the fish dropped by 80 chinese sturgeon spawning occurs when the water temperature ranges from 15 3 c to 20 0 c during the spawning season october to november the best suitable water temperature is 18 0 c to 20 0 c for chinese sturgeon spawning activity in general chinese sturgeon begin to spawn when the water temperature drops to 20 c in october wei 2003 four famous major carp species ffmc black carp mylopharyngodon piceus grass carp ctenopharyngodon idellus silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp aristichthys nobilis are important freshwater fish resources in the yangtze river fig 2 due to changes in the ecohydrological conditions required by the ffmc the number of fry decreased from 6 7 billion in 1981 to only approximately 1 9 billion in 2001 liu et al 2004 after the impoundment of the tgr adult populations decreased by more than 50 wang et al 2016 ffmc spawning occurs when water temperature is between 18 c and 24 c during the spawning season april to june ffmc begin to spawn when the water temperature rises to 18 c in april yi et al 1988 2 3 water temperature model to investigate the impacts of hydropower cascade development in the uryr on the hydrological regime the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate the flow processes the simulated discharge was used as the input of reservoir water heat model the model is verified with the measured water temperatures downstream the tgr the flow chart of model system is shown in fig 3 2 3 1 swat model the swat is an ecohydrological model for the river basin scale incorporating over 30 years of model development at the co located us department of agriculture and texas a m university laboratories at temple texas swat has undergone continuous review testing modification and enhancement and has already been widely applied in the yangtze river with promising results to represent hydrological processes wang et al 2018 to investigate the impacts of hydropower cascade development in the uryr on the hydrological regime the swat was used to simulate the flow processes calibration and verification of the swat were implemented from 1966 to 1985 based on field discharge from the changjiang water resources commission details on the calibration and verification procedures can be found in zhang et al 2012b and wang et al 2018 simulated discharges of the swat model are taken as the input of the reservoir water heat model 2 3 2 reservoir water heat model the reservoir water heat model is applied to analyze the change of water temperature caused by the reservoir by comparing the water temperature of the inflow and outflow of the reservoir this model focuses on the river water heat changes caused by reservoirs in the longitudinal direction along the river so the water heat exchange in the vertical direction of the reservoir water body is not considered in the model zou 2008 the reservoir water balance equation can be expressed as 1 i Œ¥ t Œ¥ t o Œ¥ t Œ¥ t Œ¥ s where i Œ¥ t i t Œ¥ t i t 2 represents the mean discharge of reservoir inflow from time t Œ¥ t to time t o Œ¥ t o t Œ¥ t o t 2 represents the mean reservoir outflow discharge from time t Œ¥ t to time t Œ¥ s represents the change of reservoir water volume Œ¥ t is the time step either in hours or days in this study time step Œ¥ t is set at 1 day the change of reservoir heat during Œ¥ t period can be expressed as 2 t i Œ¥ t i Œ¥ t Œ¥ t t o o Œ¥ t Œ¥ t Œ¥ e where Œ¥ e represents the change of reservoir heat t i Œ¥ t t i t Œ¥ t t i t 2 represents the mean water temperature of reservoir inflow from time t Œ¥ t to time t t i t Œ¥ t is the water

is called unit water body heat which represents heat carried by the unit volume of water hence Œ¥ e can be defined as 3 Œ¥ e s t t r t s t Œ¥ t t r t Œ¥ t where s t and s t Œ¥ t is the reservoir water storage volume at time t and t Œ¥ t respectively t r t and t r t Œ¥ t is the reservoir water temperature at time t and t Œ¥ t respectively combining equations 2 and 3 4 t r t i Œ¥ t t i Œ¥ t Œ¥ t s t

the effects of cascade reservoirs in the uryr on flow processes the simulated discharge of swat was used as the inflow of the three gorges reservoir to assess the impacts of flow change caused by the cascade reservoirs in the uryr on the water temperature regime via use of the reservoir water heat model proposed here due to limited measured data the water temperature at yichang station in 1983 was taken as the natural water temperature baseline without any reservoir construction the water temperature at cuntan is taken as the inflow temperature of the three gorges reservoir and the water temperatures at yichang station is taken as the outflow temperature in 2012 in verification of the reservoir water heat model table 1 daily water temperature at the two hydrological stations were provided by the yangtze river water resources commission to assess the impacts of cascade reservoirs in the uryr and the tgr on the water temperature regime according to the hydropower development plan of the yangtze four hypothetical scenarios are developed in the present study table 2 scenario 1 no reservoir in the uryr but the tgr is considered scenario 2 reservoirs that have been built in the uryr and tgr are considered scenario 3 reservoirs that have been built and are under construction in the uryr and tgr are considered scenario 4 all reservoirs in the uryr and tgr are considered 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the reservoir water heat model the verification of the model was carried out with the observed data measured water temperatures at the yichang hydrological station in 2012 were used in the model s verification the relative root mean square error of the final calibration is 1 11 c the agreements between the measured and simulated values in fig 4 are a strong measure of the accuracy of the simulation and as such the output of the model proposed here is adoptable 3 2 water temperature changes caused by cascade reservoirs fig 5 shows the water temperature below the tgr in four different scenarios based on the reservoir water heat model the water temperature below the tgr varies greatly when more reservoirs are involved in the operation the water temperature has been influenced dramatically throughout the whole year in spring march to may water temperatures in scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 are higher than those of the inflow of the three gorges reservoir this means that the reservoirs operation alters the water temperature processes the water temperatures in scenarios 2 3 and 4 are also higher than those in scenario 1 which means that more reservoirs built in the upper reaches of the yangtze river will further influence the water temperature in summer june to august there are no noticeable changes in the four scenarios which can be attributed to operation rules for flood control the three gorges reservoir runs at the flood control limit water level in summer which means that the outflow is equal to the inflow of the reservoir hence reservoir operation will not impose effects on water temperature below the reservoir in autumn reservoir operation decreased the water temperature regime from fig 4 the outflow water temperatures of the tgr have changed greatly outflow water temperatures are less than inflow temperatures in the four scenarios because the reservoir starts storing water in the middle of september until the reservoir level reaches 175 m in winter december to february the outflow water temperatures are also less than the inflow temperatures because of reservoir operation fig 6 shows the water temperature changes in the four different scenarios compared to the water temperature without the three gorges reservoir baseline the water temperature change in the spring for scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 varied from 0 2 c to 2 1 c from 0 5 c to 2 6 c from 0 c to 3 1 c and from 0 4 c to 3 5 c respectively the water temperature change in summer for scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 varied from 1 8 c to 0 7 c from 1 7 c to 1 0 c from 1 9 c to 0 6 c and from 1 9 c to 1 2 respectively the water temperature change in autumn for scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 varied from 0 2 c to 2 5 c from 0 1 c to 2 4 c from 0 1 c to 2 5 c and from 0 2 c to 3 0 c respectively the water temperature change in winter for scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 varied from 2 1 c to 5 9 c from 2 9 c to 6 9 c from 3 4 c to 6 7 c and from 4 1 c to 7 3 c respectively 3 3 water temperature changes during the chinese sturgeon spawning season reservoir operation changes the water temperature below the dam while altering the downstream flow processes according to the modeling results fig 7 the temperatures in four scenarios increase greatly compared to those without built reservoirs in general chinese sturgeon begins to spawn when the water temperature drops to 20 5 c the water temperature drops below 20 5 c in the middle of october and then chinese sturgeon start to lay eggs in the spawning ground when there is no reservoir in the upper reaches of yangtze river and the three gorges reservoir from fig 6 the water temperature is still above 22 c in the middle of october the water temperature did not fall below 20 5 c until the beginning of november this kind of water temperature delay phenomenon can be attributed to the operation of the tgr and reservoirs in the upper reach of the yangtze river the water temperatures of scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 begin to drop below 20 5 c on the 1st 3rd 3rd and 9th november respectively compared to the baseline the suitable spawning water temperature for chinese sturgeon is postponed for 14 16 16 and 22 days when more reservoirs in the upper reaches of yangtze river are put into operation the longer the delay of the suitable spawning water temperature from fig 8 the water temperature frequencies with a temperature of 20 5 c in scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 are 50 46 47 and 36 respectively these results are less than those during a natural period with a frequency of 80 this implies that the downstream water temperature regime was has been altered by the impoundment of tgr and upstream reservoirs during the chinese sturgeon spawning season for scenario 1 only the tgr was put into operation without any reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and the water temperature downstream has been altered greatly when more reservoirs in the upper reaches of yangtze river are considered the water temperature will be further influenced under scenarios 2 3 and 4 these analyses suggest that the reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and the tgr greatly imposed significant impacts on the water temperature regime during chinese sturgeon spawning time 3 4 water temperature changes during spawning season for four famous major carp fig 9 shows the results of the water temperature simulations of four different scenarios during the ffmc spawning season the water temperatures in the four scenarios are altered dramatically after reservoirs are put into operation ffmc starts to spawn when the water temperature rises to 18 c in mid april before these reservoirs built in the upper reaches of yangtze river are put into operation after the reservoirs are built reservoirs begin to release water for flood control during this period from fig 10 the water temperature does not rise as it did within the natural period the water temperature did not rise to 18 c until the middle of may this kind of water temperature delay phenomenon can be attributed to the operation of tgr and reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the hysteresis effect on water temperature rising processes was caused by released water of tgr and reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the water temperatures of scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 begin to rise to 18 c on the 15th 17th 16th and 21th may respectively compared to the baseline the suitable spawning water temperature for ffmc was postponed for 28 30 29 and 34 days from this analysis we observe that the date of spawning water temperature suitable for ffmc will be delayed by approximately 4 weeks after the tgr is put into use thus reservoirs being built and planned in the upper reaches of the yangtze river will further impose influences on the water temperature regime downstream from fig 10 the water temperature frequencies with a temperature of 18 0 c in scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 are 47 49 50 and 51 respectively they are higher than those during the natural period with a frequency of 18 this indicated that the downstream water temperature regime became increasingly dominated by lower water temperatures after the reservoirs were put into use including tgr during the ffmc spawning season the water temperature downstream is altered greatly after the three gorges reservoir is put into operation without any reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river as more reservoirs in the upper reaches of yangtze river begin to release water during this period the water temperature will be further affected hence the optimal water temperature for the ffmc spawning will be further delayed 3 5 further discussion this study demonstrates that water temperature regimes are significantly influenced by reservoirs in the upper stream of the yangtze river and the tgr water temperature processes changed throughout the entire year figs 5 and 6 water temperature is one of the crucial factors in almost all ecological processes in rivers and its alteration likely leads to biological behavior changes such as fish spawning activity delays the magnitude of temperature modification in the river immediately below the dam can cause adverse ecological impacts preece and jones 2002 reservoirs have the hysteresis effect on temperature falling processes fig 7 water temperature characteristics during the chinese sturgeon spawning period have been altered due to reservoir operations figs 7 and 8 these temperature modifications in spawning grounds lead to a delay in chinese sturgeon spawning behavior gao et al 2014 found that the first spawning dates were significantly correlated with the date of the water temperature reaching 20 c the october mean discharge oct discharge and the discharge change from october to november oct nov discharge the date for the beginning of chinese sturgeon spawning was gradually delayed by the impoundment of the tgr the later spawning periods may relate to a change in the original water temperature rhythm in the yichang spawning reach xiao and duan 2011 the findings of this study indicate that the suitable spawning water temperature date for chinese sturgeon would be postponed for two weeks when all reservoirs are put into use it will be postponed for three weeks the hysteresis effect in temperature rising processes also occurred due to the release of low temperature water by reservoirs fig 10 a decline in the abundance of several native fish species in sections of the basin has been attributed to a disruption of thermal spawning cues by the release of unseasonably cold water from deep release reservoirs during spring and summer harris 1997 preece and jones 2002 todd et al 2005 webb et al 2008 the tgd has lowered the water temperature and lowered food availability in the river section above jianli which has dramatically decreased the suitability of this river section for the spawning of the four major chinese carps song et al 2018 zhang et al 2012c indicated that the initiation of the spawning season was delayed by approximately 1 month compared to pre tgd records our study demonstrated that the suitable spawning water temperature for ffmc would be postponed for four weeks when all reservoirs are put into use it will be postponed by approximately five weeks the effects of dam construction on water temperature and subsequent effects on other fish have also been reported in other river systems worldwide preece and jones 2002 todd et al 2005 olden and naiman 2010 preece and jones 2002 assessed the impacts of keepit dam on the thermal regime of the namoi river indicated that keepit dam has modified the thermal regime of the namoi river the annual maximum daily temperature was approximately 5 0 c lower and occurred three weeks later than the pre dam condition this change was sufficient to disrupt thermal spawning cues for selected australian native fish species todd et al 2005 investigated the impact of altered thermal regimes on the population viability of murray cod in the mitta mitta river downstream of dartmouth dam and found that cold water releases significantly threaten the post spawning survival of murray cod the operation of flaming gorge dam on the green river decreased spring summer tailwater temperatures to nearly 6 which contributed to the extirpation of several native species olden and naiman 2010 the findings in the present study show that reservoirs in the upper reach of the yangtze river disrupt thermal spawning cues for chinese sturgeon and ffmc in the yangtze river resulting in two to five weeks delay of spawning season in addition some endemic fish species are near extinction such as the finless porpoise neophocaena phocaenoides asiaorientalis the chinese river dolphin lipotes vexillifer dabry s sturgeon acipenser dabryanus long spiky head carp luciobrama macrocephalu and chinese shad tenualosa reevesii jiang 2011 the water temperature alterations documented in this study are likely contributing to the ecological threats on these species of the yangtze river historical data analysis between pre and post dam periods have been widely implemented to assess the impacts of a single dam on thermal regime caissie 2006 olden and naiman 2010 however we less research about how to qualify the impact of cascade reservoirs to the thermal regime therefore we proposed a framework to address the issue of water temperature change caused by cascade reservoirs we also coupled the reservoir water heat model with the soil and water assessment tool as a useful tool to provide insight into how cascade reservoirs influence the water temperature regime in yangtze river and a potential quantitative method for evaluating human activities e g hydropower development influence on water temperature regime in other regulated rivers many process based models have been developed and widely used in evaluation of river temperature change webb et al 2008 dugdale et al 2017 unfortunately these models generally have high demand of input data including stream geometry vegetation cover land use and meteorological conditions lack of those input data makes it impossible for the authors to run those models and compare them to the proposed model leading to one of the limitations of this study another limitation of this study is that air temperature is not taken into consideration though it has been found to be one of factors influencing river water temperature toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 neglecting the impact of air temperature may result in inappropriate assessment of water temperature change induced by reservoir operation thus air temperature effect will be included in the model in the future although this study investigated the impacts of reservoirs on the water temperature in the yangtze river the possible effects caused by climate changes are not considered climate change will affect the hydrologic and thermal regimes of rivers thus having a direct impact on freshwater ecosystems and human water use van vliet et al 2013 to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the water temperature change of the yangtze river and its possible ecological effects climatic and dam induced impacts should be assessed simultaneously this could be implemented via a combination of hydrological models reservoir scheduling models and climate change in further study since 2011 to facilitate the spawning success of four famous major carp species of the yangtze river the tgr has implemented ecological scheduling experiments for their natural regeneration for six consecutive years all the experiments were conducted when water temperature rises to 18 chen 2018 due to the reduction in suitable water temperature time its effect is limited a change in the operational rules for water temperature compensation during the fish spawning season is thus necessary 4 conclusions this study established the reservoir water thermal model to investigate the influence of reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and the tgr on the water temperature regime in different scenarios based on the swat simulation the results show that the water temperature regime has been dramatically altered by reservoir operations water temperatures in the spring increased after the reservoirs are put into use there is no obvious change in summer due to the operation rule of flood control during this period compared to the period prior to reservoir operation water temperatures in autumn decreased greatly which can be attributed to the impoundment of reservoirs water temperatures in winter showed similar patterns of variation with the water temperature being higher than that of the pre dam period the release of reservoirs has significantly influenced the water temperature during the chinese sturgeon and ffmc spawning seasons the hysteresis effect on water temperature rising processes and falling processes resulted in delays of the suitable temperature date for chinese sturgeon and ffmc by 2 3 weeks and 4 5 weeks respectively therefore optimizing the current operation rules of these reservoirs is necessary to minimize the negative effects of water temperature on river ecosystem integrity credit authorship contribution statement yuankun wang methodology formal analysis writing original draft

5141,the natural hydrological regime of the yangtze river has been influenced by dam construction over past decades more reservoirs are being built and have been planned in the upper reach of the yangtze river uryr to investigate the effects of reservoirs in the uryr and the three gorges reservoir tgr on the water temperature regime a reservoir water heat model combined with the soil and water assessment tool is used to simulate the water temperature change under different scenarios the results show that the water temperature regime has been dramatically altered by reservoir operation especially in spring and autumn reservoir operations impose a noticeable hysteresis effect on water temperature rising and falling processes thereby resulting in a delay of the suitable temperature date for the chinese sturgeon acipenser sinensis and four famous major carps when more reservoirs are put into use the delays in the target spawning times of these fishes will be further exacerbated modifying operation modes of these reservoirs and depth of water release is necessary during fish spawning seasons which could facilitate a better balance between ecological and socioeconomic demands

yangtze river with promising results to represent hydrological processes wang et al 2018 to investigate the impacts of hydropower cascade development in the uryr on the hydrological regime the swat was used to simulate the flow processes calibration and verification of the swat were implemented from 1966 to 1985 based on field discharge from the changjiang water resources commission details on the calibration and verification procedures can be found in zhang et al 2012b and wang et al 2018 simulated discharges of the swat model are taken as the input of the reservoir water heat model 2 3 2 reservoir water heat model the reservoir water heat model is applied to analyze the change of water temperature caused by the reservoir by comparing the water temperature of the inflow and outflow of the reservoir this model focuses on the river water heat changes caused by reservoirs in the longitudinal direction along the river so the water heat exchange in the vertical direction of the reservoir water body is not considered in the model zou 2008 the reservoir water balance equation can be expressed as 1 i Œ¥ t Œ¥ t o Œ¥ t Œ¥ t Œ¥ s where i Œ¥ t i t Œ¥ t i t 2 represents the mean discharge of reservoir inflow from time t Œ¥ t to time t o Œ¥ t o t Œ¥ t o t 2 represents the mean reservoir outflow discharge from time t Œ¥ t to time t Œ¥ s represents the change of reservoir water volume Œ¥ t is the time step either in hours or days in this study time step Œ¥ t is set at 1 day the change of reservoir heat during Œ¥ t period can be expressed as 2 t i Œ¥ t i Œ¥ t Œ¥ t t o o Œ¥ t Œ¥ t Œ¥ e where Œ¥ e represents the change of reservoir heat t i Œ¥ t t i t Œ¥ t t i t 2 represents the mean water temperature of reservoir inflow from time t Œ¥ t to time t t i t Œ¥ t is the water temperature of inflow at time t Œ¥ t t i t is the water temperature of inflow at time t t o Œ¥ t t o t Œ¥ t t o t 2 represents the mean water temperature of reservoir outflow from time t Œ¥ t to time t t o t Œ¥ t is the water temperature of outflow at time t Œ¥ t t o t is the water temperature of outflow at time t the product of the unit water volume and unit water temperature at a certain moment is called unit water body heat which represents heat carried by the unit volume of water hence Œ¥ e can be defined as 3 Œ¥ e s t t r t s t Œ¥ t t r t Œ¥ t where s t and s t Œ¥ t is the reservoir water storage volume at time t and t Œ¥ t respectively t r t and t r t Œ¥ t is the reservoir water temperature at time t and t Œ¥ t respectively combining equations 2 and 3 4 t r t i Œ¥ t t i Œ¥ t Œ¥ t s t Œ¥ t t r t Œ¥ t o Œ¥ t t o Œ¥ t s t where s t i Œ¥ t Œ¥ t s t Œ¥ t o Œ¥ t Œ¥ t thus the outflow water temperature can be obtained 5 t o t t r t Œ¥ t in this study the swat model was applied to examine the effects of cascade reservoirs in the uryr on flow processes the simulated discharge of swat was used as the inflow of the three gorges reservoir to assess the impacts of flow change caused by the cascade reservoirs in the uryr on the water temperature regime via use of the reservoir water heat model proposed here due to limited measured data the water temperature at yichang station in 1983 was taken as the natural water temperature baseline without any reservoir construction the water temperature at cuntan is taken as the inflow temperature of the three gorges reservoir and the water temperatures at yichang station is taken as the outflow temperature in 2012 in verification of the reservoir water heat model table 1 daily water temperature at the two hydrological stations were provided by the yangtze river water resources commission to assess the impacts of cascade reservoirs in the uryr and the tgr on the water temperature regime according to the hydropower development plan of the yangtze four hypothetical scenarios are developed in the present study table 2 scenario 1 no reservoir in the uryr but the tgr is considered scenario 2 reservoirs that have been built in the uryr and tgr are considered scenario 3 reservoirs that have been built and are under construction in the uryr and tgr are considered scenario 4 all reservoirs in the uryr and tgr are considered 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the reservoir water heat model the verification of the model was carried out with the observed data measured water temperatures at the yichang hydrological station in 2012 were used in the model s verification the relative root mean square error of the final calibration is 1 11 c the agreements between the measured and simulated values in fig 4 are a strong measure of the accuracy of the simulation and as such the output of the model proposed here is adoptable 3 2 water temperature changes caused by cascade reservoirs fig 5 shows the water temperature below the tgr in four different scenarios based on the reservoir water heat model the water temperature below the tgr varies greatly when more reservoirs are involved in the operation the water temperature has been influenced dramatically throughout the whole year in spring march to may water temperatures in scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 are higher than those of the inflow of the three gorges reservoir this means that the reservoirs operation alters the water temperature processes the water temperatures in scenarios 2 3 and 4 are also higher than those in scenario 1 which means that more reservoirs built in the upper reaches of the yangtze river will further influence the water temperature in summer june to august there are no noticeable changes in the four scenarios which can be attributed to operation rules for flood control the three gorges reservoir runs at the flood control limit water level in summer which means that the outflow is equal to the inflow of the reservoir hence reservoir operation will not impose effects on water temperature below the reservoir in autumn reservoir operation decreased the water temperature regime from fig 4 the outflow water temperatures of the tgr have changed greatly outflow water temperatures are less than inflow temperatures in the four scenarios because the reservoir starts storing water in the middle of september until the reservoir level reaches 175 m in winter december to february the outflow water temperatures are also less than the inflow temperatures because of reservoir operation fig 6 shows the water temperature changes in the four different scenarios compared to the water temperature without the three gorges reservoir baseline the water temperature change in the spring for scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 varied from 0 2 c to 2 1 c from 0 5 c to 2 6 c from 0 c to 3 1 c and from 0 4 c to 3 5 c respectively the water temperature change in summer for scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 varied from 1 8 c to 0 7 c from 1 7 c to 1 0 c from 1 9 c to 0 6 c and from 1 9 c to 1 2 respectively the water temperature change in autumn for scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 varied from 0 2 c to 2 5 c from 0 1 c to 2 4 c from 0 1 c to 2 5 c and from 0 2 c to 3 0 c respectively the water temperature change in winter for scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 varied from 2 1 c to 5 9 c from 2 9 c to 6 9 c from 3 4 c to 6 7 c and from 4 1 c to 7 3 c respectively 3 3 water temperature changes during the chinese sturgeon spawning season reservoir operation changes the water temperature below the dam while altering the downstream flow processes according to the modeling results fig 7 the temperatures in four scenarios increase greatly compared to those without built reservoirs in general chinese sturgeon begins to spawn when the water temperature drops to 20 5 c the water temperature drops below 20 5 c in the middle of october and then chinese sturgeon start to lay eggs in the spawning ground when there is no reservoir in the upper reaches of yangtze river and the three gorges reservoir from fig 6 the water temperature is still above 22 c in the middle of october the water temperature did not fall below 20 5 c until the beginning of november this kind of water temperature delay phenomenon can be attributed to the operation of the tgr and reservoirs in the upper reach of the yangtze river the water temperatures of scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 begin to drop below 20 5 c on the 1st 3rd 3rd and 9th november respectively compared to the baseline the suitable spawning water temperature for chinese sturgeon is postponed for 14 16 16 and 22 days when more reservoirs in the upper reaches of yangtze river are put into operation the longer the delay of the suitable spawning water temperature from fig 8 the water temperature frequencies with a temperature of 20 5 c in scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 are 50 46 47 and 36 respectively these results are less than those during a natural period with a frequency of 80 this implies that the downstream water temperature regime was has been altered by the impoundment of tgr and upstream reservoirs during the chinese sturgeon spawning season for scenario 1 only the tgr was put into operation without any reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and the water temperature downstream has been altered greatly when more reservoirs in the upper reaches of yangtze river are considered the water temperature will be further influenced under scenarios 2 3 and 4 these analyses suggest that the reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and the tgr greatly imposed significant impacts on the water temperature regime during chinese sturgeon spawning time 3 4 water temperature changes during spawning season for four famous major carp fig 9 shows the results of the water temperature simulations of four different scenarios during the ffmc spawning season the water temperatures in the four scenarios are altered dramatically after reservoirs are put into operation ffmc starts to spawn when the water temperature rises to 18 c in mid april before these reservoirs built in the upper reaches of yangtze river are put into operation after the reservoirs are built reservoirs begin to release water for flood control during this period from fig 10 the water temperature does not rise as it did within the natural period the water temperature did not rise to 18 c until the middle of may this kind of water temperature delay phenomenon can be attributed to the operation of tgr and reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the hysteresis effect on water temperature rising processes was caused by released water of tgr and reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the water temperatures of scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 begin to rise to 18 c on the 15th 17th 16th and 21th may respectively compared to the baseline the suitable spawning water temperature for ffmc was postponed for 28 30 29 and 34 days from this analysis we observe that the date of spawning water temperature suitable for ffmc will be delayed by approximately 4 weeks after the tgr is put into use thus reservoirs being built and planned in the upper reaches of the yangtze river will further impose influences on the water temperature regime downstream from fig 10 the water temperature frequencies with a temperature of 18 0 c in scenarios 1 2 3 and 4 are 47 49 50 and 51 respectively they are higher than those during the natural period with a frequency of 18 this indicated that the downstream water temperature regime became increasingly dominated by lower water temperatures after the reservoirs were put into use including tgr during the ffmc spawning season the water temperature downstream is altered greatly after the three gorges reservoir is put into operation without any reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river as more reservoirs in the upper reaches of yangtze river begin to release water during this period the water temperature will be further affected hence the optimal water temperature for the ffmc spawning will be further delayed 3 5 further discussion this study demonstrates that water temperature regimes are significantly influenced by reservoirs in the upper stream of the yangtze river and the tgr water temperature processes changed throughout the entire year figs 5 and 6 water temperature is one of the crucial factors in almost all ecological processes in rivers and its alteration likely leads to biological behavior changes such as fish spawning activity delays the magnitude of temperature modification in the river immediately below the dam can cause adverse ecological impacts preece and jones 2002 reservoirs have the hysteresis effect on temperature falling processes fig 7 water temperature characteristics during the chinese sturgeon spawning period have been altered due to reservoir operations figs 7 and 8 these temperature modifications in spawning grounds lead to a delay in chinese sturgeon spawning behavior gao et al 2014 found that the first spawning dates were significantly correlated with the date of the water temperature reaching 20 c the october mean discharge oct discharge and the discharge change from october to november oct nov discharge the date for the beginning of chinese sturgeon spawning was gradually delayed by the impoundment of the tgr the later spawning periods may relate to a change in the original water temperature rhythm in the yichang spawning reach xiao and duan 2011 the findings of this study indicate that the suitable spawning water temperature date for chinese sturgeon would be postponed for two weeks when all reservoirs are put into use it will be postponed for three weeks the hysteresis effect in temperature rising processes also occurred due to the release of low temperature water by reservoirs fig 10 a decline in the abundance of several native fish species in sections of the basin has been attributed to a disruption of thermal spawning cues by the release of unseasonably cold water from deep release reservoirs during spring and summer harris 1997 preece and jones 2002 todd et al 2005 webb et al 2008 the tgd has lowered the water temperature and lowered food availability in the river section above jianli which has dramatically decreased the suitability of this river section for the spawning of the four major chinese carps song et al 2018 zhang et al 2012c indicated that the initiation of the spawning season was delayed by approximately 1 month compared to pre tgd records our study demonstrated that the suitable spawning water temperature for ffmc would be postponed for four weeks when all reservoirs are put into use it will be postponed by approximately five weeks the effects of dam construction on water temperature and subsequent effects on other fish have also been reported in other river systems worldwide preece and jones 2002 todd et al 2005 olden and naiman 2010 preece and jones 2002 assessed the impacts of keepit dam on the thermal regime of the namoi river indicated that keepit dam has modified the thermal regime of the namoi river the annual maximum daily temperature was approximately 5 0 c lower and occurred three weeks later than the pre dam condition this change was sufficient to disrupt thermal spawning cues for selected australian native fish species todd et al 2005 investigated the impact of altered thermal regimes on the population viability of murray cod in the mitta mitta river downstream of dartmouth dam and found that cold water releases significantly threaten the post spawning survival of murray cod the operation of flaming gorge dam on the green river decreased spring summer tailwater temperatures to nearly 6 which contributed to the extirpation of several native species olden and naiman 2010 the findings in the present study show that reservoirs in the upper reach of the yangtze river disrupt thermal spawning cues for chinese sturgeon and ffmc in the yangtze river resulting in two to five weeks delay of spawning season in addition some endemic fish species are near extinction such as the finless porpoise neophocaena phocaenoides asiaorientalis the chinese river dolphin lipotes vexillifer dabry s sturgeon acipenser dabryanus long spiky head carp luciobrama macrocephalu and chinese shad tenualosa reevesii jiang 2011 the water temperature alterations documented in this study are likely contributing to the ecological threats on these species of the yangtze river historical data analysis between pre and post dam periods have been widely implemented to assess the impacts of a single dam on thermal regime caissie 2006 olden and naiman 2010 however we less research about how to qualify the impact of cascade reservoirs to the thermal regime therefore we proposed a framework to address the issue of water temperature change caused by cascade reservoirs we also coupled the reservoir water heat model with the soil and water assessment tool as a useful tool to provide insight into how cascade reservoirs influence the water temperature regime in yangtze river and a potential quantitative method for evaluating human activities e g hydropower development influence on water temperature regime in other regulated rivers many process based models have been developed and widely used in evaluation of river temperature change webb et al 2008 dugdale et al 2017 unfortunately these models generally have high demand of input data including stream geometry vegetation cover land use and meteorological conditions lack of those input data makes it impossible for the authors to run those models and compare them to the proposed model leading to one of the limitations of this study another limitation of this study is that air temperature is not taken into consideration though it has been found to be one of factors influencing river water temperature toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 neglecting the impact of air temperature may result in inappropriate assessment of water temperature change induced by reservoir operation thus air temperature effect will be included in the model in the future although this study investigated the impacts of reservoirs on the water temperature in the yangtze river the possible effects caused by climate changes are not considered climate change will affect the hydrologic and thermal regimes of rivers thus having a direct impact on freshwater ecosystems and human water use van vliet et al 2013 to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the water temperature change of the yangtze river and its possible ecological effects climatic and dam induced impacts should be assessed simultaneously this could be implemented via a combination of hydrological models reservoir scheduling models and climate change in further study since 2011 to facilitate the spawning success of four famous major carp species of the yangtze river the tgr has implemented ecological scheduling experiments for their natural regeneration for six consecutive years all the experiments were conducted when water temperature rises to 18 chen 2018 due to the reduction in suitable water temperature time its effect is limited a change in the operational rules for water temperature compensation during the fish spawning season is thus necessary 4 conclusions this study established the reservoir water thermal model to investigate the influence of reservoirs in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and the tgr on the water temperature regime in different scenarios based on the swat simulation the results show that the water temperature regime has been dramatically altered by reservoir operations water temperatures in the spring increased after the reservoirs are put into use there is no obvious change in summer due to the operation rule of flood control during this period compared to the period prior to reservoir operation water temperatures in autumn decreased greatly which can be attributed to the impoundment of reservoirs water temperatures in winter showed similar patterns of variation with the water temperature being higher than that of the pre dam period the release of reservoirs has significantly influenced the water temperature during the chinese sturgeon and ffmc spawning seasons the hysteresis effect on water temperature rising processes and falling processes resulted in delays of the suitable temperature date for chinese sturgeon and ffmc by 2 3 weeks and 4 5 weeks respectively therefore optimizing the current operation rules of these reservoirs is necessary to minimize the negative effects of water temperature on river ecosystem integrity credit authorship contribution statement yuankun wang methodology formal analysis writing original draft

5142,representing regional available water and energy conditions variations in precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e0 have received much attention in current studies on climate change however the changes in their mismatch i e climate seasonality have rarely been investigated considering the seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 respectively as well as their phase difference a climate seasonality and asynchrony index sai was used to analyze the seasonal distribution of the available water energy and their mismatch in the inland river basin of northwestern china irb nwc during 1960 2017 we found that the annual Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and sai all decreased during the past few decades indicating that the mismatch between the seasonal available water and energy in irb nwc has improved attribution analysis conducted by the elasticity method indicated that the changes in Œ¥p controlled the variations in sai throughout the area with a relative contribution of 43 7 furthermore wavelet analysis indicated that large scale ocean atmosphere circulation patterns including ei ni√±o southern oscillation indian ocean dipole pacific decadal oscillation and east asian summer monsoon were significantly linked with sai on 2 6 years scale our findings may provide valuable information regarding the trends and causes of climate seasonality and aid in predicting and mitigating the effects of potential future climate changes in the dry region keywords climate seasonality precipitation potential evapotranspiration climate elasticity 1 introduction depending on net radiation received by the land largely the potential evapotranspiration e0 is often used to represent the available energy that determining the rate of evapotranspiration budyko 1961 priestley and taylor 1972 furthermore precipitation p is often considered as the water supply that also controls regional evapotranspiration milly 1994 zhang et al 2001 the variations in e0 and p over the past few decades have received much attention in the current studies on climate change anabalon and sharma 2017 andrews et al 2010 however the mismatch conditions between the available water and energy i e climate seasonality have been ignored it has been found that climate seasonality has a significant imprint on hydrological processes berghuijs et al 2014 ning et al 2017 ecosystem productivity cardenas et al 2017 masese et al 2017 and agricultural production deryng et al 2011 xing et al 2018 for example many researchers have demonstrated that hydrological variables including streamflow and evapotranspiration have changed with variations in climate seasonality du et al 2016 xing et al 2018 yuan et al 2010 zeng and cai 2016 wood and aboveground net primary productivity are also driven by seasonal variations in p robinson et al 2013 wagner et al 2016 therefore analyzing the variations in the mismatch between seasonal available water and energy on a regional scale will benefit the development of national strategies for ecological and agricultural activities under a changing climate hallegatte 2009 osberghaus et al 2010 originally horn and bryson 1960 used sinusoidal functions to describe the tendency towards annual variations in the observed curve of p in the united states this method has since been widely used to study the seasonal amplitudes of the available water and energy hickel and zhang 2006 ning et al 2017 potter et al 2005 woods 2009 for example by using the sinusoidal function for the seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 milly 1994 mapped their spatial patterns in the eastern area of the rocky mountains similarly berghuijs and woods 2016 mapped the seasonal amplitude of p on a global scale to describe the mismatch between p and e0 milly 1994 and woods 2003 developed a dimensionless climate seasonality index considering the sinusoidal expressions of the seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 however mismatch only reflected the differences in the seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 subsequently berghuijs and woods 2016 explored the asynchrony of p and temperature t liu et al 2018a b then further improved the seasonality index by incorporating this asynchrony thus the mismatch expressed by this improved climate seasonality and asynchrony index sai not only considered the seasonal amplitude mismatch between p and e0 but also their phase difference the cause of the changes in climate seasonality is the other issue we cared although the above scholars have made great contributions to improve the expression of climate seasonality the mechanism influencing the mismatch between available water and energy has received little attention first adopted by mccuen 1974 the elasticity method has been widely used to analyze the variations in hydro meteorological variables such as e0 fu et al 2009 liu et al 2011 runoff gao et al 2016 ning et al 2016 and evapotranspiration liu et al 2018a b in recent years due to its simple formulation and high accuracy taking e0 as an example the contribution of meteorological variables including air temperature wind speed solar radiation and actual vapor pressure to the temporal changes in e0 was typically assessed by multiplying the long term trend of the variable by its partial derivative coefficient based on the penman monteith equation zheng et al 2009 in view of the similarity between sai and the above variables the elasticity method can be extended to quantify the contribution of the seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 to changes in sai moreover the ocean atmosphere circulation patterns including arctic oscillation ao north atlantic oscillation nao ei ni√±o southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo indian ocean dipole iod and the east asian summer monsoon easm may greatly influence sai since they are found to have impacts on seasonal variation of p otte et al 2017 ouyang et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 and e0 chai et al 2018 meza 2005 pravalie et al 2019 tabari et al 2014 specifically it has been found that ocean atmosphere circulation patterns not only influenced the shifts of peak in seasonal p lee et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 and t beniston and jungo 2002 yasunaka and hanawa 2005 but also controlled their intra annual extreme values drobinski et al 2016 liu et al 2018a b tong et al 2019 as such it is useful to investigate the potential connection between these large scale circulation patterns with the mismatch between p and e0 the inland river basin of northwestern china irb nwc is located in the innermost area of eurasia the long distance to the surrounding oceans means that it is difficult for marine vapor to reach this region shi et al 2007 furthermore the high mountains block atmospheric circulation which results in several large dry inland basins located in the rainshadow including the junggar basin basin 1 northern qilian mountain basins basin 2 qaidam basin basin 3 and tarim basin basin 4 fig 1 dominated by a typical temperate continental climate this region experiences long and cold winters hot and dry summers and short spring and autumn seasons kang et al 2007 this region is also one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change chen et al 2015 the rising average t in the arid areas of central asia will exceed 40 of the global average t rise under the current incremental co2 emissions adalgeirsdottir et al 2005 the meltwater water based system is also very fragile therefore there is still on going interest in detecting the possible changes in climatic variables over the irb nwc chen et al 2015 li et al 2016 liu and zhang 2013 however the variation in mismatch betweeb p and e 0 and its driving factors have not yet been examined in this region the main objectives of this study were thus to i present the temporal trends for seasonal amplitudes of p e0 and sai in irb nwc during 1960 2017 ii analyze the spatial distribution of the mean annual value and trends for the above three variables iii quantify the contributions of each factor to temporal changes in sai and iv explore the correlations between ocean atmosphere circulation patterns and sai 2 data and methods 2 1 data sources monthly meteorological data 1960 2017 collected at 108 stations including precipitation temperature sunshine hours and relative humidity were obtained from the china meteorological administration 10 of the data were missing at 23 of the stations which were interpolated from the adjacent stations following a regression based approach cross validation tests were conducted and indicated that the correlation coefficients between the series of original observed data and interpolated data all exceeded 0 8 ao nao enso pdo iod and easm were used to detect the potential links between large scale circulation and sai among them ao nao enso and pdo data were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration http www cpc ncep noaa gov iod and easm data were collected from the japan meteorological agency http ds data jma go jp tcc tcc products model index html and the website of jianping li http ljp lasg ac cn dct page 65540 respectively these six indices represent different large scale atmospheric circulation patterns and would have links with regional climatic variables despite their spatial coverage the interpretation of these indices can be found in some related studies gaughan et al 2016 gong et al 2001 thompson and wallace 2000 the annual series of these indices were normalized from the monthly data the whole study area was divided into four basins based on the drainage basin partition scheme in china zhang et al 2010 see fig 1 the mean e0 and p for each basin and whole study area were area weighted values based on weights from the thiessen polygon method chen et al 2019 rhynsburger 1973 the following analyses will be conducted for each basin 2 2 method the long term stationarity of p and e0 was first checked the sine function was used to fit the seasonal evolutions of p and e0 the sai was then obtained finally two attribution methods i e the elasticity method and cross wavelet analysis were used to detect the impact factors controlling the variations in sai the specific steps are presented in fig 2 a 2 2 1 stationarity and trend tests hydrological time series modeling typically assumes that the time series is stationary peel and bloeschl 2011 however owing to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes stationarity is no longer the default assumption milly et al 2008 therefore it is necessary to test the stationarity of p and e0 before modelling their seasonal variations here the augmented dickey fuller adf test dickey and fuller 1979 was used to examine the stationarity of the monthly p and e0 for the whole study area to obtain the coefficients of the model the ordinary least squares method was employed the significance coefficients were estimated by the t student statistic and compared with the corresponding critical value at the 95 confidence level if the t statistic exceeds the critical value the time series is stationary the test results shown in table 1 indicate that the time series of p and e0 are naturally stationary in this area p 0 05 thus they can be directly used for model simulation in the following analysis furthermore the non parametric mann kendall test mk kendall 1975 mann 1945 was used to determine the statistical significance of the trends of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and sai in each basin at the 95 confidence level 2 2 2 climate seasonality indices 1 seasonal amplitude of p and e0 originally milly 1994 assumed that the temporal variations in the seasonal p and e 0 can be expressed by the sine function in his work the origin of time t 0 was fixed in april in the northern hemisphere as a result the month with the maximum monthly p and e0 would be july however this peak phase will shift in some regions therefore the phase shifts of p and e0 sp and se0 were recently considered using the sine function berghuijs and woods 2016 liu et al 2018a b 1a p t p 1 Œ¥ p s i n 2 œÄ œÑ t s p 12 1b e 0 t e 0 1 Œ¥ e 0 s i n 2 œÄ œÑ t s e 0 12 where e0 was calculated by the method presented by priestley and taylor 1972 p t and e0 t are the monthly series of p and e0 respectively œÑ is the cycle of seasonality within one year outside the tropics the p and e 0 are mean monthly values of p and e0 for each year respectively the Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 are seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 respectively larger absolute values of Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 indicate larger seasonal amplitudes of the available water and energy milly 1994 woods 2003 to better understand the meanings of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 sp and se0 an example from the basin 1 based on the long term monthly p and e0 is given in fig 2b the irb nwc experiences a typical temperate continental climate therefore the phases of the seasonal p and e0 are consistent with that of solar radiation which suggested that the month with the maximum monthly p and e0 would appear between june and september mo et al 2019 correspondingly the origin of time t 0 would appear between march and june therefore the values of sp and se0 would range from 3 to 6 taking the time step for sp as 1 the linear regression between the series of p t p 1 and s i n 2 œÄ œÑ t s p 12 was calculated according to eq 1 the determination coefficient r2 of the regression equation was then calculated for different sp the sp with the highest r2 was considered as the fitted sp similarly the fitted se0 could also be obtained 2 climate seasonality index after obtaining the values of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 sp and se0 sai can be calculated as 2 sai Œ¥ p 2 2 Œ¥ p Œ¥ e 0 c o s 2 œÄ œÑ s p s e 0 12 Œ¥ e 0 2 1 2 where is the dryness index e 0 p sp se0 is the phase difference i e asynchrony between p and e0 hereafter denoted as pd sai was used to reflect the mismatch between the available water and energy if sai 0 there is no fluctuation in the mismatch between the seasonal p and e0 larger sai values indicate greater mismatch between the seasonal p and e0 2 2 3 attribution of climate seasonality change 1 elasticity method in this study the differences in the magnitude and phases of p and e0 jointly controlled the variations in the mismatch between the available water and energy therefore the effects of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and pd on sai were quantified following the elasticity method by

variables xi et al 2018 based on cross spectrum analysis and wavelet transformation wu et al 2018 the cross magnitude and significant period between the time series can be determined vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 the details of the calculation procedure of the cwt method were described thoroughly in previous studies e g camilo restrepo et al 2019 in this study we employed this method to investigate the correlation between the ocean atmospheric circulation patterns and sai from 1960 to 2017 3 results 3 1 variations in climate seasonality 3 1 1 variations in the amplitudes of seasonal p and e0 the mean annual values of Œ¥p were highest in the basin 2 1 28 0 12 followed by basin 4 1 21 0 16 and lowest in the basin 1 and basin 3 0 74 0 12 and 0 71 0 03 respectively suggesting that the intra annual variations of p were highest in the basin 2but lowest in the basin 3 in contrast the intra annual variations in e0 were highest in the basin 3 1 36 0 08 but lowest in the basin 2 0 80 0 03 the Œ¥p was higher than Œ¥e0 in the basin 2 and basin 4 and lower than Œ¥e0 in the basin 1 and basin 3 for the whole irb nwc the mean annual values of Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 were 0 99 0 07 and 1 03 0 02 respectively these results implied that the variations in the seasonal available water were higher than those of the available energy in basin 2 and basin 4 while they were smaller than those of the available energy in the basin 1 basin 3 and the whole irb nwc the temporal variations in the regionally averaged annual amplitudes of the seasonal p and e0 for each basin and the whole irb nwc during 1960 2017 are shown in figs 3 4 trend analysis indicated that Œ¥p decreased in the basins 1 4 at rates of 0 03 0 005 0 006 and 0 02 decade respectively among these values the changes of Œ¥p in the basin 1 basin 3 and basin 4 were statistically significant p 0 05 the Œ¥e0 also decreased in the above four basins at rates of 0 004 0 002 0 005 and 0 002 decade respectively however not all of their variations were statistically significant p 0 05 for the whole irb nwc the Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 both decreased at rates of 0 015 and 0 003 decade respectively however only the trend of Œ¥p was statistically significant p 0 05 the spatial distribution patterns of Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 are also shown in figs 3 4 the annual mean Œ¥p was low in the northwestern of irb nwc with values of 0 60 0 75 and the southeastern with values of 0 75 0 90 the value then increased gradually towards the center of the study area the Œ¥p was high in the southwestern and eastern regions with values of 1 20 1 35 the annual mean Œ¥e0 exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern to Œ¥p however its high and low values were opposite to those of Œ¥p specifically the lowest annual mean Œ¥e0 was observed in the southwestern and eastern regions with values of 0 75 10 90 the Œ¥e0 was high in the southeastern of basin 3 with values of 1 35 1 50 during 1960 2017 the Œ¥p followed a decreasing trend at 47 7 of the stations but this trend only reached a significant level at 24 3 of the stations p 0 05 which were mainly distributed in the basin 1 and basin 3 there was no significant change trend of Œ¥p at the other stations p 0 05 the Œ¥ e0 exhibited decreasing trends at 72 9 of the stations which were significant in the basin 1 and basin 4 accounting for 29 0 of stations in contrast the increasing trends of Œ¥e0 were only significant for six stations 3 1 2 variations in the mismatch between the seasonal available water and energy sai was used to determine the mismatch between the seasonal available water and energy in irb nwc and its spatial and temporal trends are shown in fig 5 the mean annual values of sai were lowest in the basin 2 9 49 2 62 followed by the basin 3 and basin 1 12 97 5 70 and 14 53 5 34 respectively while the highest values were observed in the basin 4 22 16 10 34 suggesting that the mismatch between the seasonal available water and energy was smallest in the basin 2 but largest in the basin 4 trend analysis demonstrated that sai decreased in the basins 1 4 and the whole irb nwc at rates of 0 27 0 45 2 50 1 04 and 1 07 decade respectively excluding the basin 1 the decreasing trend of sai was statistically significant in all of the basins p 0 05 the decadal average values of sai were highest in the 1960 s and lowest in the 2010 s in the three basins and the whole irb nwc spatially the highest annual mean sai was observed in the central irb nwc with values of 50 160 it then decreased gradually towards the northwest and southeast 10 suggesting that the mismatch between the available water and energy tended to shrink along this direction the sai followed a downward trend at 76 6 of the weather stations however the trend was only significant for 24 3 of the stations which were mainly distributed in the basin 1 and basin 3 p 0 05 in contrast the sai increased at the remaining stations but the change trend was not significant p 0 05 3 2 attribution of the temporal changes in climate seasonality 3 2 1 contributions of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and pd to sai variation the contributions of each variable to the long term trend of the sai determined by equations 3 4 in four basins and the whole irb nwc are shown in table 2 the changes in Œ¥p controlled the variations in sai in the basin 1 basin 2 basin 3 and the whole irb nwc with relative contributions of 47 4 42 4 54 6 and 43 7 respectively the changes in Œ¥e0 controlled the variations in sai in the basin 4 with a relative contribution of 58 7 although the changes in pd did not dominate the variations in sai in the study area its contributions could not be ignored for example in the basin 3 its value was larger than that of Œ¥e0 the contributions of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and pd were also estimated at all 108 stations as indicated by fig 6 c the changes in Œ¥p controlled the changes in sai at 55 of the 108 studied stations these Œ¥p regulated stations were mainly distributed in basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 fig 6a the rc Œ¥p ranged from 1 5 to 98 7 with a median value of 53 8 the changes in Œ¥e0 were also an important factor affecting the variations in sai with a median rc Œ¥e0 of 29 3 fig 6b the Œ¥e0 dominated the variations in sai at 46 stations which were mainly distributed in the basin 4 the changes in pd had a smaller impact on the variations in sai than Œ¥p and Œ¥e 0 with a median rc pd of 12 7 however it still regulated the variations in sai at six stations that were mainly distributed along the eastern edges of the basin 2 and basin 3 3 2 2 potential links between large scale circulation and sai fig 7 presents the results of the cross wavelet analysis between six ocean atmosphere circulation patterns and sai the results indicated that enso and iod exhibited the strongest relationship with sai fig 7c e specifically enso exhibited a statistically significant negative relationship with sai from 1970 to 1988 with a 3 to 6 year signal the iod exhibited a statistically significant negative relationship with sai from 1975 to 1987 with a 4 to 6 year signal and a positive relationship from 1992 to 1999 with a 1 to 3 year signal the pdo and easm also influenced the changes in sai the pdo exhibited a statistically significant positive relationship with sai from 1983 to 1987 with a 1 to 4 year signal and a negative association from 1990 to 1998 with a 1 to 3 year signal fig 7d the easm exhibited a statistically significant negative relationship with sai from 1981 to 1987 with a 2 to 5 year signal and a positive relationship from 1994 to 1999 with a 1 to 3 year signal however the relationship between ao nao and sai was comparatively weak with few significant signals fig 7a b the nao only exhibited a negative relationship with sai from 1978 to 1985 with a 4 to 5 year signal overall we found that the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns are the likely contributors to the changes in sai but their influence differed at the temporal scale 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other studies to highlight the regional characteristics of the climate seasonality in irb nwc we compared our results to those of some previous studies milly 1994 demonstrated that Œ¥p ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 in the eastern parts of the rocky mountains in the united states however our results demonstrated that Œ¥p ranged from 0 6 to 1 35 which was higher than that in the rocky mountains this could be because the hyper arid continental monsoon climate of northwestern china is characterized by low p but frequent extreme p chen et al 2014 resulting in a high Œ¥p using the mean t to represent the regional energy conditions berghuijs and woods 2016 investigated the pd between p and t regimes at a global scale and the approximate value of pd in irb nwc ranged from 1 to 1 month while the mean annual pd between p and e0 was 1 to 2 months in our study the differences between our results and those of berghuijs and woods 2016 are likely due to the effects of different indices the e0 calculated using the equation by priestley and taylor 1972 is the function of the solar radiation and t it considers the land atmosphere feedback and partitions the available energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes milly et al 2018 therefore e0 can represent the regional energy conditions more accurately than t 4 2 possible reasons for the spatial differences in climate seasonality the attribution analysis of changes in sai was conducted at the temporal scale following the elasticity method and its connection with ocean atmosphere circulation patterns was detected in previous sections here the possible reasons for the spatial differences in sai were discussed we found that the mean annual value of sai was highest in the central irb nwc and then decreased gradually towards the northwest and southeast fig 5 in the central irb nwc i e the lower tarim river ltr Œ¥p was higher 1 05 1 20 while Œ¥e0 was lower 0 9 1 05 figs 3 4 resulting in a large difference between the amplitude of the seasonal p and e0 and a higher sai located in the daxihaizi reservoir to lake taitema between the taklamakan and kuruk deserts the ltr was dominated by a hyper arid climate p generally appears in june to august but is rarely observed during other months yuan et al 2015 this severe uneven distribution of p would result in a higher Œ¥p in the ltr as the strong center of the sensible heat flux in western china and central asia the e0 in the ltr was high and strongly controlled by solar radiation zhou 2010 therefore the distribution of the intra annual e0 is relatively stable resulting in a lower Œ¥e0 in the northwestern and southeastern irb nwc the differences between the amplitudes of the seasonal p and e0 were still large due to the higher Œ¥p and lower Œ¥e0 while sai was lowest this may be because sai was also impacted by other surface characteristics for example two regions with the same climatic conditions and different topographies one is flat and the other is steep may exhibit different sai values however the mechanism by which topography influences sai is unclear and requires further work 4 3 possible mechanism for the impact of atmospheric circulation on climatic seasonality large scale atmospheric circulation patterns are among the potential contributors to the changes in the variations of sai in irb nwc it has been found that oceanic atmospheric circulation patterns significantly affect the seasonal p in the nwc chen et al 2017 li et al 2016 yang et al 2017 for example by controlling the time and strength of the summer monsoon onset enso exhibited a positive relationship with summer p during 1960 1973 1985 1991 and 2010 2013 in the nwc yang et al 2017 the sea surface t pattern was likely to have influenced winter p by modulating the nao during 1961 2013 yin and zhou 2018 furthermore recent studies demonstrated that summer t in nwc is also correlated with tropical sea surface t anomalies ding et al 2018 guo et al 2008 for example guo et al 2008 found that when ao is in a positive phase during winter the eurasian zonal circulation is stronger and t is higher in northwestern china t is the key input item of e0 therefore the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns also affected the seasonal variations in e0 by affecting t given the above the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns would influence the seasonal variations in p and e0 and finally affect the changes of sai however the effects of ao and nao on sai were weaker than those of the other four indices in this study which may be because their effects were offset by other circulation patterns a significant relationship between the atmospheric circulation patterns and sai could be consistently detected at 2 to 6 year scales throughout 1960 2017 in this study this result corresponded well with the results of liu et al 2016 who examined the periodic oscillations of dryness wetness conditions represented by the self calibrating palmer drought severity index pdsi and enso in nwc during 1960 2009 they observed a significant common wavelet power in the 2 6 year band between the pdsi and ni√±o 3 4 index the stable band of the relationship between the atmospheric circulation patterns and sai corresponded to the regional cyclic oscillations of p and t for example previous studies found that p exhibits a 2 3 year periodic change in nwc from 1951 to 1999 ma and shao 2006 wang and cui 2006 t exhibited a significant 3 6 year band from 1961 to 1999 fu et al 2008 therefore it can be inferred that the periodic oscillations of p and t may partly explain the stable band of the relationship between the atmospheric circulation patterns and sai however the relationship between atmospheric circulation pattern and sai is unstable during different periods therefore more detailed investigations based on the observed data and numerical simulations are still required to better understand their complicated interactions additionally irb nwc lies within a westerlies dominated climatic regime and its climatic conditions are very different from those in the eastern monsoon region huang et al 2015 therefore further studies comparing the interactions between atmospheric circulation patterns and sai in different regions are required 5 conclusion the irb nwc is recognized as a sensitive area to global climate change comprehensive studies on changes in climate seasonality in this region thus are beneficial for managing the local resources and adapting to future climate change based on meteorological data collected by 108 stations during 1960 2017 p and e 0 were used to represent the regional available water and energy respectively considering both the phase and amplitude mismatch between p and e 0 sai was used to analyze the characteristics of the mismatch between the regional available water and energy conditions i e climate seasonality in irb nwc during the past few decades furthermore the elasticity method was employed to attribute the long term changes in sai the correlations between oceanic atmospheric circulation patterns and sai were also explored by cross wavelet analysis the main conclusions are as follows the intra annual variations of p were highest in the basin 2 but lowest in the basin 3 in contrast the intra annual variations of e0 were highest in the basin 3 but lowest in the basin 2 the Œ¥p decreased significantly in the basin 1 basin 3 basin 4 and the whole irb nwc p 0 05 the Œ¥e0 also exhibited an insignificant decreasing trend in all basins p 0 05 the annual mean Œ¥p was low in the northwestern jrb and southeastern basin 3 it then increased gradually towards the center of the study area the annual mean Œ¥e0 exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern to Œ¥ p but its high and low values were opposite to those of Œ¥p the mean annual values of sai were lowest in the basin 2 but highest in the basin 4 the sai decreased significantly in the basin 2 basin 3 basin 4 and the whole irb nwc p 0 05 the highest annual mean sai was observed in the central irb nwc and then decreased gradually towards the northwest and southeast respectively the changes in Œ¥p controlled the variations in sai in the basin 1 basin 2 basin 3 and the whole irb nwc with rc Œ¥p of 47 4 42 4 54 6 and 43 7 respectively the changes in Œ¥e0 controlled the variations in sai in the basin 4 with a rc Œ¥e0 of 58 7 furthermore the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns are the likely contributors to the changes in sai but their influences differed from the temporal scale

5142,representing regional available water and energy conditions variations in precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e0 have received much attention in current studies on climate change however the changes in their mismatch i e climate seasonality have rarely been investigated considering the seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 respectively as well as their phase difference a climate seasonality and asynchrony index sai was used to analyze the seasonal distribution of the available water energy and their mismatch in the inland river basin of northwestern china irb nwc during 1960 2017 we found that the annual Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and sai all decreased during the past few decades indicating that the mismatch between the seasonal available water and energy in irb nwc has improved attribution analysis conducted by the elasticity method indicated that the changes in Œ¥p controlled the variations in sai throughout the area with a relative contribution of 43 7 furthermore wavelet analysis indicated that large scale ocean atmosphere circulation patterns including ei ni√±o southern oscillation indian ocean dipole pacific decadal oscillation and east asian summer monsoon were significantly linked with sai on 2 6 years scale our findings may provide valuable information regarding the trends and causes of climate seasonality and aid in predicting and mitigating the effects of potential future climate changes in the dry region keywords climate seasonality precipitation potential evapotranspiration climate elasticity 1 introduction depending on net radiation received by the land largely the potential evapotranspiration e0 is often used to represent the available energy that determining the rate of evapotranspiration budyko 1961 priestley and taylor 1972 furthermore precipitation p is often considered as the water supply that also controls regional evapotranspiration milly 1994 zhang et al 2001 the variations in e0 and p over the past few decades have received much attention in the current studies on climate change anabalon and sharma 2017 andrews et al 2010 however the mismatch conditions between the available water and energy i e climate seasonality have been ignored it has been found that climate seasonality has a significant imprint on hydrological processes berghuijs et al 2014 ning et al 2017 ecosystem productivity cardenas et al 2017 masese et al 2017 and agricultural production deryng et al 2011 xing et al 2018 for example many researchers have demonstrated that hydrological variables including streamflow and evapotranspiration have changed with variations in climate seasonality du et al 2016 xing et al 2018 yuan et al 2010 zeng and cai 2016 wood and aboveground net primary productivity are also driven by seasonal variations in p robinson et al 2013 wagner et al 2016 therefore analyzing the variations in the mismatch between seasonal available water and energy on a regional scale will benefit the development of national strategies for ecological and agricultural activities under a changing climate hallegatte 2009 osberghaus et al 2010 originally horn and bryson 1960 used sinusoidal functions to describe the tendency towards annual variations in the observed curve of p in the united states this method has since been widely used to study the seasonal amplitudes of the available water and energy hickel and zhang 2006 ning et al 2017 potter et al 2005 woods 2009 for example by using the sinusoidal function for the seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 milly 1994 mapped their spatial patterns in the eastern area of the rocky mountains similarly berghuijs and woods 2016 mapped the seasonal amplitude of p on a global scale to describe the mismatch between p and e0 milly 1994 and woods 2003 developed a dimensionless climate seasonality index considering the sinusoidal expressions of the seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 however mismatch only reflected the differences in the seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 subsequently berghuijs and woods 2016 explored the asynchrony of p and temperature t liu et al 2018a b then further improved the seasonality index by incorporating this asynchrony thus the mismatch expressed by this improved climate seasonality and asynchrony index sai not only considered the seasonal amplitude mismatch between p and e0 but also their phase difference the cause of the changes in climate seasonality is the other issue we cared although the above scholars have made great contributions to improve the expression of climate seasonality the mechanism influencing the mismatch between available water and energy has received little attention first adopted by mccuen 1974 the elasticity method has been widely used to analyze the variations in hydro meteorological variables such as e0 fu et al 2009 liu et al 2011 runoff gao et al 2016 ning et al 2016 and evapotranspiration liu et al 2018a b in recent years due to its simple formulation and high accuracy taking e0 as an example the contribution of meteorological variables including air temperature wind speed solar radiation and actual vapor pressure to the temporal changes in e0 was typically assessed by multiplying the long term trend of the variable by its partial derivative coefficient based on the penman monteith equation zheng et al 2009 in view of the similarity between sai and the above variables the elasticity method can be extended to quantify the contribution of the seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 to changes in sai moreover the ocean atmosphere circulation patterns including arctic oscillation ao north atlantic oscillation nao ei ni√±o southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo indian ocean dipole iod and the east asian summer monsoon easm may greatly influence sai since they are found to have impacts on seasonal variation of p otte et al 2017 ouyang et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 and e0 chai et al 2018 meza 2005 pravalie et al 2019 tabari et al 2014 specifically it has been found that ocean atmosphere circulation patterns not only influenced the shifts of peak in seasonal p lee et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 and t beniston and jungo 2002 yasunaka and hanawa 2005 but also controlled their intra annual extreme values drobinski et al 2016 liu et al 2018a b tong et al 2019 as such it is useful to investigate the potential connection between these large scale circulation patterns with the mismatch between p and e0 the inland river basin of northwestern china irb nwc is located in the innermost area of eurasia the long distance to the surrounding oceans means that it is difficult for marine vapor to reach this region shi et al 2007 furthermore the high mountains block atmospheric circulation which results in several large dry inland basins located in the rainshadow including the junggar basin basin 1 northern qilian mountain basins basin 2 qaidam basin basin 3 and tarim basin basin 4 fig 1 dominated by a typical temperate continental climate this region experiences long and cold winters hot and dry summers and short spring and autumn seasons kang et al 2007 this region is also one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change chen et al 2015 the rising average t in the arid areas of central asia will exceed 40 of the global average t rise under the current incremental co2 emissions adalgeirsdottir et al 2005 the meltwater water based system is also very fragile therefore there is still on going interest in detecting the possible changes in climatic variables over the irb nwc chen et al 2015 li et al 2016 liu and zhang 2013 however the variation in mismatch betweeb p and e 0 and its driving factors have not yet been examined in this region the main objectives of this study were thus to i present the temporal trends for seasonal amplitudes of p e0 and sai in irb nwc during 1960 2017 ii analyze the spatial distribution of the mean annual value and trends for the above three variables iii quantify the contributions of each factor to temporal changes in sai and iv explore the correlations between ocean atmosphere circulation patterns and sai 2 data and methods 2 1 data sources monthly meteorological data 1960 2017 collected at 108 stations including precipitation temperature sunshine hours and relative humidity were obtained from the china meteorological administration 10 of the data were missing at 23 of the stations which were interpolated from the adjacent stations following a regression based approach cross validation tests were conducted and indicated that the correlation coefficients between the series of original observed data and interpolated data all exceeded 0 8 ao nao enso pdo iod and easm were used to detect the potential links between large scale circulation and sai among them ao nao enso and pdo data were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration http www cpc ncep noaa gov iod and easm data were collected from the japan meteorological agency http ds data jma go jp tcc tcc products model index html and the website of jianping li http ljp lasg ac cn dct page 65540 respectively these six indices represent different large scale atmospheric circulation patterns and would have links with regional climatic variables despite their spatial coverage the interpretation of these indices can be found in some related studies gaughan et al 2016 gong et al 2001 thompson and wallace 2000 the annual series of these indices were normalized from the monthly data the whole study area was divided into four basins based on the drainage basin partition scheme in china zhang et al 2010 see fig 1 the mean e0 and p for each basin and whole study area were area weighted values based on weights from the thiessen polygon method chen et al 2019 rhynsburger 1973 the following analyses will be conducted for each basin 2 2 method the long term stationarity of p and e0 was first checked the sine function was used to fit the seasonal evolutions of p and e0 the sai was then obtained finally two attribution methods i e the elasticity method and cross wavelet analysis were used to detect the impact factors controlling the variations in sai the specific steps are presented in fig 2 a 2 2 1 stationarity and trend tests hydrological time series modeling typically assumes that the time series is stationary peel and bloeschl 2011 however owing to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes stationarity is no longer the default assumption milly et al 2008 therefore it is necessary to test the stationarity of p and e0 before modelling their seasonal variations here the augmented dickey fuller adf test dickey and fuller 1979 was used to examine the stationarity of the monthly p and e0 for the whole study area to obtain the coefficients of the model the ordinary least squares method was employed the significance coefficients were estimated by the t student statistic and compared with the corresponding critical value at the 95 confidence level if the t statistic exceeds the critical value the time series is stationary the test results shown in table 1 indicate that the time series of p and e0 are naturally stationary in this area p 0 05 thus they can be directly used for model simulation in the following analysis furthermore the non parametric mann kendall test mk kendall 1975 mann 1945 was used to determine the statistical significance of the trends of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and sai in each basin at the 95 confidence level 2 2 2 climate seasonality indices 1 seasonal amplitude of p and e0 originally milly 1994 assumed that the temporal variations in the seasonal p and e 0 can be expressed by the sine function in his work the origin of time t 0 was fixed in april in the northern hemisphere as a result the month with the maximum monthly p and e0 would be july however this peak phase will shift in some regions therefore the phase shifts of p and e0 sp and se0 were recently considered using the sine function berghuijs and woods 2016 liu et al 2018a b 1a p t p 1 Œ¥ p s i n 2 œÄ œÑ t s p 12 1b e 0 t e 0 1 Œ¥ e 0 s i n 2 œÄ œÑ t s e 0 12 where e0 was calculated by the method presented by priestley and taylor 1972 p t and e0 t are the monthly series of p and e0 respectively œÑ is the cycle of seasonality within one year outside the tropics the p and e 0 are mean monthly values of p and e0 for each year respectively the Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 are seasonal amplitudes of p and e0 respectively larger absolute values of Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 indicate larger seasonal amplitudes of the available water and energy milly 1994 woods 2003 to better understand the meanings of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 sp and se0 an example from the basin 1 based on the long term monthly p and e0 is given in fig 2b the irb nwc experiences a typical temperate continental climate therefore the phases of the seasonal p and e0 are consistent with that of solar radiation which suggested that the month with the maximum monthly p and e0 would appear between june and september mo et al 2019 correspondingly the origin of time t 0 would appear between march and june therefore the values of sp and se0 would range from 3 to 6 taking the time step for sp as 1 the linear regression between the series of p t p 1 and s i n 2 œÄ œÑ t s p 12 was calculated according to eq 1 the determination coefficient r2 of the regression equation was then calculated for different sp the sp with the highest r2 was considered as the fitted sp similarly the fitted se0 could also be obtained 2 climate seasonality index after obtaining the values of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 sp and se0 sai can be calculated as 2 sai Œ¥ p 2 2 Œ¥ p Œ¥ e 0 c o s 2 œÄ œÑ s p s e 0 12 Œ¥ e 0 2 1 2 where is the dryness index e 0 p sp se0 is the phase difference i e asynchrony between p and e0 hereafter denoted as pd sai was used to reflect the mismatch between the available water and energy if sai 0 there is no fluctuation in the mismatch between the seasonal p and e0 larger sai values indicate greater mismatch between the seasonal p and e0 2 2 3 attribution of climate seasonality change 1 elasticity method in this study the differences in the magnitude and phases of p and e0 jointly controlled the variations in the mismatch between the available water and energy therefore the effects of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and pd on sai were quantified following the elasticity method by multiplying the long term trend of the variable by its partial derivative coefficient based on eq 2 3a c Œ¥ p s a i Œ¥ p d Œ¥ p dt 3b c Œ¥ e 0 s a i Œ¥ e 0 d Œ¥ e 0 dt 3c c p d s a i p d dpd dt where s a i Œ¥ p s a i Œ¥ e 0 and s a i p d represent the partial derivatives of sai to Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and pd d Œ¥ p dt d Œ¥ e 0 dt and dpd dt are the temporal trends of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and pd respectively the relative contributions rc of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and pd can be determined as follows 4a r c Œ¥ p c Œ¥ p c Œ¥ p c Œ¥ e 0 c p d 100 4b r c Œ¥ e 0 c Œ¥ e 0 c Œ¥ p c Œ¥ e 0 c p d 100 4c r c p d c p d c Œ¥ p c Œ¥ e 0 c p d

variables xi et al 2018 based on cross spectrum analysis and wavelet transformation wu et al 2018 the cross magnitude and significant period between the time series can be determined vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 the details of the calculation procedure of the cwt method were described thoroughly in previous studies e g camilo restrepo et al 2019 in this study we employed this method to investigate the correlation between the ocean atmospheric circulation patterns and sai from 1960 to 2017 3 results 3 1 variations in climate seasonality 3 1 1 variations in the amplitudes of seasonal p and e0 the mean annual values of Œ¥p were highest in the basin 2 1 28 0 12 followed by basin 4 1 21 0 16 and lowest in the basin 1 and basin 3 0 74 0 12 and 0 71 0 03 respectively suggesting that the intra annual variations of p were highest in the basin 2but lowest in the basin 3 in contrast the intra annual variations in e0 were highest in the basin 3 1 36 0 08 but lowest in the basin 2 0 80 0 03 the Œ¥p was higher than Œ¥e0 in the basin 2 and basin 4 and lower than Œ¥e0 in the basin 1 and basin 3 for the whole irb nwc the mean annual values of Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 were 0 99 0 07 and 1 03 0 02 respectively these results implied that the variations in the seasonal available water were higher than those of the available energy in basin 2 and basin 4 while they were smaller than those of the available energy in the basin 1 basin 3 and the whole irb nwc the temporal variations in the regionally averaged annual amplitudes of the seasonal p and e0 for each basin and the whole irb nwc during 1960 2017 are shown in figs 3 4 trend analysis indicated that Œ¥p decreased in the basins 1 4 at rates of 0 03 0 005 0 006 and 0 02 decade respectively among these values the changes of Œ¥p in the basin 1 basin 3 and basin 4 were statistically significant p 0 05 the Œ¥e0 also decreased in the above four basins at rates of 0 004 0 002 0 005 and 0 002 decade respectively however not all of their variations were statistically significant p 0 05 for the whole irb nwc the Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 both decreased at rates of 0 015 and 0 003 decade respectively however only the trend of Œ¥p was statistically significant p 0 05 the spatial distribution patterns of Œ¥p and Œ¥e0 are also shown in figs 3 4 the annual mean Œ¥p was low in the northwestern of irb nwc with values of 0 60 0 75 and the southeastern with values of 0 75 0 90 the value then increased gradually towards the center of the study area the Œ¥p was high in the southwestern and eastern regions with values of 1 20 1 35 the annual mean Œ¥e0 exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern to Œ¥p however its high and low values were opposite to those of Œ¥p specifically the lowest annual mean Œ¥e0 was observed in the southwestern and eastern regions with values of 0 75 10 90 the Œ¥e0 was high in the southeastern of basin 3 with values of 1 35 1 50 during 1960 2017 the Œ¥p followed a decreasing trend at 47 7 of the stations but this trend only reached a significant level at 24 3 of the stations p 0 05 which were mainly distributed in the basin 1 and basin 3 there was no significant change trend of Œ¥p at the other stations p 0 05 the Œ¥ e0 exhibited decreasing trends at 72 9 of the stations which were significant in the basin 1 and basin 4 accounting for 29 0 of stations in contrast the increasing trends of Œ¥e0 were only significant for six stations 3 1 2 variations in the mismatch between the seasonal available water and energy sai was used to determine the mismatch between the seasonal available water and energy in irb nwc and its spatial and temporal trends are shown in fig 5 the mean annual values of sai were lowest in the basin 2 9 49 2 62 followed by the basin 3 and basin 1 12 97 5 70 and 14 53 5 34 respectively while the highest values were observed in the basin 4 22 16 10 34 suggesting that the mismatch between the seasonal available water and energy was smallest in the basin 2 but largest in the basin 4 trend analysis demonstrated that sai decreased in the basins 1 4 and the whole irb nwc at rates of 0 27 0 45 2 50 1 04 and 1 07 decade respectively excluding the basin 1 the decreasing trend of sai was statistically significant in all of the basins p 0 05 the decadal average values of sai were highest in the 1960 s and lowest in the 2010 s in the three basins and the whole irb nwc spatially the highest annual mean sai was observed in the central irb nwc with values of 50 160 it then decreased gradually towards the northwest and southeast 10 suggesting that the mismatch between the available water and energy tended to shrink along this direction the sai followed a downward trend at 76 6 of the weather stations however the trend was only significant for 24 3 of the stations which were mainly distributed in the basin 1 and basin 3 p 0 05 in contrast the sai increased at the remaining stations but the change trend was not significant p 0 05 3 2 attribution of the temporal changes in climate seasonality 3 2 1 contributions of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and pd to sai variation the contributions of each variable to the long term trend of the sai determined by equations 3 4 in four basins and the whole irb nwc are shown in table 2 the changes in Œ¥p controlled the variations in sai in the basin 1 basin 2 basin 3 and the whole irb nwc with relative contributions of 47 4 42 4 54 6 and 43 7 respectively the changes in Œ¥e0 controlled the variations in sai in the basin 4 with a relative contribution of 58 7 although the changes in pd did not dominate the variations in sai in the study area its contributions could not be ignored for example in the basin 3 its value was larger than that of Œ¥e0 the contributions of Œ¥p Œ¥e0 and pd were also estimated at all 108 stations as indicated by fig 6 c the changes in Œ¥p controlled the changes in sai at 55 of the 108 studied stations these Œ¥p regulated stations were mainly distributed in basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 fig 6a the rc Œ¥p ranged from 1 5 to 98 7 with a median value of 53 8 the changes in Œ¥e0 were also an important factor affecting the variations in sai with a median rc Œ¥e0 of 29 3 fig 6b the Œ¥e0 dominated the variations in sai at 46 stations which were mainly distributed in the basin 4 the changes in pd had a smaller impact on the variations in sai than Œ¥p and Œ¥e 0 with a median rc pd of 12 7 however it still regulated the variations in sai at six stations that were mainly distributed along the eastern edges of the basin 2 and basin 3 3 2 2 potential links between large scale circulation and sai fig 7 presents the results of the cross wavelet analysis between six ocean atmosphere circulation patterns and sai the results indicated that enso and iod exhibited the strongest relationship with sai fig 7c e specifically enso exhibited a statistically significant negative relationship with sai from 1970 to 1988 with a 3 to 6 year signal the iod exhibited a statistically significant negative relationship with sai from 1975 to 1987 with a 4 to 6 year signal and a positive relationship from 1992 to 1999 with a 1 to 3 year signal the pdo and easm also influenced the changes in sai the pdo exhibited a statistically significant positive relationship with sai from 1983 to 1987 with a 1 to 4 year signal and a negative association from 1990 to 1998 with a 1 to 3 year signal fig 7d the easm exhibited a statistically significant negative relationship with sai from 1981 to 1987 with a 2 to 5 year signal and a positive relationship from 1994 to 1999 with a 1 to 3 year signal however the relationship between ao nao and sai was comparatively weak with few significant signals fig 7a b the nao only exhibited a negative relationship with sai from 1978 to 1985 with a 4 to 5 year signal overall we found that the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns are the likely contributors to the changes in sai but their influence differed at the temporal scale 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other studies to highlight the regional characteristics of the climate seasonality in irb nwc we compared our results to those of some previous studies milly 1994 demonstrated that Œ¥p ranged from 0 0 to 0 6 in the eastern parts of the rocky mountains in the united states however our results demonstrated that Œ¥p ranged from 0 6 to 1 35 which was higher than that in the rocky mountains this could be because the hyper arid continental monsoon climate of northwestern china is characterized by low p but frequent extreme p chen et al 2014 resulting in a high Œ¥p using the mean t to represent the regional energy conditions berghuijs and woods 2016 investigated the pd between p and t regimes at a global scale and the approximate value of pd in irb nwc ranged from 1 to 1 month while the mean annual pd between p and e0 was 1 to 2 months in our study the differences between our results and those of berghuijs and woods 2016 are likely due to the effects of different indices the e0 calculated using the equation by priestley and taylor 1972 is the function of the solar radiation and t it considers the land atmosphere feedback and partitions the available energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes milly et al 2018 therefore e0 can represent the regional energy conditions more accurately than t 4 2 possible reasons for the spatial differences in climate seasonality the attribution analysis of changes in sai was conducted at the temporal scale following the elasticity method and its connection with ocean atmosphere circulation patterns was detected in previous sections here the possible reasons for the spatial differences in sai were discussed we found that the mean annual value of sai was highest in the central irb nwc and then decreased gradually towards the northwest and southeast fig 5 in the central irb nwc i e the lower tarim river ltr Œ¥p was higher 1 05 1 20 while Œ¥e0 was lower 0 9 1 05 figs 3 4 resulting in a large difference between the amplitude of the seasonal p and e0 and a higher sai located in the daxihaizi reservoir to lake taitema between the taklamakan and kuruk deserts the ltr was dominated by a hyper arid climate p generally appears in june to august but is rarely observed during other months yuan et al 2015 this severe uneven distribution of p would result in a higher Œ¥p in the ltr as the strong center of the sensible heat flux in western china and central asia the e0 in the ltr was high and strongly controlled by solar radiation zhou 2010 therefore the distribution of the intra annual e0 is relatively stable resulting in a lower Œ¥e0 in the northwestern and southeastern irb nwc the differences between the amplitudes of the seasonal p and e0 were still large due to the higher Œ¥p and lower Œ¥e0 while sai was lowest this may be because sai was also impacted by other surface characteristics for example two regions with the same climatic conditions and different topographies one is flat and the other is steep may exhibit different sai values however the mechanism by which topography influences sai is unclear and requires further work 4 3 possible mechanism for the impact of atmospheric circulation on climatic seasonality large scale atmospheric circulation patterns are among the potential contributors to the changes in the variations of sai in irb nwc it has been found that oceanic atmospheric circulation patterns significantly affect the seasonal p in the nwc chen et al 2017 li et al 2016 yang et al 2017 for example by controlling the time and strength of the summer monsoon onset enso exhibited a positive relationship with summer p during 1960 1973 1985 1991 and 2010 2013 in the nwc yang et al 2017 the sea surface t pattern was likely to have influenced winter p by modulating the nao during 1961 2013 yin and zhou 2018 furthermore recent studies demonstrated that summer t in nwc is also correlated with tropical sea surface t anomalies ding et al 2018 guo et al 2008 for example guo et al 2008 found that when ao is in a positive phase during winter the eurasian zonal circulation is stronger and t is higher in northwestern china t is the key input item of e0 therefore the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns also affected the seasonal variations in e0 by affecting t given the above the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns would influence the seasonal variations in p and e0 and finally affect the changes of sai however the effects of ao and nao on sai were weaker than those of the other four indices in this study which may be because their effects were offset by other circulation patterns a significant relationship between the atmospheric circulation patterns and sai could be consistently detected at 2 to 6 year scales throughout 1960 2017 in this study this result corresponded well with the results of liu et al 2016 who examined the periodic oscillations of dryness wetness conditions represented by the self calibrating palmer drought severity index pdsi and enso in nwc during 1960 2009 they observed a significant common wavelet power in the 2 6 year band between the pdsi and ni√±o 3 4 index the stable band of the relationship between the atmospheric circulation patterns and sai corresponded to the regional cyclic oscillations of p and t for example previous studies found that p exhibits a 2 3 year periodic change in nwc from 1951 to 1999 ma and shao 2006 wang and cui 2006 t exhibited a significant 3 6 year band from 1961 to 1999 fu et al 2008 therefore it can be inferred that the periodic oscillations of p and t may partly explain the stable band of the relationship between the atmospheric circulation patterns and sai however the relationship between atmospheric circulation pattern and sai is unstable during different periods therefore more detailed investigations based on the observed data and numerical simulations are still required to better understand their complicated interactions additionally irb nwc lies within a westerlies dominated climatic regime and its climatic conditions are very different from those in the eastern monsoon region huang et al 2015 therefore further studies comparing the interactions between atmospheric circulation patterns and sai in different regions are required 5 conclusion the irb nwc is recognized as a sensitive area to global climate change comprehensive studies on changes in climate seasonality in this region thus are beneficial for managing the local resources and adapting to future climate change based on meteorological data collected by 108 stations during 1960 2017 p and e 0 were used to represent the regional available water and energy respectively considering both the phase and amplitude mismatch between p and e 0 sai was used to analyze the characteristics of the mismatch between the regional available water and energy conditions i e climate seasonality in irb nwc during the past few decades furthermore the elasticity method was employed to attribute the long term changes in sai the correlations between oceanic atmospheric circulation patterns and sai were also explored by cross wavelet analysis the main conclusions are as follows the intra annual variations of p were highest in the basin 2 but lowest in the basin 3 in contrast the intra annual variations of e0 were highest in the basin 3 but lowest in the basin 2 the Œ¥p decreased significantly in the basin 1 basin 3 basin 4 and the whole irb nwc p 0 05 the Œ¥e0 also exhibited an insignificant decreasing trend in all basins p 0 05 the annual mean Œ¥p was low in the northwestern jrb and southeastern basin 3 it then increased gradually towards the center of the study area the annual mean Œ¥e0 exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern to Œ¥ p but its high and low values were opposite to those of Œ¥p the mean annual values of sai were lowest in the basin 2 but highest in the basin 4 the sai decreased significantly in the basin 2 basin 3 basin 4 and the whole irb nwc p 0 05 the highest annual mean sai was observed in the central irb nwc and then decreased gradually towards the northwest and southeast respectively the changes in Œ¥p controlled the variations in sai in the basin 1 basin 2 basin 3 and the whole irb nwc with rc Œ¥p of 47 4 42 4 54 6 and 43 7 respectively the changes in Œ¥e0 controlled the variations in sai in the basin 4 with a rc Œ¥e0 of 58 7 furthermore the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns are the likely contributors to the changes in sai but their influences differed from the temporal scale

5143,groundwater gw is the main source of domestic water supply in ethiopia 85 however despite widespread acknowledgement of its potential for resource based development and climate change adaptation the sector is still quite under investigated this is mainly due to the scarcity of in situ data which are essential to building robust impact models to address this we developed a fine resolution 500 m gw model using modflow nwt focusing on the gilgel abay catchment located in the upper blue nile basin fed with daily distributed input forcings of recharge and streamflow simulated by the coupled routing and excess storage crest hydrological model the model was calibrated against instantaneous observation records of gw table for 38 historical wells and validated at selected sites using time series data collected from the citizen science initiative pire csi and the innovation lab for small scale irrigation ilssi project an rmse of 14 4 m 1 8 of range was achieved for calibration and same for validation was 18 21 m and 15 76 m at the pire csi and ilssi sites respectively the findings of this research indicate substantial physical gw resource availability in the gilgel abay region moreover we expect the model to have multiscale future applications these include obtaining dynamically downscaled boundary conditions for a local scale gw model to be developed in the next phase of our research further an upscaled version of this model to encompass the entire tana basin would be developed to simulate lake aquifer interactions finally the approach of this research combining different types of datasets e g reanalysis products satellite data citizen science data etc is adaptable to other global data scarce regions moreover the method overcomes specific challenges associated to in situ data scarcity limited knowledge on gw resources availability in the area interaction with complex boundary conditions and sensitivity under meteorological boundary forcings

annual renewable freshwater sources can be considered a strategic resource for regional growth and development macdonald et al 2012 while this resource is among the most underutilized in the world africa s data poor areas provide less than 0 001 of all shallow groundwater records globally colchester et al 2017 the issue of underutilization of gw resources is further exacerbated by rapidly increasing and often competing demands from domestic industrial and agricultural sectors with regulatory and enforcement systems either weak or absent colchester et al 2017 doell et al 2014 fan et al 2013 ethiopia is often considered a water tower among all the african countries with an estimated surface water sw availability of 120 billion m3 and annual gw recharge of 36 billion m3 of which nearly 10 is exploitable haile and kasa 2015 kebede 2012 many believe that this seemingly high annual gw availability has the capacity to buffer vulnerability induced by climatic variability chebud and melesse 2009 and foster human development linked to the water food and energy nexus gaye and tindimugaya 2012 lack of detailed information and knowledge on the availability and sustainable use of gw resources however has constrained the country s integrated development initiatives with reports suggesting that the total irrigation proportions being less than 5 of the countries irrigable lands haile and kasa 2015 this is affecting the country s water and food security as 85 of its population depend on agriculture haile and kasa 2015 in ethiopia the blue nile basin bnb also known as the abay basin exhibits substantial seasonal variation in rainfall resulting in more than 80 of the flows occurring during the wet season july to october this leaves less flow in the dry season february to may which may be further affected by climatic variabilities awulachew et al 2008 mccartney and girma 2012 these seasonal fluctuations often limit the availability of sw in the dry season for irrigation this is why investigating the development of gw resources during that period is essential especially because the dry season dependence of gw in the tana basin an important sub basin of the bnb is increasing abiy et al 2016 asrie and sebhat 2016 kebede et al 2006 legesse et al 2004 in the tana basin the potable water needs of about two million people are met by gw sources however the use of this resource for irrigation is still not much practiced chebud and melesse 2009 moreover despite the major importance of the tana basin where the outflow contributes about 8 of the upper blue nile flow conway 1997 haile et al 2009 its hydrogeological characteristics are not well understood or mapped at a larger scale kebede et al 2006 these limitations have historically caused resource mismanagement evidenced by an event which recorded the failure of 20 borehole drilling attempts close to lake tana at bahir dar asfaw 2003 based on the above more research and fostering of knowledge are clearly needed previously studies related to water resource management in the blue nile area and the tana basin have focused on developing hydrological models bceom 1999 conway 1997 guariso and

resource development in the lake tana area by considering climate change and different hydropower irrigation development scenarios while kebede et al 2006 analyzed the sensitivity of water balance in lake tana with respect to fluctuations in rainfall over the upper blue nile some studies have also highlighted the application of gw modeling as a tool for strategizing optimal water management

area during each cropping season could irrigate about 10 000 ha asrie and sebhat 2016 provided a comprehensive understanding of a portion of lake tana s subsurface system its impacts on gw and its response to different plausible natural and anthropogenic stresses by analyzing different contemporary scenarios including reservoir drying recharge alteration and water withdrawal abiy et al 2016 highlighted the significance of the four major rivers gilgel abay gumera ribb and megech in year round gw recharge in the tana basin all such research the modeling studies and others have highlighted the data scarcity issues in africa the societal linkages of resource functions dynamism use and challenges associated with portraying impacts of individual water withdrawals at regional scale and has led to an understanding that robust gw models for monitoring and management initiatives are needed asrie and sebhat 2016 colchester et al 2017 massuel et al 2017 smec 2008 this motivated us to develop and calibrate a regional gw model in the upper blue nile by specifically focusing on the tana basin area more specifically we developed a modular 3 d finite difference modflow model with nwt solver modflow nwt forced with daily distributed hydrological variables gw recharge and streamflow simulated by the coupled routing and excess storage crest hydrological model the modflow nwt program harbaugh 2005 employs a finite difference based method for solving the 3 d transient gw flow equation lazin et al 2020 has shown fair agreement of crest streamflow variability with respect to the

data scarcity limited gw knowledge lake contributions and forcing uncertainty effects among others asfaw 2003 kebede et al 2005 in data scarce regions there are studies establishing physically based sw budget models n√§schen et al 2018 tegegne et al 2017 research also focused on assessing gw resources through fully fledged sw gw coupling ireson et al 2006 improved conceptual models candela et al 2014 or advanced mathematical optimization pande et al 2012 the use of sw gw coupled models has been investigated in different parts of the world gamvroudis et al 2017 guzman et al 2015 maxwell et al 2015 maxwell and miller 2005 sutanudjaja et al 2011 trichakis et al 2017 however the idea of one way coupling with detailed and distributed simulated streamflow and recharge outputs to drive a physically based transient gw model validated with citizen science data for partially complementing in situ data scarcity brings substantial scientific merit to this study citizen science the process to ensure public participation in research design data collection and interpretation together with scientists has proven to be promising for data scarce regions buytaert et al 2014 more specifically the scientific contributions of this research are the following a use of simulated variables from a distributed hyper resolution hydrological model to derive some of the necessary boundary conditions

in the region 2 methodology and data 2 1 research framework the integrated modeling approach applied in this study takes the outputs of the crest model simulation recharge and streamflow as inputs to modflow nwt to develop a transient gw model specifically we partially address the in situ data scarcity by forcing the gw model with 39 years 1979 2018 of daily recharge and streamflow data simulated

tana is the source of the blue nile river and is a freshwater shallow and oligotrophic lake with weak seasonal stratification wood and talling 1988 gilgel abay ribb gumera and megech contribute more than 93 of the lake inflow abiy et al 2016 at least seven irrigation schemes with an annual water demand greater than 600 million m3 have been proposed within the tana basin in the past decade bceom 1999 kebede et al 2006 among these the koga irrigation and watershed management project falls within our model domain the project was designed to irrigate 7000 ha of command area by means of a water storage reservoir a dam and a detailed system of irrigation canals lijalem 2018 most extensive use of gw pumping in the area is for drinking and domestic purposes while use of this resource for irrigation is very limited kebede 2012 the gilgel abay catchment is in the basaltic plateau of the northwestern part of the ethiopian highlands and includes west gojam and awi two administrative zones of the amhara region fig 2 there are three major geological landforms in the area e g the alluvial deposits along the lake tana and river floodplains and the tertiary and quaternary volcanic basalt sequences kebede 2012 setegn et al 2010 a detailed description on the hydrogeology and the conceptual model development is provided in section 2 4 2 1 while designing the model spatial domain we extended the domain up to the southern periphery of lake tana in order to provide the model with a known downstream boundary specifically the area was bounded between latitudes of 10 950n to 11 890n and longitudes of 36 730e to 37 410e encompassing an area of 4622 km2 the topography of the model domain varied significantly decreasing from about 3449 m on the south to around 1736 m on the north yamazaki et al 2017 this relatively large range in elevation created an additional challenge for the subsurface hydrological modeling tasks as the regional scale of the model often made it difficult to capture the large hydraulic head variability within the model domain fig 2 shows the geographical extent of the model domain the gilgel abay catchment the lake tana basin and the topographic elevations the figure also shows the 38 historical wells locations used for model calibration and the streamflow validation site in the gilgel abay river 2 3 data description the study domain topography and detailed river network were generated from the 90 m dem yamazaki et al 2017 we collected other land and water features for example the lake tana the tana basin geological regions and fault line locations by reviewing available research kebede 2012 and from the digitized gis based information available from the abay basin authority aba bahir dar university bu and the ministry of water irrigation and energy ethiopia information on hydrogeology and aquifers are conceptualized based on literature review hautot et al 2006 kebede 2012 and is discussed in detail in section 2 4 2 1 the gw model was forced with 39 years 1979 2018 of daily recharge and streamflow data simulated by crest lazin et al 2020 the daily crest outputs were aggregated into monthly values to feed the gw

2018 we used the nasa imerg satellite based precipitation dataset huffman et al 2015 and noaa global data assimilation system gdas kleist et al 2009 for the remaining meteorological variables to keep consistency with the historic simulation 1979 2014 the meteorological variables from gdas and precipitation from imerg were temporally aggregated to 3 hourly from their original resolution hourly and half hourly respectively while keeping the original spatial resolution the original gdas forcing variables have a 0 20 spatial resolution from january 1st 2015 to january 13th 2015 and 0 11 spatial resolution from january 14th 2015 onward the imerg data is at 0 1 spatial resolution records from a total of 38 spatially distributed wells from 2013 to 2017 obtained from abbay basin authority aba were used primarily for the gw model calibration the data represented instantaneous no time series measurements of gw depth which were converted into hydraulic heads h the data also included borehole logs which were used to guide the vertical discretization of the model at two study sites koga irrigated site located in kudmi kebele and branti rainfed site located in dangishta kebele a number of shallow gw wells were monitored at weekly intervals from june 2017 to august 2018 as part of a citizen science initiative csi led by the university of connecticut uconn and bahir dar university bu dokou et al 2018 the csi data is collected by locally trained high school students and farmers and then verified by faculty experts from bu the process of data collection by local citizens has often proved to be useful for resource monitoring and also community empowerment walker et al 2016 in addition gw depth records for 36 wells in dangishta from january 2015 to december 17 were used that were collected as part of the ilssi project we also obtained monthly water levels at lake tana january 1979 december 2005 and the koga reservoir july 2012 february 2018 from the aba in may 2018 the research team carried out a weeklong field investigation at the study sites which helped developing approximations related to the river morphological properties such as river width and river depth 2 4 model setting 2 4 1 hydrologic model overview the one way model coupling based approach adopted in the study takes the simulated results of crest model specifically designed to perform energy and water balance based advanced hydrological simulations in the upper bnb as inputs to the gw model crest contains a computationally efficient fully distributed routing module shen et al 2016 that can run large basin simulations at fine spatiotemporal resolution 30 m to 1 km spatial grid resolution and hourly time steps over long periods 30 years for this research crest soil vegetation atmosphere and snow crest svas shen and anagnostou 2017 the latest version of crest was simulated at 500 m spatial resolution lazin et al 2020 crest svas includes a runoff generation module that solves for the coupled water and energy balances using a set of input dynamic variables comprising seven meteorological variables precipitation air temperature air pressure longwave and shortwave radiation specific humidity wind speed and leaf area index lai as well as a few static parameters such as land cover soil properties vegetation species descriptions and impervious ratios shen and anagnostou 2017 we used the two major outputs of the crest model that is the streamflow q and infiltration rate i which was later processed into the recharge rate r as inputs to force the gw model 2 4 2 groundwater model development 2 4 2 1 conceptual model the lake tana basin comprises of four major aquifers starting from the bottom the mesozoic sedimentary aquifer scoraceous tertiary basalt quaternary basalt sequence or volcanic basalt and the alluvial aquifer with lacustrine sediments kebede 2012 nigate et al 2016 the gilgel abay area has a predominance of quaternary or volcanic basalt sequence which provides some of the highest yielding shallow aquifers in lake tana basin kebede 2012 nigate et al 2016 groundwater flow is mainly controlled by regional tectonics associated with the formation of the lake tana graben itself the alluvial aquifer is recharged from lateral groundwater inflows from the volcanic aquifers from the upper catchments and by rainfall the aquifer discharges to lake tana and to evapotranspiration from the wetlands the volcanic aquifer of quaternary vesicular basalt is recharged from rainfall and most of its water later discharges to springs wetlands streams and directly to the southern sector of lake tana kebede 2012 nigate et al 2016 the tertiary scoraceous basaltic aquifer is also recharged from rainfall and principally discharges to springs and streams fig 3 recharge in the area varies from nearly 0 to 300 mm yr kebede 2012 nearly 60 of aquifers receive indirect recharge from floods mountain runoff as well as fast recharge from high rainfall events diffuse recharge is limited to the plateau region which accounts for around 30 of the country kebede 2012 the alluvial aquifer is not continuously spread throughout the entire gilgel abay catchment found in the river and lake tana flood plains only nor is the quaternary basalt sequence comprises the central and south central areas of the model domain nigate et al 2016 this complexity was avoided while adding the vertical discretization into the numerical model modflow nwt where we considered two aquifers i e one basalt aquifer on top which combines the alluvial quaternary and tertiary aquifers and one sedimentary aquifer at the bottom which represents the mesozoic sediment deposition fig 3 shows the conceptual model developed in this study highlighting the two aquifer s limiting surfaces and the major hydrological processes the stratigraphic assembly considered in this model is consistent with the resistivity model developed by hautot et al 2006 which inferred a consistent nw se trending sedimentary basin of about 1 5 2 km thick beneath the basaltic lava flow which spreads as deep as 250 m in some areas fig 3 in order to estimate the actual depth of the basalt layer layer 1 in the model we checked the maximum borehole depths of the 38 historical wells fig 3 shows the 3d locations of these drillings typically the depths drilled in this formation varied from 50 to 120 m with all reporting mostly basaltic stratigraphy we performed a kriging interpolation oliver 1990 with the maximum borehole drill depths and obtained the bottom of the top model layer with depths ranging from 50 to 200 m the bottom of the sedimentary aquifer which also marks the lower vertical bound of the model domain was assumed as a flat surface with 1400 masl elevation 2 4 2 2 numerical model a newton raphson formulation for unconfined subsurface flow condition was applied using the modflow nwt program the model was simulated in transient conditions from january 1979 through february 2018 470 stress periods the first 12 months of simulation results were often omitted in some of the gw analysis presented in this research considering the time the model may need to produce stable results the model comprised two vertical layers aquifers both were specified as convertible in the model however during the simulation the bottom aquifer was always confined and the top aquifer unconfined the horizontal spatial resolution of the gw model was 500 m generating 208 rows and 147 columns of model cells in each vertical layer to create the input files for the model we first used the usgs open source gui model muse version 3 10 winston and goode 2017 afterwards we used flopy version 3 2 10 an open source python api bakker et al 2016 to update the input parameters during model simulations which include calibration validation and sensitivity analysis 2 4 2 3 initial and boundary conditions we derived the initial condition of the model from a steady state simulated h profile during the steady state simulation the upstream end of the model was fixed in accordance with the historical gw levels from bceom 1999 so as to produce an h profile that has realistic hydraulic head distribution and could therefore be considered a valid model solution this is an important requirement for specifying initial conditions to improve model accuracy reilly and harbaugh 2004 the use of steady state simulated initial conditions for transient model simulations is common modelling technique adopted in large scale numerical simulations bagtzoglou 2003a 2003b franke et al 1987 reilly and harbaugh 2004 additionally we estimated the time constant defined by domenico and schwartz 1998 as approximately 3 2 years which is less compared to our transient model simulation time of 39 years the effect of any transient condition will not be observable if the time after the condition occurs is significantly larger than the time constant for the aquifer t domenico and schwartz 1998 reilly and harbaugh 2004 this justifies that the effects of the initial condition we selected for the model would not introduce any significant bias in the model results reilly and harbaugh 2004 we considered dirichlet boundary condition type i in the downstream end of the model where it meets the lake tana and where the model domain cuts across the koga reservoir we used the time variant specified head chd package to specify observed water levels from lake tana 1979 current and the koga reservoir july 2012 current along the other boundaries where time series h is not known we used the neuman boundary type ii to specify gw flux in order to accurately portray the flux boundaries we started with historical gw contour map developed by bceom 1999 and assigned no flow conditions where h contour lines are nearly perpendicular to the model boundaries in the boundaries where no flow conditions could not be established we assumed hypothetical lateral gw flux values q which are again consistent with the bceom 1999 reported h gradients the flow and head boundary fhb package was used for this while the recharge rch package was used to specify recharge r as vertical flux we adjusted the q values during the calibration process and eventually sustained them for the entire model simulation time 470 stress periods last we used mixed boundary conditions type iii to specify crest simulated streamflow q with the stream str package in addition there are some dykes and faults shown in fig 2 in the region the structures are found in the deep basal sequences with a varying width from a few centimeters to 6 m kebede 2012 it is reported in many studies that faults and dyke based structures may act as preferential pathways or conduits for gw flow especially in the saturated zone aydin 2000 bagtzoglou and cesano 2007a 2007b caine et al 1996 kebede 2012 ochoa gonz√°lez et al 2015 papadopoulou et al 2010 in their study used the drainage package to effectively simulate the hydraulic behavior of faults based on that work we also used the drain return drt package to represent the faults into the model as linear structures which would allow mostly discharge as conduits from the aquifers but also allow a fraction of the water to enter the gw system as recharge and maintain sub surface water budget the vertical locations of the faults were specified only in the bottom aquifer fig 2 showed the location of faults and dykes we also used the well package wel to assign a constant gw pumping of 40 l s in the 38 wells from their drilling period to the end of simulation 2013 2018 this average pumping rate was approximated based on the design yield data obtained from aba all the boundary conditions and packages used in the model are summarized in table 1 2 4 3 model evaluation framework 2 4 3 1 calibration validation and sensitivity the gw model was calibrated using a trial and error based approach with the objective of minimizing the root mean squared error rmse between simulated heads in the top aquifer and observed heads from 38 historical wells all of which are shallow wells located in the top aquifer hydraulic conductivity k unit streambed conductance Œ∂ recharge infiltration ratio œï r i and specific yield s y were considered as major calibration parameters based on literature support asrie and sebhat 2016 guzman et al 2015 with k Œ∂ and s y being spatially varying and œÜ r i being spatiotemporally constant the recharge infiltration ratio œï r i has been defined in this study as the percentage of infiltration that contributes to recharge in addition we also adjusted some other parameters during model calibration i e the s s values which influenced the h variations within the confined aquifer bottom and the hypothetical flux q values reviewing available literature on k transmissivity values ayenew et al 2008 kebede 2012 mengistu 2010 smec 2008 walker et al 2019 s y and s s jones 1985 walker et al 2019 in the gilgel abay region we started with initial k values horizontal of 1 m d for top aquifer and 0 5 m d for bottom aquifer and initial s y top unconfined aquifer and s s bottom confined aquifer values of 0 02 and 10 4 m 1 respectively for the other major calibration parameters feasible initial values were similarly hypothesized the initial Œ∂ value was 0 1 m d and for œï r i was 10 of infiltration coming from crest following calibration the model was validated independently against the csi and ilssi datasets moreover sensitivity analysis was performed with the four major calibration parameters k Œ∂ œï r i and s y by assigning parameter multipliers to the optimal calibration parameters and running new simulations the parameter multipliers ranged from 0 05 to 20 for k and s y 0 05 to 10 for Œ∂ and 0 05 to 2 5 for œï r i as for the last two cases the model failed to converge for larger parameter multipliers 2 4 3 2 statistical metrics during model evaluation we derived and analyzed a number of statistical error metrics in addition to the rmse we evaluated the systematic and random error components in the model by calculating the mean relative error mre and the normalized centered root mean squared error ncrmse bhuiyan et al 2019 2018 both were normalized against the mean observation set using eqs 5 and 6 here h i is the reference hydraulic head and h i is the modeled hydraulic head 5 mre 1 n i 1 n h i h i h i 6 ncrmse 1 n i 1 n h i h i 1 n i 1 n h i h i 2 1 n i 1 n h i to further evaluate the gilgel abay gw model we compared the results against two coarse resolution 0 25 nasa land surface models lms by arsenault et al 2020 and a fine resolution 1 km global model developed by fan et al 2013 the nasa lsms are regional applications of global models developed as part of the forecasting for africa and the middle east fame project arsenault et al 2020 shukla et al 2020 the aim of which was to develop a seasonal water deficit forecasting system relevant to usaid and usace activities in the middle east and africa based on existing nasa and noaa earth science capabilities mcnally et al 2017 2 2 fame was carried out within nasa funded program predicting middle eastern and african seasonal water deficits using nasa data and models https appliedsciences nasa gov content 13 water13 0010 the fine resolution model by fan et al 2013 presented global observations of water table depth compiled from government archives and literature fills in data gaps and infers patterns and processes using a gw model forced by modern climate terrain and sea level furthermore a correlation pentagon is developed and proposed in this study to underscore the correlation of the simulated h variables with some of the major drivers of the model since one of the fundamental novelties of this study was associated with the one way coupling of feeding the gw model with the crest simulated forcing variables q and r to compensate for the in situ data scarcity issues we also investigated how any plausible crest simulation error would affect the gw model for this we assigned different percentages relative errors 10 up to 50 to the forcing variables q and r and in order to keep the water balance when each q was reduced r was increased by the same amount the bound 10 50 is chosen considering crest s better performance in the region lazin et al 2020 where an error more than 50 is unlikely 3 results 3 1 gw model evaluation 3 1 1 optimal calibration parameters fig 4 shows the optimal distributed calibration parameters k s y Œ∂ head and flow boundary conditions along with the calibrated hypothetical flux values q the figure also shows the annual average distributed infiltration simulated by crest a portion of which is used as recharge in the gw model œÜ r i the optimal k covered a wide range of values for different regions driven by the variations in geological settings shown in fig 3 for most of the termaber basaltic regions in the top aquifer horizontal k values were low 0 1 0 5 m d while at alluvial formations it was significantly higher guided by reported parameter value ranges in the literature ayenew et al 2008 kebede 2012 mengistu 2010 walker et al 2019 the optimal s y was found to be spatially distributed from 0 05 to 0 12 in the top unconfined aquifer with spatial variability similar to the k zoning for the bottom aquifer the optimal specific storage value was s s 10 7 m 1 the range of optimal s y was low which indicates the basalt dominated phenomenon in the region and is also reasonable in comparison to literature in similar areas jones 1985 walker et al 2019 the optimal values for Œ∂ ranged from 0 05 to 1 d 1 fig 4 with higher values indicating increased stream leakage the optimal value of œÜ r i was reached at 40 which indicates that 40 of net infiltration was assigned in the form of recharge or deep gw percolation moreover the optimal hypothetical boundary flux q values were found as 1 3 m d during dry season 2 67 6 m d during wet season table 2 summarizes the optimal calibration parameters and fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of k s y Œ∂ and q values 3 1 2 calibration and validation results the calibration and validation results are provided in fig 5 fig 5 a indicates a good agreement rmse of 14 4 m with an r2 of 0 99 and p 0 0001 of simulated heads against the 38 observations instantaneous data for 2013 2017 fig 5 b shows validation in the citizen science wells in kudmi sep 17 aug 18 and dangishta jun 17 aug 18 and fig 5 c shows validation in the ilssi wells in dangishta jan 15 dec 17 fig 6 shows the time series of mean and the standard deviations sd taken from all samples for observed wells and simulated grids encompassing those wells h values in koga kudmi and branti dangishta in most cases the mean simulated h values were within the 1 sd bounds of the observations 3 1 3 spatial distribution of bias fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the bias red overestimation blue underestimation of simulated heads with respect to the observations here at 31 of the total 38 locations the bias was found within 15 m the model substantially overestimated at a few locations close to the boundaries in the southeast and west central areas of the domain this could have been due to failure to successfully approximate the boundary conditions that prevailed in those locations these observations as well as some other relatively larger bias incidents occurring at locations closer to the western boundary were consistently opposing changes for improvements throughout the model calibration efforts this indicates it might well be a representation of a local effect that cannot be improved at our spatiotemporal modeling scale 500 m and monthly resolution 3 2 sensitivity analysis comparisons of sensitivity analysis for different calibration parameters indicate the optimal values obtained through trial and error calibration are indeed the best fit in terms of incurring the least rmse with the closest estimation marked with the least sd fig 8 as evidenced by the discussion presented above the order of sensitivity for the calibration parameters from highest to lowest were exhibited by k high sensitivity œÜ r i moderate sensitivity Œ∂ low sensitivity and s y very low sensitivity respectively this supported the calibration efforts in emphasizing distributed characteristics for all the parameters except s y during calibration k was given the most importance which was reflected by the creation of 33 different zones allowing spatial heterogeneity to be captured the values of optimal Œ∂ were also distributed into different categories the œÜ r i value was constant but the recharge variable itself inherited distributed estimates provided by the crest simulated infiltration and varied throughout the model domain only the s y parameter was truly static throughout and considering its very low sensitivity the rationale for such a selection could be affirmed 3 3 spatiotemporal variability of hydraulic heads the spatial variability of hydraulic head h in the top unconfined aquifer is shown in fig 9 fig 9 a shows the gw contours in a representative normal dry year april 2014 before the jjas precipitation onset following the precipitation the gw table rises to its maximum in september october the figure specifically highlights the contributions to the regional gw flow of lateral fluxes flowing from the model upstream southern hilly regions to the model downstream northern region bounded by lake tana capturing well the physical dynamics prominent in the region kebede 2012 furthermore along some major rivers the contours are concave indicating a dip of h when they meet the rivers for closer examination of the seasonal fluctuations fig 9 b presents four time series plots showing the temporal variability of h at four different locations e g 1 2 3 and 4 3 4 subsurface water budget fig 10 shows several major subsurface water budget components the rates of net storage net recharge net stream leakage and drainage through the faults all the water budget components showcased the seasonal cycles the net storage rates always fluctuated indicating losses and gains of water from and into the gw storage occurred each year driven primarily by the seasonal cycles of hydrological forcing variables the net recharge values considered in our study averaged 0 7 mm d or about 255 mm year these net recharge rates are the distributed flux values reaching the groundwater system through percolation harbaugh 2005 and these estimates are consistent with the ranges recharge rates reported by other studies in ethiopia enku et al 2016 kebede et al 2005 mechal et al 2015 tilahun et al 2020 walraevens et al 2015 2009 the drought year of 2015 accounted for a substantial drop in recharge values the mean net stream leakage amount we obtained was about 61 amounting to about 153 mm year of the mean annual recharge which agreed with some other studies addressing similar ratios of stream leakage and recharge abiy et al 2016 kebede 2012 setegn et al 2010 the leakage values shown in fig 10 c indicate the difference of flow going out from aquifers into streams with the flow coming into the aquifers from streams harbaugh 2005 niswonger and prudic 2005 the positive values indicate that the aquifers were always feeding the streams during the simulations although the drainage through the faults experienced temporal variability similar to that of the stream leakage the magnitude was less than expected nevertheless the fault lines and their inclusion as drains helped the model achieve a better fit with the observations 3 5 comparison with global models for direct comparison to the outputs of two nasa global scale land surface models lsms noah mp and clsm arsenault et al 2020 and the fine resolution 1 km model developed by fan et al 2013 we converted the gilgel abay model s estimated h values into gw table depths by subtracting from the model resampled topography the global scale nasa models come at a coarse spatial resolution of 0 25 and hence at the expense of finer details noah mp is based on grid based land surface simulations while the clsm s basic computational units are hydrological basins the clsm does not explicitly simulate the water table but derives the gw storage from the basin deficit and the maximum water capacity of each basin the mean and the variability of data captured by our regional model the fan et al 2013 model and the two global nasa models are shown in fig 11 from the figure it may be inferred that the gilgel abay and the fan et al 2013 models provide a better understanding of the seasonal cycles while addressing the gw table fluctuations compared to the nasa models the mean gw table depths from gilgel abay model is much higher and comes close to fan et al 2013 3 6 driver correlation and error uncertainty propagation the correlation pentagon we developed for our model for these purposes is presented in fig 12 a here i was the location index and j is the time index in months among the drivers used in the correlation pentagon were monthly precipitation p i j and monthly recharge r i j which are spatiotemporally distributed parameters compared against the spatiotemporally distributed h monthly streamflow q j and monthly boundary flux q j are two other drivers treated as basin averaged quantities compared against basin averaged h the final driver elevation e i only varied over space during this comparison with e i values of h were temporally averaged at each location i fig 12 a shows the highest correlation coefficient of 0 816 for h with e i the other drivers have a lower yet similar correlation only with a time lag of one month for p i j and q j this implies that simulated h i j was likely to be more influenced by the forcing of p i j 1 that is the precipitation forcing of the previous month fig 12 b highlights the probabilistic estimates of systematic and random error propagation during the model coupling errors are calculated with the calibrated gw model s simulated h values as reference the values labelled above each bar are error metrics normalized with the calibrated model s mre and ncrmse as referenceswith increase in error percentages imposed in the model s forcing variables the amount of systematic and random errors always increased revealing the gw model s substantial sensitivity to errors which might have already existed in its forcing datasets the calibrated model had a mre of 0 0058 mr e reference and ncrmse of 0 0075 ncrms e reference against the 38 observation wells discussed in section 3 3 1 interestingly almost all the sequential mre values obtained in fig 12 b were found to be below the mr e reference with the exception of the 50 error case further we found all the sequential ncrmse values to be below the ncrms e reference 4 discussion and study limitations the results from this study indicated the physical availability of regional gw resources the region is often highlighted as the highest gw yield regions within the upper bnb mengistu et al 2019 this resource can be further explored and potentially utilized specifically for meeting dry season irrigation water demands the regional gilgel abay gw model developed in this study was able to exhibit satisfactory calibration and validation metrics especially considering the manifold scientific challenges that impaired the process table 3 shows the performances of some other gw models developed in the lake tana region asrie and sebhat 2016 chebud and melesse 2009 mengistu 2010 as well as some other sw gw models in different regions maxwell et al 2015 trichakis et al 2017 we obtained the rmse for calibration as 14 4 m which was about 1 8 of the h ranges on a pragmatic context this is still a large estimate however considering the regional scale of the model in situ data scarcity and the nature of lower accuracies typically observed in sw gw coupled models maxwell et al 2015 trichakis et al 2017 the results are acceptable the validation result inferred rmse of 18 21 m for the csi observations and 15 76 m for ilssi records the mre and ncrmse values of the calibrated gw model were computed as 0 0058 and 0 0075 respectively p 0 0001 both of which indicated the model was able to produce a reasonably strong fit with the observations it was found that our regional model captured a higher variability compared to the nasa global models which may be due to the model s ability to simulate deeper gw levels in contrast to the lsms which typically capture the dynamics of shallow aquifers only resulting in lower simulated depths to gw than in the fine resolution models furthermore the records from historical well observations also revealed locations where deeper gw tables were indeed reported this agrees well with the findings of the regional model we also found the major water budget estimates and the spatiotemporal profiles of h to be consistent with other literature findings the results provided in fig 9 b and 10 indicate that the model was able to capture the effects of the recent hydrological drought occurring in 2015 the discussions presented along with the correlation pentagon highlight that the model is more highly correlated with the hydrogeologically static driver elevation than the dynamic drivers hydrological forcing variables this may be supported by the consistent range of simulated h with the static variable e and also attributed to the error propagation during model coupling which is associated to the dynamic drivers hydrological forcing variables error propagation analysis underscores that the bias in forcing datasets contributes to both systematic and random errors but at a scale that is less than the reference errors i e the error against observations the discussion of error propagation stressed the importance of having accurate representations of streamflow and recharge data for gw models the gw modeling efforts carried out in this study have the potential to develop spatiotemporal estimates of subsurface water resources at regional scales this study was subject to a number of limitations that challenged the scientific efforts in general scarcity of in situ data in the gilgel abay region was a major limitation to address it we adopted this one way coupled approach although it is evidently prone to modeling uncertainties and deployed the citizen science initiative for data collection during model validation it was found that the model has limitations in capturing spatial variations which are driven by changes at local scale the temporal variability of simulated h obtained at the wells in dangishta pire csi data for example seemed similar while in reality the wells located in the alluvial regions were significantly more biased than those in basaltic regions these kinds of locally significant realities could not be captured by the model because of its reginal nature these limitations may be addressed through development of local scale gw models in the area where this regional model results could offer significant options to extract and downscale head boundaries the sensitivity analysis justifies the selection of calibration parameters and their optimal values however the analyses did not include spatial change of the parameters which is likely to have an impact another possible limitation of the model is its strong emphasis on physically based dynamics which does not consider detailed anthropogenic disturbances the irrigation schemes within the area affect the gw recharge however not enough information is available at regional scale to enable us to incorporate these irrigation practices into our regional gw model we also used simplified approximations to include gw pumping in our model since there was not enough detailed information available 5 conclusions and future work in this study we developed a regional gw flow model for the gilgel abay area of upper blue nile basin ethiopia driven by physically based distributed hydrologic model simulations evaluation of the model against ground observations indicate good model performance at regional scale the simulated h values also indicate a physical availability of gw resources which may be explored in future by decision makers to specifically address the dry season water uses the model captures aspects and physical dynamics of the deep gw regions which are sometimes missed in global scale models the calibrated gilgel abay gw model when forced with forecasted meteorological and simulated hydrological data has the potential to forecast seasonal gw levels these contributions amidst the data scarce nature of the upper blue nile could help in the decision makers efforts for establishing continuous gw monitoring at regional scale giordano 2009 gorelick and zheng 2015 llamas and mart√≠nez santos 2005 nelson 2012 shah 2010 in future the model will be used to obtain dynamically downscaled head boundaries for local scale gw models which would focus on more local aspects e g evaluation of irrigation canals and reservoir releases moreover the calibrated model will be used to carry out more dynamic state of the art research initiatives in the future including investigations on climate change development based on the water food and energy nexus human abstraction scenarios

5143,groundwater gw is the main source of domestic water supply in ethiopia 85 however despite widespread acknowledgement of its potential for resource based development and climate change adaptation the sector is still quite under investigated this is mainly due to the scarcity of in situ data which are essential to building robust impact models to address this we developed a fine resolution 500 m gw model using modflow nwt focusing on the gilgel abay catchment located in the upper blue nile basin fed with daily distributed input forcings of recharge and streamflow simulated by the coupled routing and excess storage crest hydrological model the model was calibrated against instantaneous observation records of gw table for 38 historical wells and validated at selected sites using time series data collected from the citizen science initiative pire csi and the innovation lab for small scale irrigation ilssi project an rmse of 14 4 m 1 8 of range was achieved for calibration and same for validation was 18 21 m and 15 76 m at the pire csi and ilssi sites respectively the findings of this research indicate substantial physical gw resource availability in the gilgel abay region moreover we expect the model to have multiscale future applications these include obtaining dynamically downscaled boundary conditions for a local scale gw model to be developed in the next phase of our research further an upscaled version of this model to encompass the entire tana basin would be developed to simulate lake aquifer interactions finally the approach of this research combining different types of datasets e g reanalysis products satellite data citizen science data etc is adaptable to other global data scarce regions moreover the method overcomes specific challenges associated to in situ data scarcity limited knowledge on gw resources availability in the area interaction with complex boundary conditions and sensitivity under meteorological boundary forcings

2013 ethiopia is often considered a water tower among all the african countries with an estimated surface water sw availability of 120 billion m3 and annual gw recharge of 36 billion m3 of which nearly 10 is exploitable haile and kasa 2015 kebede 2012 many believe that this seemingly high annual gw availability has the capacity to buffer vulnerability induced by climatic variability chebud and melesse 2009 and foster human development linked to the water food and energy nexus gaye and tindimugaya 2012 lack of detailed information and knowledge on the availability and sustainable use of gw resources however has constrained the country s integrated development initiatives with reports suggesting that the total irrigation proportions being less than 5 of the countries irrigable lands haile and kasa 2015 this is affecting the country s water and food security as 85 of its population depend on agriculture haile and kasa 2015 in ethiopia the blue nile basin bnb also known as the abay basin exhibits substantial seasonal variation in rainfall resulting in more than 80 of the flows occurring during the wet season july to october this leaves less flow in the dry season february to may which may be further affected by climatic variabilities awulachew et al 2008 mccartney and girma 2012 these seasonal fluctuations often limit the availability of sw in the dry season for irrigation this is why investigating the development of gw resources during that period is essential especially because the dry season dependence of gw in the tana basin an important sub basin of the bnb is increasing abiy et al 2016 asrie and sebhat 2016 kebede et al 2006 legesse et al 2004 in the tana basin the potable water needs of about two million people are met by gw sources however the use of this resource for irrigation is still not much practiced chebud and melesse 2009 moreover despite the major importance of the tana basin where the outflow contributes about 8 of the upper blue nile flow conway 1997 haile et al 2009 its hydrogeological characteristics are not well understood or mapped at a larger scale kebede et al 2006 these limitations have historically caused resource mismanagement evidenced by an event which recorded the failure of 20 borehole drilling attempts close to lake tana at bahir dar asfaw 2003 based on the above more research and fostering of knowledge are clearly needed previously studies related to water resource management in the blue nile area and the tana basin have focused on developing hydrological models bceom 1999 conway 1997 guariso and whittington 1987 johnson and curtis 1994 kebede et al 2006 legesse et al 2004 mccartney and girma 2012 sutcliffe and parks 1987 mccartney and girma 2012 evaluated the downstream implications of water resource development in the lake tana area by considering climate change and different hydropower irrigation development scenarios while kebede et al 2006 analyzed the sensitivity of water balance in lake tana with respect to fluctuations in rainfall over the upper blue nile some studies have also highlighted the application of gw modeling as a tool for strategizing optimal water management options under different scenarios helping to achieve sustainable development by illuminating surface subsurface system dynamics and environmental impacts asrie and sebhat 2016 ayenew 2001 chebud and melesse 2009 massuel et al 2017 chebud and melesse 2009 contemplated the potential of gw resources of the tana basin to support irrigation and eventually inferred that the average gw storage in the area during each cropping season could irrigate about 10 000 ha asrie and sebhat 2016 provided a comprehensive understanding of a portion of lake tana s subsurface system its impacts on gw and its response to different plausible natural and anthropogenic stresses by analyzing different contemporary scenarios including reservoir drying recharge alteration and water withdrawal abiy et al 2016 highlighted the significance of the four major rivers gilgel abay gumera ribb and megech in year round gw recharge in the tana basin all such research the modeling studies and others have highlighted the data scarcity issues in africa the societal linkages of resource functions dynamism use and challenges associated with portraying impacts of individual water withdrawals at regional scale and has led to an understanding that robust gw models for monitoring and management initiatives are needed asrie and sebhat 2016 colchester et al 2017 massuel et al 2017 smec 2008 this motivated us to develop and calibrate a regional gw model in the upper blue nile by specifically focusing on the tana basin area more specifically we developed a modular 3 d finite difference modflow model with nwt solver modflow nwt forced with daily distributed hydrological variables gw recharge and streamflow simulated by the coupled routing and excess storage crest hydrological model the modflow nwt program harbaugh 2005 employs a finite difference based method for solving the 3 d transient gw flow equation lazin et al 2020 has shown fair agreement of crest streamflow variability with respect to the observed datasets during the june september jjas season with nse values for discharge at different basin scales ranging from 0 46 to 0 75 crest also simulates et at 500 m resolution with 0 93 correlation coefficient 0 81 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and 4 75 bias at daily scale the good model performance at the validation sites nse 0 6 and bias within 15 indicates the calibrated parameters can be used for ungauged locations lazin et al 2020 the study overcomes some of the dominant challenges prescribed in the gw modeling pursuits of other researchers in the upper bnb such as data scarcity limited gw knowledge lake contributions and forcing uncertainty effects among others asfaw 2003 kebede et al 2005 in data scarce regions there are studies establishing physically based sw budget models n√§schen et al 2018 tegegne et al 2017 research also focused on assessing gw resources through fully fledged sw gw coupling ireson et al 2006 improved conceptual models candela et al 2014 or advanced mathematical optimization pande et al 2012 the use of sw gw coupled models has been investigated in different parts of the world gamvroudis et al 2017 guzman et al 2015 maxwell et al 2015 maxwell and miller 2005 sutanudjaja et al 2011 trichakis et al 2017 however the idea of one way coupling with detailed and distributed simulated streamflow and recharge outputs to drive a physically based transient gw model validated with citizen science data for partially complementing in situ data scarcity brings substantial scientific merit to this study citizen science the process to ensure public participation in research design data collection and interpretation together with scientists has proven to be promising for data scarce regions buytaert et al 2014 more specifically the scientific contributions of this research are the following a use of simulated variables from a distributed hyper resolution hydrological model to derive some of the necessary boundary conditions of the gw model b evaluation of error and uncertainty propagation of the simulated hydrological inputs to the gw model and c the incorporation of citizen science to overcome the data scarcity issues in the region 2 methodology and data 2 1 research framework the integrated modeling approach applied in this study takes the outputs of the crest model simulation recharge and streamflow as inputs to modflow nwt to develop a transient gw model specifically we partially address the in situ data scarcity by forcing the gw model with 39 years 1979 2018 of daily recharge and streamflow data simulated by crest lazin et al 2020 the gw model results were calibrated with historical instantaneous data and validated with two different time series gw level datasets e g the pire citizen science initiative csi and the innovation lab for small scale irrigation ilssi project 1 1 ilssi is a five year project that aims to benefit farmers of ethiopia ghana and tanzania by improving the effective use of scarce water supplies through interventions in small scale irrigation it is a part of the u s government s feed the future initiative https ilssi tamu edu about fig 1 is a process diagram highlighting the key components of the research the gilgel abay gw model estimated spatiotemporal profiles of hydraulic heads and the subsurface water budget both of which could improve the understanding of regional gw resource availability and management 2 2 study area the study area comprised the gilgel abay catchment and the lake tana floodplains in the southernmost areas of the tana basin fig 2 lake tana is the source of the blue nile river and is a freshwater shallow and oligotrophic lake with weak seasonal stratification wood and talling 1988 gilgel abay ribb gumera and megech contribute more than 93 of the lake inflow abiy et al 2016 at least seven irrigation schemes with an annual water demand greater than 600 million m3 have been proposed within the tana basin in the past decade bceom 1999 kebede et al 2006 among these the koga irrigation and watershed management project falls within our model domain the project was designed to irrigate 7000 ha of command area by means of a water storage reservoir a dam and a detailed system of irrigation canals lijalem 2018 most extensive use of gw pumping in the area is for drinking and domestic purposes while use of this resource for irrigation is very limited kebede 2012 the gilgel abay catchment is in the basaltic plateau of the northwestern part of the ethiopian highlands and includes west gojam and awi two administrative zones of the amhara region fig 2 there are three major geological landforms in the area e g the alluvial deposits along the lake tana and river floodplains and the tertiary and quaternary volcanic basalt sequences kebede 2012 setegn et al 2010 a detailed description on the hydrogeology and the conceptual model development is provided in section 2 4 2 1 while designing the model spatial domain we extended the domain up to the southern periphery of lake tana in order to provide the model with a known downstream boundary specifically the area was bounded between latitudes of 10 950n to 11 890n and longitudes of 36 730e to 37 410e encompassing an area of 4622 km2 the topography of the model domain varied significantly decreasing from about 3449 m on the south to around 1736 m on the north yamazaki et al 2017 this relatively large range in elevation created an additional challenge for the subsurface hydrological modeling tasks as the regional scale of the model often made it difficult to capture the large hydraulic head variability within the model domain fig 2 shows the geographical extent of the model domain the gilgel abay catchment the lake tana basin and the topographic elevations the figure also shows the 38 historical wells locations used for model calibration and the streamflow validation site in the gilgel abay river 2 3 data description the study domain topography and detailed river network were generated from the 90 m dem yamazaki et al 2017 we collected other land and water features for example the lake tana the tana basin geological regions and fault line locations by reviewing available research kebede 2012 and from the digitized gis based information available from the abay basin authority aba bahir dar university bu and the ministry of water irrigation and energy ethiopia information on hydrogeology and aquifers are conceptualized based on literature review hautot et al 2006 kebede 2012 and is discussed in detail in section 2 4 2 1 the gw model was forced with 39 years 1979 2018 of daily recharge and streamflow data simulated by crest lazin et al 2020 the daily crest outputs were aggregated into monthly values to feed the gw model because of its monthly resolution the crest model was forced with seven meteorological variables i e precipitation air temperature air pressure longwave and shortwave radiation specific humidity and wind speed from 1979 to 2014 we used the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep v1 beck et al 2017 blended global satellite based precipitation product and the remaining meteorological forcing variables were extracted from the ecmwf european center for medium weather forecasting era interim reanalysis product dee et al 2011 at 0 25 and 3 hourly spatiotemporal resolution from 2015 to 2018 we used the nasa imerg satellite based precipitation dataset huffman et al 2015 and noaa global data assimilation system gdas kleist et al 2009 for the remaining meteorological variables to keep consistency with the historic simulation 1979 2014 the meteorological variables from gdas and precipitation from imerg were temporally aggregated to 3 hourly from their original resolution hourly and half hourly respectively while keeping the original spatial resolution the original gdas forcing variables have a 0 20 spatial resolution from january 1st 2015 to january 13th 2015 and 0 11 spatial resolution from january 14th 2015 onward the imerg data is at 0 1 spatial resolution records from a total of 38 spatially distributed wells from 2013 to 2017 obtained from abbay basin authority aba were used primarily for the gw model calibration the data represented instantaneous no time series measurements of gw depth which were converted into hydraulic heads h the data also included borehole logs which were used to guide the vertical discretization of the model at two study sites koga irrigated site located in kudmi kebele and branti rainfed site located in dangishta kebele a number of shallow gw wells were monitored at weekly intervals from june 2017 to august 2018 as part of a citizen science initiative csi led by the university of connecticut uconn and bahir dar university bu dokou et al 2018 the csi data is collected by locally trained high school students and farmers and then verified by faculty experts from bu the process of data collection by local citizens has often proved to be useful for resource monitoring and also community empowerment walker et al 2016 in addition gw depth records for 36 wells in dangishta from january 2015 to december 17 were used that were collected as part of the ilssi project we also obtained monthly water levels at lake tana january 1979 december 2005 and the koga reservoir july 2012 february 2018 from the aba in may 2018 the research team carried out a weeklong field investigation at the study sites which helped developing approximations related to the river morphological properties such as river width and river depth 2 4 model setting 2 4 1 hydrologic model overview the one way model coupling based approach adopted in the study takes the simulated results of crest model specifically designed to perform energy and water balance based advanced hydrological simulations in the upper bnb as inputs to the gw model crest contains a computationally efficient fully distributed routing module shen et al 2016 that can run large basin simulations at fine spatiotemporal resolution 30 m to 1 km spatial grid resolution and hourly time steps over long periods 30 years for this research crest soil vegetation atmosphere and snow crest svas shen and anagnostou 2017 the latest version of crest was simulated at 500 m spatial resolution lazin et al 2020 crest svas includes a runoff generation module that solves for the coupled water and energy balances using a set of input dynamic variables comprising seven meteorological variables precipitation air temperature air pressure longwave and shortwave radiation specific humidity wind speed and leaf area index lai as well as a few static parameters such as land cover soil properties vegetation species descriptions and impervious ratios shen and anagnostou 2017 we used the two major outputs of the crest model that is the streamflow q and infiltration rate i which was later processed into the recharge rate r as inputs to force the gw model 2 4 2 groundwater model development 2 4 2 1 conceptual model the lake tana basin comprises of four major aquifers starting from the bottom the mesozoic sedimentary aquifer scoraceous tertiary basalt quaternary basalt sequence or volcanic basalt and the alluvial aquifer with lacustrine sediments kebede 2012 nigate et al 2016 the gilgel abay area has a predominance of quaternary or volcanic basalt sequence which provides some of the highest yielding shallow aquifers in lake tana basin kebede 2012 nigate et al 2016 groundwater flow is mainly controlled by regional tectonics associated with the formation of the lake tana graben itself the alluvial aquifer is recharged from lateral groundwater inflows from the volcanic aquifers from the upper catchments and by rainfall the aquifer discharges to lake tana and to evapotranspiration from the wetlands the volcanic aquifer of quaternary vesicular basalt is recharged from rainfall and most of its water later discharges to springs wetlands streams and directly to the southern sector of lake tana kebede 2012 nigate et al 2016 the tertiary scoraceous basaltic aquifer is also recharged from rainfall and principally discharges to springs and streams fig 3 recharge in the area varies from nearly 0 to 300 mm yr kebede 2012 nearly 60 of aquifers receive indirect recharge from floods mountain runoff as well as fast recharge from high rainfall events diffuse recharge is limited to the plateau region which accounts for around 30 of the country kebede 2012 the alluvial aquifer is not continuously spread throughout the entire gilgel abay catchment found in the river and lake tana flood plains only nor is the quaternary basalt sequence comprises the central and south central areas of the model domain nigate et al 2016 this complexity was avoided while adding the vertical discretization into the numerical model modflow nwt where we considered two aquifers i e one basalt aquifer on top which combines the alluvial quaternary and tertiary aquifers and one sedimentary aquifer at the bottom which represents the mesozoic sediment deposition fig 3 shows the conceptual model developed in this study highlighting the two aquifer s limiting surfaces and the major hydrological processes the stratigraphic assembly considered in this model is consistent with the resistivity model developed by hautot et al 2006 which inferred a consistent nw se trending sedimentary basin of about 1 5 2 km thick beneath the basaltic lava flow which spreads as deep as 250 m in some areas fig 3 in order to estimate the actual depth of the basalt layer layer 1 in the model we checked the maximum borehole depths of the 38 historical wells fig 3 shows the 3d locations of these drillings typically the depths drilled in this formation varied from 50 to 120 m with all reporting mostly basaltic stratigraphy we performed a kriging interpolation oliver 1990 with the maximum borehole drill depths and obtained the bottom of the top model layer with depths ranging from 50 to 200 m the bottom of the sedimentary aquifer which also marks the lower vertical bound of the model domain was assumed as a flat surface with 1400 masl elevation 2 4 2 2 numerical model a newton raphson formulation for unconfined subsurface flow condition was applied using the modflow nwt program the model was simulated in transient conditions from january 1979 through february 2018 470 stress periods the first 12 months of simulation results were often omitted in some of the gw analysis presented in this research considering the time the model may need to produce stable results the model comprised two vertical layers aquifers both were specified as convertible in the model however during the simulation the bottom aquifer was always confined and the top aquifer unconfined the horizontal spatial resolution of the gw model was 500 m generating 208 rows and 147 columns of model cells in each vertical layer to create the input files for the model we first used the usgs open source gui model muse version 3 10 winston and goode 2017 afterwards we used flopy version 3 2 10 an open source python api bakker et al 2016 to update the input parameters during model simulations which include calibration validation and sensitivity analysis 2 4 2 3 initial and boundary conditions we derived the initial condition of the model from a steady state simulated h profile during the steady state simulation the upstream end of the model was fixed in accordance with the historical gw levels from bceom 1999 so as to produce an h profile that has realistic hydraulic head distribution and could therefore be considered a valid model solution this is an important requirement for specifying initial conditions to improve model accuracy reilly and harbaugh 2004 the use of steady state simulated initial conditions for transient model simulations is common modelling technique adopted in large scale numerical simulations bagtzoglou 2003a 2003b franke et al 1987 reilly and harbaugh 2004 additionally we estimated the time constant defined by domenico and schwartz 1998 as approximately 3 2 years which is less compared to our transient model simulation time of 39 years the effect of any transient condition will not be observable if the time after the condition occurs is significantly larger than the time constant for the aquifer t domenico and schwartz 1998 reilly and harbaugh 2004 this justifies that the effects of the initial condition we selected for the model would not introduce any significant bias in the model results reilly and harbaugh 2004 we considered dirichlet boundary condition type i in the downstream end of the model where it meets the lake tana and where the model domain cuts across the koga reservoir we used the time variant specified head chd package to specify observed water levels from lake tana 1979 current and the koga reservoir july 2012 current along the other boundaries where time series h is not known we used the neuman boundary type ii to specify gw flux in order to accurately portray the flux boundaries we started with historical gw contour map developed by bceom 1999 and assigned no flow conditions where h contour lines are nearly perpendicular to the model boundaries in the boundaries where no flow conditions could not be established we assumed hypothetical lateral gw flux values q which are again consistent with the bceom 1999 reported h gradients the flow and head boundary fhb package was used for this while the recharge rch package was used to specify recharge r as vertical flux we adjusted the q values during the calibration process and eventually sustained them for the entire model simulation time 470 stress periods last we used mixed boundary conditions type iii to specify crest simulated streamflow q with the stream str package in addition there are some dykes and faults shown in fig 2 in the region the structures are found in the deep basal sequences with a varying width from a few centimeters to 6 m kebede 2012 it is reported in many studies that faults and dyke based structures may act as preferential pathways or conduits for gw flow especially in the saturated zone aydin 2000 bagtzoglou and cesano 2007a 2007b caine et al 1996 kebede 2012 ochoa gonz√°lez et al 2015 papadopoulou et al 2010 in their study used the drainage package to effectively simulate the hydraulic behavior of faults based on that work we also used the drain return drt package to represent the faults into the model as linear structures which would allow mostly discharge as conduits from the aquifers but also allow a fraction of the water to enter the gw system as recharge and maintain sub surface water budget the vertical locations of the faults were specified only in the bottom aquifer fig 2 showed the location of faults and dykes we also used the well package wel to assign a constant gw pumping of 40 l s in the 38 wells from their drilling period to the end of simulation 2013 2018 this average pumping rate was approximated based on the design yield data obtained from aba all the boundary conditions and packages used in the model are summarized in table 1 2 4 3 model evaluation framework 2 4 3 1 calibration validation and sensitivity the gw model was calibrated using a trial and error based approach with the objective of minimizing the root mean squared error rmse between simulated heads in the top aquifer and observed heads from 38 historical wells all of which are shallow wells located in the top aquifer hydraulic conductivity k unit streambed conductance Œ∂ recharge infiltration ratio œï r i and specific yield s y were considered as major calibration parameters based on literature support asrie and sebhat 2016 guzman et al 2015 with k Œ∂ and s y being spatially varying and œÜ r i being spatiotemporally constant the recharge infiltration ratio œï r i has been defined in this study as the percentage of infiltration that contributes to recharge in addition we also adjusted some other parameters during model calibration i e the s s values which influenced the h variations within the confined aquifer bottom and the hypothetical flux q values reviewing available literature on k transmissivity values ayenew et al 2008 kebede 2012 mengistu 2010 smec 2008 walker et al 2019 s y and s s jones 1985 walker et al 2019 in the gilgel abay region we started with initial k values horizontal of 1 m d for top aquifer and 0 5 m d for bottom aquifer and initial s y top unconfined aquifer and s s bottom confined aquifer values of 0 02 and 10 4 m 1 respectively for the other major calibration parameters feasible initial values were similarly hypothesized the initial Œ∂ value was 0 1 m d and for œï r i was 10 of infiltration coming from crest following calibration the model was validated independently against the csi and ilssi datasets moreover sensitivity analysis was performed with the four major calibration parameters k Œ∂ œï r i and s y by assigning parameter multipliers to the optimal calibration parameters and running new simulations the parameter multipliers ranged from 0 05 to 20 for k and s y 0 05 to 10 for Œ∂ and 0 05 to 2 5 for œï r i as for the last two cases the model failed to converge for larger parameter multipliers 2 4 3 2 statistical metrics during model evaluation we derived and analyzed a number of statistical error metrics in addition to the rmse we evaluated the systematic and random error components in the model by calculating the mean relative error mre and the normalized centered root mean squared error ncrmse bhuiyan et al 2019 2018 both were normalized against the mean observation set using eqs 5 and 6 here h i is the reference hydraulic head and h i is the modeled hydraulic head 5 mre 1 n i 1 n h i h i h i 6 ncrmse 1 n i 1 n h i h i 1 n i 1 n h i h i 2 1 n i 1 n h i to further evaluate the gilgel abay gw model we compared the results against two coarse resolution 0 25 nasa land surface models lms by arsenault et al 2020 and a fine resolution 1 km global model developed by fan et al 2013 the nasa lsms are regional applications of global models developed as part of the forecasting for africa and the middle east fame project arsenault et al 2020 shukla et al 2020 the aim of which was to develop a seasonal water deficit forecasting system relevant to usaid and usace activities in the middle east and africa based on existing nasa and noaa earth science capabilities mcnally et al 2017 2 2 fame was carried out within nasa funded program predicting middle eastern and african seasonal water deficits using nasa data and models https appliedsciences nasa gov content 13 water13 0010 the fine resolution model by fan et al 2013 presented global observations of water table depth compiled from government archives and literature fills in data gaps and infers patterns and processes using a gw model forced by modern climate terrain and sea level furthermore a correlation pentagon is developed and proposed in this study to underscore the correlation of the simulated h variables with some of the major drivers of the model since one of the fundamental novelties of this study was associated with the one way coupling of feeding the gw model with the crest simulated forcing variables q and r to compensate for the in situ data scarcity issues we also investigated how any plausible crest simulation error would affect the gw model for this we assigned different percentages relative errors 10 up to 50 to the forcing variables q and r and in order to keep the water balance when each q was reduced r was increased by the same amount the bound 10 50 is chosen considering crest s better performance in the region lazin et al 2020 where an error more than 50 is unlikely 3 results 3 1 gw model evaluation 3 1 1 optimal calibration parameters fig 4 shows the optimal distributed calibration parameters k s y Œ∂ head and flow boundary conditions along with the calibrated hypothetical flux values q the figure also shows the annual average distributed infiltration simulated by crest a portion of which is used as recharge in the gw model œÜ r i the optimal k covered a wide range of values for different regions driven by the variations in geological settings shown in fig 3 for most of the termaber basaltic regions in the top aquifer horizontal k values were low 0 1 0 5 m d while at alluvial formations it was significantly higher guided by reported parameter value ranges in the literature ayenew et al 2008 kebede 2012 mengistu 2010 walker et al 2019 the optimal s y was found to be spatially distributed from 0 05 to 0 12 in the top unconfined aquifer with spatial variability similar to the k zoning for the bottom aquifer the optimal specific storage value was s s 10 7 m 1 the range of optimal s y was low which indicates the basalt dominated phenomenon in the region and is also reasonable in comparison to literature in similar areas jones 1985 walker et al 2019 the optimal values for Œ∂ ranged from 0 05 to 1 d 1 fig 4 with higher values indicating increased stream leakage the optimal value of œÜ r i was reached at 40 which indicates that 40 of net infiltration was assigned in the form of recharge or deep gw percolation moreover the optimal hypothetical boundary flux q values were found as 1 3 m d during dry season 2 67 6 m d during wet season table 2 summarizes the optimal calibration parameters and fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of k s y Œ∂ and q values 3 1 2 calibration and validation results the calibration and validation results are provided in fig 5 fig 5 a indicates a good agreement rmse of 14 4 m with an r2 of 0 99 and p 0 0001 of simulated heads against the 38 observations instantaneous data for 2013 2017 fig 5 b shows validation in the citizen science wells in kudmi sep 17 aug 18 and dangishta jun 17 aug 18 and fig 5 c shows validation in the ilssi wells in dangishta jan 15 dec 17 fig 6 shows the time series of mean and the standard deviations sd taken from all samples for observed wells and simulated grids encompassing those wells h values in koga kudmi and branti dangishta in most cases the mean simulated h values were within the 1 sd bounds of the observations 3 1 3 spatial distribution of bias fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the bias red overestimation blue underestimation of simulated heads with respect to the observations here at 31 of the total 38 locations the bias was found within 15 m the model substantially overestimated at a few locations close to the boundaries in the southeast and west central areas of the domain this could have been due to failure to successfully approximate the boundary conditions that prevailed in those locations these observations as well as some other relatively larger bias incidents occurring at locations closer to the western boundary were consistently opposing changes for improvements throughout the model calibration efforts this indicates it might well be a representation of a local effect that cannot be improved at our spatiotemporal modeling scale 500 m and monthly resolution 3 2 sensitivity analysis comparisons of sensitivity analysis for different calibration parameters indicate the optimal values obtained through trial and error calibration are indeed the best fit in terms of incurring the least rmse with the closest estimation marked with the least sd fig 8 as evidenced by the discussion presented above the order of sensitivity for the calibration parameters from highest to lowest were exhibited by k high sensitivity œÜ r i moderate sensitivity Œ∂ low sensitivity and s y very low sensitivity respectively this supported the calibration efforts in emphasizing distributed characteristics for all the parameters except s y during calibration k was given the most importance which was reflected by the creation of 33 different zones allowing spatial heterogeneity to be captured the values of optimal Œ∂ were also distributed into different categories the œÜ r i value was constant but the recharge variable itself inherited distributed estimates provided by the crest simulated infiltration and varied throughout the model domain only the s y parameter was truly static throughout and considering its very low sensitivity the rationale for such a selection could be affirmed 3 3 spatiotemporal variability of hydraulic heads the spatial variability of hydraulic head h in the top unconfined aquifer is shown in fig 9 fig 9 a shows the gw contours in a representative normal dry year april 2014 before the jjas precipitation onset following the precipitation the gw table rises to its maximum in september october the figure specifically highlights the contributions to the regional gw flow of lateral fluxes flowing from the model upstream southern hilly regions to the model downstream northern region bounded by lake tana capturing well the physical dynamics prominent in the region kebede 2012 furthermore along some major rivers the contours are concave indicating a dip of h when they meet the rivers for closer examination of the seasonal fluctuations fig 9 b presents four time series plots showing the temporal variability of h at four different locations e g 1 2 3 and 4 3 4 subsurface water budget fig 10 shows several major subsurface water budget components the rates of net storage net recharge net stream leakage and drainage through the faults all the water budget components showcased the seasonal cycles the net storage rates always fluctuated indicating losses and gains of water from and into the gw storage occurred each year driven primarily by the seasonal cycles of hydrological forcing variables the net recharge values considered in our study averaged 0 7 mm d or about 255 mm year these net recharge rates are the distributed flux values reaching the groundwater system through percolation harbaugh 2005 and these estimates are consistent with the ranges recharge rates reported by other studies in ethiopia enku et al 2016 kebede et al 2005 mechal et al 2015 tilahun et al 2020 walraevens et al 2015 2009 the drought year of 2015 accounted for a substantial drop in recharge values the mean net stream leakage amount we obtained was about 61 amounting to about 153 mm year of the mean annual recharge which agreed with some other studies addressing similar ratios of stream leakage and recharge abiy et al 2016 kebede 2012 setegn et al 2010 the leakage values shown in fig 10 c indicate the difference of flow going out from aquifers into streams with the flow coming into the aquifers from streams harbaugh 2005 niswonger and prudic 2005 the positive values indicate that the aquifers were always feeding the streams during the simulations although the drainage through the faults experienced temporal variability similar to that of the stream leakage the magnitude was less than expected nevertheless the fault lines and their inclusion as drains helped the model achieve a better fit with the observations 3 5 comparison with global models for direct comparison to the outputs of two nasa global scale land surface models lsms noah mp and clsm arsenault et al 2020 and the fine resolution 1 km model developed by fan et al 2013 we converted the gilgel abay model s estimated h values into gw table depths by subtracting from the model resampled topography the global scale nasa models come at a coarse spatial resolution of 0 25 and hence at the expense of finer details noah mp is based on grid based land surface simulations while the clsm s basic computational units are hydrological basins the clsm does not explicitly simulate the water table but derives the gw storage from the basin deficit and the maximum water capacity of each basin the mean and the variability of data captured by our regional model the fan et al 2013 model and the two global nasa models are shown in fig 11 from the figure it may be inferred that the gilgel abay and the fan et al 2013 models provide a better understanding of the seasonal cycles while addressing the gw table fluctuations compared to the nasa models the mean gw table depths from gilgel abay model is much higher and comes close to fan et al 2013 3 6 driver correlation and error uncertainty propagation the correlation pentagon we developed for our model for these purposes is presented in fig 12 a here i was the location index and j is the time index in months among the drivers used in the correlation pentagon were monthly precipitation p i j and monthly recharge r i j which are spatiotemporally distributed parameters compared against the spatiotemporally distributed h monthly streamflow q j and monthly boundary flux q j are two other drivers treated as basin averaged quantities compared against basin averaged h the final driver elevation e i only varied over space during this comparison with e i values of h were temporally averaged at each location i fig 12 a shows the highest correlation coefficient of 0 816 for h with e i the other drivers have a lower yet similar correlation only with a time lag of one month for p i j and q j this implies that simulated h i j was likely to be more influenced by the forcing of p i j 1 that is the precipitation forcing of the previous month fig 12 b highlights the probabilistic estimates of systematic and random error propagation during the model coupling errors are calculated with the calibrated gw model s simulated h values as reference the values labelled above each bar are error metrics normalized with the calibrated model s mre and ncrmse as referenceswith increase in error percentages imposed in the model s forcing variables the amount of systematic and random errors always increased revealing the gw model s substantial sensitivity to errors which might have already existed in its forcing datasets the calibrated model had a mre of 0 0058 mr e reference and ncrmse of 0 0075 ncrms e reference against the 38 observation wells discussed in section 3 3 1 interestingly almost all the sequential mre values obtained in fig 12 b were found to be below the mr e reference with the exception of the 50 error case further we found all the sequential ncrmse values to be below the ncrms e reference 4 discussion and study limitations the results from this study indicated the physical availability of regional gw resources the region is often highlighted as the highest gw yield regions within the upper bnb mengistu et al 2019 this resource can be further explored and potentially utilized specifically for meeting dry season irrigation water demands the regional gilgel abay gw model developed in this study was able to exhibit satisfactory calibration and validation metrics especially considering the manifold scientific challenges that impaired the process table 3 shows the performances of some other gw models developed in the lake tana region asrie and sebhat 2016 chebud and melesse 2009 mengistu 2010 as well as some other sw gw models in different regions maxwell et al 2015 trichakis et al 2017 we obtained the rmse for calibration as 14 4 m which was about 1 8 of the h ranges on a pragmatic context this is still a large estimate however considering the regional scale of the model in situ data scarcity and the nature of lower accuracies typically observed in sw gw coupled models maxwell et al 2015 trichakis et al 2017 the results are acceptable the validation result inferred rmse of 18 21 m for the csi observations and 15 76 m for ilssi records the mre and ncrmse values of the calibrated gw model were computed as 0 0058 and 0 0075 respectively p 0 0001 both of which indicated the model was able to produce a reasonably strong fit with the observations it was found that our regional model captured a higher variability compared to the nasa global models which may be due to the model s ability to simulate deeper gw levels in contrast to the lsms which typically capture the dynamics of shallow aquifers only resulting in lower simulated depths to gw than in the fine resolution models furthermore the records from historical well observations also revealed locations where deeper gw tables were indeed reported this agrees well with the findings of the regional model we also found the major water budget estimates and the spatiotemporal profiles of h to be consistent with other literature findings the results provided in fig 9 b and 10 indicate that the model was able to capture the effects of the recent hydrological drought occurring in 2015 the discussions presented along with the correlation pentagon highlight that the model is more highly correlated with the hydrogeologically static driver elevation than the dynamic drivers hydrological forcing variables this may be supported by the consistent range of simulated h with the static variable e and also attributed to the error propagation during model coupling which is associated to the dynamic drivers hydrological forcing variables error propagation analysis underscores that the bias in forcing datasets contributes to both systematic and random errors but at a scale that is less than the reference errors i e the error against observations the discussion of error propagation stressed the importance of having accurate representations of streamflow and recharge data for gw models the gw modeling efforts carried out in this study have the potential to develop spatiotemporal estimates of subsurface water resources at regional scales this study was subject to a number of limitations that challenged the scientific efforts in general scarcity of in situ data in the gilgel abay region was a major limitation to address it we adopted this one way coupled approach although it is evidently prone to modeling uncertainties and deployed the citizen science initiative for data collection during model validation it was found that the model has limitations in capturing spatial variations which are driven by changes at local scale the temporal variability of simulated h obtained at the wells in dangishta pire csi data for example seemed similar while in reality the wells located in the alluvial regions were significantly more biased than those in basaltic regions these kinds of locally significant realities could not be captured by the model because of its reginal nature these limitations may be addressed through development of local scale gw models in the area where this regional model results could offer significant options to extract and downscale head boundaries the sensitivity analysis justifies the selection of calibration parameters and their optimal values however the analyses did not include spatial change of the parameters which is likely to have an impact another possible limitation of the model is its strong emphasis on physically based dynamics which does not consider detailed anthropogenic disturbances the irrigation schemes within the area affect the gw recharge however not enough information is available at regional scale to enable us to incorporate these irrigation practices into our regional gw model we also used simplified approximations to include gw pumping in our model since there was not enough detailed information available 5 conclusions and future work in this study we developed a regional gw flow model for the gilgel abay area of upper blue nile basin ethiopia driven by physically based distributed hydrologic model simulations evaluation of the model against ground observations indicate good model performance at regional scale the simulated h values also indicate a physical availability of gw resources which may be explored in future by decision makers to specifically address the dry season water uses the model captures aspects and physical dynamics of the deep gw regions which are sometimes missed in global scale models the calibrated gilgel abay gw model when forced with forecasted meteorological and simulated hydrological data has the potential to forecast seasonal gw levels these contributions amidst the data scarce nature of the upper blue nile could help in the decision makers efforts for establishing continuous gw monitoring at regional scale giordano 2009 gorelick and zheng 2015 llamas and mart√≠nez santos 2005 nelson 2012 shah 2010 in future the model will be used to obtain dynamically downscaled head boundaries for local scale gw models which would focus on more local aspects e g evaluation of irrigation canals and reservoir releases moreover the calibrated model will be used to carry out more dynamic state of the art research initiatives in the future including investigations on climate change development based on the water food and energy nexus human abstraction scenarios

5144,in this paper a new numerical model has been developed for simulation of qanat aquifer system this model employs quasi 3d mixed form of richards equation and 1d fully hydrodynamic form of saint venant equations to simulate subsurface and overland flow respectively in order to handle non orthogonal grids subsurface flow module benefits from coordinate transformation technique using the above mentioned governing equations the presented model is able to simulate water flow inside both collection and conveyance sections of the gallery as well as dynamics of groundwater and vadose zone from impermeable bed rock to the soil air interface since measured data corresponding to the hydraulics of qanats is scarce the overland and subsurface modules have been validated with analytical numerical and experimental benchmarks in the literature subsequently the model was employed to simulate ten different hypothetical aquifer qanat systems with different properties including the depth of groundwater aquifer roughness of the gallery and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the gallery aquifer boundary and the influence of each the parameters was monitored on the outflow rate at the appearance point of each qanat furthermore the advance of water inside two initially dry galleries were simulated at different time levels up to steady state eventually the streamlines have been shown at the steady state for two qanat aquifer systems although the presented study sheds light on some aspects of qanat aquifer hydraulics the validation of the presented model with in lab or on field data remains ongoing for the future researches keywords richards equation saint venant equation numerical modeling qanat aquifer system 1 introduction qanat is a sustainable and environment friendly water supply structure which was first established by iranians ahmadi et al 2010 hosseini et al 2010 yannopoulos et al 2015 the early constructions of qanat in iran dates back to more than 3000 years ago in achaemenid era hosseini et al 2010 naghibi et al 2015 salih 2006 stiros 2006 qanat consists of a gently sloping subterranean horizontal tunnel i e hereinafter is referred to as gallery dug through alluvial groundwater aquifer to exploit and convey water from saturated soil to ground surface samani et al 2006 the gallery of the qanat is connected to the ground surface with vertical shafts or wells drilled in particular intervals to alleviate removal of debris from the gallery and to provide fresh air for workers luo et al 2014 nazari samani and farzadmehr 2006 the vertical shaft locating in the upslope of the gallery that is usually sunk to a level below the water table is called mother well lightfoot 1996 yazdi and khaneiki 2016 the gallery starts from the mother well on the upstream and ends at the downslope to the outlet or appearance point yazdi and khaneiki 2016 which is the point gallery intersects the surface ground the gallery of the qanat can be divided into two main sections collection section or submerged zone this section lies below water table extending from mother well to the point water table intersects the gallery azari rad et al 2017 the role of collection section is to exploit water from groundwater aquifer to the gallery of the qanat subsequent to the collection section water flowing inside the gallery enters conveyance section of the gallery which is located above water table at this section water leaks from gallery to the soil block embracing qanat in order to reduce water infiltration at this section of the gallery sometimes qanat s bed is covered by impermeable material pouraghniaei and malekian 2001 while qanat as an archeological structure has drawn attention of numerous researchers stiros 2006 the hydraulic aspects of this structure has been neglected in the literature azari rad et al 2017 developed a three dimensional numerical model for simulating submerged zone of qanat by extending the methodology of mohamed and rushton 2006 for simulation of 2d groundwater aquifer excavated by a horizontal drain azari rad et al 2017 combined three dimensional governing equation of unconfined groundwater flow with darcy weisbach equation to describe water movement inside the gallery of the qanat on another part of their paper they employed the solution of robati and barani 2009 i e a steady state solution for gradually varied flow within gallery of qanat obtained by combining continuity and momentum equations with darcy s flux to simulate water movement in the gallery of the qanat however their model was only able to simulate collection section of the gallery recently sedghi and zhan 2020 proposed a semi analytical solution to investigate the influence of groundwater recharge and pumping wells on the discharge of qanats in essence qanat acts as a horizontal drain that exploits and conveys water to another point zhan and zlotnik 2002 presented a semi analytical solution to drawdown near horizontal and slanted wells the horizontal slanted well was considered as a constant flux point sink in the governing equation of groundwater flow for an unconfined aquifer the point sink solution was subsequently extended to a line sink by superposition samani et al 2006 fine tuned this solution by considering constant head point sink instead of constant flux point sink kompani zare et al 2005a presented an analytical solution for a horizontal well in a confined aquifer both solutions of samani et al 2006 and sedghi and zhan 2020 employed laplace transform superposition principles and modeling horizontal well as a constant head point source sink although samani et al 2006 provided a solution to obtain the variations of head and discharge of a horizontal drain their solution was not able to describe the influence of rainfall and pumping on the discharge of a horizontal well the solution of sedghi and zhan 2020 addressed this deficiency by a semi analytical solution obtained in laplace domain the above mentioned solutions were presented under the assumption that horizontal well was completely dug below water table kompani zare et al 2005b provided an analytical solution to investigate the variations of water flow along a horizontal subterranean tunnel dug in unsaturated zone of the aquifer they considered the subterranean tunnel as a permanently saturated point source that recharges the soil block embracing it they did not simulate variations of water head inside the horizontal tunnel wang and zhan 2017 focused on the simulation of water flow inside a horizontal well they discretized the horizontal well into several segments in each segment the drawdown is caused by frictional accelerational and water exchange between gallery and aquifer the frictional effect was modelled by darcy weisbach equation and the water exchange was incorporated into its friction coefficient following ouyang et al 1998 accelerational effect that refers to the energy loss due to velocity enhancement when water approaches pump intake point was calculated by an expression obtained from manipulation of momentum conservation following penmatcha and aziz 1998 although wang and zhan 2017 tried to overcome the deficiencies of uniform flux and uniform head boundary conditions by proposing a new boundary condition called mixed type boundary condition the coupled aquifer wellbore flow system is considerably more complex thus is left out of this work and may be investigated in a separate study in the future in addition to the semi analytical solutions researchers have used numerical modeling to simulate large scale horizontal drains rushton and brassington 2013 employed similar methodology to mohamed and rushton 2006 to simulate water flow within a curved horizontal well in a golf course however in contrast to mohamed and rushton 2006 that used hazen williams pipe flow equations rushton and brassington 2013 employed darcy weisbach equations in most of the qanats the conveyance section is much longer than the collection section therefore in order to acquire complete understanding about qanat the model must be able to simulate both submerged part of the gallery and conveyance section simultaneously furthermore the dynamics of water movement in the gallery of the qanat is better captured by the physically based shallow water flow equations therefore in order to reflect all of the above mentioned features properly a model should comprise coupled overland subsurface equations many hydrological models have been proposed in the literature that solve overland subsurface equations simultaneously such as inhm heppner et al 2006 vanderkwaak 1999 parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 weill et al 2009 and an and yu 2014 most of these models couple mixed form of richards equation and one of the forms saint venant equations simplified forms including kinematic and diffusion wave approximations or fully hydrodynamic form to describe subsurface and overland flow respectively however none of them have been used for simulation of qanat aquifer system among different available forms of richards equation mixed form has superiority over the simplified forms water content based form only yields efficient solutions in homogeneous unsaturated soils this is simply because the driving force for water movement in soil is pressure head gradient not water content gradient ≈°im≈Ønek 2005 in other words water content is not a suitable variable for calculating darcian flux within layered soils owing to its discontinuous nature at soil layer interfaces zha et al 2013b it should be mentioned that some researchers have modified water content based formulation of richards equation to address this deficiency hills et al 1989 kirkland et al 1992 ross 1990 zha et al 2013b but their use has not gained popularity among researchers non negligible bibliography have shown that pressure head based form of richards cannot preserve mass balance sufficiently kosugi 2008 lehmann and ackerer 1998 celia et al 1990 showed that this fact stems from substituting water content derivative Œ∏ t with the derivative of pressure head times water capacity function c w h t using chain rule the objective of this study is to develop a new physically based model for simulation of water flow inside and in vicinity of a qanat s gallery by coupling mixed form of richards equation and fully hydrodynamic form of the saint venant equations the resulting model will be able to simulate dynamics of qanat aquifer system more specifically the model is capable of simulating the hydraulics of both collection and conveyance sections including infiltration of groundwater into the gallery in the collection section and water leakage from qanat s gallery to the soil block embracing it in conveyance section in the following sections of this paper the governing equations of the proposed model are introduced and the numerical solution strategy for the incorporated equations are outlined subsequently the performance of model is validated against numerical analytical and experimental benchmarks furthermore the qanat s outflow rate at the appearance point have been examined in ten different hypothetical qanats the streamlines of the aquifer qanat system and advance of wetting front inside gallery was also investigated finally the concluding remarks have been mentioned 2 materials and methods 2 1 saturated unsaturated subsurface flow water flow within the saturated unsaturated porous media is described by parabolic partial differential equation which is commonly known as richards equation richards 1931 richards equation can be derived combining mass conservation law and darcy buckingham flux buckingham 1907 narasimhan 2005 as follows 1 Œ∏ t k œà œà z q ex r where Œ∏ is volumetric water content l 3 l 3 œà is soil water pressure head l k is saturated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 t is time t z is vertical space coordinate l and q ex r is the inward outward exchange between soil domain and its surroundings l 3 l 3 t 1 in the present study q ex r accounts for leakage from qanat s horizontal underground tunnel to surrounding soil or water discharge from aquifer to the horizontal underground tunnel of qanat it can also represent groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration eq 1 has two unknowns i e œà and Œ∏ which makes it impossible to solve unless one of the unknowns expresses in terms of the other one therefore constitutive relations are commonly employed to express volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity as seen in eq 1 hydraulic conductivity is a function of soil water pressure head as a function of soil water pressure head in this study van genuchten 1980 constitutive relations has been employed for describing soil water retention curve Œ∏ œà and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k œà as follows 2 Œ∏ œà Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± œà Œª œï 3 k œà k s s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 œï œï 2 w h e r e œï 1 1 Œª Œª 1 4 s e Œ∏ Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r where s e is effective saturation l 3 l 3 Œ∏ s and Œ∏ r are saturated and residual water contents respectively l 3 l 3 Œ± inverse of air entry value l 1 œï and Œª are pore size distribution indices and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 in practice natural phenomena should be simulated in three dimensions however the dimensionality of the governing equations can be reduced in the presence of symmetric line plane for both boundary conditions and computational grid sometimes the reduction of dimensionality is only for simplifying the numerical model using an appropriate simplification in the governing equation makes the resulting model more efficient by preventing laborious computations in this paper quasi 3d form of richards equation has been developed for simulation of water flow in the porous media of soil by extending trenchman 2d model naghedifar et al 2019a trenchman 2d model was primarily developed for simulation of stormwater infiltration trenches using two dimensional richards equation solved by fully implicit cell centered finite volume scheme richards equation was coupled with a reservoir equation in that model to account for water fluctuations in the stormwater infiltration trenches moreover in order to handle the irregular soil domains coordinate transformation technique was employed in trenchman 2d model further details about trenchman 2d model was described in naghedifar et al 2019a in quasi 3d extension of trenchman 2d soil water can only move within the vertical planes located separately and directed perpendicular to the gallery of the qanat fig 1 two dimensional richards equation is solved in these planes assuming that water in the groundwater aquifer is independent of upstream and downstream conditions the following sentences summarize the solution scheme of the trenchman 2d and the coordinate transformation technique in order to solve eq 1 cell centered finite volume scheme has been employed therefore eq 1 should be integrated over an arbitrarily shaped quadrilateral control volume s as follows 5 s Œ∏ t d s s k œà œà z d s s q ex r d s applying gauss green divergence theorem on the second term of the eq 5 and considering darcy buckingham flux as f k œà œà z yields 6 s f l f n d l f e l e f w l w f n l n f s l s where n is the normal unit vector and l is the contra variant vector l which is directed parallel to n but its magnitude is equal to the face of the quadrilateral control volume the subscripts and superscripts e w n and s are the representative of east west north and south faces of control volume on the other hand as mentioned above soil domain around the gallery of the qanat has an irregular shape that requires the two dimensional model to be able to handle non orthogonal grids to address this issue gravitational and soil matric pressure gradients i e œà z on the interfaces of the quadrilateral control volumes should be mapped from the real world domain or the so called physical domain to a computationally ideal domain which is commonly known as computational domain the physical domain may contain arbitrarily shaped control volumes which makes it an inappropriate domain for computation of gradients using traditional central differencing scheme however computational domain only includes orthogonal domains with unit edge length coordinate transformation method is among well documented approaches in hydrological an and yu 2014 and agricultural naghedifar et al 2019b 2020 models which has been used successfully together with finite difference an et al 2010 and finite volume an and yu 2014 schemes trenchman 2d model uses an under relaxed modified picard iteration scheme for linearization of richards equation presented by celia et al 1990 that guarantees model to preserve mass balance of the solution even if the iterative process does not reach a complete convergence kosugi 2008 modified picard scheme is also famous for its robustness and simplicity nevertheless it is linearly convergent the model uses second order accurate scheme for spatial and first order accurate scheme for temporal discretization i e backward euler scheme the linearized system of equation is solved using alternating direction implicit adi method peaceman et al 1955 whose effectiveness has been proved by researchers for solving richards equation an et al 2011 the model benefits form a simple under relaxation paniconi and putti 1994 and dynamic time stepping techniques a common approach that changes the size of current time step based on number of iterations in the previous time step an and noh 2014 that help model avoid oscillatory solutions and superfluous calculations finally zha et al 2017 s technique is added to improve the robustness of model this technique helps model avoid divergence when water infiltrates into a very dry soil zha et al 2017 defined two parameters at the rising left and falling right limbs of water capacity function called œà dry and œà wet they asserted that the iterative process is very likely to diverge when solution jumps from œà dry to œà wet at one iteration therefore they suggested an algorithm to prevent iterative process diverge when solution for pressure head passes the peak of water capacity function at one iteration for more details one is referred to zha et al 2017 2 2 one dimensional saint venant equation water flow in the gallery of the qanat is simulated using fully hydrodynamic form of one dimensional saint venant equation as follows 7 u t f x s where u is the vector of conservative variables f is the vector of fluxes and s is the vector of source terms 8 u a v a f va v 2 a g a y s q ex s v f c g a s 0 s f where a is cross sectional area l 2 v is cross sectional averaged velocity l t 1 y is the depth from the free surface to the centroid of the wetted channel cross section l g is gravitational acceleration l t 2 f c is the component of the hydrostatic force in the flow direction exerted by the channel walls l 3 t 2 s 0 is the channel bed slope and s f is friction or energy slope friction slope can be calculated using empirical equations such as manning strickler or ch√©zy formulae in this study manning strickler formula has been used q ex s v represents the water exchange rate between gallery of the qanat and the soil block embracing it the momentum of lateral flow has been neglected in eq 8 as it is expected to have insignificant influence in overland flow in gallery eq 7 is a hyperbolic equation that can be solved both implicit and explicit discretization the superiority of the explicit schemes over implicit schemes is that the equation can be solved non iteratively therefore solution speed is expected to increase significantly however time step in explicit schemes for saint venant equations is controlled by courant number explicit schemes are commonly stable for the courant numbers under unity whereas implicit schemes can be stable for larger courant numbers and hence larger time steps can be taken therefore the trade off between the size of time step and the solution speed at each time step can determine the efficient scheme for overland flow since water flow within gallery of the qanat is unlikely to reach large courant numbers herein the explicit cell centered finite volume scheme of sanders 2001 has been employed to solve saint venant equation sanders 2001 scheme employs second order accurate spatiotemporal discretization because this method benefits from hancock s predictor corrector scheme bradford and katopodes 1999 and high resolution limiters sweby 1984 such as superbee limiter hirsch 2007 sanders 2001 model is a total variation diminishing tvd scheme that avoids oscillatory solutions at the propagating wetting front using this method two forms of saint venant equations should be solved in two main steps at the first step i e predictor step the primitive form of the one dimensional saint venant equations is solved at the half time step n 1 2 to find an estimation of conservative variables a and v at the next time step n 1 the primitive form of saint venant equations is as follows 9 a t v a x a v x q ex s v 10 v t g h x v v x g s 0 s f where h is the water depth in the gallery of qanat at the second main step corrector step eq 7 is integrated directly over a full time step to find the solution at the next time step as follows 11 u i n 1 u i n Œ¥ t Œ¥ x f i 1 2 n 1 2 f i 1 2 n 1 2 Œ¥ t 0 f c i n 1 2 Œ¥ t 2 0 g a s 0 s f i n q ex s v g a s 0 s f i n 1 as shown in eq 11 vector of source terms have been split into two terms sanders 2001 referred to eq 11 as a semi implicit discretization and claimed that this approach would help model avoid instabilities associated with the friction at the wet dry interface the same approach was applied on eqs 9 and 10 at the predictor level for the same reason the important feature of eq 11 is that it requires fluxes to be evaluated at the cell interfaces using predicted values i e at the half time level to accomplish this sanders 2001 model employs muscl monotonic upwind scheme for conservation laws extrapolation technique to obtain interfacial water depth and in turn interfacial cross sectional wetted area and velocity using muscl extrapolation method interfacial conservative variables are constructed by the lines with limited locally defined slope using slope limiters these lines should spring from cell centers and extend toward cell interfaces muscl extrapolation does not necessarily result in the same values at the left u l and right u r sides of each interface these discontinuous conservative values define riemann problem at each interface in order to calculate interfacial fluxes through an irregularly shaped cross section locally linearized riemann problem should be solved in this paper roe 1981 s interface flux has been used 12 f 1 2 f l f r a u Œ¥ u where f l and f r are the flux vectors computed with muscl extrapolated values at the left and right hand side of each interface respectively Œ¥ u is the difference between conservative variables on the right and left hand side of the interface and a u is the linearized jacobian matrix a u is the jacobian matrix defined as df d u calculated by eq 13 13 a u r Œª l where Œª is the diagonal matrix containing the absolute values of all the eigenvalues of a u r and l represent the matrices of right and left eigenvectors respectively the three under caret matrices on the right hand of eq 13 consist of arrays that should be calculated using roe averaging method the approach for calculation of each array has been explained in sanders 2001 2 3 coupling overland and subsurface equations qanat is a hydraulic structure in which water is in exchange with the groundwater or unsaturated soil block embracing it groundwater can move toward the gallery of qanat recharge or it can leak out of the gallery in order to simulate interactions of the gallery of the qanat and the saturated unsaturated soil around it overland and subsurface flow equations must be solved simultaneously coupling overland subsurface flows must be accomplished through a switching boundary condition across the gallery soil gs interface herein a fine tuned version of seepage face boundary condition has been employed across the gs interface in the following coupling procedure for overland and subsurface equations at the gs interface has been described iterative process starts with solving two dimensional richards equation at the separate vertical planes for one full time step considering boundary conditions fig 2 the above mentioned fine tuned seepage face boundary condition hereinafter called gs boundary condition helps water infiltrate to the gallery or leaks out of it the gs boundary condition employs no flow condition for the 2d control volume in vicinity of gallery providing that this control volume is in unsaturated state and the free surface of water flowing inside the gallery is below this 2d control volume if the soil is either saturated or water inside the gallery covers the 2d control volume dirichlet boundary with the pressure head equal to water depth inside the gallery is applied for richards equation the water exchange rate at the intersection of qanat gallery and the aquifer embracing it i e across the gs boundary in fig 2 is calculated using darcy buckingham equation note that darcy buckingham equation is calculated at the cell face of all control volumes in vicinity of gs interface fig 2 left part however these in outflows distributed across the gs boundary are integrated to obtain total in outflow at gs boundary of each vertical plane the rationale behind this integration is that 1d saint venant equation calls for cross sectional values of source sink terms using quasi 3d scheme for richards equation the distance between the vertical planes does not affect the convergence of the subsurface module however the vertical planes are connected to each other through the source sink terms imposed by the gs boundary more precisely the water sunk from the upstream vertical plane is added to the saint venant equation as a source term carried along gallery of the qanat in form of overland flow and may leak out to the downstream vertical planes since the distance between vertical planes are quiet high saint venant equation requires additional nodes between the planes to help model s convergence the cell centered scheme employed to solve the saint venant equation causes all computational nodes to be located between two contiguous gs boundaries for each of which integrated exchange rates were calculated in previous steps as shown in fig 2 the interface of the 1d control volumes coincide the gs interfaces the source sink terms for each 1d control volume can be reasonably estimated through a linear interpolation of integrated exchange rates between two contiguous gs boundary at the final step saint venant equation is solved considering the interpolated source sink values the coupling process would be repeated until system converges 2 4 atmospheric boundary condition the upper boundary of the vertical planes of quasi 3d richards equation is in contact with atmosphere therefore atmospheric boundary condition is required to be set at these boundaries this boundary condition accounts for evaporation and precipitation from the top boundary of each plane however actual transpiration is usually modeled mechanistically by integrating root water uptake within the root zone skaggs et al 2006 these approaches call for fine computational mesh in vicinity of top boundary therefore it imposes more computational cost and does not sound efficient in large scale domains to address this deficiency camporese et al 2014 proposed a so called boundary condition switching algorithm by which evapotranspiration can be applied on the top boundary without any need to the common calculations of root water uptake the well known algorithm for atmospheric boundary condition employs two main pressure head thresholds namely h min and œà min the former represents micro topography and roughness in other words overland water is allowed to flow when water pond is higher than h min the latter is used to switch between energy or atmosphere limited and soil limited evaporation stages when soil pressure head is larger than œà min neumann condition equal to potential evaporation is set at the top boundary while it remains equal to œà min dirichlet type boundary condition as soon as pressure head drops below œà min camporese et al 2015 showed that although boundary switching method is developed to model evaporation calibrating œà min properly the evaporative fluxes can be interpreted as evapotranspiration fluxes this method is suitable for large scale domains covered with shallow rooted vegetation not exceeding approximately 50 cm camporese et al 2015 since the gallery of qanats are usually long they affect a wide region furthermore in arid and semi arid regions qanats were established in the lands with poor vegetation consequently the above mentioned assumptions behind camporese et al 2014 s boundary switching approach are relatively valid in this study 3 results and discussion in this section the performance of the proposed model is assessed and validated against analytical numerical and experimental benchmarks due to the lack of comprehensive measured data to run a real qanat aquifer system the governing equations of the presented model have been validated separately with the above mentioned benchmarks root mean squared error r m s e 1 n max n 1 n max c n r n 2 where c is the calculated value by the presented model r is the reference value and n m a x is the total number of values and mean absolute error m a e 1 n max n 1 n max c n r n have been calculated to measure the accuracy of the presented model the soil constant parameters used in this section are shown in table 1 3 1 validation analytical solution for one and two dimensional infiltration into a homogeneous soil in this section the accuracy of the subsurface code is examined against one and two dimensional analytical solutions for infiltration in homogeneous soil while two dimensional test case examines steady state condition the one dimensional analytical solution describes transient water content distribution two dimensional steady state solution was provided by tracy 2006 for two and three dimensional problems the disadvantage of this solution is that it is only applicable to exponential water retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions fig 3 a shows the two dimensional problem for which tracy 2006 provided an analytical solution in this problem pressure head distribution in a a b rectangular soil block embraced by constant head boundary conditions is obtained at the steady condition while pressure head is uniformly distributed across left right and bottom boundaries i e œà 0 y œà a y œà x 0 h r on the top boundary pressure head has a nonlinear distribution the nonlinear distribution of the pressure head at the top boundary is described by the following function 14 œà x b 1 œï l n e œï h r 1 e œï h r 3 4 sin œÄ x a 1 4 sin 3 œÄ x 4 it yields zero pressure head in the middle i e œà a 2 b 0 0 and gradually decreases to h r on the corners of the top boundary the solution of the tracy 2006 was employed by ku et al 2017 to validate their meshless model for solving two dimensional richards equation they assumed a 50 m 10 m rectangular block packed with a hypothetical soil texture soil no 1 in table 1 embraced with pressure head of h r 20 m fig 3 b compares the simulation results of the presented model with those of ku et al 2017 and analytical solution of the tracy 2006 the presented model shows good agreement with analytical solution of tracy 2006 and numerical results of ku et al 2017 in the second test case transient infiltration process is simulated with the presented model and the results are compared to the semi analytical solution of cui and zhu 2018 the semi analytical solution of cui and zhu 2018 is based on traveling characteristics of wetting front and combines continuity equation and darcy buckingham flux to describe the evolution of water content profile using an ordinary differential equation the advantage of this method is that it can be applied to any soil texture and any descriptor of soil hydraulic properties even the highly nonlinear soil hydraulic functions of van genuchten 1980 water infiltration into a homogeneous silt loam soil block soil no 2 in table 1 is simulated and the water content profile is depicted at different time levels fig 4 boundary condition at the top boundary was set as dirichlet type with constant water content equal to Œ∏ 1 0 450 the lower boundary condition was considered as free drainage semi infinite soil block a uniform initial condition was set as Œ∏ 0 0 144 i e the water content corresponding to effective saturation equal to 0 2 and the total simulation time was 10 h water content profile at different time levels was simulated using numerical and semi analytical models and depicted in fig 4 the results obtained by numerical and semi analytical models are in complete agreement at different time steps 3 2 validation 2d in lab groundwater recharge discharge problem location of the water table has a dramatic impact on the recharge discharge from the gallery of the qanat in this section the capability of the model is examined for simulating the location of water table using the in lab dataset of vauclin et al 1979 and vauclin et al 1975 vauclin et al 1979 conducted an experiment in a 6 m 2 m box packed with sandy soil texture soil no 3 in table 1 van genuchten parameters for this test case were extracted from zha et al 2013 and ye et al 2016 water table was initially at 0 65 cm from the bottom of the box and the soil pressure head was assumed to be at hydrostatic equilibrium with water table at the unsaturated zone of the box fig 5 a constant water flux was applied on the top boundary of the sand box with intensity of 0 14791 m h 1 the water depth was kept constant at the right boundary of the sand box and the rest of the boundaries were set as no flow boundary condition moreover due to the symmetry of the experimental sand box and boundary conditions only half of the sand box 3 m was simulated to accelerate numerical calculation process zha et al 2013a employed the experimental dataset of vauclin et al 1979 to validate their noniterative 2d 3d numerical scheme to solve richards equation the location of water table simulated by the presented and zha et al 2013a s model along with the measured data of vauclin et al 1979 is demonstrated in fig 5 b at 2 3 4 and 8 h after the beginning of the experiment furthermore vauclin et al 1975 conducted a drainage experiment in the same box as vauclin et al 1979 with different initial and boundary conditions the water table was initially kept at 1 45 m from the bottom of the box left and bottom boundaries were the same as vauclin et al 1979 while there was no influx across the top boundary in vauclin et al 1975 at the beginning of the experiment water head dropped from 1 45 m to 0 75 m the box was filled with sandy soil texture whose van genuchten parameters was presented by clement et al 1994 and ye et al 2016 right boundary condition was set as constant head at the lower 0 75 m and seepage face across the rest of the boundary fig 5 c the location of water table simulated by the presented and wu 2010 s model along with the measured data of vauclin et al 1975 is shown in fig 5 d at 0 1 0 5 1 2 and 5 h after the beginning of the experiment measured and simulated results are entirely consistent in both test cases 3 3 validation kinematic wave rainfall runoff and dam break problems overland flow module is validated in this section against analytical experimental and numerical results available in the literature the first benchmark is the analytical solution for kinematic wave approximation of saint venant equations provided by eagleson 1970 to describe water flow on a slanted impermeable bed under uniform rainfall this analytical solution was employed by zhang et al 2018 to simulate flow depth hydrograph of a 500 m long parking lot with 0 01 m m slope and manning roughness coefficient of 0 005 s m 1 3 the intensity and duration of rainfall were 100 m m h r and 1500 s respectively and the simulation was continued for 5000 s fig 6 a compares flow depth hydrograph of the presented model with those obtained by the explicit scheme of chow et al 1988 full maccormack scheme of zhang et al 2018 and analytical solution of eagleson 1970 as shown the presented model is in agreement with other models and the rmse and mae of the presented model s hydrograph comparing to the analytical solution are 1 16 10 5 m and 3 88 10 5 m respectively in the second benchmark experimental dataset of katopodes and schamber 1983 along with numerical simulations of bradford and katopodes 2001 is selected to validate overland flow module against dam break problem in smooth and rough channels manning roughness coefficients of 0 009 and 0 05 s m 1 3 respectively the experiment of katopodes and schamber 1983 was conducted in a 121 98 m long channel with slope of 0 005 in the middle of which a 0 305 m high dam is located the dam was suddenly removed and the water inundates the channel this experiment was conducted two times while at the first experiment the channel was reported to be relatively smooth its roughness for the second experiment changed from 0 05 to 0 009 s m 1 3 fig 6 b compares the variations of water height at 7 62 m away from the dam after dam break obtained by the presented model two dimensional model of bradford and katopodes 2001 and measured data the simulated results show that the presented model have acceptably captured the variations of water height at the two experiments nevertheless at the smooth channel both models predict water height variations similarly while at the falling limb of hydrograph corresponding to the second experiment the two models predictions deviate from each other 3 4 application simulation of interactions between a hypothetical qanat gallery and groundwater aquifer in this section the model has been employed to simulate water flow within a 4000 m long gallery in vicinity of water table head over the collection section ten hypothetical qanats table 2 have been simulated using the proposed model to investigate the effect of reduced hydraulic conductivity of the soil in gs boundary representing the effect of clogging in the soil block near gallery of qanat manning roughness coefficient of the gallery and also the distance below gallery to the impermeable soil layer on the water flow rate at the appearance point of the gallery ordinarily interfacial hydraulic conductivity is calculated by arithmetic averaging k avg in trenchman 2d code in the presented model however k clg the interfacial hydraulic conductivity reduced by clogging is employed at the gs boundary which is defined as k r k avg where k r relative hydraulic conductivity is a prescribed coefficient between 0 for blocked to 1 for no clogging at the gs boundary fig 7 shows the two aquifer qanat systems used in this section both systems include a circular gallery with 1 m diameter dug through a loamy soil soil no 5 in table 1 whose slope is assumed to be 0 4 the slope of qanats gallery is commonly between 0 3 and 0 5 ahmadi et al 2010 the aquifers are 4000 m 90 m 90 m and 4000 m 90 m 66 5 m nine y z planes were set along x direction in which 2d richards equation is solved the boundary condition on the x y 0 z plane the locus of the points for which y 0 m in fig 7 a and b is assumed to be steady state implying that the water table is sufficiently far from the gallery in other words the solution domain along y axis is assumed so wide that the drawdown cone in vicinity of gallery does not violate the steady state water table assumption at the boundary y 0 m fig 2 this is why the length of domain along y direction is assumed to be 90 m in both aquifer qanat systems shown in fig 7 in order to obtain the above mentioned steady state water table 2d richards equation was solved in x y 0 z plane the code was run for a long time to ensure steady state solution to this end along the two vertical boundaries of the x y 0 z plane of the size 4000 m 90 m fig 7 a dirichlet condition was applied considering the location of water table i e water table at the upstream of x y 0 z plane was assumed to be 52 5 m and 10 m at the upstream and downstream respectively the pressure head across these boundaries was assumed to change hydrostatically in the unsaturated part the horizontal boundaries of the x y 0 z plane to solve 2d richards equation were set as no flow condition gs boundary condition was set across the 1 m diameter semicircle and for the other parts of the boundaries no flow condition was set for 4000 m 66 5 m plane the same procedure was applied but the floor plane the locus of the points for which z 0 m in fig 7 a and b was shifted 23 5 m upward each of the aquifer qanat systems whose properties are shown in table 2 were run for 300 hr to reach the steady state water depth and velocity profiles within the gallery of qanat for test case no 1 and 6 table 2 is shown in fig 8 these two test cases have been selected as baselines for the comparative study in the following sections the gallery of qanat was assumed to be initially dry although the above mentioned initial condition may seem unrealistic it highlights the performance of model when simulating different phenomena such as advance of overland wave inside gallery of qanat from the beginning to the steady state as shown in fig 8 a the amount of water infiltrated into the qanat at the collection section upstream of the gallery flows down the gallery and reaches the appearance point after 1 2 hr from this time onward water depth profile is accumulated at the downstream of the gallery up to when it reaches steady state i e 300 hr no sign of spurious oscillations so called wiggles can be seen in water depth profiles which have been calculated by continuity equation however velocity profiles which are calculated by momentum equation have been slightly affected by the wiggles at the wetting front this fact may have root in the friction slope term which is modeled by the empirical manning equation water head in the denominator of the manning equation may arise instability in momentum equation furthermore there exist a steep change of velocity at the wetting front this gradient may impose instability for calculation of momentum flux spatial derivatives of eq 7 almost the same trend can be observed in the evolution of water depth and velocity profiles of run no 6 fig 8 b and d respectively from the beginning to the steady state however steady state water depth at the appearance point of the test case no 1 is 0 37 m while it is 0 44 m for run no 6 the steady state velocity at the same location for test case no 1 and 6 are 1 03 and 0 97 m s 1 respectively therefore different gallery outflow rates is expected to occur in run no 1 and run no 6 fig 9 compares the variations of gallery outflow from appearance point of the gallery during 300 hr for different variables presented in table 2 in all cases gallery outflow has a rising rate at the beginning and after it reaches a maximum value it gradually falls to the steady state outflow rate this outflow pattern implies that the initial groundwater head over collection section is extracted by the gallery due to the water pressure gradient inside and outside of the gs boundary water flows down the gallery and leaks to the unsaturated soil embracing conveyance section as the time passes the water pressure head in vicinity of the gallery decreases up to the time that water extraction rate from the groundwater to the gallery at the collection section and leakage from the gallery to the unsaturated zone at the conveyance section reach an equilibrium this is when outflow hydrograph reaches steady state fig 9 a shows the influence of saturated hydraulic conductivity of gs boundary only k s across the curvature of gallery on the outflow hydrograph in an aquifer qanat system of size 4000 m 90 m 90 m fig 7 a the saturated hydraulic conductivity has been reduced by 25 and 50 in test case no 2 and 3 comparing to no 1 this reduction made steady state outflow rate to decrease from 269 l s 1 for run no 1 to 198 and 129 l s 1 for no 2 and 3 respectively which is equivalent to 26 and 52 reduction comparing to run 1 the same trend is observed for the 4000 m 90 m 66 5 m aquifer qanats fig 9 b the steady state gallery outflow for the baseline run no 6 is 322 l s 1 by 25 and 50 reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity of gs boundary the steady state outflow rate has been decreased for 27 and 74 respectively in fig 9 c and d the variations of outflow rate has been compared in terms of a change in manning roughness coefficient increasing manning roughness coefficient from 0 02 s m 1 3 baselines to 0 03 s m 1 3 run no 4 and 9 led to an increase in steady state outflow rate on the contrary a reduction in manning roughness coefficient from 0 02 s m 1 3 baselines to 0 01 s m 1 3 run no 5 and 10 has yielded less steady state outflow rates comparing to baselines this fact can be justified by the depth and velocity of water inside gallery the average water depth and velocity at the steady state for run no 9 is 0 25 m and 0 53 m s 1 respectively while these values are 0 13 m and 1 12 m s 1 respectively for run no 10 therefore an increase in manning roughness coefficient results in an enhancement of average water depth but it lowers velocity on the other hand this fact should be considered that rising water depth in a circular channel will increase hydraulic radius i e wetted area divided by wetted perimeter and that the leakage from gallery is only through the circumference of the circular gallery consequently as water depth rises less fraction of water flown in the gallery is exposed to the leaking boundary along the conveyance section gs boundary and more fraction of water can be conveyed to the appearance point fig 10 shows the pressure head distribution and streamlines of the aquifer qanat system for the two baselines at the steady state it can be observed that at the collection section groundwater table approaches to the gallery of the qanat and flow direction is from the groundwater to the gallery on the contrary in the conveyance section flow direction is from the gallery to the aquifer 4 conclusions in this paper a numerical model has been presented for simulation of water flow in an aquifer qanat system to this end 1d fully hydrodynamic saint venant is coupled with a quasi 3d form of richards equation using finite volume approach the quasi 3d form of richards equation is developed using trenchman 2d a numerical code originally developed for simulation of stormwater infiltration trenches the presented model is validated using analytical numerical and experimental benchmarks in all cases the results obtained by model agreed well with the benchmarks eventually the model was verified through a numerical experiment in which a 4000 m circular gallery was considered within a homogenous loamy aquifer the simulation was continued to reach steady state solution not surprisingly the results showed that by reducing saturated hydraulic conductivity of gs boundary will result in a decrease in steady state outflow rate however by decreasing manning roughness coefficient water depth and hydraulic radius will increase and consequently more fraction of flowing water will reach the appearance point this paper showed that the model is capable of simulating primary phenomena regarding an aquifer qanat system more complicated phenomena concerning this system as well as comparing this model with an in lab experimental model or comparison with in situ measurement in a real qanat remain ongoing for

5144,in this paper a new numerical model has been developed for simulation of qanat aquifer system this model employs quasi 3d mixed form of richards equation and 1d fully hydrodynamic form of saint venant equations to simulate subsurface and overland flow respectively in order to handle non orthogonal grids subsurface flow module benefits from coordinate transformation technique using the above mentioned governing equations the presented model is able to simulate water flow inside both collection and conveyance sections of the gallery as well as dynamics of groundwater and vadose zone from impermeable bed rock to the soil air interface since measured data corresponding to the hydraulics of qanats is scarce the overland and subsurface modules have been validated with analytical numerical and experimental benchmarks in the literature subsequently the model was employed to simulate ten different hypothetical aquifer qanat systems with different properties including the depth of groundwater aquifer roughness of the gallery and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the gallery aquifer boundary and the influence of each the parameters was monitored on the outflow rate at the appearance point of each qanat furthermore the advance of water inside two initially dry galleries were simulated at different time levels up to steady state eventually the streamlines have been shown at the steady state for two qanat aquifer systems although the presented study sheds light on some aspects of qanat aquifer hydraulics the validation of the presented model with in lab or on field data remains ongoing for the future researches keywords richards equation saint venant equation numerical modeling qanat aquifer system 1 introduction qanat is a sustainable and environment friendly water supply structure which was first established by iranians ahmadi et al 2010 hosseini et al 2010 yannopoulos et al 2015 the early constructions of qanat in iran dates back to more than 3000 years ago in achaemenid era hosseini et al 2010 naghibi et al 2015 salih 2006 stiros 2006 qanat consists of a gently sloping subterranean horizontal tunnel i e hereinafter is referred to as gallery dug through alluvial groundwater aquifer to exploit and convey water from saturated soil to ground surface samani et al 2006 the gallery of the qanat is connected to the ground surface with vertical shafts or wells drilled in particular intervals to alleviate removal of debris from the gallery and to provide fresh air for workers luo et al 2014 nazari samani and farzadmehr 2006 the vertical shaft locating in the upslope of the gallery that is usually sunk to a level below the water table is called mother well lightfoot 1996 yazdi and khaneiki 2016 the gallery starts from the mother well on the upstream and ends at the downslope to the outlet or appearance point yazdi and khaneiki 2016 which is the point gallery intersects the surface ground the gallery of the qanat can be divided into two main sections collection section or submerged zone this section lies below water table extending from mother well to the point water table intersects the gallery azari rad et al 2017 the role of collection section is to exploit water from groundwater aquifer to the gallery of the qanat subsequent to the collection section water flowing inside the gallery enters conveyance section of the gallery which is located above water table at this section water leaks from gallery to the soil block embracing qanat in order to reduce water infiltration at this section of the gallery sometimes qanat s bed is covered by impermeable material pouraghniaei and malekian 2001 while qanat as an archeological structure has drawn attention of numerous researchers stiros 2006 the hydraulic aspects of this structure has been neglected in the literature azari rad et al 2017 developed a three dimensional numerical model for simulating submerged zone of qanat by extending the methodology of mohamed and rushton 2006 for simulation of 2d groundwater aquifer excavated by a horizontal drain azari rad et al 2017 combined three dimensional governing equation of unconfined groundwater flow with darcy weisbach equation to describe water movement inside the gallery of the qanat on another part of their paper they employed the solution of robati and barani 2009 i e a steady state solution for gradually varied flow within gallery of qanat obtained by combining continuity and momentum equations with darcy s flux to simulate water movement in the gallery of the qanat however their model was only able to simulate collection section of the gallery recently sedghi and zhan 2020 proposed a semi analytical solution to investigate the influence of groundwater recharge and pumping wells on the discharge of qanats in essence qanat acts as a horizontal drain that exploits and conveys water to another point zhan and zlotnik 2002 presented a semi analytical solution to drawdown near horizontal and slanted wells the horizontal slanted well was considered as a constant flux point sink in the governing equation of groundwater flow for an unconfined aquifer the point sink solution was subsequently extended to a line sink by superposition samani et al 2006 fine tuned this solution by considering constant head point sink instead of constant flux point sink kompani zare et al 2005a presented an analytical solution for a horizontal well in a confined aquifer both solutions of samani et al 2006 and sedghi and zhan 2020 employed laplace transform superposition principles and modeling horizontal well as a constant head point source sink although samani et al 2006 provided a solution to obtain the variations of head and discharge of a horizontal drain their solution was not able to describe the influence of rainfall and pumping on the discharge of a horizontal well the solution of sedghi and zhan 2020 addressed this deficiency by a semi analytical solution obtained in laplace domain the above mentioned solutions were presented under the assumption that horizontal well was completely dug below water table kompani zare et al 2005b provided an analytical solution to investigate the variations of water flow along a horizontal subterranean tunnel dug in unsaturated zone of the aquifer they considered the subterranean tunnel as a permanently saturated point source that recharges the soil block embracing it they did not simulate variations of water head inside the horizontal tunnel wang and zhan 2017 focused on the simulation of water flow inside a horizontal well they discretized the horizontal well into several segments in each segment the drawdown is caused by frictional accelerational and water exchange between gallery and aquifer the frictional effect was modelled by darcy weisbach equation and the water exchange was incorporated into its friction coefficient following ouyang et al 1998 accelerational effect that refers to the energy loss due to velocity enhancement when water approaches pump intake point was calculated by an expression obtained from manipulation of momentum conservation following penmatcha and aziz 1998 although wang and zhan 2017 tried to overcome the deficiencies of uniform flux and uniform head boundary conditions by proposing a new boundary condition called mixed type boundary condition the coupled aquifer wellbore flow system is considerably more complex thus is left out of this work and may be investigated in a separate study in the future in addition to the semi analytical solutions researchers have used numerical modeling to simulate large scale horizontal drains rushton and brassington 2013 employed similar methodology to mohamed and rushton 2006 to simulate water flow within a curved horizontal well in a golf course however in contrast to mohamed and rushton 2006 that used hazen williams pipe flow equations rushton and brassington 2013 employed darcy weisbach equations in most of the qanats the conveyance section is much longer than the collection section therefore in order to acquire complete understanding about qanat the model must be able to simulate both submerged part of the gallery and conveyance section simultaneously furthermore the dynamics of water movement in the gallery of the qanat is better captured by the physically based shallow water flow equations therefore in order to reflect all of the above mentioned features properly a model should comprise coupled overland subsurface equations many hydrological models have been proposed in the literature that solve overland subsurface equations simultaneously such as inhm heppner et al 2006 vanderkwaak 1999 parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 weill et al 2009 and an and yu 2014 most of these models couple mixed form of richards equation and one of the forms saint venant equations simplified forms including kinematic and diffusion wave approximations or fully hydrodynamic form to describe subsurface and overland flow respectively however none of them have been used for simulation of qanat aquifer system among different available forms of richards equation mixed form has superiority over the simplified forms water content based form only yields efficient solutions in homogeneous unsaturated soils this is simply because the driving force for water movement in soil is pressure head gradient not water content gradient ≈°im≈Ønek 2005 in other words water content is not a suitable variable for calculating darcian flux within layered soils owing to its discontinuous nature at soil layer interfaces zha et al 2013b it should be mentioned that some researchers have modified water content based formulation of richards equation to address this deficiency hills et al 1989 kirkland et al 1992 ross 1990 zha et al 2013b but their use has not gained popularity among researchers non negligible bibliography have shown that pressure head based form of richards cannot preserve mass balance sufficiently kosugi 2008 lehmann and ackerer 1998 celia et al 1990 showed that this fact stems from substituting water content derivative Œ∏ t with the derivative of pressure head times water capacity function c w h t using chain rule the objective of this study is to develop a new physically based model for simulation of water flow inside and in vicinity of a qanat s gallery by coupling mixed form of richards equation and fully hydrodynamic form of the saint venant equations the resulting model will be able to simulate dynamics of qanat aquifer system more specifically the model is capable of simulating the hydraulics of both collection and conveyance sections including infiltration of groundwater into the gallery in the collection section and water leakage from qanat s gallery to the soil block embracing it in conveyance section in the following sections of this paper the governing equations of the proposed model are introduced and the numerical solution strategy for the incorporated equations are outlined subsequently the performance of model is validated against numerical analytical and experimental benchmarks furthermore the qanat s outflow rate at the appearance point have been examined in ten different hypothetical qanats the streamlines of the aquifer qanat system and advance of wetting front inside gallery was also investigated finally the concluding remarks have been mentioned 2 materials and methods 2 1 saturated unsaturated subsurface flow water flow within the saturated unsaturated porous media is described by parabolic partial differential equation which is commonly known as richards equation richards 1931 richards equation can be derived combining mass conservation law and darcy buckingham flux buckingham 1907 narasimhan 2005 as follows 1 Œ∏ t k œà œà z q ex r where Œ∏ is volumetric water content l 3 l 3 œà is soil water pressure head l k is saturated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 t is time t z is vertical space coordinate l and q ex r is the inward outward exchange between soil domain and its surroundings l 3 l 3 t 1 in the present study q ex r accounts for leakage from qanat s horizontal underground tunnel to surrounding soil or water discharge from aquifer to the horizontal underground tunnel of qanat it can also represent groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration eq 1 has two unknowns i e œà and Œ∏ which makes it impossible to solve unless one of the unknowns expresses in terms of the other one therefore constitutive relations are commonly employed to express volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity as seen in eq 1 hydraulic conductivity is a function of soil water pressure head as a function of soil water pressure head in this study van genuchten 1980 constitutive relations has been employed for describing soil water retention curve Œ∏ œà and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k œà as follows 2 Œ∏ œà Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± œà Œª œï 3 k œà k s s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 œï œï 2 w h e r e œï 1 1 Œª Œª 1 4 s e Œ∏ Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r where s e is effective saturation l 3 l 3 Œ∏ s and Œ∏ r are saturated and residual water contents respectively l 3 l 3 Œ± inverse of air entry value l 1 œï and Œª are pore size distribution indices and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 in practice natural phenomena should be simulated in three dimensions however the dimensionality of the governing equations can be reduced in the presence of symmetric line plane for both boundary conditions and computational grid sometimes the reduction of dimensionality is only for simplifying the numerical model using an appropriate simplification in the governing equation makes the resulting model more efficient by preventing laborious computations in this paper quasi 3d form of richards equation has been developed for simulation of water flow in the porous media of soil by extending trenchman 2d model naghedifar et al 2019a trenchman 2d model was primarily developed for simulation of stormwater infiltration trenches using two dimensional richards equation solved by fully implicit cell centered finite volume scheme richards equation was coupled with a reservoir equation in that model to account for water fluctuations in the stormwater infiltration trenches moreover in order to handle the irregular soil domains coordinate transformation technique was employed in trenchman 2d model further details about trenchman 2d model was described in naghedifar et al 2019a in quasi 3d extension of trenchman 2d soil water can only move within the vertical planes located separately and directed perpendicular to the gallery of the qanat fig 1 two dimensional richards equation is solved in these planes assuming that water in the groundwater aquifer is independent of upstream and downstream conditions the following sentences summarize the solution scheme of the trenchman 2d and the coordinate transformation technique in order to solve eq 1 cell centered finite volume scheme has been employed therefore eq 1 should be integrated over an arbitrarily shaped quadrilateral control volume s as follows 5 s Œ∏ t d s s k œà œà z d s s q ex r d s applying gauss green divergence theorem on the second term of the eq 5 and considering darcy buckingham flux as f k œà œà z yields 6 s f l f n d l f e l e f w l w f n l n f s l s where n is the normal unit vector and l is the contra variant vector l which is directed parallel to n but its magnitude is equal to the face of the quadrilateral control volume the subscripts and superscripts e w n and s are the representative of east west north and south faces of control volume on the other hand as mentioned above soil domain around the gallery of the qanat has an irregular shape that requires the two dimensional model to be able to handle non orthogonal grids to address this issue gravitational and soil matric pressure gradients i e œà z on the interfaces of the quadrilateral control volumes should be mapped from the real world domain or the so called physical domain to a computationally ideal domain which is commonly known as computational domain the physical domain may contain arbitrarily shaped control volumes which makes it an inappropriate domain for computation of gradients using traditional central differencing scheme however computational domain only includes orthogonal domains with unit edge length coordinate transformation method is among well documented approaches in hydrological an and yu 2014 and agricultural naghedifar et al 2019b 2020 models which has been used successfully together with finite difference an et al 2010 and finite volume an and yu 2014 schemes trenchman 2d model uses an under relaxed modified picard iteration scheme for linearization of richards equation presented by celia et al 1990 that guarantees model to preserve mass balance of the solution even if the iterative process does not reach a complete convergence kosugi 2008 modified picard scheme is also famous for its robustness and simplicity nevertheless it is linearly convergent the model uses second order accurate scheme for spatial and first order accurate scheme for temporal discretization i e backward euler scheme the linearized system of equation is solved using alternating direction implicit adi method peaceman et al 1955 whose effectiveness has been proved by researchers for solving richards equation an et al 2011 the model benefits form a simple under relaxation paniconi and putti 1994 and dynamic time stepping techniques a common approach that changes the size of current time step based on number of iterations in the previous time step an and noh 2014 that help model avoid oscillatory solutions and superfluous calculations finally zha et al 2017 s technique is added to improve the robustness of model this technique helps model avoid divergence when water infiltrates into a very dry soil zha et al 2017 defined two parameters at the rising left and falling right limbs of water capacity function called œà dry and œà wet they asserted that the iterative process is very likely to diverge when solution jumps from œà dry to œà wet at one iteration therefore they suggested an algorithm to prevent iterative process diverge when solution for pressure head passes the peak of water capacity function at one iteration for more details one is referred to zha et al 2017 2 2 one dimensional saint venant equation water flow in the gallery of the qanat is simulated using fully hydrodynamic form of one dimensional saint venant equation as follows 7 u t f x s where u is the vector of conservative variables f is the vector of fluxes and s is the vector of source terms 8 u a v a f va v 2 a g a y s q ex s v f c g a s 0 s f where a is cross sectional area l 2 v is cross sectional averaged velocity l t 1 y is the depth from the free surface to the centroid of the wetted channel cross section l g is gravitational acceleration l t 2 f c is the component of the hydrostatic force in the flow direction exerted by the channel walls l 3 t 2 s 0 is the channel bed slope and s f is friction or energy slope friction slope can be calculated using empirical equations such as manning strickler or ch√©zy formulae in this study manning strickler formula has been used q ex s v represents the water exchange rate between gallery of the qanat and the soil block embracing it the momentum of lateral flow has been neglected in eq 8 as it is expected to have insignificant influence in overland flow in gallery eq 7 is a hyperbolic equation that can be solved both implicit and explicit discretization the superiority of the explicit schemes over implicit schemes is that the equation can be solved non iteratively therefore solution speed is expected to increase significantly however time step in explicit schemes for saint venant equations is controlled by courant number explicit schemes are commonly stable for the courant numbers under unity whereas implicit schemes can be stable for larger courant numbers and hence larger time steps can be taken therefore the trade off between the size of time step and the solution speed at each time step can determine the efficient scheme for overland flow since water flow within gallery of the qanat is unlikely to reach large courant numbers herein the explicit cell centered finite volume scheme of sanders 2001 has been employed to solve saint venant equation sanders 2001 scheme employs second order accurate spatiotemporal discretization because this method benefits from hancock s predictor corrector scheme bradford and katopodes 1999 and high resolution limiters sweby 1984 such as superbee limiter hirsch 2007 sanders 2001 model is a total variation diminishing tvd scheme that avoids oscillatory solutions at the propagating wetting front using this method two forms of saint venant equations should be solved in two main steps at the first step i e predictor step the primitive form of the one dimensional saint venant equations is solved at the half time step n 1 2 to find an estimation of conservative variables a and v at the next time step n 1 the primitive form of saint venant equations is as follows 9 a t v a x a v x q ex s v 10 v t g h x v v x g s 0 s f where h is the water depth in the gallery of qanat at the second main step corrector step eq 7 is integrated directly over a full time step to find the solution at the next time step as follows 11 u i n 1 u i n Œ¥ t Œ¥ x f i 1 2 n 1 2 f i 1 2 n 1 2 Œ¥ t 0 f c i n 1 2 Œ¥ t 2 0 g a s 0 s f i n q ex s v g a s 0 s f i n 1 as shown in eq 11 vector of source terms have been split into two terms sanders 2001 referred to eq 11 as a semi implicit discretization and claimed that this approach would help model avoid instabilities associated with the friction at the wet dry interface the same approach was applied on eqs 9 and 10 at the predictor level for the same reason the important feature of eq 11 is that it requires fluxes to be evaluated at the cell interfaces using predicted values i e at the half time level to accomplish this sanders 2001 model employs muscl monotonic upwind scheme for conservation laws extrapolation technique to obtain interfacial water depth and in turn interfacial cross sectional wetted area and velocity using muscl extrapolation method interfacial conservative variables are constructed by the lines with limited locally defined slope using slope limiters these lines should spring from cell centers and extend toward cell interfaces muscl extrapolation does not necessarily result in the same values at the left u l and right u r sides of each interface these discontinuous conservative values define riemann problem at each interface in order to calculate interfacial fluxes through an irregularly shaped cross section locally linearized riemann problem should be solved in this paper roe 1981 s interface flux has been used 12 f 1 2 f l f r a u Œ¥ u where f l and f r are the flux vectors computed with muscl extrapolated values at the left and right hand side of each interface respectively Œ¥ u is the difference between conservative variables on the right and left hand side of the interface and a u is the linearized jacobian matrix a u is the jacobian matrix defined as df d u calculated by eq 13 13 a u r Œª l where Œª is the diagonal matrix containing the absolute values of all the eigenvalues of a u r and l represent the matrices of right and left eigenvectors respectively the three under caret matrices on the right hand of eq 13 consist of arrays that should be calculated using roe averaging method the approach for calculation of each array has been explained in sanders 2001 2 3 coupling overland and subsurface equations qanat is a hydraulic structure in which water is in exchange with the groundwater or unsaturated soil block embracing it groundwater can move toward the gallery of qanat recharge or it can leak out of the gallery in order to simulate interactions of the gallery of the qanat and the saturated unsaturated soil around it overland and subsurface flow equations must be solved simultaneously coupling overland subsurface flows must be accomplished through a switching boundary condition across the gallery soil gs interface herein a fine tuned version of seepage face boundary condition has been employed across the gs interface in the following coupling procedure for overland and subsurface equations at the gs interface has been described iterative process starts with solving two dimensional richards equation at the separate vertical planes for one full time step considering boundary conditions fig 2 the above mentioned fine tuned seepage face boundary condition hereinafter called gs boundary condition helps water infiltrate to the gallery or leaks out of it the gs boundary condition employs no flow condition for the 2d control volume in vicinity of gallery providing that this control volume is in unsaturated state and the free surface of water flowing inside the gallery is below this 2d control volume if the soil is either saturated or water inside the gallery covers the 2d control volume dirichlet boundary with the pressure head equal to water depth inside the gallery is applied for richards equation the water exchange rate at the intersection of qanat gallery and the aquifer embracing it i e across the gs boundary in fig 2 is calculated using darcy buckingham equation note that darcy buckingham equation is calculated at the cell face of all control volumes in vicinity of gs interface fig 2 left part however these in outflows distributed across the gs boundary are integrated to obtain total in outflow at gs boundary of each vertical plane the rationale behind this integration is that 1d saint venant equation calls for cross sectional values of source sink terms using quasi 3d scheme for richards equation the distance between the vertical planes does not affect the convergence of the subsurface module however the vertical planes are connected to each other through the source sink terms imposed by the gs boundary more precisely the water sunk from the upstream vertical plane is added to the saint venant equation as a source term carried along gallery of the qanat in form of overland flow and may leak out to the downstream vertical planes since the distance between vertical planes are quiet high saint venant equation requires additional nodes between the planes to help model s convergence the cell centered scheme employed to solve the saint venant equation causes all computational nodes to be located between two contiguous gs boundaries for each of which integrated exchange rates were calculated in previous steps as shown in fig 2 the interface of the 1d control volumes coincide the gs interfaces the source sink terms for each 1d control volume can be reasonably estimated through a linear interpolation of integrated exchange rates between two contiguous gs boundary at the final step saint venant equation is solved considering the interpolated source sink values the coupling process would be repeated until system converges 2 4 atmospheric boundary condition the upper boundary of the vertical planes of quasi 3d richards equation is in contact with atmosphere therefore atmospheric boundary condition is required to be set at these boundaries this boundary condition accounts for evaporation and precipitation from the top boundary of each plane however actual transpiration is usually modeled mechanistically by integrating root water uptake within the root zone skaggs et al 2006 these approaches call for fine computational mesh in vicinity of top boundary therefore it imposes more computational cost and does not sound efficient in large scale domains to address this deficiency camporese et al 2014 proposed a so called boundary condition switching algorithm by which evapotranspiration can be applied on the top boundary without any need to the common calculations of root water uptake the well known algorithm for atmospheric boundary condition employs two main pressure head thresholds namely h min and œà min the former represents micro topography and roughness in other words overland water is allowed to flow when water pond is higher than h min the latter is used to switch between energy or atmosphere limited and soil limited evaporation stages when soil pressure head is larger than œà min neumann condition equal to potential evaporation is set at the top boundary while it remains equal to œà min dirichlet type boundary condition as soon as pressure head drops below œà min camporese et al 2015 showed that although boundary switching method is developed to model evaporation calibrating œà min properly the evaporative fluxes can be interpreted as evapotranspiration fluxes this method is suitable for large scale domains covered with shallow rooted vegetation not exceeding approximately 50 cm camporese et al 2015 since the gallery of qanats are usually long they affect a wide region furthermore in arid and semi arid regions qanats were established in the lands with poor vegetation consequently the above mentioned assumptions behind camporese et al 2014 s boundary switching approach are relatively valid in this study 3 results and discussion in this section the performance of the proposed model is assessed and validated against analytical numerical and experimental benchmarks due to the lack of comprehensive measured data to run a real qanat aquifer system the governing equations of the presented model have been validated separately with the above mentioned benchmarks root mean squared error r m s e 1 n max n 1 n max c n r n 2 where c is the calculated value by the presented model r is the reference value and n m a x is the total number of values and mean absolute error m a e 1 n max n 1 n max c n r n have been calculated to measure the accuracy of the presented model the soil constant parameters used in this section are shown in table 1 3 1 validation analytical solution for one and two dimensional infiltration into a homogeneous soil in this section the accuracy of the subsurface code is examined against one and two dimensional analytical solutions for infiltration in homogeneous soil while two dimensional test case examines steady state condition the one dimensional analytical solution describes transient water content distribution two dimensional steady state solution was provided by tracy 2006 for two and three dimensional problems the disadvantage of this solution is that it is only applicable to exponential water retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions fig 3 a shows the two dimensional problem for which tracy 2006 provided an analytical solution in this problem pressure head distribution in a a b rectangular soil block embraced by constant head boundary conditions is obtained at the steady condition while pressure head is uniformly distributed across left right and bottom boundaries i e œà 0 y œà a y œà x 0 h r on the top boundary pressure head has a nonlinear distribution the nonlinear distribution of the pressure head at the top boundary is described by the following function 14 œà x b 1 œï l n e œï h r 1 e œï h r 3 4 sin œÄ x a 1 4 sin 3 œÄ x 4 it yields zero pressure head in the middle i e œà a 2 b 0 0 and gradually decreases to h r on the corners of the top boundary the solution of the tracy 2006 was employed by ku et al 2017 to validate their meshless model for solving two dimensional richards equation they assumed a 50 m 10 m rectangular block packed with a hypothetical soil texture soil no 1 in table 1 embraced with pressure head of h r 20 m fig 3 b compares the simulation results of the presented model with those of ku et al 2017 and analytical solution of the tracy 2006 the presented model shows good agreement with analytical solution of tracy 2006 and numerical results of ku et al 2017 in the second test case transient infiltration process is simulated with the presented model and the results are compared to the semi analytical solution of cui and zhu 2018 the semi analytical solution of cui and zhu 2018 is based on traveling characteristics of wetting front and combines continuity equation and darcy buckingham flux to describe the evolution of water content profile using an ordinary differential equation the advantage of this method is that it can be applied to any soil texture and any descriptor of soil hydraulic properties even the highly nonlinear soil hydraulic functions of van genuchten 1980 water infiltration into a homogeneous silt loam soil block soil no 2 in table 1 is simulated and the water content profile is depicted at different time levels fig 4 boundary condition at the top boundary was set as dirichlet type with constant water content equal to Œ∏ 1 0 450 the lower boundary condition was considered as free drainage semi infinite soil block a uniform initial condition was set as Œ∏ 0 0 144 i e the water content corresponding to effective saturation equal to 0 2 and the total simulation time was 10 h water content profile at different time levels was simulated using numerical and semi analytical models and depicted in fig 4 the results obtained by numerical and semi analytical models are in complete agreement at different time steps 3 2 validation 2d in lab groundwater recharge discharge problem location of the water table has a dramatic impact on the recharge discharge from the gallery of the qanat in this section the capability of the model is examined for simulating the location of water table using the in lab dataset of vauclin et al 1979 and vauclin et al 1975 vauclin et al 1979 conducted an experiment in a 6 m 2 m box packed with sandy soil texture soil no 3 in table 1 van genuchten parameters for this test case were extracted from zha et al 2013 and ye et al 2016 water table was initially at 0 65 cm from the bottom of the box and the soil pressure head was assumed to be at hydrostatic equilibrium with water table at the unsaturated zone of the box fig 5 a constant water flux was applied on the top boundary of the sand box with intensity of 0 14791 m h 1 the water depth was kept constant at the right boundary of the sand box and the rest of the boundaries were set as no flow boundary condition moreover due to the symmetry of the experimental sand box and boundary conditions only half of the sand box 3 m was simulated to accelerate numerical calculation process zha et al 2013a employed the experimental dataset of vauclin et al 1979 to validate their noniterative 2d 3d numerical scheme to solve richards equation the location of water table simulated by the presented and zha et al 2013a s model along with the measured data of vauclin et al 1979 is demonstrated in fig 5 b at 2 3 4 and 8 h after the beginning of the experiment furthermore vauclin et al 1975 conducted a drainage experiment in the same box as vauclin et al 1979 with different initial and boundary conditions the water table was initially kept at 1 45 m from the bottom of the box left and bottom boundaries were the same as vauclin et al 1979 while there was no influx across the top boundary in vauclin et al 1975 at the beginning of the experiment water head dropped from 1 45 m to 0 75 m the box was filled with sandy soil texture whose van genuchten parameters was presented by clement et al 1994 and ye et al 2016 right boundary condition was set as constant head at the lower 0 75 m and seepage face across the rest of the boundary fig 5 c the location of water table simulated by the presented and wu 2010 s model along with the measured data of vauclin et al 1975 is shown in fig 5 d at 0 1 0 5 1 2 and 5 h after the beginning of the experiment measured and simulated results are entirely consistent in both test cases 3 3 validation kinematic wave rainfall runoff and dam break problems overland flow module is validated in this section against analytical experimental and numerical results available in the literature the first benchmark is the analytical solution for kinematic wave approximation of saint venant equations provided by eagleson 1970 to describe water flow on a slanted impermeable bed under uniform rainfall this analytical solution was employed by zhang et al 2018 to simulate flow depth hydrograph of a 500 m long parking lot with 0 01 m m slope and manning roughness coefficient of 0 005 s m 1 3 the intensity and duration of rainfall were 100 m m h r and 1500 s respectively and the simulation was continued for 5000 s fig 6 a compares flow depth hydrograph of the presented model with those obtained by the explicit scheme of chow et al 1988 full maccormack scheme of zhang et al 2018 and analytical solution of eagleson 1970 as shown the presented model is in agreement with other models and the rmse and mae of the presented model s hydrograph comparing to the analytical solution are 1 16 10 5 m and 3 88 10 5 m respectively in the second benchmark experimental dataset of katopodes and schamber 1983 along with numerical simulations of bradford and katopodes 2001 is selected to validate overland flow module against dam break problem in smooth and rough channels manning roughness coefficients of 0 009 and 0 05 s m 1 3 respectively the experiment of katopodes and schamber 1983 was conducted in a 121 98 m long channel with slope of 0 005 in the middle of which a 0 305 m high dam is located the dam was suddenly removed and the water inundates the channel this experiment was conducted two times while at the first experiment the channel was reported to be relatively smooth its roughness for the second experiment changed from 0 05 to 0 009 s m 1 3 fig 6 b compares the variations of water height at 7 62 m away from the dam after dam break obtained by the presented model two dimensional model of bradford and katopodes 2001 and measured data the simulated results show that the presented model have acceptably captured the variations of water height at the two experiments nevertheless at the smooth channel both models predict water height variations similarly while at the falling limb of hydrograph corresponding to the second experiment the two models predictions deviate from each other 3 4 application simulation of interactions between a hypothetical qanat gallery and groundwater aquifer in this section the model has been employed to simulate water flow within a 4000 m long gallery in vicinity of water table head over the collection section ten hypothetical qanats table 2 have been simulated using the proposed model to investigate the effect of reduced hydraulic conductivity of the soil in gs boundary representing the effect of clogging in the soil block near gallery of qanat manning roughness coefficient of the gallery and also the distance below gallery to the impermeable soil layer on the water flow rate at the appearance point of the gallery ordinarily interfacial hydraulic conductivity is calculated by arithmetic averaging k avg in trenchman 2d code in the presented model however k clg the interfacial hydraulic conductivity reduced by clogging is employed at the gs boundary which is defined as k r k avg where k r relative hydraulic conductivity is a prescribed coefficient between 0 for blocked to 1 for no clogging at the gs boundary fig 7 shows the two aquifer qanat systems used in this section both systems include a circular gallery with 1 m diameter dug through a loamy soil soil no 5 in table 1 whose slope is assumed to be 0 4 the slope of qanats gallery is commonly between 0 3 and 0 5 ahmadi et al 2010 the aquifers are 4000 m 90 m 90 m and 4000 m 90 m 66 5 m nine y z planes were set along x direction in which 2d richards equation is solved the boundary condition on the x y 0 z plane the locus of the points for which y 0 m in fig 7 a and b is assumed to be steady state implying that the water table is sufficiently far from the gallery in other words the solution domain along y axis is assumed so wide that the drawdown cone in vicinity of gallery does not violate the steady state water table assumption at the boundary y 0 m fig 2 this is why the length of domain along y direction is assumed to be 90 m in both aquifer qanat systems shown in fig 7 in order to obtain the above mentioned steady state water table 2d richards equation was solved in x y 0 z plane the code was run for a long time to ensure steady state solution to this end along the two vertical boundaries of the x y 0 z plane of the size 4000 m 90 m fig 7 a dirichlet condition was applied considering the location of water table i e water table at the upstream of x y 0 z plane was assumed to be 52 5 m and 10 m at the upstream and downstream respectively the pressure head across these boundaries was assumed to change hydrostatically in the unsaturated part the horizontal boundaries of the x y 0 z plane to solve 2d richards equation were set as no flow condition gs boundary condition was set across the 1 m diameter semicircle and for the other parts of the boundaries no flow condition was set for 4000 m 66 5 m plane the same procedure was applied but the floor plane the locus of the points for which z 0 m in fig 7 a and b was shifted 23 5 m upward each of the aquifer qanat systems whose properties are shown in table 2 were run for 300 hr to reach the steady state water depth and velocity profiles within the gallery of qanat for test case no 1 and 6 table 2 is shown in fig 8 these two test cases have been selected as baselines for the comparative study in the following sections the gallery of qanat was assumed to be initially dry although the above mentioned initial condition may seem unrealistic it highlights the performance of model when simulating different phenomena such as advance of overland wave inside gallery of qanat from the beginning to the steady state as shown in fig 8 a the amount of water infiltrated into the qanat at the collection section upstream of the gallery flows down the gallery and reaches the appearance point after 1 2 hr from this time onward water depth profile is accumulated at the downstream of the gallery up to when it reaches steady state i e 300 hr no sign of spurious oscillations so called wiggles can be seen in water depth profiles which have been calculated by continuity equation however velocity profiles which are calculated by momentum equation have been slightly affected by the wiggles at the wetting front this fact may have root in the friction slope term which is modeled by the empirical manning equation water head in the denominator of the manning equation may arise instability in momentum equation furthermore there exist a steep change of velocity at the wetting front this gradient may impose instability for calculation of momentum flux spatial derivatives of eq 7 almost the same trend can be observed in the evolution of water depth and velocity profiles of run no 6 fig 8 b and d respectively from the beginning to the steady state however steady state water depth at the appearance point of the test case no 1 is 0 37 m while it is 0 44 m for run no 6 the steady state velocity at the same location for test case no 1 and 6 are 1 03 and 0 97 m s 1 respectively therefore different gallery outflow rates is expected to occur in run no 1 and run no 6 fig 9 compares the variations of gallery outflow from appearance point of the gallery during 300 hr for different variables presented in table 2 in all cases gallery outflow has a rising rate at the beginning and after it reaches a maximum value it gradually falls to the steady state outflow rate this outflow pattern implies that the initial groundwater head over collection section is extracted by the gallery due to the water pressure gradient inside and outside of the gs boundary water flows down the gallery and leaks to the unsaturated soil embracing conveyance section as the time passes the water pressure head in vicinity of the gallery decreases up to the time that water extraction rate from the groundwater to the gallery at the collection section and leakage from the gallery to the unsaturated zone at the conveyance section reach an equilibrium this is when outflow hydrograph reaches steady state fig 9 a shows the influence of saturated hydraulic conductivity of gs boundary only k s across the curvature of gallery on the outflow hydrograph in an aquifer qanat system of size 4000 m 90 m 90 m fig 7 a the saturated hydraulic conductivity has been reduced by 25 and 50 in test case no 2 and 3 comparing to no 1 this reduction made steady state outflow rate to decrease from 269 l s 1 for run no 1 to 198 and 129 l s 1 for no 2 and 3 respectively which is equivalent to 26 and 52 reduction comparing to run 1 the same trend is observed for the 4000 m 90 m 66 5 m aquifer qanats fig 9 b the steady state gallery outflow for the baseline run no 6 is 322 l s 1 by 25 and 50 reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity of gs boundary the steady state outflow rate has been decreased for 27 and 74 respectively in fig 9 c and d the variations of outflow rate has been compared in terms of a change in manning roughness coefficient increasing manning roughness coefficient from 0 02 s m 1 3 baselines to 0 03 s m 1 3 run no 4 and 9 led to an increase in steady state outflow rate on the contrary a reduction in manning roughness coefficient from 0 02 s m 1 3 baselines to 0 01 s m 1 3 run no 5 and 10 has yielded less steady state outflow rates comparing to baselines this fact can be justified by the depth and velocity of water inside gallery the average water depth and velocity at the steady state for run no 9 is 0 25 m and 0 53 m s 1 respectively while these values are 0 13 m and 1 12 m s 1 respectively for run no 10 therefore an increase in manning roughness coefficient results in an enhancement of average water depth but it lowers velocity on the other hand this fact should be considered that rising water depth in a circular channel will increase hydraulic radius i e wetted area divided by wetted perimeter and that the leakage from gallery is only through the circumference of the circular gallery consequently as water depth rises less fraction of water flown in the gallery is exposed to the leaking boundary along the conveyance section gs boundary and more fraction of water can be conveyed to the appearance point fig 10 shows the pressure head distribution and streamlines of the aquifer qanat system for the two baselines at the steady state it can be observed that at the collection section groundwater table approaches to the gallery of the qanat and flow direction is from the groundwater to the gallery on the contrary in the conveyance section flow direction is from the gallery to the aquifer 4 conclusions in this paper a numerical model has been presented for simulation of water flow in an aquifer qanat system to this end 1d fully hydrodynamic saint venant is coupled with a quasi 3d form of richards equation using finite volume approach the quasi 3d form of richards equation is developed using trenchman 2d a numerical code originally developed for simulation of stormwater infiltration trenches the presented model is validated using analytical numerical and experimental benchmarks in all cases the results obtained by model agreed well with the benchmarks eventually the model was verified through a numerical experiment in which a 4000 m circular gallery was considered within a homogenous loamy aquifer the simulation was continued to reach steady state solution not surprisingly the results showed that by reducing saturated hydraulic conductivity of gs boundary will result in a decrease in steady state outflow rate however by decreasing manning roughness coefficient water depth and hydraulic radius will increase and consequently more fraction of flowing water will reach the appearance point this paper showed that the model is capable of simulating primary phenomena regarding an aquifer qanat system more complicated phenomena concerning this system as well as comparing this model with an in lab experimental model or comparison with in situ measurement in a real qanat remain ongoing for
