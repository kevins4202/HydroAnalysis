10355,canada is one of the top wheat grain exporters with a share of more than 10 in the world wheat market the majority of canadian wheat production takes place in the prairies where 6 2 million ha of the area is seeded to spring wheat the climate is semiarid with an estimated precipitation deficit of about 300 mm during the crop growing season indicating that water is the primary limiting factor for crop production in this study three dssat wheat models csm ceres cropsim nwheat were used to quantify the impacts of water management practices on crop water stress and wheat yields the models were evaluated individually and as an ensemble against observed wheat performance using three field experiments conducted to investigate irrigation rainfed and summer fallow impacts on wheat yields the results showed that all three wheat models well simulated grain yield gains with irrigation and summer fallow that conserved additional soil water statistically the multimodel ensemble improved the accuracy in simulating grain yields and biomass of spring wheat under both irrigated and rainfed conditions the improvements could not be linked to eco physiological processes in crop systems and the increased simulation accuracy was likely due to the offsetting effects of simulation bias and errors from the individual models water input precipitation irrigation of 400 mm was sufficient to reach the highest yield of spring wheat cultivars in the canadian prairies irrigation of 200 mm was able to alleviate most of the crop water stress in the study region further simulation scenarios showed that irrigating spring wheat when soil moisture was below 50 of available water capacity awc for plants led to high yield low irrigation rates and reduced evaporation for different soil textures combined with improved drought tolerance varieties this irrigation regime provides good prospects for increasing wheat yield and water use efficiency keywords irrigation rainfed summer fallow model ensemble soil moisture water use efficiency 1 introduction a total of 9 11 million ha of crop land is used for wheat triticum aestivum l production in canada canadian wheat 2018 canada exports 70 of its produced wheat grains with a share of 11 15 in the global wheat market in the past decade faostat 2019 more than 90 of canadian spring wheat is produced in the prairies a main agricultural region located in the southern part of three provinces alberta saskatchewan and manitoba in western canada where about 6 2 million ha of cropland are seeded to spring wheat canadian wheat 2018 the semiarid climate in the prairies does not often provide sufficient precipitation for crop growth during the growing season de jong et al 2008 water availability is considered the primary limiting factor for crop production in the semiarid prairies campbell et al 2007 the low yields of spring wheat in exceptionally dry years can even result in a loss of all profitability suggesting that there are significant opportunities available to further increase wheat productivity for this region if water limitation issues can be addressed irrigation is definitely the most effective method to overcome drought stress in crop production however less than 5 of field crops mostly in the province of alberta were irrigated in the canadian prairies in 2012 statistics canada 2012 limited availability of extractable water restricts the potential expansion of the irrigated area in the canadian prairies highest water use efficiency of the scarce water resource can be achieved through precision irrigation bernier et al 2010 but this needs to be quantified for the water demand and water stress during the crop growing season site specific irrigation based on crop demands and soil moisture is gaining ground to improve crop yield in arid and semiarid regions neupane and guo 2019 climate change is likely to lower water availability for rainfed production in the future due to changes in the seasonality of precipitation and increasing fraction of winter precipitation as rain to run off in the canadian prairie kulshreshtha and kulshreshtha 2014 summer fallow has been recognized as an effective practice to conserve soil water and minimize yield variability for rainfed production campbell et al 1983 farahani et al 1998 long term experiments showed that summer fallow conserved additional soil water to increase seasonal grain yields but with reduced total grain productions over a long period campbell et al 1987 zentner et al 2006 long term field experiments are very time and cost intensive hence they are limited to illustrate crop responses to those initially designed management practices and are difficult to extrapolate crop performances under emerging new technologies and changing environments beyond the experimental sites and periods crop growth models on the other hand represent an efficient and effective way to assess the impacts of alternative managements on cropping systems under different environments and allow for spatial extrapolation to estimate regional level production and water requirements well validated crop growth models characterizing crop soil atmospheric interactions in association with crop management have been successfully used to investigate crop performance under both single model and multimodel ensembles jing et al 2007 asseng et al 2013 bassu et al 2014 li et al 2015a jing et al 2017 since the 1980s numerous crop models have been developed to simulate wheat growth van keulen and seligman 1987 brisson et al 2003 jones et al 2003 keating et al 2003 van ittersum et al 2003 the csm ceres wheat model in dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer hoogenboom et al 2019 is one of the most widely used models recently the cropsim and nwheat models have been adapted and included in the dssat framework to simulate wheat development and growth but they have yet to be evaluated and applied in ensembles to assess water management practices for spring wheat production the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the performances of dssat wheat models csm ceres cropsim nwheat under different water managements including rainfed low to high irrigation levels and summer fallow for water conservation 2 quantify the impacts of water management practices on crop water stress and wheat yield using the evaluated crop models 2 materials and methods the soils in the prairies used for agricultural production are represented primarily by the brown dark brown and black soil zones fuller 2010 the climate is semiarid in the brown soil zone with 275 325 mm of annual precipitation compared to the slightly wetter dark brown with 325 375 mm and black soil zones with 400 475 mm willms et al 2011 about 70 of the precipitation occurs during the crop growing season from may to september based on the 1981 2010 climate normal in the canadian prairies environment and climate change canada 2019

swift current a site in the brown soil zone de jong et al 2008 2 1 field experiments the data used in this study were obtained from three field experiments conducted in the prairies the soil properties at each experimental site are provided in table 1 for different layers in the 0 120 cm soil profile details of these experiments are summarized in table 2 for irrigation and n levels cultivars and crop measurements 2 1 1 experiment i irrigated and rainfed spring wheat the irrigation experiment was carried out at swift current 50 2 n 107 4 w in the semiarid environment of the brown soil zone in southwestern saskatchewan in three consecutive years 1996 1998 details of the experiment can be found in angadi et al 2008 and only key agronomic information is presented here spring wheat cultivar katepwa was seeded with a row spacing of 20 cm under irrigated and rainfed conditions on may 31 in 1996 may 6 in 1997 and april 22 in 1998 the irrigation and rainfed treatments were established on a previously fallowed field during the experiment grassy and broadleaf weeds were controlled using a combination of pre emergence and post emergence granular herbicides that were applied in late fall and early spring the field was tilled with one to three operations using a small field cultivator with harrow attachment to control weeds and to incorporate excess straw precipitation and periodic irrigation maintained soil moisture levels above 50 of the available water capacity awc the amounts of 89 127 and 71 mm water were irrigated during the growing season in these three years 1996 1998 respectively the seeding rates were 73 92 kg ha 1 achieving an average of 99 plants m 2 with a range from 56 to 148 plants m 2 about 17 23 kg p2o5 ha 1 as monoammonium phosphate 11 51 0 was seed placed to supplement the residual p measured in the top 15 cm of the soil layer a total n rate of 31 42 kg ha 1 was applied as ammonium nitrate at seeding for each year to achieve a recommended n rate of 75 kg n ha 1 based on a fall soil test on available n in the top 60 cm soil profile at maturity two 1 m2 samples from irrigated and rainfed plots were manually harvested to measure total above ground biomass and grain yield on a dry matter basis weather data including daily maximum and minimum air temperatures precipitation and wind speed were measured at a meteorological station located within 1 km from the experimental field solar radiation data were measured at a nearby weather station swift current cda 50 27 n 107 73 w the data in 1998 were used to calibrate the crop models 2 1 2 experiment ii irrigation n fertilizer the experiment was conducted at two sites in southern alberta to test the interaction effects of n rates and irrigation levels on grain yield of hard red spring wheat cultivar neepawa spring wheat was seeded on a tilley loam soil at rolling hills 50 25 n 111 77 w on may 5 in 1982 and on a cranford sandy clay loam at rainier 50 38 n 112 09 w on april 29 in 1983 details of the experiment can be found in campbell et al 1997 and only key agronomic information is presented here soil samples were taken by 30 cm increments to 120 cm and soil water content was gravimetrically measured for four soil layers throughout the growing season in 1982 and 1983 the treatments included four levels of irrigation and three n rates under each irrigation level irrigation treatments included 10 156 242 385 mm of water applied during the wheat growing season and three n rates were 22 72 132 kg ha 1 in 1982 in 1983 the four irrigation levels were 3 157 165 254 mm and three n rates were 45 95 155 kg n ha 1 in our simulations irrigation dates were estimated using the csm ceres wheat model by setting the field to be irrigated to 100 of awc in 0 30 cm soil layer when soil moisture in this layer depleted to below 50 of awc a total of seven irrigation applications occurred in 1982 and eight in 1983 and the amount of irrigated water in the experiment was evenly distributed among the irrigation applications for each irrigation treatment for each n treatment 22 kg n ha 1 was seed placed in 1982 and 13 kg n ha 1 in 1983 the remaining was broadcasted in late may weather data including temperature and precipitation were recorded at the station brooks ahrc 50 55 n 111 85 w of environment and climate change canada https weather gc ca canada e html and solar radiation was observed at the station suffield 50 27 n 111 18 w for 1982 and 1983 the spring wheat was harvested at the end of august and yields were measured except in the year where the observations were lost for the irrigation treatment level of 157 mm in 1983 the data in 1982 were used to calibrate the three crop models 2 1 3 experiment iii continuous wheat and fallow wheat rotations the experiment was located in the south farm of the agriculture canada research station at swift current 50 283 n 107 8 w saskatchewan under rainfed conditions the soil was a swinton loam an orthic brown chernozem the soil properties were summarized in table 1 and in kersebaum et al 2008 this rotation study included 12 crop rotation treatments that have been reported in many papers along with this ongoing experiment since 1967 campbell et al 2004 2000 1987 1983 de jong et al 2011 2008 only the treatments of continuous wheat w w and summer fallow wheat f w rotations in 1967 2017 were used in this study details of the experiment can be found in the aforementioned references and only key agronomic information is presented here two plots were assigned to the f w rotation in each replicate so that wheat growth after summer fallow can be measured each year the cultivars were updated through time as shown in table 2 spring wheat was seeded from may 1 to may 26 with an average on may 11 fertilizer n rates were applied in accordance with soil nitrate n contents in the top 60 cm soil layer that were measured in mid october campbell et al 2004 from 1967 to 1989 the n rates recommended by the soil testing laboratory of the university of saskatchewan were applied to bring the total mineral n soil test fertilizer n to 65 kg n ha 1 since 1990 the total mineral n recommended by the updated guideline increased to 90 kg n ha 1 for wheat grown on summer fallow and to 73 kg n ha 1 for wheat grown on stubble fertilizer n as ammonium nitrate was applied by broadcasting with varied n rates year to year table a 1 before seedbed preparation weed was controlled by a combination of mechanical tillage mainly cultivator and rod weeder and herbicides as required the 2 4 d was applied to control winter annual weeds in the fall in crop weed control generally involved the use of bromoxynil plus mcpa e 1 1 and tralkoxydim applied at the recommended rate campbell et al 2004 above ground plant biomass was sampled at the three leaf five leaf shot blade flag leaf complete soft dough growth stages and at harvest from 1967 to 1984 after 1984 biomass was only measured at harvest the above ground biomass was determined after drying at 70 c grain yields were harvested at the full ripe stage by cutting a swath 5 m wide and 40 m long through the middle of the plot with a conventional combine grain yield and biomass at harvest were missing in 1988 for w w and in 1983 for f w soil moistures were measured at all plots prior to seeding shortly after harvest and again just prior to freeze up in the fall from 1967 to 2000 soil cores were sampled across five soil layers of 0 15 15 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 cm in depth additional measurements of soil moisture were conducted at aforementioned crop growth stages from 1967 to 1984 the measured bulk densities of these soil layers reported in read et al 1983 were used to convert measured gravimetric soil water content to volumetric units weather data from the same station for experiment i and located 1 km from the experimental field was used the crop models were calibrated for each wheat cultivar using one year of crop data during its growing season i e cultivar chinook in 1967 canuck in 1975 leader in 1983 lancer in 1996 ac barrie in 1997 and eatonia in 2000 and lillian in 2006 2 2 wheat models three wheat models in dssat v4 7 were used csm ceres csm nwheat and csm cropsim hoogenboom et al 2019 the csm ceres wheat model was adapted from the model ceres to simulate wheat in dssat jones and kiniry 1986 jones et al 2003 ritchie and otter 1985 the csm cropsim wheat model was developed in canada to simulate wheat growth and development with the assumption that crop is comprised of uniform plants hunt and pararajasingham 1995 the csm nwheat wheat model was adapted from the apsim wheat model keating et al 2003 all the three models simulate wheat growth and development on a daily step in each of these models crop development rate is mainly governed by thermal time daily plant growth is computed by converting daily intercepted photosynthetically active radiation par into plant biomass using crop specific radiation use efficiency rue the amount of new biomass available for daily growth may also be modified by water or n stresses and temperature nitrogen stress occurs when crop n demand is greater than n supply daily demand for n is calculated from biomass growth rates and n concentrations of the plant organs the soil water module ritchie 1998 used by all three wheat models in dssat computes daily changes in soil water content by soil layer due to infiltration of rainfall and irrigation vertical drainage unsaturated flow soil evaporation and root water uptake processes water stress is calculated as a fraction using potential and actual transpiration of the crop potential transpiration is calculated using the priestley taylor relation priestley and taylor 1972 actual transpiration is modified using lai soil evaporation and soil water content the n sources are fertilizer atmospheric deposition and mineralized n that is calculated by a soil organic matter som model two som modules are optional in dssat the default is an original som module based on the ceres model godwin and jones 1991 godwin and singh 1998 the other was developed by gijsman et al 2002 based on the century model parton et al 1994 which is recommended by the dssat group and was used for all three models in this study the transport of n as ammonium and nitrate n in each soil layer is associated with water flux obtained from the soil water module these three models were originally developed for different purposes leading to differences in model structure source code and input data the models structures are all complex with many feedbacks at the process level we therefore describe the most significant differences among these three models relevant to this study table 3 specific lai varies with development stage in csm nwheat and the same value is used from emergence to maturity in the csm ceres and csm cropsim models the rue is modified by par in the csm nwheat model the co2 factor is calculated by a nonlinear function of environmental co2 concentration and daily mean temperature as published in reyenga et al 1999 which affects plant growth and transpiration in the csm nwheat model the co2 impact factor is interpolated with the environmental co2 concentration and only affects biomass accumulation in the csm ceres and csm cropsim models development rate is modified by water stress in the csm ceres and csm nwheat models while it is not in the csm cropsim model root growth decreases but root depth increases with increasing water stress in the csm ceres and csm nwheat models alternately only partitioning to root increases in the csm cropsim model 2 3 evaluation of crop models the site specific experimental information was used to provide model inputs of soil weather cultivar and crop management practices the measured global environmental co2 concentrations in each year included and updated in dssat were used to simulate crop growth the models redistributed the soil information to align with model specified soil layers in the simulations each cultivar was calibrated with data indicated in the aforementioned site descriptions and evaluated with the rest of the data noted as the validation dataset during the calibration process the targeted parameters were gradually tuned within their biological ranges defined in the model input files to minimize the differences between measured and simulated attribute values the calibrated parameters for each cultivar in this study are listed in table a 2 the calibrated model was then evaluated using the independent validation data by comparing the simulated attribute values to measured ones the models were used to simulate crop biomass yield soil water content water stress and soil water balance etc the models were initialized for each experimental year in simulating spring wheat for experiments i and ii in simulating spring wheat for experiment iii the models were only initialized in 1966 and then continuously simulated spring wheat growth for w w and f w from 1967 to 2017 2 4 irrigation scenarios improving irrigation management is an important potential application of dssat to demonstrate the capability of the models for assessing the effects of water managements we evaluated the frequency of irrigation on yield of irrigated wheat for three soil types sandy loam loam and clay loam with clay sand components percentages of 10 65 18 42 and 34 33 respectively the three soils were used as representative major soils for simulating crop yields in the prairies qian et al 2019 the irrigation simulations were conducted for continuous wheat from 1967 to 2017 using cultivar ac barrie with no n stress no n stresses were implemented by applying n fertilizer at 200 kg ha 1 and results revealed that no additional yields were simulated with n fertilizer above 200 kg n ha 1 at the study sites by all three models the widely used method of sprinkler irrigation in canada statistics canada 2016 was selected the modern irrigation systems are usually equipped with intelligent technologies that can automatically irrigate following input of monitoring information critical irrigation parameters e g soil moisture and irrigation depth are important for the automated irrigation systems to improve water management neupane and guo 2019 the fields were irrigated based on water storage to six depths ranging from 10 to 60 cm and the automated irrigation was triggered by five levels of available soil moisture for plant uptake ranging from 30 to 70 of the available soil water capacity in the corresponding depth the six gradients of soil depths five levels of soil moistures for irrigation and three soil textures resulted in 90 simulations scenario combinations 2 5 data analysis the simulated y and measured x aboveground biomass hereafter denoted as biomass and yields by the three crop models were graphically plotted and compared the mean of simulated values by three models i e the ensemble mean of the crop models that is denoted as e mean was calculated to compare with the observed values the standard errors se among the three models were computed statistical criteria were used to assess the performance of individual model and e mean a paired t test p t was also applied the root mean square error rmse and the normalized rmse nrmse rmse divided by the mean of measured value x between measured and simulated values were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 where n is the number of measurements model simulation efficiency ef mean error me and its relative value rme and index of agreement d between the simulated and measured values were also calculated using eqs 3 6 as in willmott 1982 and beaudoin et al 2008 an optimal model reproduces experimental data with ef and d close to 1 0 rmse and me close to 0 the nrmse is generally deemed good and acceptable when it is less than 20 and 30 respectively 1 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 0 5 2 nrmse

calculated and plotted for simulated e mean with se and measured data for w w and f w in experiment iii the cumulative frequency was also calculated for the simulated water stress in experiment iii soil water balances input and output for the fallow and wheat growing periods in the soil profile were quantified using eq 7 the equation was adapted from the water balance method used in csm ceres wheat ritchie and otter 1985 hoogenboom et al 2019 the seeding and harvest dates were used to clarify the initial and final soil water for those two periods 7 w ini p i w fin d r e t where wini the initial soil water p precipitation i irrigation wfin final soil water d drainage r runoff e evaporation and t transpiration subsequently the conserved water in a soil profile wfin wini was calculated for a selected period the three quadrant diagram was adopted to show the relationships between water input grain yield and transpiration in experiment ii in analogy with the three quadrant diagram for n issues jing et al 2009 van keulen 1982 the diagram is used to analyze crop response to water input and water use efficiency with water inputs precipitation irrigation and transpirations the contour diagram is used to compare and analyze the impacts of irrigation strategies on yields 3 results 3 1 experiment i the three crop models generally performed well in simulating wheat grain yield and biomass with simulated values close to measured values for both irrigated and rainfed spring wheat at swift current for the three years from 1996 to 1998 fig 1 the simulated biomass somewhat differed among the three models but simulated grain yields were consistent the e mean showed good estimation of biomass with nrmse of 6 7 d of 0 9 and ef of 0 33 table 4 the e mean of grain yield was close to the measured with a difference of 266 kg ha 1 and the simulation was considered good with a nrmse of 15 3 2 experiment ii at low irrigation levels of 10 mm in 1982 and 3 mm in 1983 the measured grain yield showed no increase with increasing n fertilizer rates while the measured grain yield increased with increasing n fertilizer rates under high irrigation levels of greater than 150 mm fig 2 indicating interactions of irrigation levels with n fertilizer rates the changes in grain yield to the irrigation and n rates were reproduced by the three models although the three models showed differences in their performances especially for the irrigation level of 3 mm in 1983 the e mean gave an excellent simulation with nrmse of 7 7 d close to 1 0 and ef of 0 9 table 4 a three quadrant diagram showed that the responses of grain yields to water input irrigation precipitation levels were significantly affected by n rates and vice versa fig 3a quadrant i the yield gaps between high and low n rates were lower for the measured data than for the simulated at each irrigation level indicating that grain yield responses to n rates were slightly overestimated grain yields levelled off greatly at water input of 400 mm for both high and low n rates suggesting that the models adequately simulated the response of grain yield to water stress although the simulated yield reached the plateau with slightly less water inputs than the measured at higher fertilizer rate both the measurements and the modelled results suggested that a total water input of 400 mm irrigation precipitation would be sufficient to reach the highest yield gain for spring wheat in this region this amount of water input led to a high water use efficiency of 19 kg mm 1 transpiration fig 3a quadrant ii and additional water input would barely increase yield gain but result in high water loss fig 3a quadrant iii the simulations and measurements showed comparable water input requirements in 1983 though less than 400 mm water input could reach the yield plateau fig 3b a lower water input was possible due to the different soils table 1 and variations in distributions and amounts of precipitations between the two years 3 3 experiment iii the year to year variations of simulated yields were mostly consistent among the three models and similar to the changes in measured yields except for some years where the simulations dispersed among the three models fig 4a the inter annual fluctuation in yields of e mean mostly matched well with the measured yields indicating a good simulation for grain yield in response to crop growth stresses the simulations reproduced the lower grain yields of w w relative to f w as was observed table 4 the model ensembles improved the accuracy of the simulations the simulations on yield using multimodel ensembles were satisfactory with rmse less than 465 kg ha 1 d greater than 0 92 and ef greater than 0 68 the final biomass varied much from year to year both in simulated and measured values fig 4b the e mean showed better simulation results on biomass with the smallest rmse and highest d and ef compared to any individual model alone table 4 it is noted that the variation of measured biomass across years was reduced under f w with a coefficient of variation cv of 37 versus 43 for w w suggesting mitigation of water stress due to summer fallow this inter annual variation of biomass was reproduced by e mean with a cv of 34 for f w and 44 for w w indicating that the models adequately simulated the impacts of summer fallow on reducing growth variability with less crop water stress in years with low annual precipitation the simulated accumulations of biomass e mean were close to the measured values for w w and f w from 1967 to 1984 at swift current fig a 1 in most years the observed biomass of f w were higher than w w except for three years 1967 1969 and 1975 when no remarkable differences were found between w w and f w suggesting no direct benefit from conserved soil moisture for summer fallow in these years the cumulative frequencies of grain yields for e mean matched quite well with that of measured values reflected by the measured yields mostly overlapping the simulations fig 5 this suggests a reliable wheat production estimation under contrasting climatic conditions in the models the water stress is calculated as a fraction that ranges from 0 with no stress to 1 with full stress no water stresses were simulated in more than 10 years for f w while fewer than 5 years for w w in vegetative or reproductive phases fig 6 the estimated water stress exceeded 0 1 in 9 years for f w and in 28 years for w w during wheat vegetative phase if we define severe water stress as values exceeding 0 5 then severe water stress occurred in more years for the reproductive phase than for vegetative phase during reproductive phase severe water stress occurred in 13 years for f w and in 29 years for w w out of the 51 years tested the cumulative frequency of water stress showed that summer fallow significantly reduced the number of years with severe water stresses in particular during grain filling phase the measured values versus simulated e means for soil water storage mm were compared for w w and f w in fig a 2 from 1967 to 2000 the three crop models shared the same soil processes the simulated soil water contents varied slightly with small standard errors in most of the periods as expected the simulated soil moistures peaked after rainfall events and then decreased according to the statistical criteria table 5 the simulation of soil moisture for the second layer at 15 30 cm depth was better than for the top layer at 0 15 cm depth it is apparent that summer fallow increased soil water storage showing significantly higher values in most fallowing periods of f w than that of w w in the second soil layer 15 30 cm fig a 2b conserved water in soil was calculated with simulated soil moisture using eq 7 on average 40 mm water 21 of precipitation was conserved from wheat harvest to seeding in w w and 85 mm 16 of precipitation in f w therefore only an additional 45 mm of precipitation was conserved during summer fallow indicating that most of the precipitation received during summer fallow was lost 3 4 irrigation scenarios the irrigated spring wheat showed that grain yields increased with increasing number of irrigation events but plateaued at about 6 8 irrigation events for the three soil types fig 7 as expected evaporation increased with number of irrigation events there was a total range of 100 180 mm irrigation for the three soil types at 6 8 irrigation events with the least irrigation for sandy soil and the greatest for clay soil from the contour graphs in fig 7 irrigation events occurred more frequently when they were set to be triggered at higher percentage of awc and their number decreased when awc was considered at deeper depths irrigation when the percentage of awc was above 60 and depth of calculation was set to be less than 30 cm resulted in more than 8 irrigation events in contrast irrigation when the percentage of awc was less than 40 and irrigation depth was more than 40 cm led to less irrigation events however crop water stress which reduced yields became evident irrigating to a depth of 40 cm when the percentage of awc dropped below 50 corresponding to about 6 irrigation events led to high yields combined with low irrigated amounts and evaporated water for all three soil types 4 discussion 4 1 model evaluation the csm cropsim and csm nwheat models were evaluated to the best of our knowledge for the first time in canada since they were adapted to simulate wheat in dssat both models showed similarities in general to the csm ceres model in simulating biomass and grain yields of rainfed and irrigated spring wheat in the prairies despite of their general similar performances over three sets of experimental data the three wheat models showed some differences in nine years over the 51 year experimental and simulation period although the three wheat modes include some similarities for simulating wheat development and growth each model diverges in some aspects to reduce the simulation biases and variances the differences among the three models related to this study are described in table 3 the simulated yields and biomass by the three models distributed around the observed values as a result the e mean for grain yields by the three models improved simulation accuracy in experiment ii and iii the rmses were reduced and d and ef values increased but this improvement was not consistent such as an individual model outperformed the ensemble in experiment i table 4 similarly martre et al 2015 reported that multimodel ensembles taking either the mean e mean or median e median of simulated values improved the estimates considering all crop attributes but some individual models outperformed the ensemble for a specific crop attribute improved simulation accuracies by multimodel ensembles were also obtained for other crops like maize bassu et al 2014 and rice li et al 2015a we attribute the better performance of the multimodel ensembles to the mitigation of simulation bias variance among models statistically wallach et al 2018 the e mean of multimodel ensembles generally converging close to the true value is mainly because the errors in different models tend to compensate each other salo et al 2016 yin et al 2017 the multimodel ensembles approach can increase the simulation accuracy but not in all instances and it does not add to the explanatory power of crop eco physiological processes using e mean or e median the median of simulated values by models may make it difficult to verify the accuracy of each model and to explain differences in calculation processes among models yin et al 2017 whether multimodel ensembles can improve simulation accuracy depends on model selections wallach et al 2018 points out that multimodel ensembles might lead to worse simulation if models were selected with mostly positive or negative simulation results in a study using multiple models to simulate barley growth rötter et al 2012 salo et al 2016 it was found that if all the models are systematically wrong such as the case for estimating lai in the unfertilized treatment in 2009 in this study the multimodel ensembles may not help to improve simulation accuracy increasing the number of models in the multimodel ensembles can not guarantee a further improvement of simulations because the error of e mean and e median decreased little with an increasing number of ensemble members beyond 10 models martre et al 2015 yin et al 2017 reported that the e mean estimates regardless of using 12 models or 5 models provided good agreement with all the measured values for simulating grain n of different crops alternatively appropriate selection with a small number of model members can increase simulation accuracy ehrhardt et al 2018 found that an ensemble using only three models that produced the lowest error in simulating crop yields and n2o emissions performed similarly to a model ensemble with 24 models multimodel ensemble approaches using numerous models are much more time intensive than using a single model and it is indecisive in which models should be employed in the ensemble considering the purposes to use models to understand the underlying processes of crop growth and to facilitate the design of new management strategies aimed at sustainable production bouman et al 1996 the multimodel ensemble approaches are not an ideal solution to spur development and improve simulation accuracy and they should not be taken as a substitute towards the improvement of crop model structures and processes with newly emerging knowledge however given the fact that each individual crop model does have certain simulation bias and variance in representing the interaction processes in crop system our results show that multimodel ensembles are still a useful option to improve simulation accuracy while models continue to be developed the use of model ensembles requires the critical investigation of the included models considering in detail which processes leading to improved estimates in order to help avoiding unnecessarily large model ensembles that do little to highlight future model development needs part of the data from experiment iii and other experiments located close to experiment iii have been used to evaluate the performance of individual wheat model on grain yield given rmse values of 460 1020 kg ha 1 with nrmses greater than 29 grant et al 2016 he et al 2014 kersebaum et al 2008 li et al 2015b which are generally much higher than rmses of 465 470 kg ha 1 with nrmses of 19 25 table 4 that were obtained from e mean in this study the model ensembles also improved simulations for biomass at harvest with much smaller rmses of 1074 1309 kg ha 1 in this study than the previously reported rmses of 1785 1871 kg ha 1 using an individual model he et al 2014 part of the data from experiment iii were used to evaluate the hermes model to consecutively simulate soil moisture in the 0 120 cm soil profile kersebaum et al 2008 our simulation rmse 44 mm ef 0 23 showed better results than using the hermes model with rmse 52 mm and ef 0 4 2 irrigation to increase yield our study shows that total water input from precipitation and irrigation of 400 mm is sufficient to minimize water stress with water use efficiency decreasing beyond 400 mm for spring wheat production in the prairies fig 3 the total water input of up to 400 mm is supported by experimental studies in the prairies in a field study from 1996 to 1998 angadi et al 2008 and in a lysimeter study from 2006 to 2007 gan et al 2009 irrigation was applied for spring wheat to maintain soil moisture above 50 of awc with total water inputs of 240 330 mm to produce highest yields and improved crop water use efficiency mckenzie et al 2008 investigated the performance of spring wheat under optimum irrigated conditions in southern alberta from 2004 to 2006 they reported that total water inputs of 370 mm 56 mm would be sufficient to maintain soil moisture between 60 and 100 of awc during the crop growing season considering there is generally more than 210 mm precipitation during crop growing season environment and climate change canada 2019 and about 40 mm of water is conserved from harvest to seeding an irrigation amount of about 150 mm is sufficient to significantly reduce water stress and increase yield the increases in yield and biomass with irrigations ranging from 71 to 127 mm in three years in experiment i support our analysis by taking into account inter annual fluctuations in precipitation if we considered an irrigation efficiency of 75 due to water loss from storage conveyance and field application brouwer et al 1989 statistics canada 2016 200 mm of irrigation during the growing season would suffice to maximize spring wheat yield in the prairies in canada irrigation consumes 86 of the extracted water use for agriculture kulshreshtha and grant 2007 statistics showed that about 300 mm water was applied as irrigation in the study region in southern saskatchewan statistics canada 2012 this is greater than the estimated optimal amount for spring wheat as estimated in this study indicating that water use efficiency could be increased by improving irrigation management practices to better match soil moisture with crop demand for instance wheat at the reproductive phase generally requires more irrigation when the risk for water stress is high at a time when wheat response is more sensitive to stress than during the vegetative phase fig 6 given limited water resources available for irrigation in the canadian prairies expanding irrigation requires improving irrigation scheduling in combination with other water conserving practices such as reducing water loss through improving the conveyance infrastructure and changing the irrigation systems from high pressure to low pressure sprinkler method bennett et al 2015 our scenarios showed that improving irrigation practices reduced water losses irrigating spring wheat when soil moisture falls below 50 of awc to the soil depth of 40 cm led to high yield combining with low irrigation frequency rate and evaporation 4 3 future prospects canadian climatic conditions are projected to be warmer with increased accumulated thermal time for plant growth qian et al 2013 accompanied by a general increase and changing distribution of annual precipitation qian et al 2010 crops are also expected to be more water use efficient and assimilate more c during photosynthesis under projected climate change with increased atmospheric co2 concentrations the warmer climate conditions may lead to higher evaporation that increases soil water loss which may offset some of these benefits modelling crop system is a valuable way to evaluate optimal crop management practices to increase water use efficiency under future climate change and precision irrigation might be a prospective option to increase both yield and water use efficiency in the canadian prairies cultivar improvement led to an increase of 0 28 1 2 in grain yield per year in western canada iqbal et al 2016 in our long term experiment and simulation the cultivar ac barrie was bred in 1980s and chinook in 1930s fraser and whiteside 1956 mccaig et al 1996 the observed yields of ac barrie from 1997 to 1999 were about double that of chinook from 1967 to 1974 fig 4 to eliminate the impacts of managements and environmental factors e g n rate and co2 concentration we simulated the yields of the two cultivars with the same managements at the site of experiment iii for the same period from 1967 to 2017 the simulations showed that ac barrie yields were on average 50 higher than chinook fig a 3 the higher yield of ac barrie was due to its higher water use efficiency 16 kg grain per mm transpiration than chinook 11 kg grain per mm transpiration it is recommended that the cultivar with high water use efficiency and drought tolerance will be favorable for increasing yield in the canadian prairies encouragingly numerous efforts to mitigate drought through breeding resilient varieties are under way throughout the world mwadzingeni et al 2016 5 conclusions the three wheat models performed similarly and well simulated grain yield and biomass under both irrigated and rainfed conditions they differentiated the effects of crop rotations continuous wheat and summer fallow wheat for rainfed systems the ensembles of three models generally increased the accuracy of estimates but with less explainable eco physiological processes affecting grain yields than an individual model the advantage of ensemble simulations depends on model selections rather than increasing model members total water inputs precipitation irrigation of 400 mm were sufficient to maximize spring wheat yield in the canadian prairies irrigation of 200 mm can mostly overcome drought stress irrigating spring wheat when soil moisture was below 50 of awc to a soil depth of 40 cm led to high yields low rates of irrigation and low evaporation losses in the canadian prairies declaration of competing interest the

10355,canada is one of the top wheat grain exporters with a share of more than 10 in the world wheat market the majority of canadian wheat production takes place in the prairies where 6 2 million ha of the area is seeded to spring wheat the climate is semiarid with an estimated precipitation deficit of about 300 mm during the crop growing season indicating that water is the primary limiting factor for crop production in this study three dssat wheat models csm ceres cropsim nwheat were used to quantify the impacts of water management practices on crop water stress and wheat yields the models were evaluated individually and as an ensemble against observed wheat performance using three field experiments conducted to investigate irrigation rainfed and summer fallow impacts on wheat yields the results showed that all three wheat models well simulated grain yield gains with irrigation and summer fallow that conserved additional soil water statistically the multimodel ensemble improved the accuracy in simulating grain yields and biomass of spring wheat under both irrigated and rainfed conditions the improvements could not be linked to eco physiological processes in crop systems and the increased simulation accuracy was likely due to the offsetting effects of simulation bias and errors from the individual models water input precipitation irrigation of 400 mm was sufficient to reach the highest yield of spring wheat cultivars in the canadian prairies irrigation of 200 mm was able to alleviate most of the crop water stress in the study region further simulation scenarios showed that irrigating spring wheat when soil moisture was below 50 of available water capacity awc for plants led to high yield low irrigation rates and reduced evaporation for different soil textures combined with improved drought tolerance varieties this irrigation regime provides good prospects for increasing wheat yield and water use efficiency keywords irrigation rainfed summer

exports 70 of its produced wheat grains with a share of 11 15 in the global wheat market in the past decade faostat 2019 more than 90 of canadian spring wheat is produced in the prairies a main agricultural region located in the southern part of three provinces alberta saskatchewan and manitoba in western canada where about 6 2 million ha of cropland are seeded to spring wheat canadian wheat 2018 the semiarid climate in the prairies does not often provide sufficient precipitation for crop growth during the growing season de jong et al 2008 water availability is considered the primary limiting factor for crop production in the semiarid prairies campbell et al 2007 the low yields of spring wheat in exceptionally dry years can even result in a loss of all profitability suggesting that there are significant opportunities available to further increase wheat productivity for this region if water limitation issues can be addressed irrigation is definitely the most effective method to overcome drought stress in crop production however less than 5 of field crops mostly in the province of alberta were irrigated in the canadian prairies in 2012 statistics canada 2012 limited availability of extractable water restricts the potential expansion of the irrigated area in the canadian prairies highest water use efficiency of the scarce water resource can be achieved through precision irrigation bernier et al 2010 but this needs to be quantified for the water demand and water stress during the crop growing season site specific irrigation based on crop demands and soil moisture is gaining ground to improve crop yield in arid and semiarid regions neupane and guo 2019 climate change is likely to lower water availability for rainfed production in the future due to changes in the seasonality of precipitation and increasing fraction of winter precipitation as rain to run off in the canadian prairie kulshreshtha and kulshreshtha 2014 summer fallow has been recognized as an effective practice to conserve soil water and minimize yield variability for rainfed production campbell et al 1983 farahani et al 1998 long term experiments showed that summer fallow conserved additional soil water to increase seasonal grain yields but with reduced total grain productions over a long period campbell et al 1987 zentner et al 2006 long term field experiments are very time and cost intensive hence they are limited to illustrate crop responses to those initially designed management practices and are difficult to extrapolate crop performances under emerging new technologies and changing environments beyond the experimental sites and periods crop growth models on the other hand represent an efficient and effective way to assess the impacts of alternative managements on cropping systems under different environments and allow for spatial extrapolation to estimate regional level production and water requirements well validated crop growth models characterizing crop soil atmospheric interactions in association with crop management have been successfully used to investigate crop performance under both single model and multimodel ensembles jing

widely used models recently the cropsim and nwheat models have been adapted and included in the dssat framework to simulate wheat development and growth but they have yet to be evaluated and applied in ensembles to assess water management practices for spring wheat production the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the performances of dssat wheat models csm ceres cropsim nwheat under different water managements including rainfed low to high irrigation levels and summer fallow for water conservation 2 quantify the impacts of water management practices on crop water stress and wheat yield using the evaluated crop models 2 materials and methods the soils in the prairies used for agricultural production are represented primarily by the brown dark brown and black soil zones fuller 2010 the climate is semiarid in the brown soil zone with 275 325 mm of annual precipitation compared to the slightly wetter dark brown with 325 375 mm and black soil zones with 400 475 mm willms et al

cultivars and crop measurements 2 1 1 experiment i irrigated and rainfed spring wheat the irrigation experiment was carried out at swift current 50 2 n 107 4 w in the semiarid environment of the brown soil zone in southwestern saskatchewan in three consecutive years 1996 1998 details of the experiment can be found in angadi et al 2008 and only key agronomic information is presented here spring wheat cultivar katepwa was seeded with a row spacing of 20 cm under irrigated and rainfed conditions on may 31 in 1996 may 6 in 1997 and april 22 in 1998 the irrigation and rainfed treatments were established on a previously fallowed field during the experiment grassy and broadleaf weeds were controlled using a combination of pre emergence and post emergence granular herbicides that were applied in late fall and early spring the field was tilled with one to three operations using a small field cultivator with harrow attachment to control weeds and to incorporate excess straw precipitation and periodic irrigation maintained soil moisture levels above 50 of the available water capacity awc the amounts of 89 127 and 71 mm water were irrigated during the growing season in these three years 1996 1998 respectively the seeding rates were 73 92 kg ha 1 achieving an average of 99 plants m 2 with a range from 56 to 148 plants m 2 about 17 23 kg p2o5 ha 1 as monoammonium phosphate 11 51 0 was seed placed to supplement the residual p measured in the top 15 cm of the soil layer a total n rate of 31 42 kg ha 1 was applied as ammonium nitrate at seeding for each year to achieve a recommended n rate of 75 kg n ha 1 based on a fall soil test on available n in the top 60 cm soil profile at maturity two 1 m2 samples from irrigated and rainfed plots were manually harvested to measure total above ground biomass and grain yield on a dry matter basis weather data including daily maximum and minimum air temperatures precipitation and wind speed were measured at a meteorological station located within 1 km from the experimental field solar radiation data were measured at a nearby weather station swift current cda 50 27 n 107 73 w the data in 1998 were used to calibrate the crop models 2 1 2 experiment ii irrigation n fertilizer the experiment was conducted at two sites in southern alberta to test the interaction effects of n rates and irrigation levels on grain yield of hard red spring wheat cultivar neepawa spring wheat was seeded on a tilley loam soil at rolling hills 50 25 n 111 77 w on may 5 in 1982 and on a cranford sandy clay loam at rainier 50 38 n 112 09 w on april 29 in 1983 details of the experiment can be found in campbell et al 1997 and only key agronomic information is presented here soil samples were taken by 30 cm increments to 120 cm and soil water content was gravimetrically measured for four soil layers throughout the growing season in 1982 and 1983 the treatments included four levels of irrigation and three n rates under each irrigation level irrigation treatments included 10 156 242 385 mm of water applied during the wheat growing season and three n rates were 22 72 132 kg ha 1 in 1982 in 1983 the four irrigation levels were 3 157 165 254 mm and three n rates were 45 95 155 kg n ha 1 in our simulations irrigation dates were estimated using the csm ceres wheat model by setting the field to be irrigated to 100

in the experiment was evenly distributed among the irrigation applications for each irrigation treatment for each n treatment 22 kg n ha 1 was seed placed in 1982 and 13 kg n ha 1 in 1983 the remaining was broadcasted in late may weather data including temperature and precipitation were recorded at the station brooks ahrc 50 55 n 111 85 w of environment and climate change canada https weather gc ca canada e html and solar radiation was observed at the station suffield 50 27 n 111 18 w for 1982 and 1983 the spring wheat was harvested at the end of august and yields were measured except in the year where the observations were lost for the irrigation treatment level of 157 mm in 1983 the data in 1982 were used to calibrate the three crop models 2 1 3 experiment iii continuous wheat and fallow wheat rotations the experiment was located in the south farm of the agriculture canada research station at swift current 50 283 n 107 8 w saskatchewan under rainfed conditions the soil was a swinton loam an orthic brown chernozem the soil properties were summarized in table 1 and in kersebaum et al 2008 this rotation study included 12 crop rotation treatments that have been reported in many papers along with this ongoing experiment since 1967 campbell et al 2004 2000 1987 1983 de jong et al 2011 2008 only the treatments of continuous wheat w w and summer fallow wheat f w rotations in 1967 2017 were used in this study details of the experiment can be found in the aforementioned references and only key agronomic information is presented here two plots were assigned to the f w rotation in each replicate so that wheat growth after summer fallow can be measured each year the cultivars were updated through time as shown in table 2 spring wheat was seeded from may 1 to may 26 with an average on may 11 fertilizer n rates were applied in accordance with soil nitrate n contents in the top 60 cm soil layer that were measured in mid october campbell et al 2004 from 1967 to 1989 the n rates recommended by the soil testing laboratory of the university of saskatchewan were applied to bring the total mineral n soil test fertilizer n to 65 kg n ha 1 since 1990 the total mineral n recommended by the updated guideline increased to 90 kg n ha 1 for wheat grown on summer fallow and to 73 kg n ha 1 for wheat grown on stubble fertilizer n as ammonium nitrate was applied by broadcasting with varied n rates year to year table a 1 before seedbed preparation weed was controlled by a combination of mechanical tillage mainly cultivator and rod weeder and herbicides as required the 2 4 d was applied to control winter annual weeds in the fall in crop weed control generally involved the use of bromoxynil plus mcpa e 1 1 and tralkoxydim applied at the recommended rate campbell et al 2004 above ground plant biomass was sampled at the three leaf five leaf shot blade flag leaf complete soft dough growth stages and at harvest from 1967 to 1984 after 1984 biomass was only measured at harvest the above ground biomass was determined after drying at 70 c grain yields were harvested at the full ripe stage by cutting a swath 5 m wide and 40 m long through the middle of the plot with a conventional combine grain yield and biomass at harvest were missing in 1988 for w w and in 1983 for f w soil moistures were measured at all plots prior to seeding shortly after harvest and again just prior to freeze up in the fall from 1967 to 2000 soil cores were sampled across five soil layers of 0 15 15 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 cm in depth additional measurements of soil moisture were conducted at aforementioned crop growth stages from 1967 to 1984 the measured bulk densities of these soil layers reported in read et al 1983 were used to convert measured gravimetric soil water content to volumetric units weather data from the same station for experiment i and located 1 km from the experimental field was used the crop models were calibrated for each wheat cultivar using one year of crop data during its growing season i e cultivar chinook in 1967 canuck in 1975 leader in 1983 lancer in 1996 ac barrie in 1997 and eatonia in 2000 and lillian in 2006 2 2 wheat models three wheat models in dssat v4 7 were used csm ceres csm nwheat and csm cropsim hoogenboom et al 2019 the csm ceres wheat model was adapted from the model ceres to simulate wheat in dssat jones and kiniry 1986 jones et al 2003 ritchie and otter 1985 the csm cropsim wheat model was developed in canada to simulate wheat growth and development with the assumption that crop is comprised of uniform plants hunt and pararajasingham 1995 the csm nwheat wheat model was adapted from the apsim wheat model keating et al 2003 all the three models simulate wheat growth and development on a daily step in each of these models crop development rate is mainly governed by thermal time daily plant growth is computed by converting daily intercepted photosynthetically active radiation par into plant biomass using crop specific radiation use efficiency rue the amount of new biomass available for daily growth may also be modified by water or n stresses and temperature nitrogen stress occurs when crop n demand is greater than n supply daily demand for n is calculated from biomass growth rates and n concentrations of the plant organs the soil water module ritchie 1998 used by all three wheat models in dssat computes daily changes in soil water content by soil layer due to infiltration of rainfall and irrigation vertical drainage unsaturated flow soil evaporation and root water uptake processes water stress is calculated as a fraction using potential and actual transpiration of the crop potential transpiration is calculated using the priestley taylor relation priestley and taylor 1972 actual transpiration is modified using lai soil evaporation and soil water content the n sources are fertilizer atmospheric deposition and mineralized n that is calculated by a soil organic matter som model two som modules are optional in dssat the default is an original som module based on the ceres model godwin and jones 1991 godwin and singh 1998 the other was developed by gijsman et al 2002 based on the century model parton et al 1994 which is recommended by the dssat group and was used for all three models in this study the transport of n as ammonium and nitrate n in each soil layer is associated with water flux obtained from the soil water module these three models were originally developed for different purposes leading to differences in model structure source code and input data the models structures are all complex with many feedbacks at the process level we therefore describe the most significant differences among these three models relevant to this study table 3 specific lai varies with development stage in csm nwheat and the same value is used from emergence to maturity in the csm ceres and csm cropsim models the rue is modified by par in the csm nwheat model the co2 factor is calculated by a nonlinear function of environmental co2 concentration and daily mean temperature as published in reyenga et al 1999 which affects plant growth and transpiration in the csm nwheat model the co2 impact factor is interpolated with the environmental co2 concentration and only affects biomass accumulation in the csm ceres and csm cropsim models development rate is modified by water stress in the csm ceres and csm nwheat models while it is not in the csm cropsim model root growth decreases but root depth increases with increasing water stress in the csm ceres and csm nwheat models alternately only partitioning to root increases in the csm cropsim model 2 3 evaluation of crop models the site specific experimental information was used to provide model inputs of soil weather cultivar and crop management practices the measured global environmental co2 concentrations in each year included and updated in dssat were used to simulate crop growth the models redistributed the soil information to align with model specified soil layers in the simulations each cultivar was calibrated with data indicated in the aforementioned site descriptions and evaluated with the rest of the data noted as the validation dataset during the calibration process the targeted parameters were gradually tuned within their biological ranges defined in the model input files to minimize the differences between measured and simulated attribute values the calibrated parameters for each cultivar in this study are listed in table a 2 the calibrated model was then evaluated using the independent validation data by comparing the simulated attribute values to measured ones the models were used to simulate crop biomass yield soil water content water stress and soil water balance etc the models were initialized for each experimental year in simulating spring wheat for experiments i and ii in simulating spring wheat for experiment iii the models were only initialized in 1966 and then continuously simulated spring wheat growth for w w and f w from 1967 to 2017 2 4 irrigation scenarios improving irrigation management is an important potential application of dssat to demonstrate the capability of the models for assessing the effects of water managements we evaluated the frequency of irrigation on yield of irrigated wheat for three soil types sandy loam loam and clay loam with clay sand components percentages of 10 65 18 42 and 34 33 respectively the three soils were used as representative major soils for simulating crop yields in the prairies qian et al 2019 the irrigation simulations were conducted for continuous wheat from 1967 to 2017 using cultivar ac barrie with no n stress no n stresses were implemented by applying n fertilizer at 200 kg ha 1 and results revealed that no additional yields were simulated with n fertilizer above 200 kg n ha 1 at the study sites by all three models the widely used method of sprinkler irrigation in canada statistics canada 2016 was selected the modern irrigation systems are usually equipped with intelligent technologies that can automatically irrigate following input of monitoring information critical irrigation parameters e g soil moisture and irrigation depth are important for the automated irrigation systems to improve water management neupane and guo 2019 the fields were irrigated based on water storage to six depths ranging from 10 to 60 cm and the automated irrigation was triggered by five levels of available soil moisture for plant uptake ranging from 30 to 70 of the available soil water capacity in the corresponding depth the six gradients of soil depths five levels of soil moistures for irrigation and three soil textures resulted in 90 simulations scenario combinations 2 5 data analysis the simulated y and measured x aboveground biomass hereafter denoted as biomass and yields by the three crop models were graphically plotted and compared the mean of simulated values by three models i e the ensemble mean of the crop models that is denoted as e mean was calculated to compare with the observed values the standard errors se among the three models were computed statistical criteria were used to assess the performance of individual model and e mean a paired t test p t was also applied the root mean square error rmse and the normalized rmse nrmse rmse divided by the mean of measured value x between measured and simulated values were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 where n is the number of measurements model simulation efficiency ef mean error me and its relative value rme and index of agreement d between the simulated and measured values were also calculated using eqs 3 6 as in willmott 1982 and beaudoin et al 2008 an optimal model reproduces

calculated and plotted for simulated e mean with se and measured data for w w and f w in experiment iii the cumulative frequency was also calculated for the simulated water stress in experiment iii soil water balances input and output for the fallow and wheat growing periods in the soil profile were quantified using eq 7 the equation was adapted from the water balance method used in csm ceres wheat ritchie and otter 1985 hoogenboom et al 2019 the seeding and harvest dates were used to clarify the initial and final soil water for those two periods 7 w ini p i w fin d r e t where wini the

for a selected period the three quadrant diagram was adopted to show the relationships between water input grain yield and transpiration in experiment ii in analogy with the three quadrant diagram for n issues jing et al 2009 van keulen 1982 the diagram is used to analyze crop response to water input and water use efficiency with water inputs precipitation irrigation and transpirations the contour diagram is used to compare and analyze the impacts of irrigation strategies on yields 3 results 3 1 experiment i the three crop models generally performed well in simulating wheat grain yield and biomass with simulated values close to measured values for both irrigated and rainfed spring wheat at swift current for the three years from 1996 to 1998 fig 1 the simulated biomass somewhat differed among the three models but simulated grain yields were consistent the e mean showed good estimation of biomass with nrmse of 6 7 d of 0 9 and ef of 0 33 table 4 the e mean of grain yield was close to the measured with a difference of 266 kg ha 1 and the simulation was considered good with a nrmse of 15 3 2 experiment ii at low irrigation levels of 10 mm in 1982 and 3 mm in 1983 the measured grain yield showed no increase with increasing n fertilizer rates while the measured grain yield increased with increasing n fertilizer rates under high irrigation levels of greater than 150 mm fig 2 indicating interactions of irrigation levels with n fertilizer rates the changes in grain yield to the irrigation and n rates were reproduced by the three models although the three models showed differences in their performances especially for the irrigation level of 3 mm in 1983 the e mean gave an excellent simulation with nrmse of 7 7 d close to 1 0 and ef of 0 9 table 4 a three quadrant diagram showed that the responses of grain yields to water input irrigation precipitation levels were significantly affected by n rates and vice versa fig 3a quadrant i the yield gaps between high and low n rates were lower for the measured data than for the simulated at each irrigation level indicating that grain yield responses to n rates were slightly overestimated grain yields levelled off greatly at water input of 400 mm for both high and low n rates suggesting that the models adequately simulated the response of grain yield to water stress although the simulated yield reached the plateau with slightly less water inputs than the measured at higher fertilizer rate both the measurements and the modelled results suggested that a total water input of 400 mm irrigation precipitation would be sufficient to reach the highest yield gain for spring wheat in this region this amount of water input led to a high water use efficiency of 19 kg mm 1 transpiration fig 3a quadrant ii and additional water input would barely increase yield gain but result in high water loss fig 3a quadrant iii the simulations and measurements showed comparable water input requirements in 1983 though less than 400 mm water input could reach the yield plateau fig 3b a lower water input was possible due to the different soils table 1 and variations in distributions and amounts of precipitations between the two years 3 3 experiment iii the year to year variations of simulated yields were mostly consistent among the three models and similar to the changes in measured yields except for some years where the simulations dispersed among the three models fig 4a the inter annual fluctuation in yields of e mean mostly matched well with the measured yields indicating a good simulation for grain yield in response to crop growth stresses the simulations reproduced the lower grain yields of w w relative to f w as was observed table 4 the model ensembles improved the accuracy of the simulations the simulations on yield using multimodel ensembles were satisfactory with rmse less than 465 kg ha 1 d greater than 0 92 and ef greater than 0 68 the final biomass varied much from year to year both in simulated and measured values fig 4b the e mean showed better simulation results on biomass with the smallest rmse and highest d and ef compared to any individual model alone table 4 it is noted that the variation of measured biomass across years was reduced under f w with a coefficient of variation cv of 37 versus 43 for w w suggesting mitigation of water stress due to summer fallow this inter annual variation of biomass was reproduced by e mean with a cv of 34 for f w and 44 for w w indicating that the models adequately simulated the impacts of summer fallow on reducing growth variability with less crop water stress in years with low annual precipitation the simulated accumulations of biomass e mean were close to the measured values for w w and f w from 1967 to 1984 at swift current fig a 1 in most years the observed biomass of f w were higher than w w except for three years 1967 1969 and 1975 when no remarkable differences were found between w w and f w suggesting no direct benefit from conserved soil moisture for summer fallow in these years the cumulative frequencies of grain yields for e mean matched quite well with that of measured values reflected by the measured yields mostly overlapping the simulations fig 5 this suggests a reliable wheat production estimation under contrasting climatic conditions in the models the water stress is calculated as a fraction that ranges from 0 with no stress to 1 with full stress no water stresses were simulated in more than 10 years for f w while fewer than 5 years for w w in vegetative or reproductive phases fig 6 the estimated water stress exceeded 0 1 in 9 years for f w and in 28 years for w w during wheat vegetative phase if we define severe water stress as values exceeding 0 5 then severe water stress occurred in more years for the reproductive phase than for vegetative phase during reproductive phase severe water stress occurred in 13 years for f w and in 29 years for w w out of the 51 years tested the cumulative frequency of water stress showed that summer fallow significantly reduced the number of years with severe water stresses in particular during grain filling phase the measured values versus simulated e means for soil water storage mm were compared for w w and f w in fig a 2 from 1967 to 2000 the three crop models shared the same soil processes the simulated soil water contents varied slightly with small standard errors in most of the periods as expected the simulated soil moistures peaked after rainfall events and then decreased according to the statistical criteria table 5 the simulation of soil moisture for the second layer at 15 30 cm depth was better than for the top layer at 0 15 cm depth it is apparent that summer fallow increased soil water storage showing significantly higher values in most fallowing periods of f w than that of w w in the second soil layer 15 30 cm fig a 2b conserved water in soil was calculated with simulated soil moisture using eq 7 on average 40 mm water 21 of precipitation was conserved from wheat harvest to seeding in w w and 85 mm 16 of precipitation in f w therefore only an additional 45 mm of precipitation was conserved during summer fallow indicating that most of the precipitation received during summer fallow was lost 3 4 irrigation scenarios the irrigated spring wheat showed that grain yields increased with increasing number of irrigation events but plateaued at about 6 8 irrigation events for the three soil types fig 7 as expected evaporation increased with number of irrigation events there was a total range of 100 180 mm irrigation for the three soil types at 6 8 irrigation events with the least irrigation for sandy soil and the greatest for clay soil from the contour graphs in fig 7 irrigation events occurred more frequently when they were set to be triggered at higher percentage of awc and their number decreased when awc was considered at deeper depths irrigation when the percentage of awc was above 60 and depth of calculation was set to be less than 30 cm resulted in more than 8 irrigation events in contrast irrigation when the percentage of awc was less than 40 and irrigation depth was more than 40 cm led to less irrigation events however crop water stress which reduced yields became evident irrigating to a depth of 40 cm when the percentage of awc dropped below 50 corresponding to about 6 irrigation events led to high yields combined with low irrigated amounts and evaporated water for all three soil types 4 discussion 4 1 model evaluation the csm cropsim and csm nwheat models were evaluated to the best of our knowledge for the first time in canada since they were adapted to simulate wheat in dssat both models showed similarities in general to the csm ceres model in simulating biomass and grain yields of rainfed and irrigated spring wheat in the prairies despite of their general similar performances over three sets of experimental data the three wheat models showed some differences in nine years over the 51 year experimental and simulation period although the three wheat modes include some similarities for simulating wheat development and growth each model diverges in some aspects to reduce the simulation biases and variances the differences among the three models related to this study are described in table 3 the simulated yields and biomass by the three models distributed around the observed values as a result the e mean for grain yields by the three models improved simulation accuracy in experiment ii and iii the rmses were reduced and d and ef values increased but this improvement was not consistent such as an individual model outperformed the ensemble in experiment i table 4 similarly martre et al 2015 reported that multimodel ensembles taking either the mean e mean or median e median of simulated values improved the estimates considering all crop attributes but some individual models outperformed the ensemble for a specific crop attribute improved simulation accuracies by multimodel ensembles were also obtained for other crops like maize bassu et al 2014 and rice li et al 2015a we attribute the better performance of the multimodel ensembles to the mitigation of simulation bias variance among models statistically wallach et al 2018 the e mean of multimodel ensembles generally converging close to the true value is mainly because the errors in different models tend to compensate each other salo et al 2016 yin et al 2017 the multimodel ensembles approach can increase the simulation accuracy but not in all instances and it does not add to the explanatory power of crop eco physiological processes using e mean or e median the median of simulated values by models may make it difficult to verify the accuracy of each model and to explain differences in calculation processes among models yin et al 2017 whether multimodel ensembles can improve simulation accuracy depends on model selections wallach et al 2018 points out that multimodel ensembles might lead to worse simulation if models were selected with mostly positive or negative simulation results in a study using multiple models to simulate barley growth rötter et al 2012 salo et al 2016 it was found that if all the models are systematically wrong such as the case for estimating lai in the unfertilized treatment in 2009 in this study the multimodel ensembles may not help to improve simulation accuracy increasing the number of models in the multimodel ensembles can not guarantee a further improvement of simulations because the error of e mean and e median decreased little with an increasing number of ensemble members beyond 10 models martre et al 2015 yin et al 2017 reported that the e mean estimates regardless of using 12 models or 5 models provided good agreement with all the measured values for simulating grain n of different crops alternatively appropriate selection with a small number of model members can increase simulation accuracy ehrhardt et al 2018 found that an ensemble using only three models that produced the lowest error in simulating crop yields and n2o emissions performed similarly to a model ensemble with 24 models multimodel ensemble approaches using numerous models are much more time intensive than using a single model and it is indecisive in which models should be employed in the ensemble considering the purposes to use models to understand the underlying processes of crop growth and to facilitate the design of new management strategies aimed at sustainable production bouman et al 1996 the multimodel ensemble approaches are not an ideal solution to spur development and improve simulation accuracy and they should not be taken as a substitute towards the improvement of crop model structures and processes with newly emerging knowledge however given the fact that each individual crop model does have certain simulation bias and variance in representing the interaction processes in crop system our results show that multimodel ensembles are still a useful option to improve simulation accuracy while models continue to be developed the use of model ensembles requires the critical investigation of the included models considering in detail which processes leading to improved estimates in order to help avoiding unnecessarily large model ensembles that do little to highlight future model development needs part of the data from experiment iii and other experiments located close to experiment iii have been used to evaluate the performance of individual wheat model on grain yield given rmse values of 460 1020 kg ha 1 with nrmses greater than 29 grant et al 2016 he et al 2014 kersebaum et al 2008 li et al 2015b which are generally much higher than rmses of 465 470 kg ha 1 with nrmses of 19 25 table 4 that were obtained from e mean in this study the model ensembles also improved simulations for biomass at harvest with much smaller rmses of 1074 1309 kg ha 1 in this study than the previously reported rmses of 1785 1871 kg ha 1 using an individual model he et al 2014 part of the data from experiment iii were used to evaluate the hermes model to consecutively simulate soil moisture in the 0 120 cm soil profile kersebaum et al 2008 our simulation rmse 44 mm ef 0 23 showed better results than using the hermes model with rmse 52 mm and ef 0 4 2 irrigation to increase yield our study shows that total water input from precipitation and irrigation of 400 mm is sufficient to minimize water stress with water use efficiency decreasing beyond 400 mm for spring wheat production in the prairies fig 3 the total water input of up to 400 mm is supported by experimental studies in the prairies in a field study from 1996 to 1998 angadi et al 2008 and in a lysimeter study from 2006 to 2007 gan et al 2009 irrigation was applied for spring wheat to maintain soil moisture above 50 of awc with total water inputs of 240 330 mm to produce highest yields and improved crop water use efficiency mckenzie et al 2008 investigated the performance of spring wheat under optimum irrigated conditions in southern alberta from 2004 to 2006 they reported that total water inputs of 370 mm 56 mm would be sufficient to maintain soil moisture between 60 and 100 of awc during the crop growing season considering there is generally more than 210 mm precipitation during crop growing season environment and climate change canada 2019 and about 40 mm of water is conserved from harvest to seeding an irrigation amount of about 150 mm is sufficient to significantly reduce water stress and increase yield the increases in yield and biomass with irrigations ranging from 71 to 127 mm in three years in experiment i support our analysis by taking into account inter annual fluctuations in precipitation if we considered an irrigation efficiency of 75 due to water loss from storage conveyance and field application brouwer et al 1989 statistics canada 2016 200 mm of irrigation during the growing season would suffice to maximize spring wheat yield in the prairies in canada irrigation consumes 86 of the extracted water use for agriculture kulshreshtha and grant 2007 statistics showed that about 300 mm water was applied as irrigation in the study region in southern saskatchewan statistics canada 2012 this is greater than the estimated optimal amount for spring wheat as estimated in this study indicating that water use efficiency could be increased by improving irrigation management practices to better match soil moisture with crop demand for instance wheat at the reproductive phase generally requires more irrigation when the risk for water stress is high at a time when wheat response is more sensitive to stress than during the vegetative phase fig 6 given limited water resources available for irrigation in the canadian prairies expanding irrigation requires improving irrigation scheduling in combination with other water conserving practices such as reducing water loss through improving the conveyance infrastructure and changing the irrigation systems from high pressure to low pressure sprinkler method bennett et al 2015 our scenarios showed that improving irrigation practices reduced water losses irrigating spring wheat when soil moisture falls below 50 of awc to the soil depth of 40 cm led to high yield combining with low irrigation frequency rate and evaporation 4 3 future prospects canadian climatic conditions are projected to be warmer with increased accumulated thermal time for plant growth qian et al 2013 accompanied by a general increase and changing distribution of annual precipitation qian et al 2010 crops are also expected to be more water use efficient and assimilate more c during photosynthesis under projected climate change with increased atmospheric co2 concentrations the warmer climate conditions may lead to higher evaporation that increases soil water loss which may offset some of these benefits modelling crop system is a valuable way to evaluate optimal crop management practices to increase water use efficiency under future climate change and precision irrigation might be a prospective option to increase both yield and water use efficiency in the canadian prairies cultivar improvement led to an increase of 0 28 1 2 in grain yield per year in western canada iqbal et al 2016 in our long term experiment and simulation the cultivar ac barrie was bred in 1980s and chinook in 1930s fraser and whiteside 1956 mccaig et al 1996 the observed yields of ac barrie from 1997 to 1999 were about double that of chinook from 1967 to 1974 fig 4 to eliminate the impacts of managements and environmental factors e g n rate and co2 concentration we simulated the yields of the two cultivars with the same managements at the site of experiment iii for the same period from 1967 to 2017 the simulations showed that ac barrie yields were on average 50 higher than chinook fig a 3 the higher yield of ac barrie was due to its higher water use efficiency 16 kg grain per mm transpiration than chinook 11 kg grain per mm transpiration it is recommended that the cultivar with high water use efficiency and drought tolerance will be favorable for increasing yield in the canadian prairies encouragingly numerous efforts to mitigate drought through breeding resilient varieties are under way throughout the world mwadzingeni et al 2016 5 conclusions the three wheat models performed similarly and well simulated grain yield and biomass under both irrigated and rainfed conditions they differentiated the effects of crop rotations continuous wheat and summer fallow wheat for rainfed systems the ensembles of three models generally increased the accuracy of estimates but with less explainable eco physiological processes affecting grain yields than an individual model the advantage of ensemble simulations depends on model selections rather than increasing model members total water inputs precipitation irrigation of 400 mm were sufficient to maximize spring wheat yield in the canadian prairies irrigation of 200 mm can mostly overcome drought stress irrigating spring wheat when soil moisture was below 50 of awc to a soil depth of 40 cm led to high yields low rates of irrigation and low evaporation losses in the canadian prairies declaration of competing interest the

characteristics keywords alkali water soil sodification hydraulic properties soil stability infiltration characteristics brackish water irrigation 1 introduction worldwide increasing scarcity of water especially in drought prone arid and semiarid regions has witnessed a surge in groundwater irrigation for enhancing food and livelihood security shah 2014 nevertheless a typical scenario has emerged in the groundwater irrigated regions the areas characterized by water scarcity usually have underlying aquifers of poor quality minhas 2012 as a consequence land and environmental degradation are now widespread due to inappropriately managed irrigation with these marginal quality waters the degradation processes are associated with the build up in soil salinity sodicity and toxicity related problems the tendency of soils to develop sodicity alkalinity hazards depends upon the absolute and relative concentrations of specific cations and anions in the irrigation water the parameters determining the potential of irrigation waters to create these hazards are sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc and adjusted sar adj rna in addition to the ionic chemistry of the irrigation waters the rate and final build of soil sodicity are dependent upon the soil type crops grown and agro climatic conditions minhas and sharma 2006 the resultant manifestation of physical stresses from the deteriorated soil structure includes the water stagnation and anoxia from poor infiltration and hydraulic conductivity tillage problems from the hard setting of dispersed soils impairment of germination with surface crusts etc to characterize irrigation waters for their infiltration hazards hydraulic conductivity k curves defining threshold values of electrolyte concentration ec in relation to sar or soil exchangeable sodium percentage esp have been the key feature for soils varying in texture clay mineralogy organic matter and ph quirk 1971 shainberg and letey 1984 minhas and sharma 1986 suarez et al 1984 sumner et al 1998 bhardwaj et al 2007 the main mechanisms for reduced k are the process of swelling leading to constricted pores in clayey soils having smectite clay minerals bhardwaj et al 2008 whereas its dispersion and movement of clay to cause pore blockage in coarser soils shainberg and letey 1984 this formed the basis of the earlier water quality criteria which included combinations of ec and sar to maintain infiltration rates of soils ayers and westcot 1985 it is a general observation that crops suffer the most with water stagnation problems due to surface crusting during the rainy season when soil dispersion is further enhanced with the beating action of raindrops drastic reductions in k have been reported frenkel et al 1978 pupisky and shainberg 1979 shainberg et al 1981a 1981b minhas and sharma 1986 shainberg and letey 1984 sumner et al 1998 minhas et al 1999 oster et al 1999 when low electrolyte rainwater infiltration conditions were simulated using de ionized water ec 0 03dsm 1 slaking upon wetting and thereafter translocation of dispersed clay particles was noted to be the main limitation for the infiltration of rainfall water steady infiltration rates ir monitored after 8 years of irrigation with various ec 6 and 12dsm 1 and sar 10 20 30 and 40 mmol l 1 waters to wheat pearl millet crop rotation declined to 5 10 compared with the original sandy loam soil the recoupment in ir with saline waters was only 22 28 even though the flocculation values of clays for such illitic soils were 30 40 me l 1 minhas et al 1994 subsequently it was established that the washed in dispersed clays moved into the subsoil below the plow sole with the traction of infiltrating rainwater blocking the soil pores and ultimately becoming a sort of permanent throttle for downward movement of water minhas et al 1999 the quantum of clay that can undergo translocation and its settling depth depends upon the soil texture and its mineralogy which control their inherent infiltration characteristics yet modifying factors like sodicity level of the soil its salt release characteristics and organic matter content play an important role minhas 2010 suarez 2015 with a simultaneous increase in soil ph alkali waters prove to be more deleterious than those with neutral salts sharma and minhas 1997 reported that in an illitic sandy loam soil the effect of sar for waters with neutral salts cl so4 and adj sar for water with residual alkalinity on infiltration rates was negative and similar in magnitude the heavy textured soils surapaneni and olsson 2002 and those put under rice wheat systems are even more prone to sodification and structural problems when irrigated with sodic alkali waters minhas et al 2019 however most of the information on the impact of sodicity on clay dispersion and soil s hydraulic properties has been generated under laboratory conditions using disturbed repacked soils and that too with neutral salts to create high sar conditions disturbed and repacked soil studies tend to over estimate the effects especially for hydraulic properties bhardwaj et al 2008 these conditions do not portray typical soil structural changes and their magnitude in field soils especially when soils are sodificated with irrigation water having residual alkalinity moreover the alkali sodic and rainwater intake may alternate each other former being used for irrigation to crops during fairly dry period and even during the rainy period especially under monsoonal mediterranean type climates however insufficient research efforts have been directed towards the evaluation of soil responses to represent such field conditions where the alternate cycles of infiltration with low electrolyte rainwater and the saline alkali waters and vice versa are prevalent remedial measures including extraneous inputs of amendments are usually recommended to minimize the degradation of soils by sodification the amendments either contain ca e g gypsum or are those which on reaction with calcite release native ca into soil solutions e g sulfur sulfuric acid pyrites etc the viability of these amendments is mostly judged from improvement in crop yields versus the costs involved minhas et al 2004 since the application of amendments is a recurring requirement under alkali water irrigated conditions their doses modes and frequency of application have been standardized at large minhas et al 2019 for similar doses better efficiency of utilization and crop yield responses have been observed when alkali waters are ameliorated either by passing irrigation water through specially designed gypsum beds which improved ca concentration by 3 5 me l 1 or by addition of sulfuric acid through sulfurous acid generators minhas et al 2004 murtaza et al 2006 nevertheless little information is available on the long term impacts of irrigation with waters having residual alkalinity and the comparative performance of rsc neutralization with equivalent amounts of either calcium or acid on soil physico chemical properties and infiltration and related hydraulic properties a controlled lysimeter experiment is being conducted for two decades since 2000 wherein crops are irrigated with waters of different residual alkalinity and neutralization with gypsum or sulfuric acid on an equivalent basis this provided for an opportunity to quantify the long term changes in physico chemical properties and also infiltration and related hydraulic properties under undisturbed conditions

treatment replications by collecting soil cores using metal samplers of 3 cm length and 5 cm internal diameter at 0 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 20 cm depth by placing the core in the middle of each soil layer bulk density was obtained by dividing the gravimetric weights of the cores after oven drying by core volume porosity was calculated from the db using the relation porosity cm 3 cm 3 1 d b d p where dp is the particle density which was assumed to be 2 65 g cm 3 simultaneously soil penetration resistance spr was determined for the surface 20 cm of soil at every 5 cm depth interval using a manual cone penetrometer eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek the netherlands the penetrometer cone had a 30 apex angle and the base of the cone had 1 cm2 surface area the soil samples collected for bulk density were also utilized for gravimetric soil moisture determination the soil moisture content was near field capacity and its variance was less than 5 at the time of soil penetration resistance measurement the soil moisture was 0 238 8 0 009 0 255 8 0 007 0 215 8 0 011 and 0 196 8 0 008 cm3 cm 3 at 0 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 20 cm depth respectively 2 3 soil aggregate analysis undisturbed soil samples for surface 15 cm depth were collected with the help of a spade air dried and passed through 8 mm and 4 75 mm sieves by gently breaking apart the clods samples retained on 4 75 mm sieves were used for analysis and clods aggregates and residues 8 mm in diameter were discarded the air dried samples were placed in plastic bags stored at ambient temperature and transferred to the laboratory for analysis the aggregate size distribution of the soil was determined by the wet sieving method using a yoder s apparatus as described by kemper and rosenau 1986 the air dried soil sample 50 g was placed on a 4 75 mm sieve and submerged in water on a nest of six sieves 4 75 2 0 1 0 0 5 0 25 and 0 106 mm for 10 min before the start of wet sieving action the sieve nest was then clamped and secured to the drum the sieve assembly was oscillated up down by a pulley arrangement for 20 min at a frequency of 30 35 cycles per minute with a stroke length of 4 cm in salt free water inside the drum the water stable aggregates wsa retained on the sieves were collected carefully by washing gently using a washing bottle into pre weighed containers the collected aggregates were oven dried at 105 c for 48 h and weighed the water stable aggregation was expressed as mean weight diameter mwd the mwd of aggregates mm was calculated as mwd i 0 n xi wi where xi is the mean diameter of the aggregate class and wi is the weight proportion of each aggregate class in relation to the bulk soil weight 2 4 high energy moisture characteristics the high energy moisture characteristics hemc technique collis george and figueroa 1984 pierson and mulla 1989 levy and miller 1997 bhardwaj et al 2007 was used for the determination of effects on soil stability and volume of drainable pores based on specific water capacity curves for the soils under different treatments briefly indices of soil stability were generated from the differences in soil moisture release characteristics under slow 2 mm h 1 and fast 100 mm h 1 wetting of a particular range of aggregates 0 5 1 0 mm fifteen grams of air dried aggregates from the 0 15 cm soil layer were collected from each treatment 4 replications and placed on a 65 mm internal diameter funnel with a sintered disc to form a 5 mm thick bed the sintered disk had a pore size of 20 40 µm saturation of the sintered disc was ensured before placing aggregates in the funnel the funnel was connected from its bottom via tubing to a peristaltic pump which was then used to wet the aggregates in the funnel either fast 100 mm h 1 or slowly 2 mm h 1 at the end of wetting aggregates were ensured to be fully saturated with water deionized water ec of 0 04dsm 1 was used for wetting the aggregates a moisture characteristic mc curve at a matric potential range of 0 50 cm water tension 0 to 5 0 j kg 1 was obtained using a hanging water column whereby the height of the meniscus in the pipette was decreased in increments of 0 1 0 2 j kg 1 by increasing the suction applied the volume of water that drained from the aggregates at each matric potential increment was recorded after a 2 min of equilibrium period and the corresponding water content of the aggregates was calculated modeling of moisture characteristic curves for fast and slow wetting was done with the modified van genuchten model pierson and mulla 1989 the moisture release characteristics at high energies up to 50 cm water tension provide the volume of drainable pores vdp and modal suctions which are used for calculation of stability indices as structural index

drainable pores vdp is the integral of area under the water capacity curve the changes in drainable pores were quantified as vdp ratio volume of drainable pores fast wetting volume of drainable pores slow w etting the structural index for two wetting rates for a soil of a particular treatment was used to determine stability ratio as stability ratio structural index fast wetting structural index slow wetting the stability ratio allows for comparisons of effects at a relative scale of 0 1 a value of 1 indicates maximum stability and 0 indicates no stability when soil is fast wetted compared to slowly wetted 2 5 infiltration characteristics double ring infiltrometers were used to measure the infiltration rate ir of water into the soil by recording the amount of water infiltrated in the inner ring diameter 26 cm as a function of time bouwer 1986 the infiltrometers were pushed into the soil to 10 cm depth and similar water levels were maintained in both the rings of the infiltrometer infiltration measurements were made at two separate randomly selected points in each lysimeter in one of the infiltrometers measurements were made using the corresponding irrigation water iw that is aw1 aw2 aw2 sa aw2 gyp or gqw hereafter referred to as iw to start with and these continued until a steady state infiltration rate was achieved 30h thereafter the standing water was piped out and soil was allowed to drain overnight the next day morning the measurements of irs were repeated using de ionized water eciw 0 03dsm 1 for simulating low electrolyte rainwater rw this sequence of water infiltration is referred to as iw rw in the latter text once the steady ir was achieved with rw the standing water was again piped out and these were covered with a polythene sheet the soils were later sampled after 1 and 2 days of drainage at 0 10 m depth interval down to 0 9 m soil depth for determination of soil water distribution storage at field capacity fc in the other infiltrometer rw was used to start with and this was replaced with iw following the same procedure as in first infiltrometer referred to as rw iw sequence after piping out the standing iw the soil was allowed to dry once the optimal moisture level was attained in about 6 7 days the surface 5 cm was tilled with a sharp tool to break the soil crust st and infiltration measurements were repeated using aws this sequence of water infiltration is referred to as rw iw st iw 2 6 statistical analysis the data were subjected to analysis of variance anova and analyzed using the completely randomized design

or gypsum aw2 gyp which maintained a little higher ph than aw1 with increased eciw due to the addition of gypsum higher soil salinity ece was observed in the soils irrigated with aw2 gyp than those with aw1 aw2 and aw2 sa the soils were sodificated considerably with irrigation waters having residual alkalinity as indicated by sare and the exchangeable sodium percentage esp when averaged for the two layers 0 30 cm sare followed the trend aw2 aw2 sa aw2 gyp aw1 the corresponding esp also followed the similar trend with aw2 33 5 aw2 sa 26 6 aw2 gyp 21 6 aw1 20 9 as compared to irrigation with

kg 1 to 5 1 g kg 1 compared to that between 3 6 and 3 8 g kg 1 under aw treatments the average calcite content of 30 cm soil was noted to be 0 6 with gqw while it increased to 0 97 and 1 18 respectively with aw1 and aw2 the maximum calcite precipitation i e 1 66 in surface 15 cm soil was obtained in treatment receiving additional ca as gypsum aw2 gyp while it got slightly reduced to 1 1 due to dissolution in soil receiving sulfuric acid aw2 sa 3 2 bulk density and soil penetration resistance the effect of irrigation with aws and amendments on soil bulk density db was significant for 10 20 cm soil depths fig 1a in general db was lower in surface 10 cm tilled layer than 10 20 cm layer irrespective of treatments at 0 10 cm soil depth the differences were not significant with large variability but general trends indicated an increase in db with aw irrigations even with use of amendments the averaged db for 10 20 cm soil was 1 68 8 0 03 1 68 8 0 04 1 73 8 0 02 1 71 8 0 3 and 1 71 8 0 04 when irrigated with gqw aw1 aw2 aw2 sa and aw2 gyp respectively with the increase in db the porosity was calculated to have decreased from 0 42 under gqw to 0 38 0 41 cm3 cm 3 with aws in surface 10 cm soil and ranged between 0 35 and 0 37 cm3 cm 3 at 10 20 cm soil depth soil penetration resistance spr was significantly influenced by alkali waters and the amendments fig 1b irrespective of treatment spr increased with depth down to 20 cm soil depth especially in soils irrigated with aw2 water very significant reduction in spr was noted at 0 5 cm for aw2 sa and aw2 gyp compared to all other treatments but high variability was noted moving further down at 15 20 cm depth significant increase in spr with aw2 was noted 3 3 soil aggregation and stability characteristics there was large variation in the mean weight diameter mwd of wet sieved aggregates that avoided finding significant differences fig 2a the proportion of water stable macro aggregates 8 0 4 75 mm and 4 75 2 0 mm size was 0 11 with gqw and it reduced to 0 093 and 0 07 with aw1 and aw2 respectively while there was some improvement with the use of amendments as under aw2 sa and aw2 gyp 0 084 and 0 074 respectively the fraction of dispersed soil passing through the sieve with the smallest size 0 125 mm tended to be in greater proportion with aws 0 25 0 31 against 0 21 with gqw the mwds were 0 76 0 68 and 0 53 mm under gqw aw1 and aw2 respectively and increased to 0 61 0 68 mm with the use of amendments though the differences were not significant due to large variation results of the aggregate stability determinations with high energy moisture characteristics hemc method are presented in the form of the stability ratio in fig 2b significant differences were noted among the irrigation water quality treatments the stability ratio decreased from 0 99 0 2 with gqw to 0 84 0 06 and 0 61 0 02 with aw1 and aw2 respectively a significant recovery in stability was also noted with the use of gypsum aw2 gyp as well as sulfurous amendment aw2 sa making them similar to aw1 somewhat similar trends were observed in volume of drainable pores vdp under hemc method fig 3 while there was no difference in vdp under slow wetting sw procedures compared to gqw there was a significant reduction in vdp with fast wetting fw for all aw including aw1 and aw2 as well as their use with amendments aw2 gyp aw2 sa consequently the vdp ratios decreased to 0 71 and 0 65 in aw1 and aw2 respectively a slight recovery of vdp ratio was noticed with the use of gypsum aw2 gyp 0 71 similar to use of gqw and aw1 fig 3 3 4 sequential infiltration with alkali and simulated rain waters the cumulative infiltration ci with waters that were used under different treatments iw and that of deionized water eciw 0 03dsm 1 to simulate low electrolyte rainwater rw is depicted in fig 4 ci was the highest in soils irrigated with gqw followed by aw1 aw2 gyp and aw2 sa while it was the lowest with aw2 considering the infiltration period of one day 24h the ci equaled 203 mm for gqw followed by 84 63 58 and 40 mm for aw1 aw2 gyp aw2 sa and aw2 respectively the trend was similar when ci was determined using rw although corresponding ci in 24h was 186 57 39 35 and 23 mm in soils irrigated with gqw aw1 aw2 sa aw2 gyp and aw2 respectively the steady state infiltration rate ir was also significantly affected by different treatments and the infiltration cycles followed using different quality of infiltration waters steady infiltration rate ir monitored using gqw was 5 4 mm h 1 fig 5 and this was reduced to 2 2 1 0 1 7 and 1 8 mm h 1 with aw1 aw2 aw2 sa and aw2 gyp respectively indicating a reduction of 59 81 when referenced to infiltration rate with gqw referred hereafter as ir gqw when rw was used irs were reduced to 1 1 0 7 1 4 and 1 0 mm h 1 in soils irrigated with aw1 aw2 aw2 sa and aw2 gyp respectively i e a further decline of 6 22 in ir when compared with ir gqw when the 5 cm soil was tilled to disturb the dispersed surface and break the surface crust iw rw st iw there was little recovery in ir except for aw1 on the whole irs with final of waters used in sequence were related to the surface soil esp and the same could be described r2 0 53 0 83 by the power functions given in table 3 from the determined equations the calculated values of esp for ir 0 25 ir gqw would be 24 5 15 8 17 4 14 5 and 14 4 for iw rw iw rw rw iw and rw iw st iw sequences of infiltration events the aggregate breakdown and the dispersed soil conditions in alkali water irrigated soils not only tended to impede water intake but this also reduced post infiltration water storage in the soil profile and a slow down redistribution due to drainage fig 6 following infiltration and subsequent drainage for 48h the moisture content down to 90 cm soil was 12 5 6 9 6 0 9 1 and 7 6 cm under gqw aw1 aw2 aw2 sa and aw2 gyp respectively even the drying patterns of the soils as wetted with infiltrating water varied which was indicated by the moisture contents in the surface 10 cm layer determined after 7 days of completion of the infiltration event the values averaged 0 164 0 214 0 223 0 229 and 0 236 cm3 cm 3 in soils irrigated with gqw aw1 aw2 aw2 sa and aw2 gyp respectively the differences were significant for aws compared to gqw 4 discussion irrigation with groundwater of high residual alkalinity is a very common practice especially in arid and semi arid regions of the world though the major ion chemistry of these waters defines the extent of sodification of soils it also gets modified by the site specific conditions a large number of reports have emerged on the long term sodification of soils irrigated with alkali irrigation waters especially in north west india bajwa et al 1992 1993 bajwa and josan 1989a b c sharma and minhas 2004 minhas et al 2007a b choudhary et al 2011 the general experience is that the initial rates of sodification and rise in soil ph are slow due to the release of divalent cations from the inherent calcite and other soil minerals quasi equilibrium is achieved after about 4 5 years of continued irrigation with alkali waters the extent of sodification levels in soils usually depends upon residual alkalinity of irrigation water cropping sequence being followed soil type and the other agro climatic conditions higher quantities of irrigation water applied to the rice wheat cropping systems leaching fraction 0 6 0 8 results in faster and higher sodification especially at surface soil esp 1 8 times adj sar when compared with upland crops such as cotton maize and pearl millet in rotation with wheat minhas and gupta 1992 minhas and bajwa 2001 it is worth mentioning here that paddy wheat was the cropping system followed in this experiment for the initial 12 years 2000 2012 when it was replaced with upland crops of sorghum mustard sunflower for next 6 years 2012 2016 and again for the last 2 years the cropping system was paddy wheat esp sustained in surface 30 cm soil for different treatments ranged between 2 1 and 3 3 times the sariw further a significant observation is that despite the neutralization of rsc of aw2 with sulfuric acid aw2 sa making it equivalent to 5 me l 1 the soil sodification effects still remained higher than aw1 rsc 5 me l 1 irrigation with gwq accumulated the highest carbon in the soil with greater biomass production minhas et al 2007a higher recycling of crop residues root biomass and rhizo depositions are expected to result in higher soil organic carbon benbi and brar 2009 in addition to the lower input of organic residues breakdown of macro aggregates where c is sequestered its hydrolysis and thereby downward leaching of organic solutes is expected to increase with the maintenance of high ph and bicarbonate in soils irrigated with alkali waters bhardwaj et al 2020 another typical feature of irrigation with waters having residual alkalinity is the precipitation of calcite when the alkalinity exceeds ca upon the concentration of soil solution with the uptake of water by plant roots therefore continued irrigation with these waters over the past 20 years resulted in the increase in calcite content in the surface soil calcite precipitation was further built up with neutralization of alkali irrigation water with caso4 2h2o aw2 gyp while it seemed to get dissolved and leached at least from surface 0 15 m layer due to addition of sulfuric acid as in aw2 sa there is a general observation in soils under the paddy wheat cropping system that compacted hardpans may develop by puddling tillage immediately underneath the tilled soils sur et al 1980 the reasons ascribed to the increase in db in soils beneath the plow layer include i destruction of aggregates with shearing action of tillage implements and compaction by the machinery ii filling of pores by finer soil particles resulting in reduce porosity and iii direct physical compaction caused by machinery though machinery could not be used due to area constraint of lysimeters 2 m 2 m and the puddling had to be manual this effect can be ruled out here the breakdown of aggregates and movement of dispersed clays with sodification must have induced compaction of subsoil and therefore increased its bulk density and penetration resistance the two methods of soil aggregate stability assessment which were used in this study have two different principles of determination of susceptibility to breakage wet sieving assesses the breakage of aggregates under the force of water thus finer differences may not be visible the method has been used mostly for erosion related assessments on the other hand hemc method has accurate control of wetting forces and the slaking of aggregates is the main phenomenon for the assessment of susceptibility to breakage thus this method reveals finer differences due to sodification and perhaps also the effects of organic carbon changes in the treatments this facilitated studying processes which are difficult to assess with wet sieving the method has been found sensitive enough even for weakly aggregated soils pierson and mulla 1989 both methods revealed a significant decrease in soil stability with alkali waters aw compared to gqw these methodologies confirmed that sodicity reduced both the binding of the micro aggregates as well as enhanced their susceptibility to slaking moreover organic carbon seems to have a role in binding soil particles and micro aggregates together several reports have earlier appeared oster and schroer 1979 shainberg and letey 1984 minhas and sharma 1986 sumner et al 1998 oster et al 1999 shainberg and singer 2015 that sodification induced structural instability aggregate slaking swelling dispersion and movement of clays to clog water conducting soil pores increased bulk density to reduce pore sizes ultimately leading to reduced intake rates in irrigated soils on the contrary high salts in irrigation waters can sustain higher hydraulic conductance and therefore ec sar combinations are described for irrigation waters when the neutral ions are associated with increased sar shainberg and letey 1984 ayers and westcot 1985 irrigation with waters having high residual alkalinity also leads to increase in soil ph especially when salts get leaching from surface soil sharma and khosla 1984 therefore the soil clays become still more sensitive to dispersion and movement to the subsoil sharma and minhas 1997 suarez 2015 under field conditions the occurrence of rainfall events may reduce the water intake rates via the physical impacts of raindrops that provide for energy to break down the aggregates as well as surface soil washing to lower salinity below threshold levels both of these processes complement each other for dispersing soil clays and thus in the formation of surface crusts since the rainwater rw was applied with minimum soil disturbance here only the effects of the chemistry of rw were envisaged however this represented the infiltration of rainwater that often happens when the foliage of growing crops keeps the surface covered still the negative effects of irrigation with aw exacerbated with rw and irs further declined to 0 06 0 22 ir gqw similarly very sharp reductions in hydraulic conductivity ir have been reported using simulated rw frenkel et al 1978 pupisky and shainberg 1979 shainberg et al 1981a 1981b minhas and sharma 1986 minhas et al 1999 shainberg and letey 1984 shainberg and singer 2015 under laboratory conditions using disturbed repacked soils under field conditions soil aggregates get greater opportunities for re arrangements of sub aggregates with wetting and drying during the separated and successive cycles of irrigation with alkali waters and rainwater organic inputs with cropping and the tillage operations which provide stability of aggregates and thus field soils are not as sensitive to rw as observed in laboratory columns alternation in the respective irrigation water iw and rw intake is also envisaged under field conditions especially during the period of monsoon rains when episodic events of high rainfall occur therefore the ir was also monitored by replacing iw with rw iw rw and rw with iw rw iw little recovery in irs 0 02 0 11 ir gqw was observed when iw followed rw rw iw but irs further declined when rw followed iw iw rw possibilities of breaking the surface crusts with shallow tillage inter culture operations exist in field soils especially during the initial stages of crop growth only a little recovery in infiltration rate with tilling further indicates that once the washed in dispersed clay moves into the subsoil below the plow sole it develops a sort of permanent throttle for downward movement of water therefore the reversibility of ir may be possible only through deep ripping with chisel plows since the soil under study contains mainly the illitic clays which have non swelling nature the recoupment of intake rates with aw is not expected because of reduced infiltration in soils irrigated with aws their post infiltration soil water storage was also less slower redistribution of infiltrated water in aw irrigated soils confirmed the changes in hydraulic characteristics with faster redistribution and also the higher losses as evaporation from the surface due to higher conductance optimal soil moisture conditions could be attained under gqw while the soils were still wet under other treatments with alkali waters similar reports on reduced soil water storage and drying patterns have earlier come from gypsum amended alkali soils minhas and acharya 2020 the soil moisture content in the surface few mm of sodic soils decreases rapidly with evaporation but layers below this depth continue to remain wet as moisture loss at the surface is not replenished by the lower depths due to poor water transmission this could be an important aspect in intensively cropped systems where the window period between the harvesting of one crop and sowing of next is very short the sowing of next crop often gets delayed due to non attainment of optimal soil moisture condition for timely tillage operations 5 conclusions long term irrigation with alkali waters aw lead to deterioration in soil quality in terms of chemical ph ece sar esp and physical db mwd spr parameters their amelioration with gypsum and sulfuric acid improved these parameters but this was not sufficient enough to match the soils irrigated with good quality water the infiltration rate ir declined markedly in alkali water irrigated soils especially when low electrolyte rainwater was used for monitoring the non significant recovery in irs by either reverting to aw or breaking the surface soil crust indicates permanent damage to soil structure and water transmission characteristics through the development sub soil throttles with moved in clays nevertheless the use of both gypsum and sulfurous amendments improved hydro physical characteristics the impact of gypsum being slightly better especially in improving soil stability characteristics further efforts should be made to incorporate rainwater impacts on hydro physical properties of soils irrigated with alkali sodic waters under different agro climatic conditions to ultimately come up with precise water quality

10356,degradation of soils due to sodification is now widespread in arid and semiarid areas irrigated with groundwater having residual alkalinity we monitored the changes in soil physical chemical and

characteristics keywords alkali water soil sodification hydraulic properties soil stability infiltration characteristics brackish water irrigation 1 introduction worldwide increasing scarcity of water especially in drought prone arid and semiarid regions has witnessed a surge in groundwater irrigation for enhancing food and livelihood security shah 2014 nevertheless a typical scenario has emerged in the groundwater irrigated regions the areas characterized by water scarcity usually have underlying aquifers of poor quality minhas 2012 as a consequence land and environmental degradation are now widespread due to inappropriately managed irrigation with these marginal quality waters the degradation processes are associated with the build up in soil salinity sodicity and toxicity related problems the tendency of soils to develop sodicity alkalinity hazards depends upon the absolute and relative concentrations of specific cations and anions in the irrigation water the parameters determining the potential of irrigation waters to create these hazards are sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc and adjusted sar adj rna in addition to the ionic chemistry of the irrigation waters the rate and final build of soil sodicity are dependent upon the soil type crops grown and agro climatic conditions minhas and sharma 2006 the resultant manifestation of physical stresses from the deteriorated soil structure includes the water stagnation and anoxia from poor infiltration and hydraulic conductivity tillage problems from the hard setting of dispersed soils impairment of germination with surface crusts etc to characterize irrigation waters for their infiltration hazards hydraulic conductivity k curves defining threshold values of electrolyte concentration ec in relation to sar or soil exchangeable sodium percentage esp have been the key feature for soils varying in texture clay mineralogy organic matter and ph quirk 1971 shainberg and letey 1984 minhas and sharma 1986 suarez et al 1984 sumner et al 1998 bhardwaj et al 2007 the main mechanisms for reduced k are the process of swelling leading to constricted pores in clayey soils having smectite clay minerals bhardwaj et al 2008 whereas its dispersion and movement of clay to cause pore blockage in coarser soils shainberg and letey 1984 this formed the basis of the earlier water quality criteria which included combinations of ec and sar to maintain infiltration rates of soils ayers and westcot 1985 it is a general observation that crops suffer the most with water stagnation problems due to surface crusting during the rainy season when soil dispersion is further enhanced with the beating action of raindrops drastic reductions in k have been reported frenkel et al 1978 pupisky and shainberg 1979 shainberg et al 1981a 1981b minhas and sharma 1986 shainberg and letey 1984 sumner et al 1998 minhas et al 1999 oster et al 1999 when low electrolyte rainwater infiltration conditions were simulated using de ionized water ec 0 03dsm 1 slaking upon wetting and thereafter translocation of dispersed clay particles was noted to be the main limitation for the infiltration of rainfall water steady infiltration rates ir monitored after 8 years of irrigation with various ec 6 and 12dsm 1 and sar 10 20 30 and 40 mmol l 1 waters to wheat pearl millet crop rotation declined to 5 10 compared with the original sandy loam soil the recoupment in ir with saline waters was only 22 28 even though the flocculation values of clays for such illitic soils were 30 40 me l 1 minhas et al 1994 subsequently it was established that the washed in dispersed clays moved into the subsoil below the plow sole with the traction of infiltrating rainwater blocking the soil pores and ultimately becoming a sort of permanent throttle for downward movement of water minhas et al 1999 the quantum of clay that can undergo translocation and its settling depth depends upon the soil texture and its mineralogy which control their inherent infiltration characteristics yet modifying factors like sodicity level of the soil its salt release characteristics and organic matter content play an important role minhas 2010 suarez 2015 with a simultaneous increase in soil ph alkali waters prove to be more deleterious than those with neutral salts sharma and minhas 1997 reported that in an illitic sandy loam soil the effect of sar for waters with neutral salts cl so4 and adj sar for water with residual alkalinity on infiltration rates was negative and similar in magnitude the heavy textured soils surapaneni and olsson 2002 and those put under rice wheat systems are even more prone to sodification and structural problems when irrigated with sodic alkali waters minhas et al 2019 however most of the information on the impact of sodicity on clay dispersion and soil s hydraulic properties has been generated under laboratory conditions using disturbed repacked soils and that too with neutral salts to create high sar conditions disturbed and repacked soil studies tend to over estimate the effects especially for hydraulic properties bhardwaj et al 2008 these conditions do not portray typical soil structural changes and their magnitude in field soils especially when soils are sodificated with irrigation water having residual alkalinity moreover the alkali sodic and rainwater intake may alternate each other former being used for irrigation to crops during fairly dry period and even during the rainy period especially under monsoonal mediterranean type climates however insufficient research efforts have been directed towards the evaluation of soil responses to represent such field conditions where the alternate cycles of infiltration with low electrolyte rainwater and the saline alkali waters and vice versa are prevalent remedial measures including extraneous inputs of amendments are usually recommended to minimize the degradation of soils by sodification the amendments either contain ca e g gypsum or are those which on reaction with calcite release native ca into soil solutions e g sulfur sulfuric acid pyrites etc the viability of these amendments is mostly judged from improvement in crop yields versus the costs involved minhas et al 2004 since the application of amendments is a recurring requirement under alkali water irrigated conditions their doses modes and frequency of application have been standardized at large minhas et al 2019 for similar doses better efficiency of utilization and crop yield responses have been observed when alkali waters are ameliorated either by passing irrigation water through specially designed gypsum beds which improved ca concentration by 3 5 me l 1 or by addition of sulfuric acid through sulfurous acid generators minhas et al 2004 murtaza et al 2006 nevertheless little information is available on the long term impacts of irrigation with waters having residual alkalinity and the comparative performance of rsc neutralization with equivalent amounts of either calcium or acid on soil physico chemical properties and infiltration and related hydraulic properties a controlled lysimeter experiment is being conducted for two decades since 2000 wherein crops are irrigated with waters of different residual alkalinity and neutralization with gypsum or sulfuric acid on an equivalent basis this provided for an opportunity to quantify the long term changes in physico chemical properties and also infiltration and related hydraulic properties under undisturbed conditions

treatment replications by collecting soil cores using metal samplers of 3 cm length and 5 cm internal diameter at 0 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 20 cm depth by placing the core in the middle of each soil layer bulk density was obtained by dividing the gravimetric weights of the cores after oven drying by core volume porosity was calculated from the db using the relation porosity cm 3 cm 3 1 d b d p where dp is the particle density which was assumed to be 2 65 g cm 3 simultaneously soil penetration resistance spr was determined for the surface 20 cm of soil at every 5 cm depth interval using a manual cone penetrometer eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek the netherlands the penetrometer cone had a 30 apex angle and the base of the cone had 1 cm2 surface area the soil samples collected for bulk density were also utilized for gravimetric soil moisture determination the soil moisture content was near field capacity and its variance was less than 5 at the time of soil penetration resistance measurement the soil moisture was 0 238 8 0 009 0 255 8 0 007 0 215 8 0 011 and 0 196 8 0 008 cm3 cm 3 at 0 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 20 cm depth respectively 2 3 soil aggregate analysis undisturbed soil samples for surface 15 cm depth were collected with the help of a spade air dried and passed through 8 mm and 4 75 mm sieves by gently breaking apart the clods samples retained on 4 75 mm sieves were used for analysis and clods aggregates and residues 8 mm in diameter were discarded the air dried samples were placed in plastic bags stored at ambient temperature and transferred to the laboratory for analysis the aggregate size distribution of the soil was determined by the wet sieving method using a yoder s apparatus as described by kemper and rosenau 1986 the air dried soil sample 50 g was placed on a 4 75 mm sieve and submerged in water on a nest of six sieves 4 75 2 0 1 0 0 5 0 25 and 0 106 mm for 10 min before the start of wet sieving action the sieve nest was then clamped and secured to the drum the sieve assembly was oscillated up down by a pulley arrangement for 20 min at a frequency of 30 35 cycles per minute with a stroke length of 4 cm in salt free water inside the drum the water stable aggregates wsa retained on the sieves were collected carefully by washing gently using a washing bottle into pre weighed containers the collected aggregates were oven dried at 105 c for 48 h and weighed the water stable aggregation was expressed as mean weight diameter mwd the mwd of aggregates mm was calculated as mwd i 0 n xi wi where xi is the mean diameter of the aggregate class and wi is the weight proportion of each aggregate class in relation to the bulk soil weight 2 4 high energy moisture characteristics the high energy moisture characteristics hemc technique collis george and figueroa 1984 pierson and mulla 1989 levy and miller 1997 bhardwaj et al 2007 was used for the determination of effects on soil stability and volume of drainable pores based on specific water capacity curves for the soils under different treatments briefly indices of soil stability were generated from the differences in soil moisture release characteristics under slow 2 mm h 1 and fast 100 mm h 1 wetting of a particular range of aggregates 0 5 1 0 mm fifteen grams of air dried aggregates from the 0 15 cm soil layer were collected from each treatment 4 replications and placed on a 65 mm internal diameter funnel with a sintered disc to form a 5 mm thick bed the sintered disk had a pore size of 20 40 µm saturation of the sintered disc was ensured before placing aggregates in the funnel the funnel was connected from its bottom via tubing to a peristaltic pump which was then used to wet the aggregates in the funnel either fast 100 mm h 1 or slowly 2 mm h 1 at the end of wetting aggregates were ensured to be fully saturated with water deionized water ec of 0 04dsm 1 was used for wetting the aggregates a moisture characteristic mc curve at a matric potential range of 0 50 cm water tension 0 to 5 0 j kg 1 was obtained using a hanging water column whereby the height of the meniscus in the pipette was decreased in increments of 0 1 0 2 j kg 1 by increasing the suction applied the volume of water that drained from the aggregates at each matric potential increment was recorded after a 2 min of equilibrium period and the corresponding water content of the aggregates was calculated modeling of moisture characteristic curves for fast and slow wetting was done with the modified van genuchten model pierson and mulla 1989 the moisture release characteristics at high energies up to 50 cm water tension provide the volume of drainable pores vdp and modal suctions which are used for calculation of stability indices as structural index volume of drainable pores modal suction where modal suction is the peak of specific water capacity curve dθ dψ dθ is the water content in kgkg 1 and dψ is the matric suction in cm and volume of drainable pores vdp is the integral of area under the water capacity curve the changes in drainable pores were quantified as vdp ratio volume of drainable pores fast wetting volume of drainable pores slow w etting the structural index for two wetting rates for a soil of a particular treatment was used to determine stability ratio as stability ratio structural index fast wetting structural index slow wetting the stability ratio allows for comparisons of effects at a relative scale of 0 1 a value of 1 indicates maximum stability and 0 indicates no stability when soil is fast wetted compared to slowly wetted 2 5 infiltration characteristics double ring infiltrometers were used to measure the infiltration rate ir of water into the soil by recording the amount of water infiltrated in the inner ring diameter 26 cm as a function of time bouwer 1986 the infiltrometers were pushed into the soil to 10 cm depth and similar water levels were maintained in both the rings of the infiltrometer infiltration measurements were made at two separate randomly selected points in each lysimeter in one of the infiltrometers measurements were made using the corresponding irrigation water iw that is aw1 aw2 aw2 sa aw2 gyp or gqw hereafter referred to as iw to start with and these continued until a steady state infiltration rate was achieved 30h thereafter the standing water was piped out and soil was allowed to drain overnight the next day morning the measurements of irs were repeated using de ionized water eciw 0 03dsm 1 for simulating low electrolyte rainwater rw this sequence of water infiltration is referred to as iw rw in the latter text once the steady ir was achieved with rw the standing water was again piped out and these were covered with a polythene sheet the soils were later sampled after 1 and 2 days of drainage at 0 10 m depth interval down to 0 9 m soil depth for determination of soil water distribution storage at field capacity fc in the other infiltrometer rw was used to start with and this was replaced with iw following the same procedure as in first infiltrometer referred to as rw iw sequence after piping out the standing iw the soil was allowed to dry once the optimal moisture level was attained in about 6 7 days the surface 5 cm was tilled with a sharp tool to break the soil crust st and infiltration measurements were repeated using aws this sequence of water infiltration is referred to as rw iw st iw 2 6 statistical analysis the data were subjected to analysis of variance anova and analyzed using the completely randomized design procedures the statistical analysis was done using jmp 9 0 sas inc cary usa the mean values of all parameters were subjected to the tukey test steel and torrie 1960 unless stated otherwise differences were considered significant only at p 0 05 infiltration rate curves were described using power regression functions and goodness of fit denoted by r2 the graphing was done using origin v 8 5 software

or gypsum aw2 gyp which maintained a little higher ph than aw1 with increased eciw due to the addition of gypsum higher soil salinity ece was observed in the soils irrigated with aw2 gyp than those with aw1 aw2 and aw2 sa the soils were sodificated considerably with irrigation waters having residual alkalinity as indicated by sare and the exchangeable sodium percentage esp when averaged for the two layers 0 30 cm sare followed the trend aw2 aw2 sa aw2 gyp aw1 the corresponding esp also followed the similar trend with aw2 33 5 aw2 sa 26 6 aw2 gyp 21 6 aw1 20 9 as compared to irrigation with gqw 4 3 a higher accumulation of soil organic carbon oc was monitored in the topsoil where the gqw was used for irrigation table 2 in surface soil 0 15 cm it increased from an initial content of 2 9 g kg 1 to 5 1 g kg 1 compared to that between 3 6 and 3 8 g kg 1 under aw treatments the average calcite content of 30 cm soil was noted to be 0 6 with gqw while it increased to 0 97 and 1 18 respectively with aw1 and aw2 the maximum calcite precipitation i e 1 66 in surface 15 cm soil was obtained in treatment receiving additional ca as gypsum aw2 gyp while it got slightly reduced to 1 1 due to dissolution in soil receiving sulfuric acid aw2 sa 3 2 bulk density and soil penetration resistance the effect of irrigation with aws and amendments on soil bulk density db was significant for 10 20 cm soil depths fig 1a in general db was lower in surface 10 cm tilled layer than 10 20 cm layer irrespective of treatments at 0 10 cm soil depth the differences were not significant with large variability but general trends indicated an increase in db with aw irrigations even with use of amendments the averaged db for 10 20 cm soil was 1 68 8 0 03 1 68 8 0 04 1 73 8 0 02 1 71 8 0 3 and 1 71 8 0 04 when irrigated with gqw aw1 aw2 aw2 sa and aw2 gyp respectively with the increase in db the porosity was calculated to have decreased from 0 42 under gqw to 0 38 0 41 cm3 cm 3 with aws in surface 10 cm soil and ranged between 0 35 and 0 37 cm3 cm 3 at 10 20 cm soil depth soil penetration resistance spr was significantly influenced by alkali waters and the amendments fig 1b irrespective of treatment spr increased with depth down to 20 cm soil depth especially in soils irrigated with aw2 water very significant reduction in spr was noted at 0 5 cm for aw2 sa and aw2 gyp compared to all other treatments but high variability was noted moving further down at 15 20 cm depth significant increase in spr with aw2 was noted 3 3 soil aggregation and stability characteristics there was large variation in the mean weight diameter mwd of wet sieved aggregates that avoided finding significant differences fig 2a the proportion of water stable macro aggregates 8 0 4 75 mm and 4 75 2 0 mm size was 0 11 with gqw and it reduced to 0 093 and 0 07 with aw1 and aw2 respectively while there was some improvement with the use of amendments as under aw2 sa and aw2 gyp 0 084 and 0 074 respectively the fraction of dispersed soil passing through the sieve with the smallest size 0 125 mm tended to be in greater proportion with aws 0 25 0 31 against 0 21 with gqw the mwds were 0 76 0 68 and 0 53 mm under gqw aw1 and aw2 respectively and increased to 0 61 0 68 mm with the use of amendments though the differences were not significant due to large variation results of the aggregate stability determinations with high energy moisture characteristics hemc method are presented in the form of the stability ratio in fig 2b significant differences were noted among the irrigation water quality treatments the stability ratio decreased from 0 99 0 2 with gqw to 0 84 0 06 and 0 61 0 02 with aw1 and aw2 respectively a significant recovery in stability was also noted with the use of gypsum aw2 gyp as well as sulfurous amendment aw2 sa making them similar to aw1 somewhat similar trends were observed in volume of drainable pores vdp under hemc method fig 3 while there was no difference in vdp under slow wetting sw procedures compared to gqw there was a significant reduction in vdp with fast wetting fw for all aw including aw1 and aw2 as well as their use with amendments aw2 gyp aw2 sa consequently the vdp ratios decreased to 0 71 and 0 65 in aw1 and aw2 respectively a slight recovery of vdp ratio was noticed with the use of gypsum aw2 gyp 0 71 similar to use of gqw and aw1 fig 3 3 4 sequential infiltration with alkali and simulated rain waters the cumulative infiltration ci with waters that were used under different treatments iw and that of deionized water eciw 0 03dsm 1 to simulate low electrolyte rainwater rw is depicted in fig 4 ci was the highest in soils irrigated with gqw followed by aw1 aw2 gyp and aw2 sa while it was the lowest with aw2 considering the infiltration period of one day 24h the ci equaled 203 mm for gqw followed by 84 63 58 and 40 mm for aw1 aw2 gyp aw2 sa and aw2 respectively the trend was similar when ci was determined using rw although corresponding ci in 24h was 186 57 39 35 and 23 mm in soils irrigated with gqw aw1 aw2 sa aw2 gyp and aw2 respectively the steady state infiltration rate ir was also significantly affected by different treatments and the infiltration cycles followed using different quality of infiltration waters steady infiltration rate ir monitored using gqw was 5 4 mm h 1 fig 5 and this was reduced to 2 2 1 0 1 7 and 1 8 mm h 1 with aw1 aw2 aw2 sa and aw2 gyp respectively indicating a reduction of 59 81 when referenced to infiltration rate with gqw referred hereafter as ir gqw when rw was used irs were reduced to 1 1 0 7 1 4 and 1 0 mm h 1 in soils irrigated with aw1 aw2 aw2 sa and aw2 gyp respectively i e a further decline of 6 22 in ir when compared with ir gqw when the 5 cm soil was tilled to disturb the dispersed surface and break the surface crust iw rw st iw there was little recovery in ir except for aw1 on the whole irs with final of waters used in sequence were related to the surface soil esp and the same could be described r2 0 53 0 83 by the power functions given in table 3 from the determined equations the calculated values of esp for ir 0 25 ir gqw would be 24 5 15 8 17 4 14 5 and 14 4 for iw rw iw rw rw iw and rw iw st iw sequences of infiltration events the aggregate breakdown and the dispersed soil conditions in alkali water irrigated soils not only tended to impede water intake but this also reduced post infiltration water storage in the soil profile and a slow down redistribution due to drainage fig 6 following infiltration and subsequent drainage for 48h the moisture content down to 90 cm soil was 12 5 6 9 6 0 9 1 and 7 6 cm under gqw aw1 aw2 aw2 sa and aw2 gyp respectively even the drying patterns of the soils as wetted with infiltrating water varied which was indicated by the moisture contents in the surface 10 cm layer determined after 7 days of completion of the infiltration event the values averaged 0 164 0 214 0 223 0 229 and 0 236 cm3 cm 3 in soils irrigated with gqw aw1 aw2 aw2 sa and aw2 gyp respectively the differences were significant for aws compared to gqw 4 discussion irrigation with groundwater of high residual alkalinity is a very common practice especially in arid and semi arid regions of the world though the major ion chemistry of these waters defines the extent of sodification of soils it also gets modified by the site specific conditions a large number of reports have emerged on the long term sodification of soils irrigated with alkali irrigation waters especially in north west india bajwa et al 1992 1993 bajwa and josan 1989a b c sharma and minhas 2004 minhas et al 2007a b choudhary et al 2011 the general experience is that the initial rates of sodification and rise in soil ph are slow due to the release of divalent cations from the inherent calcite and other soil minerals quasi equilibrium is achieved after about 4 5 years of continued irrigation with alkali waters the extent of sodification levels in soils usually depends upon residual alkalinity of irrigation water cropping sequence being followed soil type and the other agro climatic conditions higher quantities of irrigation water applied to the rice wheat cropping systems leaching fraction 0 6 0 8 results in faster and higher sodification especially at surface soil esp 1 8 times adj sar when compared with upland crops such as cotton maize and pearl millet in rotation with wheat minhas and gupta 1992 minhas and bajwa 2001 it is worth mentioning here that paddy wheat was the cropping system followed in this experiment for the initial 12 years 2000 2012 when it was replaced with upland crops of sorghum mustard sunflower for next 6 years 2012 2016 and again for the last 2 years the cropping system was paddy wheat esp sustained in surface 30 cm soil for different treatments ranged between 2 1 and 3 3 times the sariw further a significant observation is that despite the neutralization of rsc of aw2 with sulfuric acid aw2 sa making it equivalent to 5 me l 1 the soil sodification effects still remained higher than aw1 rsc 5 me l 1 irrigation with gwq accumulated the highest carbon in the soil with greater biomass production minhas et al 2007a higher recycling of crop residues root biomass and rhizo depositions are expected to result in higher soil organic carbon benbi and brar 2009 in addition to the lower input of organic residues breakdown of macro aggregates where c is sequestered its hydrolysis and thereby downward leaching of organic solutes is expected to increase with the maintenance of high ph and bicarbonate in soils irrigated with alkali waters bhardwaj et al 2020 another typical feature of irrigation with waters having residual alkalinity is the precipitation of calcite when the alkalinity exceeds ca upon the concentration of soil solution with the uptake of water by plant roots therefore continued irrigation with these waters over the past 20 years resulted in the increase in calcite content in the surface soil calcite precipitation was further built up with neutralization of alkali irrigation water with caso4 2h2o aw2 gyp while it seemed to get dissolved and leached at least from surface 0 15 m layer due to addition of sulfuric acid as in aw2 sa there is a general observation in soils under the paddy wheat cropping system that compacted hardpans may develop by puddling tillage immediately underneath the tilled soils sur et al 1980 the reasons ascribed to the increase in db in soils beneath the plow layer include i destruction of aggregates with shearing action of tillage implements and compaction by the machinery ii filling of pores by finer soil particles resulting in reduce porosity and iii direct physical compaction caused by machinery though machinery could not be used due to area constraint of lysimeters 2 m 2 m and the puddling had to be manual this effect can be ruled out here the breakdown of aggregates and movement of dispersed clays with sodification must have induced compaction of subsoil and therefore increased its bulk density and penetration resistance the two methods of soil aggregate stability assessment which were used in this study have two different principles of determination of susceptibility to breakage wet sieving assesses the breakage of aggregates under the force of water thus finer differences may not be visible the method has been used mostly for erosion related assessments on the other hand hemc method has accurate control of wetting forces and the slaking of aggregates is the main phenomenon for the assessment of susceptibility to breakage thus this method reveals finer differences due to sodification and perhaps also the effects of organic carbon changes in the treatments this facilitated studying processes which are difficult to assess with wet sieving the method has been found sensitive enough even for weakly aggregated soils pierson and mulla 1989 both methods revealed a significant decrease in soil stability with alkali waters aw compared to gqw these methodologies confirmed that sodicity reduced both the binding of the micro aggregates as well as enhanced their susceptibility to slaking moreover organic carbon seems to have a role in binding soil particles and micro aggregates together several reports have earlier appeared oster and schroer 1979 shainberg and letey 1984 minhas and sharma 1986 sumner et al 1998 oster et al 1999 shainberg and singer 2015 that sodification induced structural instability aggregate slaking swelling dispersion and movement of clays to clog water conducting soil pores increased bulk density to reduce pore sizes ultimately leading to reduced intake rates in irrigated soils on the contrary high salts in irrigation waters can sustain higher hydraulic conductance and therefore ec sar combinations are described for irrigation waters when the neutral ions are associated with increased sar shainberg and letey 1984 ayers and westcot 1985 irrigation with waters having high residual alkalinity also leads to increase in soil ph especially when salts get leaching from surface soil sharma and khosla 1984 therefore the soil clays become still more sensitive to dispersion and movement to the subsoil sharma and minhas 1997 suarez 2015 under field conditions the occurrence of rainfall events may reduce the water intake rates via the physical impacts of raindrops that provide for energy to break down the aggregates as well as surface soil washing to lower salinity below threshold levels both of these processes complement each other for dispersing soil clays and thus in the formation of surface crusts since the rainwater rw was applied with minimum soil disturbance here only the effects of the chemistry of rw were envisaged however this represented the infiltration of rainwater that often happens when the foliage of growing crops keeps the surface covered still the negative effects of irrigation with aw exacerbated with rw and irs further declined to 0 06 0 22 ir gqw similarly very sharp reductions in hydraulic conductivity ir have been reported using simulated rw frenkel et al 1978 pupisky and shainberg 1979 shainberg et al 1981a 1981b minhas and sharma 1986 minhas et al 1999 shainberg and letey 1984 shainberg and singer 2015 under laboratory conditions using disturbed repacked soils under field conditions soil aggregates get greater opportunities for re arrangements of sub aggregates with wetting and drying during the separated and successive cycles of irrigation with alkali waters and rainwater organic inputs with cropping and the tillage operations which provide stability of aggregates and thus field soils are not as sensitive to rw as observed in laboratory columns alternation in the respective irrigation water iw and rw intake is also envisaged under field conditions especially during the period of monsoon rains when episodic events of high rainfall occur therefore the ir was also monitored by replacing iw with rw iw rw and rw with iw rw iw little recovery in irs 0 02 0 11 ir gqw was observed when iw followed rw rw iw but irs further declined when rw followed iw iw rw possibilities of breaking the surface crusts with shallow tillage inter culture operations exist in field soils especially during the initial stages of crop growth only a little recovery in infiltration rate with tilling further indicates that once the washed in dispersed clay moves into the subsoil below the plow sole it develops a sort of permanent throttle for downward movement of water therefore the reversibility of ir may be possible only through deep ripping with chisel plows since the soil under study contains mainly the illitic clays which have non swelling nature the recoupment of intake rates with aw is not expected because of reduced infiltration in soils irrigated with aws their post infiltration soil water storage was also less slower redistribution of infiltrated water in aw irrigated soils confirmed the changes in hydraulic characteristics with faster redistribution and also the higher losses as evaporation from the surface due to higher conductance optimal soil moisture conditions could be attained under gqw while the soils were still wet under other treatments with alkali waters similar reports on reduced soil water storage and drying patterns have earlier come from gypsum amended alkali soils minhas and acharya 2020 the soil moisture content in the surface few mm of sodic soils decreases rapidly with evaporation but layers below this depth continue to remain wet as moisture loss at the surface is not replenished by the lower depths due to poor water transmission this could be an important aspect in intensively cropped systems where the window period between the harvesting of one crop and sowing of next is very short the sowing of next crop often gets delayed due to non attainment of optimal soil moisture condition for timely tillage operations 5 conclusions long term irrigation with alkali waters aw lead to deterioration in soil quality in terms of chemical ph ece sar esp and physical db mwd spr parameters their amelioration with gypsum and sulfuric acid improved these parameters but this was not sufficient enough to match the soils irrigated with good quality water the infiltration rate ir declined markedly in alkali water irrigated soils especially when low electrolyte rainwater was used for monitoring the non significant recovery in irs by either reverting to aw or breaking the surface soil crust indicates permanent damage to soil structure and water transmission characteristics through the development sub soil throttles with moved in clays nevertheless the use of both gypsum and sulfurous amendments improved hydro physical characteristics the impact of gypsum being slightly better especially in improving soil stability characteristics further efforts should be made to incorporate rainwater impacts on hydro physical properties of soils irrigated with alkali sodic waters under different agro climatic conditions to ultimately come up with precise water quality

10357,in the poorly drained regions of the world subsurface drainage systems are required to remove excess water for crop growth plastic drains alter a field s hydrology by lowering the water table reducing surface ponding and reducing surface runoff one significant concern with the use of subsurface drainage systems is adverse environmental effects because of the modification of the soil water dynamics some effects include the reduction of ecological services since wetlands change to croplands water quality concerns particularly sediment nitrogen and phosphorus losses in agricultural subsurface discharge water as well as changes in the volume and timing of off site discharges hydrological simulation models predict surface and artificial subsurface flow at different scales often in these models hooghoudt based expressions are adapted in their internal algorithms in this study the water erosion prediction project wepp model developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars for soil and water conservation planning activities was tested and improved to simulate surface and subsurface discharges the modified wepp model was tested and validated on an extensive dataset collected at four experimental sites managed by usda ars within the lake erie watershed predicted drainage discharges show nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values ranging from 0 50 to 0 70 and percent bias ranging from 30 to 15 at daily and monthly resolutions evidence suggests that the wepp model can be used to produce reliable estimates of subsurface flow

the soils skaggs and broadhead 1982 fraser and flemming 2001 higher storage capacity reduces surface runoff and promotes infiltration skaggs et al 1987 robinson and rycroft 1999 research shows that artificially drained soils act as a buffer for rainfall and spread runoff over longer time periods thus peak flows decrease and less flooding occurs as a result robinson 1990 konyha et al 1992 skaggs et al 1994 schilling and helmers 2008 henine et al 2010 crop production benefits from subsurface drainage since it affects physical and chemical soil properties and strongly influences crop growth and quality messing and wesström 2006 vopravil et al 2017 as the goal of proper subsurface drainage is to remove excess gravitational water consisting of shallow groundwater flow and water moving downward from upper soil horizons constant aeration of the crop rooting zone promotes root health and microbial activity which are important for maximizing nutrient availability kladivko et al 1999 tiemeyer et

improves workability reduces the potential for soil compaction and decreases surface ponding aldabagh and beer 1971 kornecki and fouss 2001 mathematical formulations have been developed to predict subsurface flow and associated transport focused on determining the optimal size and spacing of pipes in the field under steady or non steady flow conditions most investigations assume systems with parallel drainage and equally spaced pipes wesseling 1964 kirkham 1966 van schilfgaarde 1970 with hooghoudt s equation hooghoudt 1940 applied to approximate flow into two parallel drains however when parallel spacing is not a suitable assumption e g fields with irregular systems the actual spacing is substituted by an effective spacing which approximates the system to equivalent parallel drains of the same length effective spacing is not site specific but somewhat depends on the soil type kurien et al 1997 and accretion rate northcott et al 2001 hydrological simulation models estimate subsurface flow to drains at different scales these models include the large scale soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 field scale models such as drainmod skaggs et al 2012c gleams leonard et al 1987 and adapt gowda et al 2012 the root zone water quality model rzwqm ma et al 2012 as well as the multiscale water erosion prediction project wepp flanagan and nearing 1995 flanagan and livingston 1995 model other models include mathematical algorithms such as drenafem castanheira and santos 2009 and hydrus2d simunek et al 1999 although the latter two models are not hydrologic formulations they offer a more complex and complete representation of the transient saturated unsaturated vertical flow in the soil profile in practice however the hydrological models previously mentioned are solely based on the kirkham kirkham 1966 and hooghoudt s equation hooghoudt 1940 at watershed and hillslope scales respectively swat and drainmod have been extensively validated whereas gleams adapt rzwqm and wepp have limited evidence of their success for subsurface drainage estimation as subsurface drainage influences infiltration and surface runoff it is an important factor in the soil erosion process drainage reduces surface runoff but questions abound on its influence on sediment transport through hillslopes and watersheds skaggs et al 1982 and maalim and melesse 2013 used the drainmod and wepp models respectively to estimated average annual rates of erosion they found that annual rates of erosion are up to 10 times lower when subsurface drainage is used as a practice to control water table depths however none of these predictions were validated with observed data from a modeling standpoint drainmod has been widely applied in the united states for subsurface flow prediction however it neglects the effects of management operations agricultural practices and subsurface drainage on hillslope hydrology which are conditions that greatly influence soil erosion by water management practices such as soil disturbance by tillage operations residue management and decomposition and soil erosion control practices are incorporated in the wepp model flanagan et al 2007 an environmental model for soil erosion prediction used by the united states department of agriculture usda in soil and water conservation planning activities wepp includes mechanisms such as weather generation winter processes irrigation hydrology plant growth management operations and erosion for both hillslope and watershed scales licciardello et al 2013 migliaccio and srivastava 2007 however model inconsistencies have been found when validating the subsurface drainage algorithms oztekin et al 2004 such discrepancies include overprediction of daily runoff for daily storms large deviations between observed and simulated subsurface flow conditions and poor representation of the water table depth variations although these inconsistencies were addressed by comparing the model predictions with those using drainmod there is no validation of the model using observed field drainage data and no updates have been included in the current public version of the wepp model v2012 8 a comprehensive understanding of the hydrology of subsurface drainage fields and its impact on sediment delivery and transport are major knowledge gaps sims et al 1998 king et al 2014 king et al 2015 that restrict suitable cropland management strategies improved water quality soil erosion mitigation and selection and implementation of best management practices the goal of this study was to evaluate and enhance the wepp model subsurface drainage routines to provide a more realistic and holistic representation of the conditions observed in agricultural fields under subsurface drainage systems the model improvements will not only extend the applicability of the current version of the wepp model to artificially drained croplands and contribute to reducing the gap seen between agricultural practices and subsurface drainage but will also better account for these effects on soil erosion predictions a comprehensive dataset of hourly weather variables and daily subsurface flow collected at four experimental sites managed by the usda ars in the lake erie watershed were used for testing and validation as part of this study particularly this research provides details on 1 subsurface drainage prediction calculated by the current version of the wepp model v2012 8 2 modifications of the source code in subsurface drainage percolation water balance and infiltration algorithms and the incorporation of soil water movement by capillary rise from the water table into the model code and 3 evaluation calibration and validation of the new subsurface drainage algorithms implemented in the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the wepp model flanagan et al 2012 ascough et al 2013 is a soil erosion prediction tool developed since 1985 to replace the well known empirical universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 contrary to the usle the wepp model is a process based technology that estimates the spatial and temporal distribution of soil loss and sediment deposition at both hillslope and watershed scales flanagan et al 2007 it simulates continuous processes with a daily time step including weather generation hydrologic processes soil physics plant growth and erosion mechanics the model water balance based on soil water content in the root zone includes processes such as infiltration runoff percolation soil and residue evaporation plant transpiration lateral flow snowmelt subsurface drainage and seepage for more details on those processes and the model structure see the model documentation flanagan and nearing 1995 the current subsurface drainage component of wepp savabi 1993 simulates subsurface flow to pipes or ditches drainage fluxes are estimated for a given water table depth with the steady state hooghoudt equation bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 as follows 1 q d 4 k e m 2 d e m l 2 where k e is the soil s equivalent lateral hydraulic conductivity cm h 1 m is the midpoint water table elevation above the pipes cm d e is the equivalent depth from the drain to the impervious layer cm and l is the drain spacing cm the equivalent depth in the equation can be calculated with the moody 1967 equations 2 d e d 1 d l 8 π l n d r 3 4 d l 0 3 3 d e l π 8 l n l r 1 15 d l 0 3 where d is the distance between the impervious layer and the drain cm and r is the effective drain radius cm eq 1 in the wepp model v2012 8 calculates the drainage rates when water table depth is located at and below the surface for the latter condition the hooghoudt equation has been widely applied and validated skaggs et al 2012c however for the water table at the surface the kirkham equation 1957 has shown a more accurate representation this condition and the inconsistencies previously mentioned were addressed by modifications in the model source code as described in the next subsections the wepp model v2012 9 the enhanced version of the model is used throughout this research for comparison purposes with the current version of the model v2012 8 2 1 1 subsurface drainage modifications for ponding of water at the soil surface drainage flow in the wepp model v2012 9 is computed as kirkham 1957 4 q d 4 π k e

at the soil surface and below are restricted to the drainage coefficient d c of the system cm day 2 1 2 soil water characteristics modifications the water re distribution approach used in the current version of the wepp model v2012 8 assumes that the water table is estimated from the bottom layer and ending at the topmost soil layer soils draining water are considered to be above the field capacity each of the saturated layers above the tiles contains a potential drainable amount of water once the potential is drained the respective soil layers return to their field capacity however this only happens once a day so that sub daily water table variations are omitted the pipes hydraulic coefficient limits the potential amount of water drained in the current version of the model the water s daily movement between layers in wepp at the end of the day starts from the bottom layer and progresses up to the surface layer as the model can simulate deep percolation the lower layer can become saturated due to the not yet percolated water after saturation the excess water is moved to the soil layer above https www ars usda gov arsuserfiles 50201000 wepp weppdrainage2012 pdf the soil water distribution in the enhanced version v2012 9 of the wepp model is assumed to be divided into wet and dry zones a wet zone develops from the water table level up to the root zone and possibly extending to the soil surface whereas a dry zone occurs when water is removed from the root zone storage once the maximum capillary rise from the water table is not sufficient to supply the evapotranspiration amount skaggs et al 2012c a drained to equilibrium condition is assumed to control the water distribution in the soil domain skaggs 1980 which represents a major change in the percolation routine in the wepp model v2012 8 which originally used storage routing techniques to percolate water content exceeding the soil field capacity the soil water distribution above the water table and the volume of water free pore space is calculated at each time step of the model fig 1a inputs required to make these calculations include the soil water retention curve or soil moisture characteristic for each soil layer fig 1b the volumetric water content lower limit available to the crop or permanent wilting point for the soil layer where roots are located and the maximum upward water movement vs water table depth relationships fig 1c 2 1 3 infiltration modifications the wepp model v2012 8 calculates the cumulative infiltration using the green ampt mein larson model for erratic rainfall the primary assumption used under the wide variety of the model versions including mein larson s is that the infiltration rate can be expressed in terms of the cumulative infiltration regardless of the infiltration rate this means that once the cumulative infiltration is obtained the green ampt model can be solved for the infiltration rate in the green ampt method two processes are distinguished a stage where the ground surface is ponded and a stage without surface ponding under ponding conditions the infiltration rate reaches its maximum capacity or infiltration capacity at this point the rainfall excess is computed as the difference between rainfall rate and infiltration capacity during no surface ponding all the rainfall infiltrates into the soil and the infiltration rate equals the rainfall intensity at this point there is no surface runoff in the updated algorithms the main advantage of the green ampt model is still used however mein and larson 1973 neglected the resistance to air movement in predicting the infiltration relationships which can be quite significant for shallow water tables where air may be entrapped between the advancing wetting front and the water table as a result the new approach includes the effect of entrapped air in the soil properties certainly entrapped air effects are already contained within the wepp model which modifies hydraulic conductivity and field capacity values however the water table depth as shown in this paper may not be reliable under this assumption also the green ampt model depends on suitable initial conditions that rely on a range of water table depths thus a set of green and ampt parameters a and b versus water depths are inputs into the new version of the wepp model fig 1d infiltration and runoff are then calculated for surface ponding and no surface ponding conditions as explained previously the green ampt equation adopts the following form green and ampt 1911 6 f k s 1 m s w f where k s is the vertical soil hydraulic conductivity in the transmission zone m is the fillable porosity s w is the effective suction at the wetting front and f is the cumulative infiltration the original form of the green ampt expression was derived under total saturation behind the wetting front however this assumption was relaxed by philip 1954 so that k s is expected to be less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity for a given soil with an initial water content eq 6 can be written as 7 f a f b where the parameters a k s m s av and b k s depend on soil properties initial water content distribution surface conditions and water table depth as in other green ampt formulations infiltration rates are set equal to rainfall rates until infiltration capacity is exceeded for shallow water table soils a typical initial condition is an unsaturated profile in equilibrium with the water table in this study the wepp model was modified to input a set of parameters a and b versus water table depths fig 1d for water table depths in between input values parameters can be calculated by linear interpolation skaggs 1980 presents detailed methods to calculate the parameters a and b required for the wepp model from both experimental and numerical derived data the numerical method described here was implemented and adopted in the wepp model v2012 9 using the input parameters derived from the application of a soil properties generator model schaap et al 2001 based on soil properties used in the wepp model v2012 8 so that no additional inputs are required 2 1 4 water balance a primary wepp model water balance is calculated at daily time increments flanagan and nearing 1995 in this study a secondary water balance within the soil profile was performed on an hourly basis to capture the variation of drainage fluxes in a more realistic fashion xian et al 2017 a section of unit surface area extending from the impermeable layer to the soil surface and located midway between parallel drains is idealized the water balance within the soil profile is then expressed by the following 8 δ v p q d h e t h i f h where v p is the variation in water free pore space in the soil profile cm q dh is the drainage flux leaving the soil section cm et h is the evapotranspiration including soil and residue evaporation and plant transpiration cm and if h is the infiltrated water cm as evapotranspiration rates are calculated daily in the wepp model v2012 8 daily evapotranspiration is distributed during a 12 h period 6 am to 6 pm to ensure an hourly water balance it is assumed that evapotranspiration is only significant during daylight additionally a computational sub time step equal to 0 05 h is used to calculate infiltration when rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity once change in air volume in the profile is calculated the water distribution in the soil is estimated at each time step and each component of the primary water balance is updated to produce daily outputs 2 1 5 upward water movement capillary rise from the water table depth supplies water to the plant roots as a result it is an important process in models simulating water management systems such as artificial subsurface drainage as the water table rises water can be transmitted by capillary rise to the root zone to satisfy the et demand of the crops capillary rise affects the water table drawdown since soil profile water is lost by upward flux consequently upward flux has a direct effect on evapotranspiration originally the wepp model did not account for upward water movement modifications to the model were completed to determine the steady upward flux from different water table depths for the soils examined in this study the method used here was illustrated by memon et al 1986 where the concept of matrix flux potential mflp was defined by shaykewich and stroosnijder 1977 9 m f l p h h o h max k h d h where h max is the maximum pressure head cm allowed at the center of the effective root zone and h o is the pressure head at the water table cm taylor and ashcroft 1972 presented values of h max for a wide range of crops these values vary with crop growth using the integral from the darcy buckingham equation as 10 q k h z o z d z h o h k h d h where q is the rate of upward movement cm day and z is the water table depth cm substituting eq 10 into eq 9 a finite difference form of eq 9 is obtained 11 z i 1 m f l p i 1 m f l p i q k h i 1 k h i 2 for a range of soil matric potentials i e h 500 cm to h 0 soil matric potentials at the effective root zone and at the water table respectively an assumed flux upward z i 1 can be estimated the accumulated value of z i 1 represents the water table depth as the corresponding upward water movement occurs these calculations are repeated for several values of q which represents theoretical values of the maximum amount of water supplied by capillary rise of the water table that can be used for plant transpiration calculations of the maximum upflux of water require previous knowledge of the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity when the water table is at h cm the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h for each soil layer is estimated using the mualem and dagan 1978 model 12 k θ s e n 0 θ θ h 2 b d 0 θ s θ h 2 b d where n is the pore size distribution b is the soil tortuosity s e is the effective saturation defined as θ θ s θ is the effective water content defined as water content minus residual water content θ r and θ s is the water content at saturation this model ensures that k θ s corresponds to the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity k s soil water retention curves were fitted using the van genuchten 1980 model 13 s e 1 1 α h n m where α is the air entry value and m is a fitting parameter set to one all parameters required by the mualem and dagan and van genuchten models are numerically calculated from soil texture soil density field capacity and wilting point 2 1 6 additional modifications supplementary modifications to the wepp model v2012 8 source code were performed to completely adapt the model to the new subsurface drainage routines and all the changes previously discussed wepp input routines were modified to allow inclusion of field and laboratory measurements such as soil water retention curves upward movement of water or capillary rise lateral hydraulic conductivity and relevant information used for drainage flux estimation lastly output routines were also modified to provide a temporal description of subsurface drainage a new output file now includes information on water table level subsurface drainage and water free pore space 2 2 experimental sites a field selected to perform an uncalibrated validation of the current version of the wepp model v2012 8 and its latter modifications from now on called es 1 is located near hamilton in steuben county northeast indiana fig 2 the usda ars national soil erosion research laboratory nserl at purdue university west lafayette indiana collects crop management and subsurface drainage data to assess water and soil conservation practice implementation effects dominant soils in the area of study are blount loam and pewamo silty clay loam table 1 the drainage system consists of corrugated plastic drains separated every 10 m at a depth of 1 m from the soil surface meteorological data and drainage fluxes were measured from 2015 to 2017 at the experimental site table 2 drainage flow characteristics such as discharge and velocity were measured with a thelmar 12 compound weir and a teledyne isco tienet 350 area velocity sensor attached to a teledyne isco 330 flowmeter respectively crop and soil management at es 1 are a two year corn soybean rotation and annual primary and secondary tillage operations respectively see crop management section and table 2 for calibration and validation evaluations fields named here es 2 4 were selected to demonstrate the efficiency of the enhanced version of the wepp model v2012 9 after the modifications proposed in this paper sites es 2 4 are located in northwest ohio and managed by local farmers fig 2 the fields are part of the usda ars edge of field network managed by the usda ars soil drainage research unit the area has dominant soils such as hoytville silty clay loam and hoytville clay loam see table 1 for physical properties for these sites pipe spacing ranges from 6 to 10 m at depths varying from 0 76 to 1 m see table 2 drainage fluxes and precipitation from 2014 to 2018 were measured at the experimental sites additional weather variables were obtained from the ohio agricultural research and development center https www oardc ohio state edu weather1 oardc northwest branch crop management data are detailed in the crop management section and table 2 2 3 model input and calibration validation the hillslope wepp model simulation uses four basic inputs 1 climate inputs describing temporal variability of precipitation temperature radiation and wind speed and direction 2 hydraulic and physical properties of single or layered soils i e depths soil textures effective hydraulic conductivity etc 3 detailed description of the steepness along the hillslope profile and 4 plant crop management data purposely the es 1 site was only used for an uncalibrated validation and calibration was not performed since the goal was to evaluate the accuracy of the current version and the improved version of the wepp model under the same input conditions and parameters to evaluate the modifications of the wepp model v2012 9 under different soil and drainage conditions fields es 2 4 were used for calibration and validation a sensitivity analysis using the model independent parameter estimation uncertainty analysis pest doherty 2015 software revealed that the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity and saturated lateral hydraulic conductivity were the most sensitive parameters calibration of those parameters was performed until the best efficiency of the model to predict observed drainage fluxes was obtained drainmod based model studies have demonstrated that model response is sensitive to multiple soil parameters among other variables i e monthly potential evapotranspiration and usually calibrated however in this study only the first two most sensitive parameters were adjusted to maintain simplicity and practicability of the model singh et al 2006 2007 morrison et al 2014 qi et al 2015 liang et al 2018 after the model calibration a one year period was selected for validation purposes for the simulations one year 2017 and two year 2014 2015 warmup periods were used for wepp to develop reliable initial conditions for the es 1 and es 2 4 sites respectively 2 3 1 meteorological data meteorological data including hourly precipitation and relative humidity maximum and minimum daily air temperatures and wind speed and direction measured at the site es 1 were collected as part of the conservation effects assessment project ceap similarly weather data at es 2 4 were collected at each experimental site all these data were used to calculate potential evapotranspiration using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 missing values in the climatic data were obtained from the oardc weather system within a 30 km radius from the sites used for calibration daily solar radiation for the same period was obtained from the national solar radiation data base nsrdb 2 3 2 soil hydraulic parameters most field soil properties relevant in subsurface flow estimation in the current version of the wepp model were input as described in the nrcs soil survey for the soil found at the experimental sites table 1 these properties included soil texture field capacity wilting point bulk density and vertical hydraulic conductivities per each soil layer however the improved version of the model required additional parameters to generate three main functions soil water retention drainage volume and maximum capillary movement although these additional relationships are commonly measured under laboratory conditions in this paper pedotransfer functions ptfs were used to predict the additional soil hydraulic parameters and subsequently develop the three input parameters table 1 schaap et al 2001 presents the rosetta software a hierarchical neural network analysis model that uses soil textures and soil water content at 33 and 1500 kpa and ptfs for generating sets of soil hydraulic properties this method is convenient since it allows the generation of the additional soil hydraulic parameters using the same information obtained from the nrcs soil survey in addition to the parameters shown in table 1 the wepp model soil input file requires information on organic matter and cation exchange capacity both available in the nrcs soil survey 2 3 3 crop plant management crop parameters for wepp model simulations were obtained from the extensive database available within the model installation the management input file contains all information related to plants crops grown growth parameters residue characteristics residue decomposition parameters tillage implements soil disturbance parameters as well as their temporal and spatial description management information collected at each of the sites included tillage operations planting and harvesting dates fertilizer application and details on the subsurface drainage system installation table 2 site es 1 consisted of a two year corn soybean rotation with primary and secondary tillage operations using a plowing disk and field cultivator respectively field es 2 had a two year corn soybean rotation with no tillage operations tillage operations in es 3 included primary tillage with a combination subsoiler disk ripper 30 48 cm 12 deep and land leveler equipment and secondary tillage using a seedbed conditioner turbo tillage lastly es 4 included primary tillage with a disk chisel 20 25 cm 8 10 deep and secondary tillage using a field cultivator with a rolling harrow 5 cm 2 deep 2 3 4 performance evaluation measures statistical measures can be used to quantify the differences between the predicted and observed values and evaluate the model efficiency in this study four statistical measures were used to assess the quality and reliability of wepp model predictions of subsurface drainage root mean square error rmse liang et al 2018 mean absolute error mae willmott and matsuura 2005 percent bias pbias yapo et al 1996 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 14 r m s e i 1 n o i s i 2 n 15 m a e 1 n i 1 n o i s i 16 p b i a s 100 i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 17 n s e 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 where n is the number of observed simulated values o i is the ith observed value and s i is the ith simulated value rmse represents the absolute difference between observed and simulated values mae measures the average magnitude of the errors between the observations and predictions without considering their direction pbias quantifies the average tendency of the simulated values to be larger or smaller than the observed values and nse measures the model performance evaluation metrics are compared with the calibration criteria for statistical measures of agreement between predicted and measured drainage volume in moriasi et al 2015 and skaggs et al 2012c the mse incorporates both random and systematic errors willmott 1982 webster 1997 as it is significant to distinguish between these two errors systematic errors can be seen as errors that can be corrected by calibration in contrast random errors indicate that a model s mathematical structure cannot capture the temporal and spatial variability present within the natural system or the hydrological processes in this case licciardello et al 2009 the latter can indicate insufficient quality data or a secondary model structure this last type of error cannot be corrected by calibration the systematic errors mse s and random errors mse u are calculated with the following equation licciardello et al 2009 18 m s e m s e s m s e u 1 n p i ˆ o i 2 1 n p i p i ˆ 2 where mse is the mean square error p i and o i are the wepp model v2012 8 predicted and observed values and p i is the linear regression predicted value expressed as 19 p i ˆ a o i b where a and b are regression coefficients the mse s and mse u were calculated for calibrated and validated conditions of the wepp model v2012 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncalibrated performance at es 1 wepp v2012 8 vs v2012 9 daily drainage measurements at es 1 were initiated in late 2015 and collected until 2017 two years 2016 2017 of drainage flux weather variables and crop management data were used to compare the uncalibrated performance of the current wepp model v2012 8 and the enhanced wepp model v2012 9 simulated daily drainage values using the current wepp version showed a poor match with measured drainage flux distribution and peaks fig 3 the model predicted values presented delayed responses with respect to the observed values model accuracy measures indicated both large differences between simulated and observed conditions and poor model performance table 3 for instance the rmse and mae for uncalibrated conditions were 0 686 cm and 0 402 cm respectively these measures represent substantial differences since drainage values at es 1 varied from 0 0 to 2 65 cm percent bias was 69 8 meaning that 70 of the simulated values tended to be greater than the observations overall model performance was poor nse 0 with an nse of 1 17 after analyzing the results it was difficult to compare predicted to observed values as the water table depth in the current wepp version did not present a realistic temporal distribution fig 4 as often observed in previous subsurface drainage investigations skaggs et al 2012a 2012b saadat et al 2017 simulations showed water table depth gradients changed very quickly under the presence of small amounts of rainfall or when water was removed from the soil through evapotranspiration for instance in the 2016 growing season a sudden decline of the water table depth was observed fig 4 red solid line when water was above the depth to the pipe 100 cm the water table depths were limited to the soil depth 80 cm this behavior seemed to be related to the assumption of the wepp model moving all water above the field capacity at the end of the day which forces the model to maintain the water table depth only to a certain soil depth fig 4 red solid line in other words these two behaviors cause transitions between saturated and unsaturated conditions to happen very quickly which is unusual for many soils there are several possible reasons why wepp drainage fluxes and water table depths were poorly simulated first the 24 hour time step used to calculate drainage in the current model is large and water table depths can change rapidly during this period xian et al 2017 second the wepp model seemed to predict a perched water table and not a water table with saturated conditions from the bottom of the soil profile internally wepp runs its water routing percolation process through nine layers and creates saturated conditions in upper layers while lower layers may not be saturated however wepp assumes that water table depth was created from the bottom to top of the soil profile as a result lower layers may be in an unsaturated condition and the transitions between saturated and unsaturated states can occur quickly lastly the wepp model appeared to underestimate snow melt for the observed field conditions which reduced infiltration water and along with the saturated condition of the topsoil layer that water then tended to leave the hillslope in the form of runoff later in the simulations as a result a flat water table was observed during winter periods of the simulations fig 4 red solid line although this might not affect previous studies where the main purpose was to predict runoff induced erosion savabi 1993 savabi et al 1995 zhang et al 1996 this turned out to be important for drainage flux estimation where soil water distribution played an important role the problem discussed above confirmed some of the findings previously reported by oztekin et al 2004 and re emphasized that the wepp model needed improvements in its drainage computations after all model modifications drainage predictions were statistically improved table 3 at site es 1 water table depth showed more expected variations fig 4 black solid line similar to those produced in soils under shallow water tables skaggs et al 2012c predicted drainage peaks matched observed peaks in most cases fig 3 black solid line and deviations between predicted and observed drainage improved fig 5 solid circles in periods where plants were actively growing may oct the water table depths were deeper than the pipe installation depth and consequently drainage stopped these periods also had greater rates of evapotranspiration so that infiltrated water decreased to its minimum differences between observed and predicted daily drainage depth amounts were reduced by more than 50 after the proposed modifications rmse and mae were 0 337 and 0 154 cm respectively whereas the current version of wepp overpredicted drainage pbias 69 8 the modified version underpredicted it pbias 33 2 model efficiency nse 0 47 greatly increased after the model code changes the coefficient of determination r2 between simulated event drainage amount values and observations was equal to 0 50 fig 6a 3 2 drainage at uncalibrated sites es 2 4 performance measures of the enhanced wepp model v2012 9 for uncalibrated conditions u m are shown in table 3 site es 2 presented the largest errors of all three locations with rmse and mae equal to 0 157 cm and 0 069 cm respectively es 3 and es 4 presented similar values of rmse and mae ranging from 0 100 cm to mae 0 046 cm the wepp model v2012 9 applied to es 2 4 tended to underestimate drainage water depth amounts with pbias 68 9 53 4 and 30 5 respectively nse values for individual drainage event depths ranged from 0 27 to 0 47 for the three uncalibrated fields table 3 these performance levels indicate that the uncalibrated version of the improved wepp model predicted daily drainage discharge depths with an accuracy ranging from 30 to 50 for the experimental fields analyzed in this study similar to the uncalibrated validation at es 1 the values of rmse and mae calculated with the current version of the model v2012 8 at es 2 4 were about twice as high as ones using the improved version of the model table 3 rmse ranged from 0 155 to 0 299 cm whereas mae ranged from 0 096 to 0 183 cm average values of subsurface drainage depths tended to be overpredicted at sites es 3 and es 4 with pbias 88 4 and 20 respectively while at es 2 values were underpredicted with pbias 12 4 lastly poor behavior of the model was indicated by the negative nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values varying from 4 72 to 0 18 for sites es 3 4 these results contrasted with those obtained using the improved wepp model v2012 9 that increased the confidence in the model enhancements to predict daily estimates of drainage flow one can easily notice that for the uncalibrated conditions all sites es 1 4 were in the acceptable range of performance according to moriasi et al 2015 and skaggs et al 2012c which means the modifications performed in the wepp model allow suitable subsurface drainage estimation for the field conditions found at the study sites in the following section the saturated vertical and lateral hydraulic conductivity values of the soils at sites es 2 4 were adjusted manually to improve the model performance during the calibration period a validation period was then evaluated to observe the model behavior under the calibration parameters 3 3 drainage at calibrated validated sites es 2 4 simulated drainage amounts at the calibrated sites es 2 4 using the enhanced wepp model v2012 9 were expected to agree well with observations since the two soil input parameters k sv and k sl were adjusted although more parameters could be adjusted to reach an optimal agreement changing many input parameters can lead to non meaningful model reliability skaggs et al 2012c presented a list of possible soil and physical parameters that may be adjusted due to uncertainty found in field scale simulations here only hydraulic conductivities most sensitive soil parameters were adjusted to allow for assessment of the model potential for predicting drainage amounts under limited calibration table 3 shows the differences and model efficiencies between observed and predicted drainage amounts at the calibrated sites es 2 had the greatest errors among all sites with rmse and mae equal to 0 106 cm and 0 053 cm respectively es 3 and es 4 had similar error magnitudes rmse 0 071 cm and mae 0 035 cm although rmse is in the same drainage units it does not give either the relative size or the nature of the errors the updated wepp model applied to es 2 and es 4 tended to underestimate drainage amounts with pbias 39 3 and 32 4 respectively wepp applied in es 3 overpredicted drainage pbias 38 2 model efficiencies ranged from 0 52 to 0 71 for all sites table 3 even though these efficiencies might be improved by a more detailed calibration procedure values between 0 50 nse 1 00 are considered acceptable when predicting subsurface drainage amounts wang et al 2006 skaggs et al 2012c for all the fields es 3 4 the systematic errors mses ranged from 0 012 to 0 059 cm for calibrated conditions whereas for validation simulations the mses values ranged from 0 01 to 0 031 cm with overall values close to zero and small in comparison with the observed subsurface discharge this behavior indicates that the model exhibited an acceptable calibration procedure on the other hand random errors ranged from 0 051 to 0 063 cm and from 0 049 to 0 057 cm for the calibration and validation simulations respectively one can see that overall we obtained greater random errors than systematic errors however the former indicates that additional enhancements can be made to the structure of the model as random errors should approach the rmse willmott 1982 average values of calibrated k sv and k sl ranged from 0 325 to 1 366 cm h 1 and from 0 935 to 2 488 cm h 1 respectively clay loam soils at es 2 and es 4 showed similar magnitudes of both vertical and lateral hydraulic conductivities 1 342 and 1 892 cm h 1 respectively table 4 this behavior was expected since soils at those sites had similar physical and hydraulic properties table 1 k sv and k sl for es 3 were 0 325 and 0 979 cm h 1 respectively table 4 fig 6 shows substantial correlation between predicted and observed drainage amounts with coefficients of determination r 2 ranging from 0 69 to 0 73 wepp v2012 9 model predictions at the es 3 4 sites had the greatest correlation fig 6 also shows how model predictions at es 3 tended to overpredict drainage amounts whereas simulations at es 2 and es 4 showed the opposite behavior predicted daily drainage fluxes at es 2 4 for the calibration period 2016 2017 matched most of the peaks in the observed data fig 7 also most of the drainage occurred during the spring months march may when crops were not in the field or at initial growth stages and did not have any significant effect on drainage rates for the validation period at sites es 2 4 rmse and mae were similar in magnitude to the ones in the calibration period rmse average values were 0 10 cm and mae values were 0 47 cm the latter shows that the mean errors tended to be greater in the validation period percent bias in the same period showed improvement with respect to the calibration period being equal to 28 2 15 4 and 15 3 for es 2 es 3 and es 4 respectively while the modified wepp model v2012 9 was overpredicting daily drainage flux at es 3 for the calibration period estimates were underpredicted for the validation period nse values decreased during the validation period at sites es 3 and es 4 to 0 42 and 0 69 respectively however for site es 2 nse improved from 0 65 to 0 73 in summary the modified version of the wepp model showed an acceptable response to predict daily drainage depths under the conditions found at experimental sites es 2 4 for the validation period selected in this study 3 4 water balance at the experimental sites average infiltrated water contributing either to evapotranspiration or subsurface drainage at es 2 4 for the entire time period 2016 2018 corresponded to 78 99 and 92 of the annual precipitation respectively evapotranspiration amounts at the experimental sites es 2 4 accounted for approximately 53 78 and 71 of the annual precipitation respectively table 5 no seepage was calculated since we assumed that all infiltrated water not contributing to evapotranspiration was drained through the pipes es 3 had the greatest rates of infiltration and evapotranspiration the latter might have occurred due to the presence of a crop during the winter period which induced water infiltration and increased water demand by evapotranspiration the rates of evapotranspiration for es 2 4 were compared to the mean annual values for northwestern ohio and northeast indiana calculated in the sanford and selnick 2013 study the estimated mean annual ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation et p at sites es 2 4 were 0 61 0 75 0 70 respectively those et p values are comparable to a mean value equal to 0 65 found for the field locations in sanford and selnick 2013 accumulated monthly amounts of drainage for the experimental sites are shown in fig 8 similar to the daily amounts model simulations for es 2 and es 4 underpredicted monthly drainage amounts while simulations at es 3 overpredicted the drainage amounts for most months the improved version of the wepp model simulated 70 of the subsurface drainage at the sites accurately model simulations for es 2 4 showed fairly good agreement for drainage fluxes during the winter months for the first two years 2016 2017 fig 8 however drainage for the last year of the calibration period was not as accurately simulated this difference can be attributed to the fact that the assumption of drained to equilibrium which was used here to calculate drainage does not consider the effects of the freezing and thawing processes on water movement in soils additionally soils used in this study present zones with macropores and preferential flow where the assumption of no seepage may be not a suitable hypothesis this issue can be solved by incorporating the unfrozen water content curve derived from the soil freezing characteristic curve measured on site or approximated using air temperature as a reference luo et al 2000 annual observed and predicted drainage amounts are reported in table 6 wepp v2012 9 simulations at es 1 es 2 and es 4 predicted 67 of the observed total drained water for the entire simulated period model predictions at es 3 overestimated 20 subsurface flow about 70 of the annual drainage amount at es 1 was accurately predicted which indicates that the modified wepp model can provided acceptable annual estimates of subsurface drainage for similar soils and conditions among the models for subsurface drainage simulations for both field and watershed scales drainmod has been leading research at field scales for a comparison between the wepp model v2012 9 and drainmod v6 0 performances recent field studies using drainmod can be divided into two categories depending on the nature of the input soil properties 1 studies using experimental based inputs yang et al 2007 salazar et al 2009 nabi sichani and sepaskhah 2012 skaggs et al 2012c

2014 qi et al 2015 the overall efficiency i e nse of the studies contained in the first category was 0 65 however about 50 of those studies were focused on monthly drainage estimates average nash sutcliffe efficiency for monthly drainage fluxes was 0 75 whereas for the daily drainage fluxes nse 0 60 the performance of the model in the second category provided an overall efficiency of 0 60 whereas nash sutcliffe efficiency values for the daily and monthly drainage studies were 0 72 and 0 40 respectively the nse values found in this study for daily and monthly drainage estimates were 0 63 and 0 70 respectively the improved wepp model v2012 9 thus showed a comparable efficiency for both monthly and daily drainage estimates among the studies found in the literature this indicates that the new version of the wepp model presented in this study may be a suitable tool for computing estimates of subsurface drainage without any increase in the amount of input data required in previous versions of the model 4 concluding remarks the field scale hydrologic models wepp v2012 8 and v2012 9 were tested to simulate the effect of artificial subsurface drainage on hydrology of four fields within the western lake erie basin u s initial testing of wepp showed that the current version v2012 8 did not accurately predict the daily amount of subsurface drainage modifications in the tile drainage percolation water balance and soil water distribution algorithms were made to the source code to improve the model drainage calculations calibration and validation of the improved version of the model v2012 9 in three agricultural fields showed that wepp could predict subsurface drainage amounts well with nse 0 6 on average 21 of the precipitation left the field through drain pipes at the sites studied here the monthly and annual amounts of water leaving through drains were also predicted well nse 0 70 the combined use of the enhanced wepp model and a suitable soil property estimation model rosetta showed that an acceptable amount of drainage could be estimated with limited field data additional future modifications can be performed to improve the wepp model estimates of subsurface drainage under shallow water tables during winter conditions the results of this study when implemented will increase confidence in the wepp model predictions for agricultural fields with installed drainage systems in the midwest u s further investigations using field data and modification of the model to controlled water table conditions are recommended to understand the impacts of shallow

10357,in the poorly drained regions of the world subsurface drainage systems are required to remove excess water for crop growth plastic drains alter a field s hydrology by lowering the water table reducing surface ponding and reducing surface runoff one significant concern with the use of subsurface drainage systems is adverse environmental effects because of the modification of the soil water dynamics some effects include the reduction of ecological services since wetlands change to croplands water quality concerns particularly sediment nitrogen and phosphorus losses in agricultural subsurface discharge water as well as changes in the volume and timing of off site discharges hydrological simulation models predict surface and artificial subsurface flow at different scales often in these models hooghoudt based expressions are adapted in their internal algorithms in this study the water erosion prediction project wepp model developed by the united states department of agriculture

validated on an extensive dataset collected at four experimental sites managed by usda ars within the lake erie watershed predicted drainage discharges show nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values ranging from 0 50 to 0 70 and percent bias ranging from 30 to 15 at daily and monthly resolutions evidence suggests that the wepp model can be used to produce reliable estimates of subsurface flow with minimum calibration future work includes the extension of the model for quantifying subsurface drainage under controlled water table and watershed scale simulations keywords artificial drainage hydrology prediction simulation validation wepp 1 introduction humid areas in northern europe canada and the midwest u s are artificially drained by lowering the water table of perennially or seasonably wet soils pavelis 1987 gilliam et al 1999 in the humid upper midwestern portion of the u s about 37 of the land 20 6 million ha has been artificially drained to transform wet soils into highly productive cropland zucker and brown 1998 drainage impacts hillslope and watershed hydrology as it increases the water storage capacity and improves physical structure of the upper layers of the soils skaggs and broadhead 1982 fraser and flemming 2001 higher storage capacity reduces surface runoff and promotes infiltration skaggs et al 1987 robinson and rycroft 1999 research shows that artificially drained soils act as a buffer for rainfall and spread runoff over longer time periods thus peak flows decrease and less flooding occurs as a result robinson 1990 konyha et al 1992 skaggs et al 1994 schilling and helmers 2008 henine et al 2010 crop production benefits from subsurface drainage since it affects physical and chemical soil properties and strongly influences crop growth and quality messing and wesström 2006 vopravil et al 2017 as the goal of proper subsurface drainage is to remove excess gravitational water consisting of shallow groundwater flow and water moving downward from upper soil horizons constant aeration of the crop rooting zone promotes root health and microbial activity which are important for maximizing nutrient availability kladivko et al 1999 tiemeyer et al 2006 additionally artificial drainage allows earlier planting which increases the yield potential for crops kornecki and fouss 2001 research has additionally demonstrated that subsurface drainage improves workability reduces the potential for soil compaction and decreases surface ponding aldabagh and beer 1971 kornecki and fouss 2001 mathematical formulations have been developed to predict subsurface flow and associated transport focused on determining the optimal size and spacing of pipes in the field under steady or non steady flow conditions most investigations assume systems with parallel drainage and equally spaced pipes wesseling 1964 kirkham 1966 van schilfgaarde 1970 with hooghoudt s equation hooghoudt 1940 applied to approximate flow into two parallel drains however when parallel spacing is not a suitable assumption e g fields with irregular systems the actual spacing is substituted by an effective spacing which approximates the system to equivalent parallel drains of the same length effective spacing is not site specific but somewhat depends on the soil type kurien et al 1997 and accretion rate northcott et al 2001 hydrological simulation models estimate subsurface flow to drains at different scales these models include the large scale soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 field scale models such as drainmod skaggs et al 2012c gleams leonard et al 1987 and adapt gowda et al 2012 the root zone water quality model rzwqm ma et al 2012 as well as the multiscale water erosion prediction project wepp flanagan and nearing 1995 flanagan and livingston 1995 model other models include mathematical algorithms such as drenafem castanheira and santos 2009 and hydrus2d simunek et al 1999 although the latter two models are not hydrologic formulations they offer a more complex and complete representation of the transient saturated unsaturated vertical flow in the soil profile in practice however the hydrological models previously mentioned are solely based on the kirkham kirkham 1966 and hooghoudt s equation hooghoudt 1940 at watershed and hillslope scales respectively swat and drainmod have been extensively validated whereas gleams adapt rzwqm and wepp have limited evidence of their success for subsurface drainage estimation as subsurface drainage influences infiltration and surface runoff it is an important factor in the soil erosion process drainage reduces surface runoff but questions abound on its influence on sediment transport through hillslopes and watersheds skaggs et al 1982 and maalim and melesse 2013 used the drainmod and wepp models respectively to estimated average annual rates of erosion they found that annual rates of erosion are up to 10 times lower when subsurface drainage is used as a practice to control water table depths however none of these predictions were validated with observed data from a modeling standpoint drainmod has been widely applied in the united states for subsurface flow prediction however it neglects the effects of management operations agricultural practices and subsurface drainage on hillslope hydrology which are conditions that greatly influence soil erosion by water management practices such as soil disturbance by tillage operations residue management and decomposition and soil erosion control practices are incorporated in the wepp model flanagan et al 2007 an environmental model for soil erosion prediction used by the united states department of agriculture usda in soil and water conservation planning activities wepp includes mechanisms such as weather generation winter processes irrigation hydrology plant growth management operations and erosion for both hillslope and watershed scales licciardello et al 2013 migliaccio and srivastava 2007 however model inconsistencies have been found when validating the subsurface drainage algorithms oztekin et al 2004 such discrepancies include overprediction of daily runoff for daily storms large deviations between observed and simulated subsurface flow conditions and poor representation of the water table depth variations although these inconsistencies were addressed by comparing the model predictions with those using drainmod there is no validation of the model using observed field drainage data and no updates have been included in the current public version of the wepp model v2012 8 a comprehensive understanding of the hydrology of subsurface drainage fields and its impact on sediment delivery and transport are major knowledge gaps sims et al 1998 king et al 2014 king et al 2015 that restrict suitable cropland management strategies improved water quality soil erosion mitigation and selection and implementation of best management practices the goal of this study was to evaluate and enhance the wepp model subsurface drainage routines to provide a more realistic and holistic representation of the conditions observed in agricultural fields under subsurface drainage systems the model improvements will not only extend the applicability of the current version of the wepp model to artificially drained croplands and contribute to reducing the gap seen between agricultural practices and subsurface drainage but will also better account for these effects on soil erosion predictions a comprehensive dataset of hourly weather variables and daily subsurface flow collected at four experimental sites managed by the usda ars in the lake erie watershed were used for testing and validation as part of this study particularly this research provides details on 1

algorithms and the incorporation of soil water movement by capillary rise from the water table into the model code and 3 evaluation calibration and validation of the new subsurface drainage algorithms implemented in the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the wepp model flanagan et al 2012 ascough et al 2013 is a soil erosion prediction tool developed since 1985 to replace the well known empirical universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 contrary to the usle the wepp model is a process based technology that estimates the spatial and temporal distribution of soil loss and sediment deposition at both hillslope and watershed scales flanagan et al 2007 it simulates continuous processes with a daily time step including weather generation hydrologic processes soil physics plant growth and erosion mechanics the model water balance based on soil water content in the root zone includes processes such as infiltration runoff percolation soil and residue evaporation plant transpiration lateral flow snowmelt subsurface drainage and seepage for more details on those processes and the model structure see the model documentation flanagan and nearing 1995 the current subsurface drainage component of wepp savabi 1993 simulates subsurface flow to pipes or ditches drainage fluxes are estimated for a given water table depth with the steady state hooghoudt equation bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 as follows 1 q d 4 k e m 2 d e m l 2 where k e is the soil s equivalent lateral hydraulic conductivity cm h 1 m is the midpoint water table elevation above the pipes cm d e is the equivalent depth from the drain to the impervious layer cm and l is the drain spacing cm the equivalent depth in the equation can be calculated with the moody 1967 equations 2 d e d 1 d l 8 π l n d r 3 4 d l 0 3 3 d e l π 8 l n l r 1 15 d l 0 3 where d is the distance between the impervious layer and the drain cm and r is the effective drain radius cm eq 1 in the wepp model v2012 8 calculates the drainage rates when water table depth is located at and below the surface for the latter condition the hooghoudt equation has been widely applied and validated skaggs et al 2012c however for the water table at the surface the kirkham equation 1957 has shown a more accurate representation this condition and the inconsistencies previously mentioned were addressed by modifications in the model source code as described in the next subsections the wepp model v2012 9 the enhanced version of the model is used throughout this research for comparison purposes with the current version of the model v2012 8 2 1 1 subsurface drainage modifications for ponding of water at the soil surface drainage flow in the wepp model v2012 9 is computed as kirkham 1957 4 q d 4 π k e

at the soil surface and below are restricted to the drainage coefficient d c of the system cm day 2 1 2 soil water characteristics modifications the water re distribution approach used in the current version of the wepp model v2012 8 assumes that the water table is estimated from the bottom layer and ending at the topmost soil layer soils draining water are considered to be above the field capacity each of the saturated layers above the tiles contains a potential drainable amount of water once the potential is drained the respective soil layers return to their field capacity however this only happens once a day so that sub daily water table variations are omitted the pipes hydraulic coefficient limits the potential amount of water drained in the current version of the model the water s daily movement between layers in wepp at the end of the day starts from the bottom layer and progresses up to the surface layer as the model can simulate deep percolation the lower layer can become saturated due to the not yet percolated water after saturation the excess water is moved to the soil layer above https www ars usda gov arsuserfiles 50201000 wepp weppdrainage2012 pdf the soil water distribution in the enhanced version v2012 9 of the wepp model is assumed to be divided into wet and dry zones a wet zone develops from the water table level up to the root zone and possibly extending to the soil surface whereas a dry zone occurs when water is removed from the root zone storage once the maximum capillary rise from the water table is not sufficient to supply the evapotranspiration amount skaggs et al 2012c a drained to equilibrium condition is assumed to control the water distribution in the soil domain skaggs 1980 which represents a major change in the percolation routine in the wepp model v2012 8 which originally used storage routing techniques to percolate water content exceeding the soil field capacity the soil water distribution above the water table and the volume of water free pore space is calculated at each time step of the model fig 1a inputs required to make these calculations include the soil water retention curve or soil moisture characteristic for each soil layer fig 1b the volumetric water content lower limit available to the crop or permanent wilting point for the soil layer where roots are located and the maximum upward water movement vs water table depth relationships fig 1c 2 1 3 infiltration modifications the wepp model v2012 8 calculates the cumulative infiltration using the green ampt mein larson model for erratic rainfall the primary assumption used under the wide variety of the model versions including mein larson s is that the infiltration rate can be expressed in terms of the cumulative infiltration regardless of the infiltration rate this means that once the cumulative infiltration is obtained the green ampt model can be solved for the infiltration rate in the green ampt method two processes are distinguished a stage where the ground surface is ponded and a stage without surface ponding under ponding conditions the infiltration rate reaches its maximum capacity or infiltration capacity at this point the rainfall excess is computed as the difference between rainfall rate and infiltration capacity during no surface ponding all the rainfall infiltrates into the soil and the infiltration rate equals the rainfall intensity at this point there is no surface runoff in the updated algorithms the main advantage of the green ampt model is still used however mein and larson 1973 neglected the resistance to air movement in predicting the infiltration relationships which can be quite significant for shallow water tables where air may be entrapped between the advancing wetting front and the water table as a result the new approach includes the effect of entrapped air in the soil properties certainly entrapped air effects are already contained within the wepp model which modifies hydraulic conductivity and field capacity values however the water table depth as shown in this paper may not be reliable under this assumption also the green ampt model depends on suitable initial conditions that rely on a range of water table depths thus a set of green and ampt parameters a and b versus water depths are inputs into the new version of the wepp model fig 1d infiltration and runoff are then calculated for surface ponding and no surface ponding conditions as explained previously the green ampt equation adopts the following form green and ampt 1911 6 f k s 1 m s w f where k s is the vertical soil hydraulic conductivity in the transmission zone m is the fillable porosity s w is the effective suction at the wetting front and f is the cumulative infiltration the original form of the green ampt expression was derived under total saturation behind the wetting front however this assumption was relaxed by philip 1954 so that k s is expected to be less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity for a given soil with an initial water content eq 6 can be written as 7 f a f b where the parameters a k s m s av and b k s depend on soil properties initial water content distribution surface conditions and water table depth as in other green ampt formulations infiltration rates are set equal to rainfall rates until infiltration capacity is exceeded for shallow water table soils a typical initial condition is an unsaturated profile in equilibrium with the water table in this study the wepp model was modified to input a set of parameters a and b versus water table depths fig 1d for water table depths in between input values parameters can be calculated by linear interpolation skaggs 1980 presents detailed methods to calculate the parameters a and b required for the wepp model from both experimental and numerical derived data the numerical method described here was implemented and adopted in the wepp model v2012 9 using the input parameters derived from the application of a soil properties generator model schaap et al 2001 based on soil properties used in the wepp model v2012 8 so that no additional inputs are required 2 1 4 water balance a primary wepp model water balance is calculated at daily time increments flanagan and nearing 1995 in this study a secondary water balance within the soil profile was performed on an hourly basis to capture the variation of drainage fluxes in a more realistic fashion xian et al 2017 a section of unit surface area extending from the impermeable layer to the soil surface and located midway between parallel drains is idealized the water balance within the soil profile is then expressed by the following 8 δ v p q d h e t h i f h where v p is the variation in water free pore space in the soil profile cm q dh is the drainage flux leaving the soil section cm et h is the evapotranspiration including soil and residue evaporation and plant transpiration cm and if h is the infiltrated water cm as evapotranspiration rates are calculated daily in the wepp model v2012 8 daily evapotranspiration is distributed during a 12 h period 6 am to 6 pm to ensure an hourly water balance it is assumed that evapotranspiration is only significant during daylight additionally a computational sub time step equal to 0 05 h is used to calculate infiltration when rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity once change in air volume in the profile is calculated the water distribution in the soil is estimated at each time step and each component of the primary water balance is updated to produce daily outputs 2 1 5 upward water movement capillary rise from the water table depth supplies water to the plant roots as a result it is an important process in models simulating water management systems such as artificial subsurface drainage as the water table rises water can be transmitted by capillary rise to the root zone to satisfy the et demand of the crops capillary rise affects the water table drawdown since soil profile water is lost by upward flux consequently upward flux has a direct effect on evapotranspiration originally the wepp model did not account for upward water movement modifications to the model were completed to determine the steady upward flux from different water table depths for the soils examined in this study the method used here was illustrated by memon et al 1986 where the concept of matrix flux potential mflp was defined by shaykewich and stroosnijder 1977 9 m f l p h h o h max k h d h where h max is the maximum pressure head cm allowed at the center of the effective root zone and h o is the pressure head at the water table cm taylor and ashcroft 1972 presented values of h max for a wide range of crops these values vary with crop growth using the integral from the darcy buckingham equation as 10 q k h z o z d z h o h k h d h where q is the rate of upward movement cm day and z is the water table depth cm substituting eq 10 into eq 9 a finite difference form of eq 9 is obtained 11 z i 1 m f l p i 1 m f l p i q k h i 1 k h i 2 for a range of soil matric potentials i e h 500 cm to h 0 soil matric potentials at the effective root zone and at the water table respectively an assumed flux upward z i 1 can be estimated the accumulated value of z i 1 represents the water table depth as the corresponding upward water movement occurs these calculations are repeated for several values of q which represents theoretical values of the maximum amount of water supplied by capillary rise of the water table that can be used for plant transpiration calculations of the maximum upflux of water require previous knowledge of the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity when the water table is at h cm the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h for each soil layer is estimated using the mualem and dagan 1978 model 12 k θ s e n 0 θ θ h 2 b d 0 θ s θ h 2 b d where n is the pore size distribution b is the soil tortuosity s e is the effective saturation defined as θ θ s θ is the effective water content defined as water content minus residual water content θ r and θ s is the water content at saturation this model ensures that k θ s corresponds to the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity k s soil water retention curves were fitted using the van genuchten 1980 model 13 s e 1 1 α h n m where α is the air entry value and m is a fitting parameter set to one all parameters required by the mualem and dagan and van genuchten models are numerically calculated from soil texture soil density field capacity and wilting point 2 1 6 additional modifications supplementary modifications to the wepp model v2012 8 source code were performed to completely adapt the model to the new subsurface drainage routines and all the changes previously discussed wepp input routines were modified to allow inclusion of field and laboratory measurements such as soil water retention curves upward movement of water or capillary rise lateral hydraulic conductivity and relevant information used for drainage flux estimation lastly output routines were also modified to provide a temporal description of subsurface drainage a new output file now includes information on water table level subsurface drainage and water free pore space 2 2 experimental sites a field selected to perform an uncalibrated validation of the current version of the wepp model v2012 8 and its latter modifications from now on called es 1 is located near hamilton in steuben county northeast indiana fig 2 the usda ars national soil erosion research laboratory nserl at purdue university west lafayette indiana collects crop management and subsurface drainage data to assess water and soil conservation practice implementation effects dominant soils in the area of study are blount loam and pewamo silty clay loam table 1 the drainage system consists of corrugated plastic drains separated every 10 m at a depth of 1 m from the soil surface meteorological data and drainage fluxes were measured from 2015 to 2017 at the experimental site table 2 drainage flow characteristics such as discharge and velocity were measured with a thelmar 12 compound weir and a teledyne isco tienet 350 area velocity sensor attached to a teledyne isco 330 flowmeter respectively crop and soil management at es 1 are a two year corn soybean rotation and annual primary and secondary tillage operations respectively see crop management section and table 2 for calibration and validation evaluations fields named here es 2 4 were selected to demonstrate the efficiency of the enhanced version of the wepp model v2012 9 after the modifications proposed in this paper sites es 2 4 are located in northwest ohio and managed by local farmers fig 2 the fields are part of the usda ars edge of field network managed by the usda ars soil drainage research unit the area has dominant soils such as hoytville silty clay loam and hoytville clay loam see table 1 for physical properties for these sites pipe spacing ranges from 6 to 10 m at depths varying from 0 76 to 1 m see table 2 drainage fluxes and precipitation from 2014 to 2018 were measured at the experimental sites additional weather variables were obtained from the ohio agricultural research and development center https www oardc ohio state edu weather1 oardc northwest branch crop management data are detailed in the crop management section and table 2 2 3 model input and calibration validation the hillslope wepp model simulation uses four basic inputs 1 climate inputs describing temporal variability of precipitation temperature radiation and wind speed and direction 2 hydraulic and physical properties of single or layered soils i e depths soil textures effective hydraulic conductivity etc 3 detailed description of the steepness along the hillslope profile and 4 plant crop management data purposely the es 1 site was only used for an uncalibrated validation and calibration was not performed since the goal was to evaluate the accuracy of the current version and the improved version of the wepp model under the same input conditions and parameters to evaluate the modifications of the wepp model v2012 9 under different soil and drainage conditions fields es 2 4 were used for calibration and validation a sensitivity analysis using the model independent parameter estimation uncertainty analysis pest doherty 2015 software revealed that the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity and saturated lateral hydraulic conductivity were the most sensitive parameters calibration of those parameters was performed until the best efficiency of the model to predict observed drainage fluxes was obtained drainmod based model studies have demonstrated that model response is sensitive to multiple soil parameters among other variables i e monthly potential evapotranspiration and usually calibrated however in this study only the first two most sensitive parameters were adjusted to maintain simplicity and practicability of the model singh et al 2006 2007 morrison et al 2014 qi et al 2015 liang et al 2018 after the model calibration a one year period was selected for validation purposes for the simulations one year 2017 and two year 2014 2015 warmup periods were used for wepp to develop reliable initial conditions for the es 1 and es 2 4 sites respectively 2 3 1 meteorological data meteorological data including hourly precipitation and relative humidity maximum and minimum daily air temperatures and wind speed and direction measured at the site es 1 were collected as part of the conservation effects assessment project ceap similarly weather data at es 2 4 were collected at each experimental site all these data were used to calculate potential evapotranspiration using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 missing values in the climatic data were obtained from the oardc weather system within a 30 km radius from the sites used for calibration daily solar radiation for the same period was obtained from the national solar radiation data base nsrdb 2 3 2 soil hydraulic parameters most field soil properties relevant in subsurface flow estimation in the current version of the wepp model were input as described in the nrcs soil survey for the soil found at the experimental sites table 1 these properties included soil texture field capacity wilting point bulk density and vertical hydraulic conductivities per each soil layer however the improved version of the model required additional parameters to generate three main functions soil water retention drainage volume and maximum capillary movement although these additional relationships are commonly measured under laboratory conditions in this paper pedotransfer functions ptfs were used to predict the additional soil hydraulic parameters and subsequently develop the three input parameters table 1 schaap et al 2001 presents the rosetta software a hierarchical neural network analysis model that uses soil textures and soil water content at 33 and 1500 kpa and ptfs for generating sets of soil hydraulic properties this method is convenient since it allows the generation of the additional soil hydraulic parameters using the same information obtained from the nrcs soil survey in addition to the parameters shown in table 1 the wepp model soil input file requires information on organic matter and cation exchange capacity both available in the nrcs soil survey 2 3 3 crop plant management crop parameters for wepp model simulations were obtained from the extensive database available within the model installation the management input file contains all information related to plants crops grown growth parameters residue characteristics residue decomposition parameters tillage implements soil disturbance parameters as well as their temporal and spatial description management information collected at each of the sites included tillage operations planting and harvesting dates fertilizer application and details on the subsurface drainage system installation table 2 site es 1 consisted of a two year corn soybean rotation with primary and secondary tillage operations using a plowing disk and field cultivator respectively field es 2 had a two year corn soybean rotation with no tillage operations tillage operations in es 3 included

tillage with a disk chisel 20 25 cm 8 10 deep and secondary tillage using a field cultivator with a rolling harrow 5 cm 2 deep 2 3 4 performance evaluation measures statistical measures can be used to quantify the differences between the predicted and observed values and evaluate the model efficiency in this study four statistical measures were used to assess the quality and reliability of wepp

observed values and nse measures the model performance evaluation metrics are compared with the calibration criteria for statistical measures of agreement between predicted and measured drainage volume in moriasi et al 2015 and skaggs et al 2012c the mse incorporates both random and systematic errors willmott 1982 webster 1997 as it is significant to distinguish between these two errors systematic errors can be seen as errors that can be corrected by calibration in contrast random errors indicate that a model s mathematical structure cannot capture the temporal and spatial variability present within the natural system or the hydrological processes in this case licciardello et al 2009 the latter can indicate insufficient quality data or a secondary model structure this last type of error cannot be corrected by calibration the systematic errors mse s and random errors mse u are calculated with the following equation licciardello et al 2009 18 m s e m s e s m s e u 1 n p i ˆ o i 2 1 n p i p i ˆ 2 where mse is the mean square error p i and o i are the wepp model v2012 8 predicted and observed values and p i is the linear regression predicted value expressed as 19 p i ˆ a o i b where a and b are regression coefficients the mse s and mse u were calculated for calibrated and validated conditions of the wepp model v2012 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncalibrated performance at es 1 wepp v2012 8 vs v2012 9 daily drainage measurements at es 1 were initiated in late 2015 and collected until 2017 two years 2016 2017 of drainage flux weather variables and crop management data were used to compare the uncalibrated performance of the current wepp model v2012 8 and the enhanced wepp model v2012 9 simulated daily drainage values using the current wepp version showed a poor match with measured drainage flux distribution and peaks fig 3 the model predicted values presented delayed responses with respect to the observed values model accuracy measures indicated both large differences between simulated and observed conditions and poor model performance table 3 for instance the rmse and mae for uncalibrated conditions were 0 686 cm and 0 402 cm respectively these measures represent substantial differences since drainage values at es 1 varied from 0 0 to 2 65 cm percent bias was 69 8 meaning that 70 of the simulated values tended to be greater than the observations overall model performance was poor nse 0 with an nse of 1 17 after analyzing the results it was difficult to compare predicted to observed values as the water table depth in the current wepp version did not present a realistic temporal distribution fig 4 as often observed in previous subsurface drainage investigations skaggs et al 2012a 2012b saadat et al 2017 simulations showed water table depth gradients changed very quickly under the presence of small amounts of rainfall or when water was removed from the soil through evapotranspiration for instance in the 2016 growing season a sudden decline of the water table depth was observed fig 4 red solid line when water was above the depth to the pipe 100 cm the water table depths were limited to the soil depth 80 cm this behavior seemed to be related to the assumption of the wepp model moving all water above the field capacity at the end of the day which forces the model to maintain the water table depth only to a certain soil depth fig 4 red solid line in other words these two behaviors cause transitions between saturated and unsaturated conditions to happen very quickly which is unusual for many soils there are several possible reasons why wepp drainage fluxes and water table depths were poorly simulated first the 24 hour time step used to calculate drainage in the current model is large and water table depths can change rapidly during this period xian et al 2017 second the wepp model seemed to predict a perched water table and not a water table with saturated conditions from the bottom of the soil profile internally wepp runs its water routing percolation process through nine layers and creates saturated conditions in upper layers while lower layers may not be saturated however wepp assumes that water table depth was created from the bottom to top of the soil profile as a result lower layers may be in an unsaturated condition and the transitions between saturated and unsaturated states can occur quickly lastly the wepp model appeared to underestimate snow melt for the observed field conditions which reduced infiltration water and along with the saturated condition of the topsoil layer that water then tended to leave the hillslope in the form of runoff later in the simulations as a result a flat water table was observed during winter periods of the simulations fig 4 red solid line although this might not affect previous studies where the main purpose was to predict runoff induced erosion savabi 1993 savabi et al 1995 zhang et al 1996 this turned out to be important for drainage flux estimation where soil water distribution played an important role the problem discussed above confirmed some of the findings previously reported by oztekin et al 2004 and re emphasized that the wepp model needed improvements in its drainage computations after all model modifications drainage predictions were statistically improved table 3 at site es 1 water table depth showed more expected variations fig 4 black solid line similar to those produced in soils under shallow water tables skaggs et al 2012c predicted drainage peaks matched observed peaks in most cases fig 3 black solid line and deviations between predicted and observed drainage improved fig 5 solid circles in periods where plants were actively growing may oct the water table depths were deeper than the pipe installation depth and consequently drainage stopped these periods also had greater rates of evapotranspiration so that infiltrated water decreased to its minimum differences between observed and predicted daily drainage depth amounts were reduced by more than 50 after the proposed modifications rmse and mae were 0 337 and 0 154 cm respectively whereas the current version of wepp overpredicted drainage pbias 69 8 the modified version underpredicted it pbias 33 2 model efficiency nse 0 47 greatly increased after the model code changes the coefficient of determination r2 between simulated event drainage amount values and observations was equal to 0 50 fig 6a 3 2 drainage at uncalibrated sites es 2 4 performance measures of the enhanced wepp model v2012 9 for uncalibrated conditions u m are shown in table 3 site es 2 presented the largest errors of all three locations with rmse and mae equal to 0 157 cm and 0 069 cm respectively es 3 and es 4 presented similar values of rmse and mae ranging from 0 100 cm to mae 0 046 cm the wepp model v2012 9 applied to es 2 4 tended to underestimate drainage water depth amounts with pbias 68 9 53 4 and 30 5 respectively nse values for individual drainage event depths ranged from 0 27 to 0 47 for the three uncalibrated fields table 3 these performance levels indicate that the uncalibrated version of the improved wepp model predicted daily drainage discharge depths with an accuracy ranging from 30 to 50 for the experimental fields analyzed in this study similar to the uncalibrated validation at es 1 the values of rmse and mae calculated with the current version of the model v2012 8 at es 2 4 were about twice as high as ones using the improved version of the model table 3 rmse ranged from 0 155 to 0 299 cm whereas mae ranged from 0 096 to 0 183 cm average values of subsurface drainage depths tended to be overpredicted at sites es 3 and es 4 with pbias 88 4 and 20 respectively while at es 2 values were underpredicted with pbias 12 4 lastly poor behavior of the model was indicated by the negative nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values varying from 4 72 to 0 18 for sites es 3 4 these results contrasted with those obtained using the improved wepp model v2012 9 that increased the confidence in the model enhancements to predict daily estimates of drainage flow one can easily notice that for the uncalibrated conditions all sites es 1 4 were in the acceptable range of performance according to moriasi et al 2015 and skaggs et al 2012c which means the modifications performed in the wepp model allow suitable subsurface drainage estimation for the field conditions found at the study sites in the following section the saturated vertical and lateral hydraulic conductivity values of the soils at sites es 2 4 were adjusted manually to improve the model performance during the calibration period a validation period was then evaluated to observe the model behavior under the calibration parameters 3 3 drainage at calibrated validated sites es 2 4 simulated drainage amounts at the calibrated sites es 2 4 using the enhanced wepp model v2012 9 were expected to agree well with observations since the two soil input parameters k sv and k sl were adjusted although more parameters could be adjusted to reach an optimal agreement changing many input parameters can lead to non meaningful model reliability skaggs et al 2012c presented a list of possible soil and physical parameters that may be adjusted due to uncertainty found in field scale simulations here only hydraulic conductivities most sensitive soil parameters were adjusted to allow for assessment of the model potential for predicting drainage amounts under limited calibration table 3 shows the differences and model efficiencies between observed and predicted drainage amounts at the calibrated sites es 2 had the greatest errors among all sites with rmse and mae equal to 0 106 cm and 0 053 cm respectively es 3 and es 4 had similar error magnitudes rmse 0 071 cm and mae 0 035 cm although rmse is in the same drainage units it does not give either the relative size or the nature of the errors the updated wepp model applied to es 2 and es 4 tended to underestimate drainage amounts with pbias 39 3 and 32 4 respectively wepp applied in es 3 overpredicted drainage pbias 38 2 model efficiencies ranged from 0 52 to 0 71 for all sites table 3 even though these efficiencies might be improved by a more detailed calibration procedure values between 0 50 nse 1 00 are considered acceptable when predicting subsurface drainage amounts wang et al 2006 skaggs et al 2012c for all the fields es 3 4 the systematic errors mses ranged from 0 012 to 0 059 cm for calibrated conditions whereas for validation simulations the mses values ranged from 0 01 to 0 031 cm with overall values close to zero and small in comparison with the observed subsurface discharge this behavior indicates that the model exhibited an acceptable calibration procedure on the other hand random errors ranged from 0 051 to 0 063 cm and from 0 049 to 0 057 cm for the calibration and validation simulations respectively one can see that overall we obtained greater random errors than systematic errors however the former indicates that additional enhancements can be made to the structure of the model as random errors should approach the rmse willmott 1982 average values of calibrated k sv and k sl ranged from 0 325 to 1 366 cm h 1 and from 0 935 to 2 488 cm h 1 respectively clay loam soils at es 2 and es 4 showed similar magnitudes of both vertical and lateral hydraulic conductivities 1 342 and 1 892 cm h 1 respectively table 4 this behavior was expected since soils at those sites had similar physical and hydraulic properties table 1 k sv and k sl for es 3 were 0 325 and 0 979 cm h 1 respectively table 4 fig 6 shows substantial correlation between predicted and observed drainage amounts with coefficients of determination r 2 ranging from 0 69 to 0 73 wepp v2012 9 model predictions at the es 3 4 sites had the greatest correlation fig 6 also shows how model predictions at es 3 tended to overpredict drainage amounts whereas simulations at es 2 and es 4 showed the opposite behavior predicted daily drainage fluxes at es 2 4 for the calibration period 2016 2017 matched most of the peaks in the observed data fig 7 also most of the drainage occurred during the spring months march may when crops were not in the field or at initial growth stages and did not have any significant effect on drainage rates for the validation period at sites es 2 4 rmse and mae were similar in magnitude to the ones in the calibration period rmse average values were 0 10 cm and mae values were 0 47 cm the latter shows that the mean errors tended to be greater in the validation period percent bias in the same period showed improvement with respect to the calibration period being equal to 28 2 15 4 and 15 3 for es 2 es 3 and es 4 respectively while the modified wepp model v2012 9 was overpredicting daily drainage flux at es 3 for the calibration period estimates were underpredicted for the validation period nse values decreased during the validation period at sites es 3 and es 4 to 0 42 and 0 69 respectively however for site es 2 nse improved from 0 65 to 0 73 in summary the modified version of the wepp model showed an acceptable response to predict daily drainage depths under the conditions found at experimental sites es 2 4 for the validation period selected in this study 3 4 water balance at the experimental sites average infiltrated water contributing either to evapotranspiration or subsurface drainage at es 2 4 for the entire time period 2016 2018 corresponded to 78 99 and 92 of the annual precipitation respectively evapotranspiration amounts at the experimental sites es 2 4 accounted for approximately 53 78 and 71 of the annual precipitation respectively table 5 no seepage was calculated since we assumed that all infiltrated water not contributing to evapotranspiration was drained through the pipes es 3 had the greatest rates of infiltration and evapotranspiration the latter might have occurred due to the presence of a crop during the winter period which induced water infiltration and increased water demand by evapotranspiration the rates of evapotranspiration for es 2 4 were compared to the mean annual values for northwestern ohio and northeast indiana calculated in the sanford and selnick 2013 study the estimated mean annual ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation et p at sites es 2 4 were 0 61 0 75 0 70 respectively those et p values are comparable to a mean value equal to 0 65 found for the field locations in sanford and selnick 2013 accumulated monthly amounts of drainage for the experimental sites are shown in fig 8 similar to the daily amounts model simulations for es 2 and es 4 underpredicted monthly drainage amounts while simulations at es 3 overpredicted the drainage amounts for most months the improved version of the wepp model simulated 70 of the subsurface drainage at the sites accurately model simulations for es 2 4 showed fairly good agreement for drainage fluxes during the winter months for the first two years 2016 2017 fig 8 however drainage for the last year of the calibration period was not as accurately simulated this difference can be attributed to the fact that the assumption of drained to equilibrium which was used here to calculate drainage does not consider the effects of the freezing and thawing processes on water movement in soils additionally soils used in this study present zones with macropores and preferential flow where the assumption of no seepage may be not a suitable hypothesis this issue can be solved by incorporating the unfrozen water content curve derived from the soil freezing characteristic curve measured on site or approximated using air temperature as a reference luo et al 2000 annual observed and predicted drainage amounts are reported in table 6 wepp v2012 9 simulations at es 1 es 2 and es 4 predicted 67 of the observed total drained water for the entire simulated period model predictions at es 3 overestimated 20 subsurface flow about 70 of the annual drainage amount at es 1 was accurately predicted which indicates that the modified wepp model can provided acceptable annual estimates of subsurface drainage for similar soils and conditions among the models for subsurface drainage simulations for both field and watershed scales drainmod has been leading research at field scales for a comparison between the wepp model v2012 9 and drainmod v6 0 performances recent field studies using drainmod can be divided into two categories depending on the nature of the input soil properties 1 studies using experimental based inputs yang et al 2007 salazar et al 2009 nabi sichani and sepaskhah 2012 skaggs et al 2012c ale et al 2013 el hawary et al 2015 golmohammadi et al 2016 negm et al 2014 2016 2017 liang et al 2018 wilson et al 2019 and 2 studies using numerical based inputs singh et al 2006 2007 morrison et al 2014 qi et al 2015 the overall efficiency i e nse of the studies contained in the first category was 0 65 however about 50 of those studies were focused on monthly drainage estimates average nash sutcliffe efficiency for monthly drainage fluxes was 0 75 whereas for the daily drainage fluxes nse 0 60 the performance of the model in the second category provided an overall efficiency of 0 60 whereas nash sutcliffe efficiency values for the daily and monthly drainage studies were 0 72 and 0 40 respectively the nse values found in this study for daily and monthly drainage estimates were 0 63 and 0 70 respectively the improved wepp model v2012 9 thus showed a comparable efficiency for both monthly and daily drainage estimates among the studies found in the literature this indicates that the new version of the wepp model presented in this study may be a suitable tool for computing estimates of subsurface drainage without any increase in the amount of input data required in previous versions of the model 4 concluding remarks the field scale hydrologic models wepp v2012 8 and v2012 9 were tested to simulate the effect of artificial subsurface drainage on hydrology of four fields within the western lake erie basin u s initial testing of wepp showed that the current version v2012 8 did not accurately predict the daily amount of subsurface drainage modifications in the tile drainage percolation water balance and soil water distribution algorithms were made to the source code to improve the model drainage calculations calibration and validation of the improved version of the model v2012 9 in three agricultural fields showed that wepp could predict subsurface drainage amounts well with nse 0 6 on average 21 of the precipitation left the field through drain pipes at the sites studied here the monthly and annual amounts of water leaving through drains were also predicted well nse 0 70 the combined use of the enhanced wepp model and a suitable soil property estimation model rosetta showed that an acceptable amount of drainage could be estimated with limited field data additional future modifications can be performed to improve the wepp model estimates of subsurface drainage under shallow water tables during winter conditions the results of this study when implemented will increase confidence in the wepp model predictions for agricultural fields with installed drainage systems in the midwest u s further investigations using field data and modification of the model to controlled water table conditions are recommended to understand the impacts of shallow water tables on hydrology and crop production in fields with subsurface drainage systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

10358,irrigated agriculture in pakistan provides food and livelihood security for about 220 million people mostly living in punjab and sindh provinces this review paper explains the institutional arrangements for water supply and on farm water management along with their roles successful elements covering decades of efforts have also been studied the implications of less profitability of the farming business are also identified this paper articulates multiple investments for irrigation infrastructure expansion on farm water management and promotion of resource conservation technologies including public sector demonstration and research projects cost sharing subsidized schemes and technology introduction with associated training and learning approaches this draws a clear picture of present day agriculture and has helped in identifying cracks in the implementation of these practices that need mending for more definitive outcomes these efforts have resulted in considerable enhancements including increasing water availability cropped areas and cropping intensity promotion of resource conservation technologies and farm mechanization despite these attempts farming is no more a profitable business for the majority of farmers while water productivity remains the lowest in the region there is a constant decline of the share of agriculture sector and labor in gross domestic product of the country the divide between on farm water management and irrigation departments requires formulation of a new governance model keeping in view the past experiences to make farming a profitable business keywords irrigated agriculture on farm water management water availability less profitable cropping intensity watercourse improvement precision land level high efficiency irrigation 1 introduction punjab and sindh are the two major provinces of pakistan represent about 90 of canal irrigated cultivated land housing a large proportion of the national population 76 these two provinces are also home to most of the rural population and 77 of the nation s agricultural workforce pbs 2017 the agricultural land of these provinces provides coverage for major crops including cotton 98 5 sugarcane 90 wheat 78 and rice 65 7 mnfsr 2019 all these major crops represent 80 of water consumed in agriculture and generate less than five percent of gdp young et al 2019 during 2018 19 low reported annual progress of agriculture sector 0 38 against the target of 3 8 was attributed to low water availability resulting in reduction of cultivated area under major crops this hampered growth also negatively impacted related economic activities such as employability and industries dependent upon agricultural produce gop 2019a canal irrigation supplies have remained fixed over two main cropping seasons 1 1 there are two cropping seasons in pakistan kharif and rabi kharif season starts from june to october whereas rabi season starts from october november and continues till april may types of crop grown and time of cropping vary according to the geography of the country pakistan receives most of its inflows in rivers and rainfall during monsoon month synchronized with earlier kharif months however rabi season mostly remains dry rabi winter season and kharif summer season besides pakistan has one of the most extended irrigation systems in the world having three major reservoirs 16 barrages two headworks 12 inter river link canals and 44 canal commands out of these 23 canal commands lie in punjab and 14 in sindh province young et al 2019 the distribution network consists of 4000 distributaries and total of 107 000 watercourses out of which about 47 000 lies in sindh and 59 000 in punjab province gop 2018a gos 2018 annually 165 billion cubic meter bm3 of water is regulated through this surface water regulation and distribution system to all four provinces of the country whereas punjab and sindh provinces receive majority of the share this irrigation system commands a total cultivated area of 16 85 million hectare mha perennial irrigation supply is only available to half of this command area sarwar 2011 the remainder of the cultivable land either receives canal water during the kharif season or through groundwater extraction sarwar 2011 the growing water demand is fulfilled from groundwater abstraction watoo and mugera 2016 by virtue of 1 3 million tube wells 55 of cultivated area in punjab is under supplementary irrigation and 21 is entirely reliant upon groundwater whereas groundwater irrigates only 20 of the irrigated area in sindh and rest of the cultivated area is being serviced by surface drains and canal irrigation system young et al 2019 water resources availability and management are governed by complex institutional setup after the 18th amendment to the constitution water is a legally provincial subject but still some national institutions and policies coexist prevail and overlap with provincial systems and polices young et al 2019 the development of large dams and the apportionment of the canal water share is a responsibility of the federal government provincial irrigation departments pids are responsible for regulating canal water supplies whereas watercourses and other on farm water management fall in the preview of the provincial agricultural departments azad 2003 overall irrigation efficiency from canal head to root zone is only 40 mostly due to poor maintenance of irrigation infrastructure sarwar 2011 the irrigation system is supply driven not demand driven the operation is entirely manual very unsophisticated and the on farm distribution is still unlined and leaky despite several investments young et al 2019 the water use efficiency is also quite low e g it is 0 45 kg of rice per cubic meter of irrigation water used against the world average of 0 71 kg m3 and at a few places it is as low as 0 08 kg m3 soomro et al 2015 poor irrigation practices and secondary salinization are also key factors behind low water productivity sarwar 2011 gaining more yield and value from less amount of water have the potential to reduce future water demands limiting environmental degradation and easing the competition for water laghari et al 2012 this paper has reviewed water supply and management system including institutional arrangements for water supply and on farm water management it has also documented successful elements of initiatives intended for water resources availability and management during past several decades almost all of these projects were implemented through a top down approach and on large farmers land assuming that it will have trickle down effects on small farmers the present agricultural extension system involves extension work through extension field schools efs following the same approach mazher et al 2009 muhammad et al 2014 moreover the extension agents are neither equipped nor have the desired knowledge of irrigation water management heaney mustafa et al 2018 also elucidated the limited knowledge of irrigation among extension agents for instance agricultural extension and ofwm are at crossroads on zero tillage technology ahmad et al 2014 this rivalry between ofwm and agricultural extension is a misfortune for technology and farmers in punjab farooq et al 2007 high investment cost risks associated with operation lack of knowledge about the system and most suitable crops for it are barriers in the way of adoption of drip irrigation systems bell et al 2017 poor system of formal credit is also to be blamed small farmers who have less than three hectares of land represent 80 farming community and own 31 cultivated land mnfsr 2019 this segment of farmers is reliant upon informal system of credit comprises shop keepers and village middleman therefore a large majority of farmers remained trapped in poverty net lack or misuse of technology and poor agricultural productivity rehman et al 2017 in this review most elements of agriculture and water management system are discussed highlighting the issues contributing to overall lower efficiency productivity and economic contribution by the irrigated agriculture of pakistan 2 research questions this review is focused on the following research questions i what is the structure of institutional setup for the management of irrigated agriculture from canal head to farmers field ii what are the significant features and outcomes of investments made to improve the functions of these institutions iii what are the success factors and failures directed to improve irrigated agriculture as a result of implementation of these projects iv what are the future challenges and way forward for improved and productive irrigated agriculture 3 materials and methods 3 1 literature search this paper involves a review of all measures taken to improve water productivity of irrigated agriculture focusing two major provinces punjab and sindh review also included an overview of institutional and governance structure of existing water management in review criteria institutional information was collected directly from official websites of the provincial agriculture and irrigation departments publicly available information regarding all of the investment projects executed by these organizations were collected these set of information were in the form of project document end of the project evaluation reports institutional evaluation reports technical reports by third party organizations and research publications relevant to these projects data on national statistics was collected from various institutions of government of pakistan the selection criteria for review of material was follows publicly available information on the official websites of relevant department technical papers and reports by members of expert groups famous for their research work on irrigated agriculture of pakistan project evaluation reports released by third party consultants acquired by project funding agency research papers with synchronized key words such as water management zero tillage operation technology adoption in agriculture water conservation technologies on farm water management research papers outside of the subject with key word rural urbanization the key limitation was the availability of research literature on projects executed to improve on farm water management third party evaluation reports of certain projects were available for punjab province only whereas few were found for sindh province research project reports and technical papers provide technical discussion on causes of failure in high efficiency irrigation technologies the reports of pilot projects and development projects lacks such quality analysis and findings therefore most of the project impacts could not be ascertain due to this limited availability of technical literature 3 2 analysis the analysis of this review was challenging to an extent that most of the literature information and data were publicly available in the form of project reports the source of information and available grey literature were checked for the authenticity of source before using it the first research question was addressed by the information provided on the websites of provincial government and their relevant departments answers to questions two and three were addressed by identifying the theme of each investment project these themes included a infrastructural development projects for improving supply of irrigation water b public sector demonstration and research projects to improve irrigation application efficiency c cost sharing subsidized schemes for improving irrigation efficiency d demonstrative research projects for improving water productivity and d technology introduction with learning methods all of these thematic projects are listed with their significant features along with their best impacts the last question is addressed in discussion section by highlighting challenges and dependence of national economy on irrigated agriculture 4 institutional arrangements 4 1 water supply irrigation department government of punjab has a vast portfolio however regarding the supply of irrigation water this department holds the responsibility of regulating surface and groundwater across the province this legislative framework includes a different set of rules acts and policies with institutional set up pid 2017 other notable acts of punjab irrigation department are punjab water act 2019 punjab soil reclamation act 1952 and on farm water management and water user association ordinance 1981 likewise sindh irrigation department holds the functions of regulating canal water to farmgate as well as managing groundwater for supplementary irrigation sid 2020 water distribution dispute resolution revenue collection pertaining to canal water supply is governed by sindh irrigation act 1879 revised in 1996 the assessment of abiana water tax is made through the divisional canal officer from each canal command through a revenue clerk patwari once the assessment of crop coverage in each canal command is done revenue department directs revenue clerk for abiana collection tahir and habib 2000 in order to achieve economical and effective operation of canal system punjab irrigation and drainage authority was established gop 1997 similarly sindh irrigation and drainage authority sida was established in 1998 along with the governance framework of area water boards awbs and 1200 farmer organizations fos for the 14 canal commands of sindh province azad 2003 water scheduling in canals is inappropriate particularly in kharif season the canal and watercourses run at full supply when farmers do not need water under pricing of water and system inefficiencies offer no incentive to farmers for water conservation at farm level azad 2003 fig 1 illustrates the conceptual layout of a typical irrigation water supply institutional framework 4 2 on farm water management ofwm canal irrigation supply system is 76 efficient whereas the watercourse system efficiency in both punjab and sindh provinces is 52 and 54 respectively yu et al 2013 improving water productivity in agriculture requires improvement in infrastructure and better management practices davies et al 2017 improving watercourses better land management practices capacity building of water user s associations wuas are the responsibilities of provincial agricultural departments gos 2017 gop 2018a punjab agriculture department has decentralized institutions responsible for improving water productivity this department also performs research for the development of low cost farm machinery at the agricultural mechanization research institute amri gop 2018a other services of field wing of the directorate of agriculture are water resources development and soil conservation activities such as land levelling gop 2018b in addition the on farm water management department executes specialized projects and activities targeted to improve water productivity at farm level these institutes perform their mandated activities through their research facilities established across the province and district level field staff similarly the agriculture department of sindh government executes on farm water management activities including registration and capacity building of wua s through agricultural engineering and water management wing ae wm gos 2017 as the name indicates this department undertakes the responsibilities equal to the combined activities of ofwm and field wing of punjab directorate of agriculture this department has district level outreach through its research directorates and officers placed at different locations across sindh province a framework of the water management system is also illustrated in fig 1 4 3 analysis overlap of institutions their activities and bureaucratic system of administration is one of the major reasons behind the low of effectiveness of pida s young et al 2019 theoretically there is a direct linkage between canal supply authorities and on farm water management however administratively both institutions are inert the only synchronizing point between ofwm and pidas is wua s which by definition are responsible for the operation and maintenance of watercourses qureshi and haque 2006 ofwm punjab registers wua s under the on farm water management and water user association ordinance 1981 amended in 2001 in pida s system despite the establishment of farmer organizations fo s at distributary level equitable canal water supplies were available only to members of fo s young et al 2019 this multi tier institutional setup which was meant for improving supply and equity has compromised its transparency this is regarded as the inherent default in extensive irrigation systems by levine 1977 such supply based systems are inefficient because they are designed based on the per acre water requirement while ignoring human factor who have to manage these systems levine 1977 according to the provision in act of pida s such issue is to be resolved by the involvement of consumers and beneficiaries of canal supplies therefore it is essential to involve wuas comprising farmers for participatory development and management of watercourses as most of the conveyance losses occur in watercourses this will be actualized by diffusing the roles and functions of provincial irrigation departments into pidas and ofwm departments 5 successful elements of initiatives intended for water resource availability and management 5 1 infrastructural improvement for water resource availability agriculture is the largest consumer of fresh water and it will continue to remain the biggest user of water given the food security need of pakistan gop 2018a gop 2018b gop 2018c total water withdrawals are 180 bm3 out of which 69 99 bm3 is consumed by irrigation while the rest being lost to the system and consumption in other sectors this scenario of low efficiency is reducing water availability for lower riparian laghari et al 2012 since the 1970 s pakistan has initiated considerable projects for developing irrigation structure through international development assistance ida credit and from its public sector financing table 1 these investments expanded the irrigation system and increased cropping intensity of the indus basin briscoe et al 2005 the introduction of the salinity control reclamation project scarp tube well for the drainage of ibis helped in the lowering of the water table as a result a vast increase in private tubewells occurred and increased the dependence of farmers on groundwater to cultivate their land davies et al 2017 the scarp project with us 2 billion investment successfully reclaimed 6 mha of salt affected area young et al 2019 which brought additional land under cultivation since the 1980s several on farm water management projects have been introduced in addition to irrigation and drainage system expansion consequently 42 of watercourses in punjab province and 16 in sindh were improved before 2003 04 through ida credit fig 2 in the year 2004 05 the national program for the improvement of watercourses npiw was launched covering 31 additional watercourses for improvement in punjab and 42 in sindh province at that time sindh on farm water management program sofwm through ida credit was also being executed in sindh the specialty of npiw was that it was solely executed by the public sector financing of federal and provincial governments since 2012 pipip and siapep were launched through world bank financing in punjab and sindh provinces respectively improvement of watercourses was one of the critical components in all of these projects the positive impact is an improvement of two third watercourses in punjab and more than half in sindh province in an earlier national on farm water management project in 1980 reported increased cropping intensity in sindh province from 102 to 120 since 1977 usaid 1982 all of these infrastructural expansions brought about progressive changes in irrigated agriculture fig 3 since last four decades coverage of major crops has been increased in both sindh and punjab provinces improvement of watercourses is reported to have reduced conveyance losses by 39 and expanded the irrigated area by 21 gop 2019a gop 2019b the sofwm project reported 17 increased cropping intensity in the command area of improved watercourses the world bank 2015 freshwater availability due to improved irrigation infrastructure has also played a role in increasing crop yield and cropping intensity fig 4 despite that crop productivity of major crops in ibis is still low due to wasteful surface irrigation methods and freshwater applications through flood irrigation laghari et al 2012 initially these infrastructural improvements increased the coverage of irrigated land however canal water supplies remained fixed over the years but cropping intensity continues to grow at the expense of groundwater in year 1960 agricultural reliance on groundwater was only 8 watto and mugera 2016 qureshi et al 2010 reported the groundwater use in agriculture by 50 in addition to canal supplies this situation shows that crop choices were made out of their cash values but irrigation methods remained unchanged popular irrigation methods waste 50 60 of applied irrigation water therefore water efficient irrigation technologies are required to improve agricultural productivity by preserving water resources rizwan et al 2018 in response to water challenges certain resource conservation technologies are being promoted these include direct seeded rice zero tillage drill of wheat bed planting of rice and wheat laser land leveling and crop residue retention ahmad et al 2014 specific irrigation techniques drip and sprinkler irrigation that can deliver water at appropriate timing and quantification according to different crop growth stages have significant potential for increasing water productivity laghari et al 2012 5 2 promotion of resource conservation technologies and availability through mechanization numerous efforts have aimed at shifting farmers towards improved land management practices for higher water productivity these interventions are either piloted and promoted through a demonstration on farmers field or handed over to farmers on a cost sharing basis ofwm department government of punjab has highlighted a list of such accomplishments on its website gop 2018a in absence of the latest available statistics of farm machinery it is difficult to ascertain the farm mechanization literacy of the farming community in pakistan however a comparison of the progress of two consecutive decades fig 5 showed a rapid pace of progress in developing a private pool of farm machinery by farmers a comparison of 1984 94 and 1994 2004 recorded higher progress in the development of private tube wells tractors cultivators and trolleys record of the observation period indicates a slower transformation from bullock to tractors and bull cart to trolleys the development of the procurement of other types of ploughs was also dependent upon farmers who own tractors this distribution continued to remain the same because only 20 of small landholders less than 3 ha own tractors the percentage ownership of other equipment such as a seed drill becomes even smaller privately owned laser land level equipment is about 2 300 in punjab and sindh provinces mnfsr 2019 independent of landholdings however the use of rented machinery from the provincial government s pool and other farmers cannot be ruled out for instance out of 26 of farms that reported the use of simple seed drill about 88 use the rented tools mnfsr 2019 the reported use of machinery by farmers indicates that knowledge and awareness about the machinery play a key role in convincing them to use it imran et al 2018 the successful role of several research and demonstration projects that helped farmers in gaining such knowledge is detailed below 5 2 1 public sector demonstration and research projects government of pakistan has also executed national programs for the improvement of water productivity with particular focus on punjab and sindh provinces such as national program for improvement of watercourse npiw national project to stimulate the adaptation of permanent raised beds in maize wheat and cotton wheat farming system in pakistan gop 2010 and water conservation and productivity enhancement through high efficiency pressurized irrigation system gop 2018a during four years of experimentation 1998 2002 ofwm punjab established 88 demonstration plots covering an area of 460 ha for bed and furrow irrigation in cotton crop this demonstrative research reported that bed and furrow cropping in cotton saves up to 60 of irrigation water gill et al 2005 a three year research by ofwm in the rice wheat crop system reported 40 50 saving in irrigation water on permanent raised beds meisner et al 2005 in sindh province through sindh on farm water management project sofwm precision land leveling of about 32 000 ha of farmers land was completed the world bank 2015 it is difficult to ascertain the benefits incurred to farmers as a result of this project only available report on the impact assessment of this project was by the world bank which states that there was no assessment available to this particular component by sofwm 5 2 2 cost sharing subsidized schemes sofwm project initiated 90 10 government and farmer cost sharing for precision land levelling due to a lack of payment by the beneficiaries this component of sofwm was converted to a fully funded project the world bank 2015 sindh government has also initiated a new project on cost sharing basis known as the sindh irrigated agriculture productivity enhancement project siapep through world bank assistance this project offers a range of water conservation techniques on various cost modalities except for improvement of community watercourses distribution of high efficiency irrigation systems and precision land levelling equipment was done on government to farmers cost sharing basis 60 40 and 55 45 respectively siapep org 2018 the duration of this project is 2016 2021 therefore its impacts are yet to be determined however the sofwm project has been rated moderately satisfactory by the world bank so far unlike sindh province many cost sharing subsidized schemes for improving water productivity are offered by the punjab government through its own resources an overview and cost sharing scenario of these schemes is provided in table 2 punjab irrigation productivity improvement project pipip offered a package of technologies to farmers on subsidized rates implementation methodologies of both siapep and pipip include the invitation of applications from organizing wuas for watercourse improvement the acquisition of cost and in kind contribution from farmers the design and implementation of the activity gop 2018a siapep org 2018 the impact analysis studies of laser land levelling under the pipip program have revealed that in a laser levelled field as per farmer s method about 30 of water saving for wheat and maize crops have reported a good impact on crop yield mmp 2019 introduction of high efficiency irrigation system heis has reported an increase in 13 income benefits for row crops and 100 benefits in the case of vegetable cultivation the concept of heis irrigation schemes is also introduced in this project bringing the non canal command area under cultivation mmp 2016 these schemes are supported with high efficiency irrigation system sourced by solar powered pumping 5 2 3 demonstrative research projects public sector research projects adopted demonstration methodology for the promotion of water conservation techniques to farmers the sofwm project has demonstrated off season vegetable tunnels on 30 sites this technique has brought sound benefits to the beneficiary farmers the world bank 2015 pipip also demonstrated the concept of irrigation schemes and vegetable farming in tunnels on cost sharing basis mmp 2016 apart from public institutions international development organizations and national research institutions have also demonstrated water smart interventions such demonstration sites are either developed on farmer fields or demonstrated to farmers through farmer field days majeed et al 2017 over 150 farmers days field days were organized on these demonstration sites and trainings of over 13 000 farmers took place same methodology was adopted in watershed rehabilitation and irrigation improvement in pakistan executed by icarda more than 2 000 professionals from agriculture extension department on farm water management soil conservation and agriculture service providers participated in 122 professional on the job training sessions fatima and ashraf 2016 the technology package included design of solar powered high efficiency irrigation system heis farm level rainwater harvesting and cultivation of crops on beds ridges pakistan council of research in water resources pcrwr has also demonstrated rice cultivation on beds on its research and demonstration farm the technique reported demonstrating a 37 more water use efficiency in comparison to conventional flood irrigation soomro et al 2015 demonstrative research of water conservation technologies precision land levelling pll bed planting watercourse improvement and high efficiency irrigation system was also undertaken as a component of lower chenab canal lcc rehabilitation project 2008 15 this project was undertaken by water resources research centre university of agriculture faisalabad under this project demonstration of the aforementioned technologies was done free of cost on farmers fields located in the lcc command area the number of interventions was pll 2631 ha six watercourses improved 4 496 m in each distributary and hies established on 2 ha in each distributary rizwan et al 2018 this research has shown an increase in conveyance efficiency by watercourse improvement 22 water saving by pll whereas 30 50 water saving through rice wheat sowing on a raised bed ahmad et al 2014 conducted research on adaptation potential of resource conservation technologies direct seed drill and laser land level in rice wheat crop system of pakistan this research reported a higher adaptation of zero tillage drill and laser land level in sindh province compared to punjab province as they prevent deep percolation of irrigation water controlling the waterlogging problem 5 2 4 technology introduction with training and learning approaches in sindh province a total of 123 farmer field schools ffs in six districts were developed under integrated pest management ipm component of the sofwm project the world bank 2015 under the pipip project ofwm punjab provides mandatory training to beneficiary farmers for performing laser land levelling gop 2018a international centre for agricultural research in dry areas icarda through its research project during 2013 17 adopted a different approach that involved training of agricultural service provider asps the project provided asps training for designing installation and maintenance of water conservation technologies these trained asps were to provide support to local farmers in their respective areas majeed et al 2017 6 discussion the above review of various project reports literature and research material shows that a lot of efforts and investments are made to increase freshwater availability of irrigated agriculture these efforts have shaped present day ibis its governance infrastructure and ofwm in both punjab and sindh provinces these projects achieved their intended targets such as number of watercourses to be lined increase in farm mechanization and increased number of tubewells as a result about 107 000 watercourses present in sindh and punjab province will be lined by the end of sipep and pipip projects in sindh and punjab province number of tubewells has also grown from 30 000 in 1960 to over a million watoo and mugera 2016 this increase in water availability has also increased coverage of irrigated land but the low application efficiency has brought more unsustainable impact on water resources of pakistan despite these efforts the water use efficiency of crops and irrigation profitability in pakistan is amongst the lowest in the world soomro et al 2015 and laghari et al 2012 from institutional analysis it appears that there is a complete disconnect between organizations working on supply demand and implementation aspects emerging as a considerable governance challenge the focus of irrigation departments is just to supply water without catering to the demand of the user there is an ample quantity of water when there is no requirement of irrigation thus a supply based system is developed forcing the farmers to apply water even if the crops do not need it resultantly there is an overuse of water and farmers labelled as overusers parc 2018 the other side of this artificial investment and progress may be the poor working model imposed by the financial institutions in 1970 the establishment of parallel working ofwm directorates in each province reported as having caused resistance by the existing extension system usaid 1982 consequently there is difference of opinion between ofwm and agricultural extension departments since the beginning therefore a mixed message is being conveyed on farmer scale farooq et al 2007 the review of donor funded project evaluation reports reveal that projects are designed on perceptions and implemented on target approach lack of research based impact evaluation has left no concrete evidence regarding lessons learnt in earlier irrigation efficiency improvement projects an example of such useful reports is the impact assessment research on drip system beneficiary farmers of pipip project which reveal beneficiary aspects of project implementation such as farmers value subsidized drip irrigation system and they aspire for extensive and high value cropping using these drip systems however the adoption and benefits of drip irrigation subside with lack of knowledge on drip irrigation among the consumers dai et al 2015 same is the case with zero tillage and precision laser land leveling technologies reported by ahmad et al 2014 generally there is a need to run knowledge campaigns about operations and use of drip irrigation system to increase its adoption by the farmers bell et al 2017 the knowledge of resource conservation and climate smart technologies is also regarded as highly important by imran et al 2018 for their adoption and use the green revolution has resulted in increase of crop coverage in pakistan after 1960 s expansion of irrigation infrastructure supply of improved quality seeds fertilizers and pesticides were made to improve coverage of main crops dorosh et al 2003 many studies have reported shortage of water or water stress a principal reason behind low yield of major crops however there are many other factors contributing to low water productivity for instance cotton crop yield is sufficiently reduced due to infestation of insects rehman et al 2015 and cost of production is increasing due to expensive chemical control of pest integrated pest management ipm program was launched in sindh province to reduce environmental footprints of cotton production in pesticide attribute the impact assessment report of project states that ipm component moderately achieved highlights the target oriented implementation of potentially useful projects in case of maize crop availability of water has remained a critical aspect for cultivation of this cash crop rehman et al 2015 the availability of hybrid seed of maize crops has increased its crop coverage owning to its demand in poultry and livestock industry likewise yield of wheat and rice crops and their water productivity may be improved by choosing better yielding varieties young et al 2019 it is also pertinent to note here that all reasonable efforts and even the successful elements of on farm water management initiatives may have gone nowhere this results from the constant shrinkage of the share of agricultural input to the pakistan s gross domestic product gdp as a whole and particularly the share of the major crops fig 6 even a higher annual growth of agriculture sector of 3 9 has less effect in overall agricultural share to gdp main reason of this situation is that rural population generating their return from agricultural land are only 40 of rural community dorosh et al 2003 with increase of non farm rural poor population even a high agricultural income has cumulative low contribution into national economy there are two possible solutions to increase agricultural share in gdp firstly to increase value addition in agriculture at rural scale involving non farm rural poor into agriculture related activity secondly strict land reforms may be imposed on large land holdings which covers 52 of cultivated land and only being utilized 60 the absorption of the workforce has also reduced from 50 to 38 from 1970 to 2019 gop 2019 gop 2019 gop 2000 this shrinking trend points towards less profitable operations in the production of major crops and shift of agricultural workforce and farmers to other employment sectors one of the consequences is that agricultural land has been converted into housing societies mughal 2019 also pointed out the occurrence of rural urbanization in punjab mainly due to achieving high socioeconomic status and subsequent involvement in a variety of jobs other than agriculture similarly peerzado et al 2019 explained the phenomenon of agricultural land conversion into urbanization in search of better necessities rajpar et al 2019 also indicated an increase in abandoning agriculture activities in favor of non agricultural activities especially revenue generation activities 7 conclusion irrigated agriculture in pakistan mostly represents land and water resources of punjab and sindh provinces indus basin river system sources pakistan s irrigation system its longevity though not free of losses also contributes to the groundwater balance of the country multiple investments have contributed progressively to its extent and water availability in its command area as a combined blessing of tube well technology and improved irrigation system cropped area and the cropping intensity have enhanced remarkably it is also true that enormous efforts have contributed in better on farm water management through farm mechanization water conservation and heis these interventions have also impacted in the area of water savings on one hand as reported by many researchers and discussed in earlier sections on the other hand the introduction of new line of institutions pida s and ofwm created a destructive competition in case of pida s and provincial irrigation departments this has resulted into inequity in distribution subversion in water governance and revenue collection in case of agriculture extension and ofwm rigorous and perception based conception of target oriented projects mostly through loans from international financial institutions these projects have some demonstrated success however those could not expand as were perceived this occurred due to multiple reasons most of the initial projects were focused on large or progressive farmers lack of knowledge support to farmers for sustainable operations and lack of information dissemination to farmers regarding economic benefits of these system lastly technical complexities and high cost of low quality technologies worsened the situation and confined farmers to inefficient agricultural practices the subsidized schemes however provided a relief to farmers for being more focused on small farmers and offering credit to purchase high efficiency irrigation system limited efforts on educating farmers and building their knowledge about these water saving techniques are the achilles heel of these interventions this complete set of problems requires a paradigm shift in our way of looking into things related to irrigation water management and improving the efficiency of irrigated agriculture massive awareness campaign needs to be initiated to educate farmers regarding the use of efficient irrigation techniques new adult learning approaches have to be tested with strong involvement of the farming community ofwm and agriculture extension needs to upscale themselves according to farmer s needs a complete overhauling is required for extension agents with higher coordination between ofwm and agricultural extension in the field as well as on leadership level a new governance model has to be devised keeping in view the lessons learned from these successful elements and lessons learnt to make farming a profitable business land reforms needs to be introduced as well as rural value chain for agriculture at village scale needs to be established declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper the authors declare that they have no conﬂict of interest acknowledgment this work has been done under a project lwr 074 2014 developing approaching to enhance farmer water management skills in punjab sindh and balochistan funded by australian centre for international agricultural research 
10358,irrigated agriculture in pakistan provides food and livelihood security for about 220 million people mostly living in punjab and sindh provinces this review paper explains the institutional arrangements for water supply and on farm water management along with their roles successful elements covering decades of efforts have also been studied the implications of less profitability of the farming business are also identified this paper articulates multiple investments for irrigation infrastructure expansion on farm water management and promotion of resource conservation technologies including public sector demonstration and research projects cost sharing subsidized schemes and technology introduction with associated training and learning approaches this draws a clear picture of present day agriculture and has helped in identifying cracks in the implementation of these practices that need mending for more definitive outcomes these efforts have resulted in considerable enhancements including increasing water availability cropped areas and cropping intensity promotion of resource conservation technologies and farm mechanization despite these attempts farming is no more a profitable business for the majority of farmers while water productivity remains the lowest in the region there is a constant decline of the share of agriculture sector and labor in gross domestic product of the country the divide between on farm water management and irrigation departments requires formulation of a new governance model keeping in view the past experiences to make farming a profitable business keywords irrigated agriculture on farm water management water availability less profitable cropping intensity watercourse improvement precision land level high efficiency irrigation 1 introduction punjab and sindh are the two major provinces of pakistan represent about 90 of canal irrigated cultivated land housing a large proportion of the national population 76 these two provinces are also home to most of the rural population and 77 of the nation s agricultural workforce pbs 2017 the agricultural land of these provinces provides coverage for major crops including cotton 98 5 sugarcane 90 wheat 78 and rice 65 7 mnfsr 2019 all these major crops represent 80 of water consumed in agriculture and generate less than five percent of gdp young et al 2019 during 2018 19 low reported annual progress of agriculture sector 0 38 against the target of 3 8 was attributed to low water availability resulting in reduction of cultivated area under major crops this hampered growth also negatively impacted related economic activities such as employability and industries dependent upon agricultural produce gop 2019a canal irrigation supplies have remained fixed over two main cropping seasons 1 1 there are two cropping seasons in pakistan kharif and rabi kharif season starts from june to october whereas rabi season starts from october november and continues till april may types of crop grown and time of cropping vary according to the geography of the country pakistan receives most of its inflows in rivers and rainfall during monsoon month synchronized with earlier kharif months however rabi season mostly remains dry rabi winter season and kharif summer season besides pakistan has one of the most extended irrigation systems in the world having three major reservoirs 16 barrages two headworks 12 inter river link canals and 44 canal commands out of these 23 canal commands lie in punjab and 14 in sindh province young et al 2019 the distribution network consists of 4000 distributaries and total of 107 000 watercourses out of which about 47 000 lies in sindh and 59 000 in punjab province gop 2018a gos 2018 annually 165 billion cubic meter bm3 of water is regulated through this surface water regulation and distribution system to all four provinces of the country whereas punjab and sindh provinces receive majority of the share this irrigation system commands a total cultivated area of 16 85 million hectare mha perennial irrigation supply is only available to half of this command area sarwar 2011 the remainder of the cultivable land either receives canal water during the kharif season or through groundwater extraction sarwar 2011 the growing water demand is fulfilled from groundwater abstraction watoo and mugera 2016 by virtue of 1 3 million tube wells 55 of cultivated area in punjab is under supplementary irrigation and 21 is entirely reliant upon groundwater whereas groundwater irrigates only 20 of the irrigated area in sindh and rest of the cultivated area is being serviced by surface drains and canal irrigation system young et al 2019 water resources availability and management are governed by complex institutional setup after the 18th amendment to the constitution water is a legally provincial subject but still some national institutions and policies coexist prevail and overlap with provincial systems and polices young et al 2019 the development of large dams and the apportionment of the canal water share is a responsibility of the federal government provincial irrigation departments pids are responsible for regulating canal water supplies whereas watercourses and other on farm water management fall in the preview of the provincial agricultural departments azad 2003 overall irrigation efficiency from canal head to root zone is only 40 mostly due to poor maintenance of irrigation infrastructure sarwar 2011 the irrigation system is supply driven not demand driven the operation is entirely manual very unsophisticated and the on farm distribution is still unlined and leaky despite several investments young et al 2019 the water use efficiency is also quite low e g it is 0 45 kg of rice per cubic meter of irrigation water used against the world average of 0 71 kg m3 and at a few places it is as low as 0 08 kg m3 soomro et al 2015 poor irrigation practices and secondary salinization are also key factors behind low water productivity sarwar 2011 gaining more yield and value from less amount of water have the potential to reduce future water demands limiting environmental degradation and easing the competition for water laghari et al 2012 this paper has reviewed water supply and management system including institutional arrangements for water supply and on farm water management it has also documented successful elements of initiatives intended for water resources availability and management during past several decades almost all of these projects were implemented through a top down approach and on large farmers land assuming that it will have trickle down effects on small farmers the present agricultural extension system involves extension work through extension field schools efs following the same approach mazher et al 2009 muhammad et al 2014 moreover the extension agents are neither equipped nor have the desired knowledge of irrigation water management heaney mustafa et al 2018 also elucidated the limited knowledge of irrigation among extension agents for instance agricultural extension and ofwm are at crossroads on zero tillage technology ahmad et al 2014 this rivalry between ofwm and agricultural extension is a misfortune for technology and farmers in punjab farooq et al 2007 high investment cost risks associated with operation lack of knowledge about the system and most suitable crops for it are barriers in the way of adoption of drip irrigation systems bell et al 2017 poor system of formal credit is also to be blamed small farmers who have less than three hectares of land represent 80 farming community and own 31 cultivated land mnfsr 2019 this segment of farmers is reliant upon informal system of credit comprises shop keepers and village middleman therefore a large majority of farmers remained trapped in poverty net lack or misuse of technology and poor agricultural productivity rehman et al 2017 in this review most elements of agriculture and water management system are discussed highlighting the issues contributing to overall lower efficiency productivity and economic contribution by the irrigated agriculture of pakistan 2 research questions this review is focused on the following research questions i what is the structure of institutional setup for the management of irrigated agriculture from canal head to farmers field ii what are the significant features and outcomes of investments made to improve the functions of these institutions iii what are the success factors and failures directed to improve irrigated agriculture as a result of implementation of these projects iv what are the future challenges and way forward for improved and productive irrigated agriculture 3 materials and methods 3 1 literature search this paper involves a review of all measures taken to improve water productivity of irrigated agriculture focusing two major provinces punjab and sindh review also included an overview of institutional and governance structure of existing water management in review criteria institutional information was collected directly from official websites of the provincial agriculture and irrigation departments publicly available information regarding all of the investment projects executed by these organizations were collected these set of information were in the form of project document end of the project evaluation reports institutional evaluation reports technical reports by third party organizations and research publications relevant to these projects data on national statistics was collected from various institutions of government of pakistan the selection criteria for review of material was follows publicly available information on the official websites of relevant department technical papers and reports by members of expert groups famous for their research work on irrigated agriculture of pakistan project evaluation reports released by third party consultants acquired by project funding agency research papers with synchronized key words such as water management zero tillage operation technology adoption in agriculture water conservation technologies on farm water management research papers outside of the subject with key word rural urbanization the key limitation was the availability of research literature on projects executed to improve on farm water management third party evaluation reports of certain projects were available for punjab province only whereas few were found for sindh province research project reports and technical papers provide technical discussion on causes of failure in high efficiency irrigation technologies the reports of pilot projects and development projects lacks such quality analysis and findings therefore most of the project impacts could not be ascertain due to this limited availability of technical literature 3 2 analysis the analysis of this review was challenging to an extent that most of the literature information and data were publicly available in the form of project reports the source of information and available grey literature were checked for the authenticity of source before using it the first research question was addressed by the information provided on the websites of provincial government and their relevant departments answers to questions two and three were addressed by identifying the theme of each investment project these themes included a infrastructural development projects for improving supply of irrigation water b public sector demonstration and research projects to improve irrigation application efficiency c cost sharing subsidized schemes for improving irrigation efficiency d demonstrative research projects for improving water productivity and d technology introduction with learning methods all of these thematic projects are listed with their significant features along with their best impacts the last question is addressed in discussion section by highlighting challenges and dependence of national economy on irrigated agriculture 4 institutional arrangements 4 1 water supply irrigation department government of punjab has a vast portfolio however regarding the supply of irrigation water this department holds the responsibility of regulating surface and groundwater across the province this legislative framework includes a different set of rules acts and policies with institutional set up pid 2017 other notable acts of punjab irrigation department are punjab water act 2019 punjab soil reclamation act 1952 and on farm water management and water user association ordinance 1981 likewise sindh irrigation department holds the functions of regulating canal water to farmgate as well as managing groundwater for supplementary irrigation sid 2020 water distribution dispute resolution revenue collection pertaining to canal water supply is governed by sindh irrigation act 1879 revised in 1996 the assessment of abiana water tax is made through the divisional canal officer from each canal command through a revenue clerk patwari once the assessment of crop coverage in each canal command is done revenue department directs revenue clerk for abiana collection tahir and habib 2000 in order to achieve economical and effective operation of canal system punjab irrigation and drainage authority was established gop 1997 similarly sindh irrigation and drainage authority sida was established in 1998 along with the governance framework of area water boards awbs and 1200 farmer organizations fos for the 14 canal commands of sindh province azad 2003 water scheduling in canals is inappropriate particularly in kharif season the canal and watercourses run at full supply when farmers do not need water under pricing of water and system inefficiencies offer no incentive to farmers for water conservation at farm level azad 2003 fig 1 illustrates the conceptual layout of a typical irrigation water supply institutional framework 4 2 on farm water management ofwm canal irrigation supply system is 76 efficient whereas the watercourse system efficiency in both punjab and sindh provinces is 52 and 54 respectively yu et al 2013 improving water productivity in agriculture requires improvement in infrastructure and better management practices davies et al 2017 improving watercourses better land management practices capacity building of water user s associations wuas are the responsibilities of provincial agricultural departments gos 2017 gop 2018a punjab agriculture department has decentralized institutions responsible for improving water productivity this department also performs research for the development of low cost farm machinery at the agricultural mechanization research institute amri gop 2018a other services of field wing of the directorate of agriculture are water resources development and soil conservation activities such as land levelling gop 2018b in addition the on farm water management department executes specialized projects and activities targeted to improve water productivity at farm level these institutes perform their mandated activities through their research facilities established across the province and district level field staff similarly the agriculture department of sindh government executes on farm water management activities including registration and capacity building of wua s through agricultural engineering and water management wing ae wm gos 2017 as the name indicates this department undertakes the responsibilities equal to the combined activities of ofwm and field wing of punjab directorate of agriculture this department has district level outreach through its research directorates and officers placed at different locations across sindh province a framework of the water management system is also illustrated in fig 1 4 3 analysis overlap of institutions their activities and bureaucratic system of administration is one of the major reasons behind the low of effectiveness of pida s young et al 2019 theoretically there is a direct linkage between canal supply authorities and on farm water management however administratively both institutions are inert the only synchronizing point between ofwm and pidas is wua s which by definition are responsible for the operation and maintenance of watercourses qureshi and haque 2006 ofwm punjab registers wua s under the on farm water management and water user association ordinance 1981 amended in 2001 in pida s system despite the establishment of farmer organizations fo s at distributary level equitable canal water supplies were available only to members of fo s young et al 2019 this multi tier institutional setup which was meant for improving supply and equity has compromised its transparency this is regarded as the inherent default in extensive irrigation systems by levine 1977 such supply based systems are inefficient because they are designed based on the per acre water requirement while ignoring human factor who have to manage these systems levine 1977 according to the provision in act of pida s such issue is to be resolved by the involvement of consumers and beneficiaries of canal supplies therefore it is essential to involve wuas comprising farmers for participatory development and management of watercourses as most of the conveyance losses occur in watercourses this will be actualized by diffusing the roles and functions of provincial irrigation departments into pidas and ofwm departments 5 successful elements of initiatives intended for water resource availability and management 5 1 infrastructural improvement for water resource availability agriculture is the largest consumer of fresh water and it will continue to remain the biggest user of water given the food security need of pakistan gop 2018a gop 2018b gop 2018c total water withdrawals are 180 bm3 out of which 69 99 bm3 is consumed by irrigation while the rest being lost to the system and consumption in other sectors this scenario of low efficiency is reducing water availability for lower riparian laghari et al 2012 since the 1970 s pakistan has initiated considerable projects for developing irrigation structure through international development assistance ida credit and from its public sector financing table 1 these investments expanded the irrigation system and increased cropping intensity of the indus basin briscoe et al 2005 the introduction of the salinity control reclamation project scarp tube well for the drainage of ibis helped in the lowering of the water table as a result a vast increase in private tubewells occurred and increased the dependence of farmers on groundwater to cultivate their land davies et al 2017 the scarp project with us 2 billion investment successfully reclaimed 6 mha of salt affected area young et al 2019 which brought additional land under cultivation since the 1980s several on farm water management projects have been introduced in addition to irrigation and drainage system expansion consequently 42 of watercourses in punjab province and 16 in sindh were improved before 2003 04 through ida credit fig 2 in the year 2004 05 the national program for the improvement of watercourses npiw was launched covering 31 additional watercourses for improvement in punjab and 42 in sindh province at that time sindh on farm water management program sofwm through ida credit was also being executed in sindh the specialty of npiw was that it was solely executed by the public sector financing of federal and provincial governments since 2012 pipip and siapep were launched through world bank financing in punjab and sindh provinces respectively improvement of watercourses was one of the critical components in all of these projects the positive impact is an improvement of two third watercourses in punjab and more than half in sindh province in an earlier national on farm water management project in 1980 reported increased cropping intensity in sindh province from 102 to 120 since 1977 usaid 1982 all of these infrastructural expansions brought about progressive changes in irrigated agriculture fig 3 since last four decades coverage of major crops has been increased in both sindh and punjab provinces improvement of watercourses is reported to have reduced conveyance losses by 39 and expanded the irrigated area by 21 gop 2019a gop 2019b the sofwm project reported 17 increased cropping intensity in the command area of improved watercourses the world bank 2015 freshwater availability due to improved irrigation infrastructure has also played a role in increasing crop yield and cropping intensity fig 4 despite that crop productivity of major crops in ibis is still low due to wasteful surface irrigation methods and freshwater applications through flood irrigation laghari et al 2012 initially these infrastructural improvements increased the coverage of irrigated land however canal water supplies remained fixed over the years but cropping intensity continues to grow at the expense of groundwater in year 1960 agricultural reliance on groundwater was only 8 watto and mugera 2016 qureshi et al 2010 reported the groundwater use in agriculture by 50 in addition to canal supplies this situation shows that crop choices were made out of their cash values but irrigation methods remained unchanged popular irrigation methods waste 50 60 of applied irrigation water therefore water efficient irrigation technologies are required to improve agricultural productivity by preserving water resources rizwan et al 2018 in response to water challenges certain resource conservation technologies are being promoted these include direct seeded rice zero tillage drill of wheat bed planting of rice and wheat laser land leveling and crop residue retention ahmad et al 2014 specific irrigation techniques drip and sprinkler irrigation that can deliver water at appropriate timing and quantification according to different crop growth stages have significant potential for increasing water productivity laghari et al 2012 5 2 promotion of resource conservation technologies and availability through mechanization numerous efforts have aimed at shifting farmers towards improved land management practices for higher water productivity these interventions are either piloted and promoted through a demonstration on farmers field or handed over to farmers on a cost sharing basis ofwm department government of punjab has highlighted a list of such accomplishments on its website gop 2018a in absence of the latest available statistics of farm machinery it is difficult to ascertain the farm mechanization literacy of the farming community in pakistan however a comparison of the progress of two consecutive decades fig 5 showed a rapid pace of progress in developing a private pool of farm machinery by farmers a comparison of 1984 94 and 1994 2004 recorded higher progress in the development of private tube wells tractors cultivators and trolleys record of the observation period indicates a slower transformation from bullock to tractors and bull cart to trolleys the development of the procurement of other types of ploughs was also dependent upon farmers who own tractors this distribution continued to remain the same because only 20 of small landholders less than 3 ha own tractors the percentage ownership of other equipment such as a seed drill becomes even smaller privately owned laser land level equipment is about 2 300 in punjab and sindh provinces mnfsr 2019 independent of landholdings however the use of rented machinery from the provincial government s pool and other farmers cannot be ruled out for instance out of 26 of farms that reported the use of simple seed drill about 88 use the rented tools mnfsr 2019 the reported use of machinery by farmers indicates that knowledge and awareness about the machinery play a key role in convincing them to use it imran et al 2018 the successful role of several research and demonstration projects that helped farmers in gaining such knowledge is detailed below 5 2 1 public sector demonstration and research projects government of pakistan has also executed national programs for the improvement of water productivity with particular focus on punjab and sindh provinces such as national program for improvement of watercourse npiw national project to stimulate the adaptation of permanent raised beds in maize wheat and cotton wheat farming system in pakistan gop 2010 and water conservation and productivity enhancement through high efficiency pressurized irrigation system gop 2018a during four years of experimentation 1998 2002 ofwm punjab established 88 demonstration plots covering an area of 460 ha for bed and furrow irrigation in cotton crop this demonstrative research reported that bed and furrow cropping in cotton saves up to 60 of irrigation water gill et al 2005 a three year research by ofwm in the rice wheat crop system reported 40 50 saving in irrigation water on permanent raised beds meisner et al 2005 in sindh province through sindh on farm water management project sofwm precision land leveling of about 32 000 ha of farmers land was completed the world bank 2015 it is difficult to ascertain the benefits incurred to farmers as a result of this project only available report on the impact assessment of this project was by the world bank which states that there was no assessment available to this particular component by sofwm 5 2 2 cost sharing subsidized schemes sofwm project initiated 90 10 government and farmer cost sharing for precision land levelling due to a lack of payment by the beneficiaries this component of sofwm was converted to a fully funded project the world bank 2015 sindh government has also initiated a new project on cost sharing basis known as the sindh irrigated agriculture productivity enhancement project siapep through world bank assistance this project offers a range of water conservation techniques on various cost modalities except for improvement of community watercourses distribution of high efficiency irrigation systems and precision land levelling equipment was done on government to farmers cost sharing basis 60 40 and 55 45 respectively siapep org 2018 the duration of this project is 2016 2021 therefore its impacts are yet to be determined however the sofwm project has been rated moderately satisfactory by the world bank so far unlike sindh province many cost sharing subsidized schemes for improving water productivity are offered by the punjab government through its own resources an overview and cost sharing scenario of these schemes is provided in table 2 punjab irrigation productivity improvement project pipip offered a package of technologies to farmers on subsidized rates implementation methodologies of both siapep and pipip include the invitation of applications from organizing wuas for watercourse improvement the acquisition of cost and in kind contribution from farmers the design and implementation of the activity gop 2018a siapep org 2018 the impact analysis studies of laser land levelling under the pipip program have revealed that in a laser levelled field as per farmer s method about 30 of water saving for wheat and maize crops have reported a good impact on crop yield mmp 2019 introduction of high efficiency irrigation system heis has reported an increase in 13 income benefits for row crops and 100 benefits in the case of vegetable cultivation the concept of heis irrigation schemes is also introduced in this project bringing the non canal command area under cultivation mmp 2016 these schemes are supported with high efficiency irrigation system sourced by solar powered pumping 5 2 3 demonstrative research projects public sector research projects adopted demonstration methodology for the promotion of water conservation techniques to farmers the sofwm project has demonstrated off season vegetable tunnels on 30 sites this technique has brought sound benefits to the beneficiary farmers the world bank 2015 pipip also demonstrated the concept of irrigation schemes and vegetable farming in tunnels on cost sharing basis mmp 2016 apart from public institutions international development organizations and national research institutions have also demonstrated water smart interventions such demonstration sites are either developed on farmer fields or demonstrated to farmers through farmer field days majeed et al 2017 over 150 farmers days field days were organized on these demonstration sites and trainings of over 13 000 farmers took place same methodology was adopted in watershed rehabilitation and irrigation improvement in pakistan executed by icarda more than 2 000 professionals from agriculture extension department on farm water management soil conservation and agriculture service providers participated in 122 professional on the job training sessions fatima and ashraf 2016 the technology package included design of solar powered high efficiency irrigation system heis farm level rainwater harvesting and cultivation of crops on beds ridges pakistan council of research in water resources pcrwr has also demonstrated rice cultivation on beds on its research and demonstration farm the technique reported demonstrating a 37 more water use efficiency in comparison to conventional flood irrigation soomro et al 2015 demonstrative research of water conservation technologies precision land levelling pll bed planting watercourse improvement and high efficiency irrigation system was also undertaken as a component of lower chenab canal lcc rehabilitation project 2008 15 this project was undertaken by water resources research centre university of agriculture faisalabad under this project demonstration of the aforementioned technologies was done free of cost on farmers fields located in the lcc command area the number of interventions was pll 2631 ha six watercourses improved 4 496 m in each distributary and hies established on 2 ha in each distributary rizwan et al 2018 this research has shown an increase in conveyance efficiency by watercourse improvement 22 water saving by pll whereas 30 50 water saving through rice wheat sowing on a raised bed ahmad et al 2014 conducted research on adaptation potential of resource conservation technologies direct seed drill and laser land level in rice wheat crop system of pakistan this research reported a higher adaptation of zero tillage drill and laser land level in sindh province compared to punjab province as they prevent deep percolation of irrigation water controlling the waterlogging problem 5 2 4 technology introduction with training and learning approaches in sindh province a total of 123 farmer field schools ffs in six districts were developed under integrated pest management ipm component of the sofwm project the world bank 2015 under the pipip project ofwm punjab provides mandatory training to beneficiary farmers for performing laser land levelling gop 2018a international centre for agricultural research in dry areas icarda through its research project during 2013 17 adopted a different approach that involved training of agricultural service provider asps the project provided asps training for designing installation and maintenance of water conservation technologies these trained asps were to provide support to local farmers in their respective areas majeed et al 2017 6 discussion the above review of various project reports literature and research material shows that a lot of efforts and investments are made to increase freshwater availability of irrigated agriculture these efforts have shaped present day ibis its governance infrastructure and ofwm in both punjab and sindh provinces these projects achieved their intended targets such as number of watercourses to be lined increase in farm mechanization and increased number of tubewells as a result about 107 000 watercourses present in sindh and punjab province will be lined by the end of sipep and pipip projects in sindh and punjab province number of tubewells has also grown from 30 000 in 1960 to over a million watoo and mugera 2016 this increase in water availability has also increased coverage of irrigated land but the low application efficiency has brought more unsustainable impact on water resources of pakistan despite these efforts the water use efficiency of crops and irrigation profitability in pakistan is amongst the lowest in the world soomro et al 2015 and laghari et al 2012 from institutional analysis it appears that there is a complete disconnect between organizations working on supply demand and implementation aspects emerging as a considerable governance challenge the focus of irrigation departments is just to supply water without catering to the demand of the user there is an ample quantity of water when there is no requirement of irrigation thus a supply based system is developed forcing the farmers to apply water even if the crops do not need it resultantly there is an overuse of water and farmers labelled as overusers parc 2018 the other side of this artificial investment and progress may be the poor working model imposed by the financial institutions in 1970 the establishment of parallel working ofwm directorates in each province reported as having caused resistance by the existing extension system usaid 1982 consequently there is difference of opinion between ofwm and agricultural extension departments since the beginning therefore a mixed message is being conveyed on farmer scale farooq et al 2007 the review of donor funded project evaluation reports reveal that projects are designed on perceptions and implemented on target approach lack of research based impact evaluation has left no concrete evidence regarding lessons learnt in earlier irrigation efficiency improvement projects an example of such useful reports is the impact assessment research on drip system beneficiary farmers of pipip project which reveal beneficiary aspects of project implementation such as farmers value subsidized drip irrigation system and they aspire for extensive and high value cropping using these drip systems however the adoption and benefits of drip irrigation subside with lack of knowledge on drip irrigation among the consumers dai et al 2015 same is the case with zero tillage and precision laser land leveling technologies reported by ahmad et al 2014 generally there is a need to run knowledge campaigns about operations and use of drip irrigation system to increase its adoption by the farmers bell et al 2017 the knowledge of resource conservation and climate smart technologies is also regarded as highly important by imran et al 2018 for their adoption and use the green revolution has resulted in increase of crop coverage in pakistan after 1960 s expansion of irrigation infrastructure supply of improved quality seeds fertilizers and pesticides were made to improve coverage of main crops dorosh et al 2003 many studies have reported shortage of water or water stress a principal reason behind low yield of major crops however there are many other factors contributing to low water productivity for instance cotton crop yield is sufficiently reduced due to infestation of insects rehman et al 2015 and cost of production is increasing due to expensive chemical control of pest integrated pest management ipm program was launched in sindh province to reduce environmental footprints of cotton production in pesticide attribute the impact assessment report of project states that ipm component moderately achieved highlights the target oriented implementation of potentially useful projects in case of maize crop availability of water has remained a critical aspect for cultivation of this cash crop rehman et al 2015 the availability of hybrid seed of maize crops has increased its crop coverage owning to its demand in poultry and livestock industry likewise yield of wheat and rice crops and their water productivity may be improved by choosing better yielding varieties young et al 2019 it is also pertinent to note here that all reasonable efforts and even the successful elements of on farm water management initiatives may have gone nowhere this results from the constant shrinkage of the share of agricultural input to the pakistan s gross domestic product gdp as a whole and particularly the share of the major crops fig 6 even a higher annual growth of agriculture sector of 3 9 has less effect in overall agricultural share to gdp main reason of this situation is that rural population generating their return from agricultural land are only 40 of rural community dorosh et al 2003 with increase of non farm rural poor population even a high agricultural income has cumulative low contribution into national economy there are two possible solutions to increase agricultural share in gdp firstly to increase value addition in agriculture at rural scale involving non farm rural poor into agriculture related activity secondly strict land reforms may be imposed on large land holdings which covers 52 of cultivated land and only being utilized 60 the absorption of the workforce has also reduced from 50 to 38 from 1970 to 2019 gop 2019 gop 2019 gop 2000 this shrinking trend points towards less profitable operations in the production of major crops and shift of agricultural workforce and farmers to other employment sectors one of the consequences is that agricultural land has been converted into housing societies mughal 2019 also pointed out the occurrence of rural urbanization in punjab mainly due to achieving high socioeconomic status and subsequent involvement in a variety of jobs other than agriculture similarly peerzado et al 2019 explained the phenomenon of agricultural land conversion into urbanization in search of better necessities rajpar et al 2019 also indicated an increase in abandoning agriculture activities in favor of non agricultural activities especially revenue generation activities 7 conclusion irrigated agriculture in pakistan mostly represents land and water resources of punjab and sindh provinces indus basin river system sources pakistan s irrigation system its longevity though not free of losses also contributes to the groundwater balance of the country multiple investments have contributed progressively to its extent and water availability in its command area as a combined blessing of tube well technology and improved irrigation system cropped area and the cropping intensity have enhanced remarkably it is also true that enormous efforts have contributed in better on farm water management through farm mechanization water conservation and heis these interventions have also impacted in the area of water savings on one hand as reported by many researchers and discussed in earlier sections on the other hand the introduction of new line of institutions pida s and ofwm created a destructive competition in case of pida s and provincial irrigation departments this has resulted into inequity in distribution subversion in water governance and revenue collection in case of agriculture extension and ofwm rigorous and perception based conception of target oriented projects mostly through loans from international financial institutions these projects have some demonstrated success however those could not expand as were perceived this occurred due to multiple reasons most of the initial projects were focused on large or progressive farmers lack of knowledge support to farmers for sustainable operations and lack of information dissemination to farmers regarding economic benefits of these system lastly technical complexities and high cost of low quality technologies worsened the situation and confined farmers to inefficient agricultural practices the subsidized schemes however provided a relief to farmers for being more focused on small farmers and offering credit to purchase high efficiency irrigation system limited efforts on educating farmers and building their knowledge about these water saving techniques are the achilles heel of these interventions this complete set of problems requires a paradigm shift in our way of looking into things related to irrigation water management and improving the efficiency of irrigated agriculture massive awareness campaign needs to be initiated to educate farmers regarding the use of efficient irrigation techniques new adult learning approaches have to be tested with strong involvement of the farming community ofwm and agriculture extension needs to upscale themselves according to farmer s needs a complete overhauling is required for extension agents with higher coordination between ofwm and agricultural extension in the field as well as on leadership level a new governance model has to be devised keeping in view the lessons learned from these successful elements and lessons learnt to make farming a profitable business land reforms needs to be introduced as well as rural value chain for agriculture at village scale needs to be established declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper the authors declare that they have no conﬂict of interest acknowledgment this work has been done under a project lwr

10359,limited water resources and climate change in arid and semi arid regions have negative impacts on food and water security management of irrigation and compost may be used to tackle this issue crop models are the powerful tools that could predict grain yield gy and water productivity wp under a broad range of irrigation compost and temperature interactions in addition modeling irrigation management requires the selection of the most suitable evapotranspiration et approach to achieve robust simulations to achieve this goal two crop models in decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat i e ceres wheat and n wheat were calibrated and evaluated using a field dataset of three growing seasons in a high temperate region in egypt luxor then the models were applied to explore gy and wp across a wide range of irrigation 11 options and compost 8 rates interactions using two et routines such as priestley taylor pt and fao 56 penman monteith pm the models were also used to predict gy and wp within the same range of irrigation and compost interactions at higher temperatures i e 1 2 3 and 4 compared to the baseline outputs 1981 2010 simulation results showed that deficit irrigation up to 80 and 85 from soil available water achieved the highest values of gy 7 5 t ha 1 and wp 18 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively provided that using higher rate of compost 12 t ha 1 rising temperature up to 4 c decreased gy and wp by 17 2 and 7 4 respectively relative to the baseline without any benefits from compost compost technology does not help offset the negative impacts of temperature but increased yield reduction and greenhouse gas emissions ghg higher compost rates may be used to mitigate the effect of deficit irrigation on wheat yield and water productivity but not compatible with mitigation of climate change in arid and semi arid regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords evapotranspiration climate change greenhouse gas emissions priestley taylor penman monteith 1 introduction global food security has recently been affected by overuse of freshwater resources falkenmark 2013 population growth asseng et al 2018a vörösmarty et al 2000 and impacts of climate change asseng et al 2015 kheir et al 2019 this requires a challenge to be sustainable when changing water use particularly in arid and semi arid regions to ensure global food security for humanity long et al 2006 in irrigation management studies actual evapotranspiration eta as one of the most significant physical factor in natural ecosystems and major component in hydrological cycle must be properly investigated ochoa sanchez et al 2019 climate change influences eta levels causing adverse impacts on soil moisture water balance carbon cycle and crop productivity gu et al 2008 application of physio biochemical traits and stress tolerance index increased wheat yields recently ahmed et al 2020 compost application to dry soil may boost mineralization of nitrogen n and carbon c under normal conditions of moisture brempong et al 2019 however the relationship between compost temperature and greenhouse gasses ghg in arid temperate regions is still uncertain in addition it is still unknown to investigate a wide range of compost deficit irrigation and heat stress by optimizing yield and water productivity wp brempong et al 2019 ding et al 2020 integrated management of irrigation and organic amendments may help farmers and decision makers cope with water scarcity in drought and water limited areas however so far less attention has been paid to investigating the combined impacts of temperature with large range of irrigation and compost interactions on crop and water productivity additionally there is not enough research yet to investigate the relationship between compost application and adaptation and mitigation to climate change under rising temperatures furthermore it was not possible to investigate a large range of irrigation compost and temperature relationships in field experiments proving the significance of current modeling study while wheat is considered the world s most important crop egypt is the world s most imported wheat country and willing to boost productivity in the coming years asseng et al 2018a irrigated wheat is the majority of the total wheat lands in egypt while arid and semi arid is the dominant region with restricted water resources seleiman et al 2019 therefore several recent attempts have been made to ensure that included use of nutrients seleiman 2019 and soil amendments seleiman and kheir 2018 nevertheless these attempts were carried out only in upper latitudes with low temperature and lack the complex effect of temperature irrigation and compost in lower latitudes with higher temperatures therefore the crop yield and water productivity through the use of an effective irrigation scheduling system is an urgent need in arid and semi arid regions lopeza et al 2017 mathematically crop models may provide a satisfactory way of studying the complex systems holzworth et al 2014 kheir et al 2020 ahmed 2020 ahmed and ahmad 2020 it is becoming an evaluation tool to improve the physiology and ecology of crops dong et al

and global model with more than 40 crops included in the cropping system model csm hoogenboom et al 2017 ceres wheat and cropsim wheat jones and kiniry 1986 ritchie and otter 1985 are most popular dssat models capable of predicting soil water and nitrogen crop yield and yield attributes plant density cultivar effects and weather that is subject to their environments in addition the n wheat model has recently been launched on the dssat platforms increasing the number of wheat models in the dssat kassie et al 2016 crop models should first be tested at current locations before they should be used in other regions it is very useful to use multi models to choose the correct model which could be successfully used to predict crop production at the specific location martre et al 2015 therefore to achieve robust prediction with high precision and low uncertainty we used a multi model ensemble crop models may also be used with a suggested uncertainty for assessing evapotranspiration et and water demand webber et al 2016 the dssat models could estimate et using various methods including fao 56 penman monteith pm allen et al 1998 and priestley taylor pt priestley and taylor 1972 these methods vary in precision depending on the availability of regular climatic data in the region being studied however comparison between both methods in crop models and observed values has not previously been studied in arid regions with spring wheat given the expected differences between et estimation methods kingston et al 2009 simulation of crop yields subject to adaptation was commonly used asseng et al 2018b ali et al 2020 with less emphasis on other essential options such as irrigation compost and temperature interactions furthermore the application of crop models requires a great deal of high quality data particularly on climate soil management and cultivar boote et al 2015 dssat models could simulate compost applications using the century module rather than other crop models performing long term sustainability analysis gijsman et al 2002 facilitating the simulation of n mineralization and ghg emissions nevertheless in modeling studies of temperate regions even under water and heat stress the broad application of this approach has not been studied before in this context the key objectives of this study can be summarized as ⅰ to calibrate ceres wheat and n wheat models for a recent local cultivar in egypt s high temperate zone ⅱ to explore the most accurate approach to et estimation in crop models under current conditions and ⅲ to research the combined impact of deficit irrigation temperature and compost on wheat yield and water productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and soil properties during the three successive wheat growing seasons 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 on spring wheat triticum aestivum l cv shandweel1 a field experiment was carried out at matanna agricultural research station luxor egypt 25 6 n 32 6 e the soil type of the experimental site was silty clay textured and classified by soil taxonomy as the order aridisol the preceding crop was first season maize second season sunflower and third season sesame in all seasons soil samples were taken from different depths 0 130 cm before treatment applications and used in crop models as soil file supplementary tables 1a b and c initial conditions such as moisture and nitrogen were measured before three growing seasons supplementary tables 2a b and c and used for models to reset all treatments each run the settings of calibrated models were set at soil data and initial conditions of first year 2016 2017 in simulation options to be used for baseline simulation 1981 2010 and with split interactions of rising temperature compost and deficit irrigation supplementary tables 1a and 2a meanwhile during calibration and evaluation processes soil and initial data of three growing seasons were used 2 2 agricultural practices and experimental design the experiment included 36 plots with three replicates in a split plot design the main plots were allocated to irrigation treatments to be triggered at different rates of soil moisture depletion from soil available water as 30 50 and 70 while the sub plots were mineral nitrogen fertilization urea 46 5 n as control without nitrogen fertilization recommended 120 kg n ha 80 from recommended 96 kg n ha and 60 from recommended 72 kg n ha a recent high yield common wheat cultivar of wheat shandweel1 was selected in this study it is a local variety recently introduced from wheat research program field crops research institute egypt to the egyptian cultivars yield and phenology attributes including grain yield total final biomass and phenology anthesis and maturity dates were measured and recorded grain and biomass yields were measured at harvest on 10 8 and 5 april for first 2016 2017 second 2017 2018 and third 2018 2019 seasons respectively the dates of anthesis differed according to growing seasons conditions and treatments varying from 84 to 93 days after sowing fig 2 also maturity dates ranged 115 129 days after sowing due to the effect of treatments and growing seasons climatic conditions 2 3 weather conditions daily data of maximum minimum temperatures solar radiation and rainfall were collected from an automated station in luxor fig 1 in addition the required weather data for model simulations for baseline simulations 1981 2010 were collected from the central lab for agricultural climate www clac edu eg in egypt 2 4 water measurements soil water content in depth of 40 cm was monitored using acquisition system composed by probes of time domain reflectometry tdr heimovaara et al 2004 the relationship between crop produced and the amount of water involved in crop production is defined by water productivity ali and talukder 2008 timing of irrigation triggered based on depletion levels of soil available water which was monitored daily by tdr then irrigation water quantities determined by refilling soil reservoir up to field capacity the observed et calculation is measured using the method of soil moisture depletion 2 5 modeling study two wheat models were evaluated and implemented in this study i e ceres wheat and n wheat embedded in the latest version of decision support systems for agrotechnology transfer dssat v 4 7 5 hoogenboom et al 2019 hoogenboom et al 2015 jones et al 2003 these models were chosen because they are commonly used in the crop modeling community and are well known tubiello and ewert 2002 nevertheless they were not been tested with current cultivar under the egyptian conditions with interactions between irrigation compost and temperature the dssat models are designed to simulate crop growth as a function of crop characteristics soil properties environment and management these models were used mainly for simulating various split scenarios of irrigation and compost in the current study both models are calibrated and tested using shandweel1 wheat cultivar cross name site mo 4 nac th ac 3 pvn 3 mirlo buc selection history cmss93b00567s 72y 010m 010y 010m3y 0m 0hty 0sh the models n wheat and ceres wheat were calibrated using the 2016 2017 dataset and evaluated using the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 growing seasons with shandweel1 cultivar data collection the calibration had been done manually by modifying the cultivar parameters to be consistent under all treatments with the field dataset calibrated models were evaluated and performed using the optimum set of parameters in models the evaluation and performance of models have been done using coefficient of determination r2 root mean square deviation rmsd and model index of agreement d as explained by jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 moriasi et al 2007 willmott 1984 respectively the grain yield and water productivity values were determined using two approaches in dssat models such as priestley taylor pt and fao 56 penman monteith pm this is to specify the best approach which achieves high precision under current conditions following model calibration during three growing seasons we applied wide range scenarios to predict the best practices in the application of water and compost that could achieve higher grain yield and wp values scenarios included irrigation at 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 and 100 depletion from soil available water and 8 rates of compost i e 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 t ha 1 compost was incorporated in soil with 15 cm depth for each rate total nitrogen 1 7 total phosphorus 1 1 and total potassium 1 5 were the chemical properties of the applied compost flow diagram in the supplementary fig 1 illustrates the mechanism of working century module in dssat models irrigation settings conducted using automatic irrigation option in the latest version of dssat models this is a new tool that allows irrigation at different fractions of depletion from soil available water by changing the code ithrl with the required fraction then supplemental irrigation is triggered to refill soil reservoir up to field capacity using ithru code in conjunction with these scenarios temperature impacts introduced to model by simulated gy and wp in baseline climate 1981 2010 and slowly rising temperature by 1 2 3 and 4 c simulation of temperature effect performed with the combination of irrigation and compost splits this is to investigate the projected impact of compost not only on deficit irrigation but also on rising temperature simulated outputs included evapotranspiration grain yield water productivity nitrogen uptake kg n ha cumulative n2o emissions from soil kg n ha and cumulative co2 emissions from soil kg c ha 3 results 3 1 calibration and evaluation of dssat models tables 1 and 2 provided all implemented models with a list of measured cultivar parameters and a shandweel1 evaluation for this calibration the coefficients have been obtained step by step first we started with phenological parameters and then with yields of grain and biomass data shown in fig 2 show that the n wheat and ceres wheat calibrations function well and robustly where the calibration of both models gave the grain yield total biomass anthesis and maturity dates high agreement with r2 0 80 and 0 95 both crop models reproduced grain yields well in addition the rmsd values for n wheat and ceres wheat were 458 and 370 kg ha 1 and the high agreement index d 0 97 and 0 98 respectively table 2 the models therefore displayed a simulation of high yield under the current conditions indeed under both model s total biomass simulations were well predicted where there were 0 79 and 0 60 simulated biomass r2 values the rmsd values were 1100 and 1608 kg ha 1 additionally d values for n wheat and ceres wheat were 0 85 and 0 83 respectively table 2 regarding wheat phenology simulations anthesis and maturity the data plotted in fig 2 and statistical indicators in table 2 showed a wise agreement between simulated and observed values the results from the n wheat and ceres wheat models in this study could therefore be used successfully as a decision support tool for selecting the fit cultivars both models well represented the anthesis and maturity dates fig 2 and table 2 3 2 measured and simulated actual evapotranspiration cumulative seasonal evapotranspiration etc predicted using two approaches in crop models pt and pm and measured using soil moisture depletion are shown in fig 3 simulated etc with pt and pm routines showed underestimation with pm approach recording range of 324 379 mm and 399 460 mm for pm and pt respectively fig 3a the observed measurements of etc ranged 375 495 mm creating a linear relationship with pt fig 3b and underestimation with pm routine fig 3c estimation of etc using pt approach much better than pm and could be used effectively in dssat models for et simulations and irrigation management studies 3 3 simulated grain yield irrigation water and water productivity subjected to compost and irrigation scenarios fig 4 displays simulated grain yield gy using two crop models and two et approaches pt and pm under wide range of compost and irrigation interactions this was to find out which scenario could improve yield and water productivity rather than those obtained under current field experimental treatments according to both methods pt and pm the data usually indicated a decrease in gy with deficit irrigation increasing the rate of compost however alleviated the decline in gy under deficit irrigation up to i8 irrigation at 85 depletion from soil available water beyond scenario of i8 there is no response in yield to ambient compost causing a sharp reduction in gy fig 4 the highest yield 8374 and 8209 kg ha 1 predicted by pt and pm approaches respectively under higher rate of compost 12 t ha 1 and higher rate of irrigation i1 irrigation at 50 depletion from soil available water simulated irrigation water decreased at both methods pt and pm with deficit irrigation the impact of compost application on irrigation water levels was non significant although irrigation rates marginally increased with higher compost rates in response to an increase in compost from 5 to 12 t ha 1 irrigation water increased by 1 9 and 2 5 respectively for pt and pm over irrigation treatments the effect of compost rates was considerable with gy and irrigation was not significant with deficit irrigation simulated water productivity wp increased to i7 in pm and to i8 in pt routine with respect to compost application fig 5 averaging over irrigation treatments rising compost levels from 5 to 12 t ha 1 for pm and pt routines respectively improved wp by 12 and 13 for pt and pm routines respectively the highest values of wp 19 3 and 23 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 were predicted under higher compost rates c8 12 t ha 1 and deficit irrigation i8 and i7 despite higher yields in full irrigation i1 deficit irrigation at i7 and i8 achieved higher wp values saving water for pt and pm routines by 84 and 57 mm ha 1 respectively as with gy higher compost levels are not advantageous in higher irrigation deficit beyond i8 dssat crop models therefore successfully used different split options from irrigation and compost to improve the wheat yield and water productivity in addition the pt method is much better than pm in simulating yield and water productivity where the first values attained close to the observed field values and less uncertainty errors compared to the second method pm 3 4 combined effect of rising temperature compost and deficit irrigation on grain yield and water productivity the combined effect of rising temperature compost and deficit irrigation on grain yield was shown in fig 6 averaging over irrigation and compost scenarios rising temperatures of 1 2 3 and 4 c decreased gy by 4 8 7 8 12 0 and 17 2 relative to baseline yield respectively this decrease also increased with irrigation deficits and higher compost levels averaged over irrigation treatment compost rates increased to c8 12 t ha 1 gy decreased by 7 2 11 6 16 0 and 21 5 relative to baseline yield due to rising temperatures of 1 2 3 and 4 c respectively fig 6a b c and d regarding the combined effect of temperature and deficit irrigation data showed that averaged over compost rates gy decreased only beyond i6 i3 i2 if temperature increased by 1 2 and 3 c respectively meanwhile with temperatures rising by 4 c the gy will be lowered relative to baseline under all irrigation scenarios with i11 the largest reduction in gy was expected showing a reduction in yields of 11 3 15 3 21 0 and 30 7 due to rising temperatures of 1 2 3 and 4 c relative to baseline yield fig 6 unlike gy wp impacts showed lower adverse effects under irrigation and compost interactions fig 7 averaged over all interactions of compost and irrigation rising temperature increased wp by 3 0 and 1 7 if temperature increased by 1 and 2 c respectively relative to baseline in the meantime higher temperature rates rose by 3 and 4 c the predicted wp dropped by 2 0 and 7 4 increasing compost up to c4 8 t ha 1 rates showed increase in wp only with rising temperature by 1 and 2 c respectively relative to baseline fig 7a b meanwhile in case of higher increase of temperature to 3 and 4 c the predicted values of wp increased with increasing compost rates by c3 7 t ha 1 and c1 5 t ha 1 respectively fig 7b c deficit irrigation averaged over compost applications decreased wp after i7 i7 i6 and i3 due to rising temperatures of 1 2 3 and 4 c respectively relative to baseline the higher temperature the higher irrigation deficit and the higher wp decrease the higher reduction in wp was predicted at lower irrigation i11 and recorded at 4 5 5 4 10 6 and 21 3 respectively due to rising temperatures of 1 2 3 and 4 c relative to baseline compost application favourable in optimizing yield and wp but not recommended as a climate change adaptation option in arid and semi arid regions 4 discussion 4 1 calibration and evaluation of dssat models determination of genetic parameters determination as per godwin and singh 1998 was done manually the values have been modified based on achieving the minimum root mean square deviation rmsd between predicted field data and observed data due to the positive relationships between yield growth and production simulated phenology achieved robust accuracy with observed as well as grain yield and biomass ceglar et al 2011 in ceres wheat anthesis date was calibrated using p1v and p1d meanwhile maturity date was controlled by p5 table 1 while in case of n wheat anthesis and maturity dates could be modified and controlled by vsen ppsen and p5 in the genotypic file table 1 accurate phenology is considered the first step for model calibration archontoulis et al 2014 due to achieving high accuracy and low uncertainty of phenology the genotypic variations could be captured by models which affect yield biomass and leaf area development robertson et al 2002 the main factors that can influence the production of biomass are the interception of solar radiation ri and radiation use efficiency rue our results were highly successful in predicting total biomass close to that obtained by arora et al 2007 due to the correlation between biomass and grain yield dettori et al 2011 simulations of biomass based on crop models are accurate and robust in these results biomass in ceres wheat was determined using standard non stressed dry weight total including grain of a single tiller at maturity g3 meanwhile in n wheat it was controlled by potential final dry weight of a single tiller stmmx table 1 grain yield is resulting from crop canopy and its ri harvest index hi and rue both models ceres wheat and n wheat achieved a high robust in simulating grain yield in ceres wheat the parameters that responsible for determining grain yield are kernel number per unit canopy weight at anthesis g1 and standard kernel size under optimum conditions g2 table 1 meanwhile in case of n wheat coefficient of kernel number per stem weight at the beginning of grain filling grno and kernel growth rate mxfil are the required parameters for grain yield calibration kassie et al 2016 therefore by modifying these parameters grain yield of the specific cultivar could be increased or decreased provided that modifying after process of crop phenology calibration ma et al 2011 4 2 difference between pt and pm in et calculations exploring the best et approach in crop models is very relevant and is still unclear in most models some related studies recommended using the pm approach for irrigation scheduling around the world since it generally yields robust results under different climatic conditions allen et al 2005 suleiman and hoogenboom 2007 on the other hand under mediterranean conditions utset et al 2004 proposed the use of pt than pm in irrigation scheduling our findings also found that in calculating et the pt approach is much better than pm achieving closable values with measured et meanwhile pm showed under estimation with measured et this is mainly attributed to the availability of additional climatic data required by pm such as wind speed and vapor pressure deficit along with temperature and solar radiation meanwhile pt approach characterizes with simplicity and its limited input requirements temperature and solar radiation hoogenboom 2001 therefore the pt approach is most suitable in arid and semi arid regions and with limited climatic data given the accurate estimates of evapotranspiration consequently the pt approach was later used to predict gy and wp under a large range of deficit irrigation compost rates and increasing temperature in both crop models figs 6 and 7 4 3 grain yield and water productivity subjected to irrigation and compost interactions water shortage has recently become a global concern owing to its negative effect on food security in arid and semi arid regions nouri et al 2019 therefore many attempts have been paid to reduce water use in agriculture included soil mulching pi et al 2017 plant breeding tester and langridge 2010 using drip irrigation to maximize irrigation efficiency nouri et al 2019 deficit irrigation to increase crop per drop wp chai et al 2016 ding et al 2020 conservation tillage azimzadeh 2012 and changing crop pattern to match the local growing conditions davis et al 2017 however there is still less exposure to the application of deficit irrigation with an effective management framework with compost and temperature interactions proving the significance of our findings in agricultural water management our novel approach used a multi model ensemble the suitable et calculation method as well as a broad range of deficit irrigation 11 scenarios and compost 8 rates interactions even under rising temperature here we focused on exploring the impact of a wide range of deficit irrigation and compost interactions on wheat yield and water productivity interestingly higher compost levels 12 t ha 1 led to a 21 4 and 11 3 increase in wheat yield under deficit irrigation irrigation at 85 depletion from soil available water for use of pm and pt approaches compared to lower compost levels 5 t ha 1 respectively this is mainly due to the role of compost in improving soil physical properties kranz et al 2020 in addition compost have been used to provide plants with macro and micronutrients donn et al 2014 gattinger et al 2012 ngo and cavagnaro 2018 from our findings in this relation it was found that nitrogen uptake by plant increased with higher compost levels supplementary fig 2 explaining the cause of increasing wheat yield with deficit irrigation at higher compost levels however there is no response to higher rates of compost with severe stress of deficit irrigation irrigation at 90 95 and 100 depletion from available water this is mainly attributed to the difficulty of extracting water by roots under limited available water thus in silty clay soils deficit irrigation up to depletion of 85 from soil available water could be used to tackle water scarcity and food insecurity provided that using higher rates of compost extreme deficit irrigation above 85 depletion from soil available water not recommended under arid and semi arid conditions 4 4 combined effect of temperature compost and irrigation on grain yield and water productivity unlike humid and semi humid regions the effect of compost on the wheat yield and water productivity under climate change increased temperature is unwise decreasing gy and wp with higher temperature levels reduced yield with increasing temperature is mainly due to shortened crop growth and canopy production accelerating the crop life cycle ali et al 2020 asseng et al 2015 correlated with less interception of solar radiation heng et al 2007 on the other hand due to the shorter crop period and declining total et the expected impact of increasing temperature on water productivity showed less adverse effects than gy figs 6 and 7 despite compost s wise role in alleviating negative impacts of deficit irrigation on gy and wp its role in climate change has been showing negative impacts through decreasing yield and wp with rising temperature this is may be due to decreasing et with higher compost rates with respect to deficit irrigation supplementary fig 3 additionally compost may not be recommended for climate change mitigation due to increased greenhouse gas ghg emissions associated with compost applications here we found that higher rates of compost associated with cumulative n2o emissions from soil supplementary fig 4 and cumulative co2 emissions from soil supplementary fig 5 this confirms that compost application to soils is favorable with water scarcity and food security but not recommended with climate change adaptation and mitigation in arid regions 5 conclusion climate change and water shortages have shown detrimental impacts on food and water shortages this problem could be overcome by applying a wide range of irrigation and compost to crop modeling however irrigation scheduling in crop modeling requires selecting the correct approach to determine evapotranspiration as it varies depending on the availability of climatic data in the studied region so far less attention has been paid to integrating compost into crop models to explore its effect on deficit irrigation and adaptation to climate change in addition exploring the potential impact of compost on greenhouse gases not studied yet before in arid regions in this paper we used a multi model approach with two methods of evapotranspiration estimation for each model to predict wheat grain yield and water productivity in a wide range of temperature compost and deficit irrigation interactions in a high temperate zone our novel findings showed that deficit irrigation up to depletion of 85 from soil available water achieved the highest water productivity provided that using higher rates of compost however compost technology does not help offset the negative impacts of temperature and increased yield reduction and greenhouse gas emissions higher compost rates used to mitigate the effect of deficit irrigation on wheat yield and water productivity but not compatible with adaptation

10359,limited water resources and climate change in arid and semi arid regions have negative impacts on food and water security management of irrigation and compost may be used to tackle this issue crop models are the powerful tools that could predict grain yield gy and water productivity wp under a broad range of irrigation compost and temperature interactions in addition modeling irrigation management requires the selection of the most suitable evapotranspiration et approach to achieve robust simulations to achieve this goal two crop models in decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat i e ceres wheat and n wheat were calibrated and evaluated using a field dataset of three growing seasons in a high temperate region in egypt luxor then the models were applied to explore gy and wp across a wide range of irrigation 11 options and compost 8 rates interactions using two et routines such as priestley taylor pt and fao 56 penman monteith pm the models were also used to predict gy and wp within the same range of irrigation and compost interactions at higher temperatures i e 1 2 3 and 4 compared to the baseline outputs 1981 2010 simulation results showed that deficit irrigation up to 80 and 85 from soil available water achieved the highest values of gy 7 5 t ha 1 and wp 18 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively provided that using higher rate of compost 12 t ha 1 rising temperature up to 4 c decreased gy and wp by 17 2 and 7 4 respectively relative to the baseline without any benefits from compost compost technology does not help offset the negative impacts of temperature but increased yield reduction and greenhouse gas emissions ghg higher compost rates may be used to mitigate the effect of deficit irrigation on wheat yield and water productivity but not compatible with mitigation of climate change in arid and semi arid regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords evapotranspiration climate change greenhouse gas emissions priestley taylor penman monteith 1 introduction global food security has recently been affected by overuse of freshwater resources falkenmark 2013 population growth asseng et al 2018a vörösmarty et al 2000 and impacts of climate change asseng et al 2015 kheir et al 2019 this requires a challenge to be sustainable when changing water use particularly in arid and semi arid regions to ensure global food security for humanity long et al 2006 in irrigation management studies actual evapotranspiration eta as one of the most significant physical factor in natural ecosystems and major component in hydrological cycle must be properly investigated ochoa sanchez et al 2019 climate change influences eta levels causing adverse impacts on soil moisture water balance carbon cycle and crop productivity gu et al 2008 application of physio biochemical traits and stress tolerance index increased wheat yields recently ahmed et al 2020 compost application to dry soil may boost mineralization of nitrogen n and carbon c under normal conditions of moisture brempong et al 2019 however the relationship between compost temperature and greenhouse gasses ghg in arid temperate regions is still uncertain in addition it is still unknown to investigate a wide range of compost deficit irrigation and heat stress by optimizing yield and water productivity wp brempong et al 2019 ding et al 2020 integrated management of irrigation and organic amendments may help farmers and decision makers cope with water scarcity in drought and water limited areas however so far less attention has been paid to investigating the combined impacts of temperature with large range of irrigation and compost interactions on crop and water productivity additionally there is not enough research yet to investigate the relationship between compost application and adaptation and mitigation to climate change under rising temperatures furthermore it was not possible to investigate a large range of irrigation compost and temperature relationships in field experiments proving the significance of current modeling study while wheat is considered the world s most important crop egypt is the world s most imported wheat country and willing to boost productivity in the coming years asseng et al 2018a irrigated wheat is the majority of the total wheat lands in egypt while arid and semi arid is the dominant region with restricted water resources seleiman et al 2019 therefore several recent attempts have been made to ensure that included use of nutrients seleiman 2019 and soil amendments seleiman and kheir 2018 nevertheless these attempts were carried out only in upper latitudes with low temperature and lack the complex effect of temperature irrigation and compost in lower latitudes with higher temperatures therefore the crop yield and water productivity through the use of an effective irrigation scheduling system is an urgent need in arid and semi arid regions lopeza et al 2017 mathematically crop models may provide a satisfactory way of studying the complex systems holzworth et al 2014 kheir et al 2020 ahmed 2020 ahmed and ahmad 2020 it is becoming an evaluation tool to improve the physiology and ecology of crops dong et al

et al 2012 and stics brisson et al 2003 were tested and enhanced for predicting potential wheat in different environments decision support system of agrotechnology transfer dssat v 4 7 5 is a large and global model with more than 40 crops included in the cropping system model csm hoogenboom et al 2017 ceres wheat and cropsim wheat jones and kiniry 1986 ritchie and otter 1985 are most popular dssat models capable of predicting soil water and nitrogen crop yield and yield attributes plant density cultivar effects and weather that is subject to their environments in addition the n wheat model has recently been launched on the dssat platforms increasing the number of wheat models in the dssat kassie et al 2016 crop models should first be tested at current locations before they should be used in other regions it is very useful to use multi models to choose the correct model which could be successfully used to predict crop production at the specific location martre et al 2015 therefore to achieve robust prediction with high precision and low uncertainty we used a multi model ensemble crop models may also be used with a suggested uncertainty for assessing evapotranspiration et and water demand webber et al 2016 the dssat models could estimate et using various methods including fao 56 penman monteith pm allen et al 1998 and priestley taylor pt priestley and taylor 1972 these methods vary in precision depending on the availability of regular climatic data in the region being studied however comparison between both methods in crop models and observed values has not previously been studied in arid regions with spring wheat given the expected differences between et estimation methods kingston et al 2009 simulation of crop yields subject to adaptation was commonly used asseng et al 2018b ali et al 2020 with less emphasis on other essential options such as irrigation compost and temperature interactions furthermore the application of crop models requires a great deal of high quality data particularly on climate soil management and cultivar boote et al 2015 dssat models could simulate compost applications using the century module rather than other crop models performing long term sustainability analysis gijsman et al 2002 facilitating the simulation of n mineralization and ghg emissions nevertheless in modeling studies of temperate regions even under water and heat stress the broad application of this approach has not been studied before in this context the key objectives of this study can be summarized as ⅰ to calibrate ceres wheat and n wheat models for a recent local cultivar in egypt s high temperate zone ⅱ to explore the most accurate approach to et estimation in crop models under current conditions and ⅲ to research the combined impact of deficit irrigation temperature and compost on wheat yield and water productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location and soil properties during the three successive wheat growing seasons 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 on spring wheat triticum aestivum l cv shandweel1 a field experiment was carried out at matanna agricultural research station luxor egypt 25 6 n 32 6 e the soil type of the experimental site was silty clay textured and classified by soil taxonomy as the order aridisol the preceding crop was first season maize second season sunflower and third season sesame in all seasons soil samples were taken from different depths 0 130 cm before treatment applications and used in crop models as soil file supplementary tables 1a b and c initial conditions such as moisture and nitrogen were measured before three growing seasons supplementary tables 2a b and c and used for models to reset all treatments each run the settings of calibrated models were set at soil data and initial conditions of first year 2016 2017 in simulation options to be used for baseline simulation 1981 2010 and with split interactions of rising temperature compost and deficit irrigation supplementary tables 1a and 2a meanwhile during calibration and evaluation processes soil and initial data of three growing seasons were used 2 2 agricultural practices and experimental design the experiment included 36 plots with three replicates in a split plot design the main plots were allocated to irrigation treatments to be triggered at different rates of soil moisture depletion from soil available water as 30 50 and 70 while the sub plots were mineral nitrogen fertilization urea 46 5 n as control without nitrogen fertilization recommended 120 kg n ha 80 from recommended 96 kg n ha and 60 from recommended 72 kg n ha a recent high yield common wheat cultivar of wheat shandweel1 was selected in this study it is a local variety recently introduced from wheat research program field crops research institute egypt to the egyptian cultivars yield and phenology attributes including grain yield total final biomass and phenology anthesis and maturity dates were measured and recorded grain and biomass yields were measured at harvest on 10 8 and 5 april for first 2016 2017 second 2017 2018 and third 2018 2019 seasons respectively the dates of anthesis differed according to growing seasons conditions and treatments varying from 84 to 93 days after sowing fig 2 also maturity dates ranged 115 129 days after sowing due to the effect of treatments and growing seasons climatic conditions 2 3 weather conditions daily data of maximum minimum temperatures solar radiation and rainfall were collected from an automated station in luxor fig 1 in addition the required weather data for model simulations for baseline simulations 1981 2010 were collected from the central lab for agricultural climate www clac edu eg in egypt 2 4 water measurements soil water content in depth of 40 cm was monitored using acquisition system composed by probes of time domain reflectometry tdr heimovaara et al 2004 the relationship between crop produced and the amount of water involved in crop production is defined by water productivity ali and talukder 2008 timing of irrigation triggered based on depletion levels of soil available water which was monitored daily by tdr then irrigation water quantities determined by refilling soil reservoir up to field capacity the observed et calculation is measured using the method of soil moisture depletion 2 5 modeling study two wheat models were evaluated and implemented in this study i e ceres wheat and n wheat embedded in the latest version of decision support systems for agrotechnology transfer dssat v 4 7 5 hoogenboom et al 2019 hoogenboom et al 2015 jones et al 2003 these models were chosen because they are commonly used in the crop modeling community and are well known tubiello and ewert 2002 nevertheless they were not been tested with current cultivar under the egyptian conditions with interactions between irrigation compost and temperature the dssat models are designed to simulate crop growth as a function of crop characteristics soil properties environment and management these models were used mainly for simulating various split scenarios of irrigation and compost in the current study both models are calibrated and tested using shandweel1 wheat cultivar cross name site mo 4 nac th ac 3 pvn 3 mirlo buc selection history cmss93b00567s 72y 010m 010y 010m3y 0m 0hty 0sh the models n wheat and ceres wheat were calibrated using the 2016 2017 dataset and evaluated using the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 growing seasons with shandweel1 cultivar data collection the calibration had been done manually by modifying the cultivar parameters to be consistent under all treatments with the field dataset calibrated models were evaluated and performed using the optimum set of parameters in models the evaluation and performance of models have been done using coefficient of determination r2 root mean square deviation rmsd and model index of agreement d as explained by jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 moriasi et al 2007 willmott 1984 respectively the grain yield and water productivity values were determined using two approaches in dssat models such as priestley taylor pt and fao 56 penman monteith pm this is to specify the best approach which achieves high precision under current conditions following model calibration during three growing seasons we applied wide range scenarios to predict the best practices in the application of water and compost that could achieve higher grain yield and wp values scenarios included irrigation at 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 and 100 depletion from soil available water and 8 rates of compost i e 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 t ha 1 compost was incorporated in soil with 15 cm depth for each rate total nitrogen 1 7 total phosphorus 1 1 and total potassium 1 5 were the chemical properties of the applied compost flow diagram in the supplementary fig 1 illustrates the mechanism of working century module in dssat models irrigation settings conducted using automatic irrigation option in the latest version of dssat models this is a new tool that allows irrigation at different fractions of depletion from soil available water by changing the code ithrl with the required fraction then supplemental irrigation is triggered to refill soil reservoir up to field capacity using ithru code in conjunction with these scenarios temperature impacts introduced to model by simulated gy and wp in baseline climate 1981 2010 and slowly rising temperature by 1 2 3 and 4 c simulation of temperature effect performed with the combination of irrigation and compost splits this is to investigate the projected impact of compost not only on deficit irrigation but also on rising temperature simulated outputs included evapotranspiration grain yield water productivity nitrogen uptake kg n ha cumulative n2o emissions from soil kg n ha and cumulative co2 emissions from soil kg c ha 3 results 3 1 calibration and evaluation of dssat models tables 1 and 2 provided all implemented models with a list of measured cultivar parameters and a shandweel1 evaluation for this calibration the coefficients have been obtained step by step first we started with phenological parameters and then with yields of grain and biomass data shown in fig 2 show that the n wheat and ceres wheat calibrations function well and robustly where the calibration of both models gave the grain yield total biomass anthesis and maturity dates high agreement with r2 0 80 and 0 95 both crop models reproduced grain yields well in addition the rmsd values for n wheat and ceres wheat were 458 and 370 kg ha 1 and the high agreement index d 0 97 and 0 98 respectively table 2 the models therefore displayed a simulation of high yield under the current conditions indeed under both model s total biomass simulations were well predicted where there were 0 79 and 0 60 simulated biomass r2 values the rmsd values were 1100 and 1608 kg ha 1 additionally d values for n wheat and ceres wheat were 0 85 and 0 83 respectively table 2 regarding wheat phenology simulations anthesis and maturity the data plotted in fig 2 and statistical indicators in table 2 showed a wise agreement between simulated and observed values the results from the n wheat and ceres wheat models in this study could therefore be used successfully as a decision support tool for selecting the fit cultivars both models well represented the anthesis and maturity dates fig 2 and table 2 3 2 measured and simulated actual evapotranspiration cumulative seasonal evapotranspiration etc predicted using two approaches in crop models pt and pm and measured using soil moisture depletion are shown in fig 3 simulated etc with pt and pm routines showed underestimation with pm approach recording range of 324 379 mm and 399 460 mm for pm and pt respectively fig 3a the observed measurements of etc ranged 375 495 mm creating a linear relationship with pt fig 3b and underestimation with pm routine fig 3c estimation of etc using pt approach much better than pm and could be used effectively in dssat models for et simulations and irrigation management studies 3 3 simulated grain yield irrigation water and water productivity subjected to compost and irrigation scenarios fig 4 displays simulated grain yield gy using two crop models and two et approaches pt and pm under wide range of compost and irrigation interactions this was to find out which scenario could improve yield and water productivity rather than those obtained under current field experimental treatments according to both methods pt and pm the data usually indicated a decrease in gy with deficit irrigation increasing the rate of compost however alleviated the decline in gy under deficit irrigation up to i8 irrigation at 85 depletion from soil available water beyond scenario of i8 there is no response in yield to ambient compost causing a sharp reduction in gy fig 4 the highest yield 8374 and 8209 kg ha 1 predicted by pt and pm approaches respectively under higher rate of compost 12 t ha 1 and higher rate of irrigation i1 irrigation at 50 depletion from soil available water simulated irrigation water decreased at both methods pt and pm with deficit irrigation the impact of compost application on irrigation water levels was non significant although irrigation rates marginally increased with higher compost rates in response to an increase in compost from 5 to 12 t ha 1 irrigation water increased by 1 9 and 2 5 respectively for pt and pm over irrigation treatments the effect of compost rates was considerable with gy and irrigation was not significant with deficit irrigation simulated water productivity wp increased to i7 in pm and to i8 in pt routine with respect to compost application fig 5 averaging over irrigation treatments rising compost levels from 5 to 12 t ha 1 for pm and pt routines respectively improved wp by 12 and 13 for pt and pm routines respectively the highest values of wp 19 3 and 23 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 were predicted under higher compost rates c8 12 t ha 1 and deficit irrigation i8 and i7 despite higher yields in full irrigation i1 deficit irrigation at i7 and i8 achieved higher wp values saving water for pt and pm routines by 84 and 57 mm ha 1 respectively as with gy higher compost levels are not advantageous in higher irrigation deficit beyond i8 dssat crop models therefore successfully used different split options from irrigation and compost to improve the wheat yield and water productivity in addition the pt method is much better than pm in simulating yield and water productivity where the first values attained close to the observed field values and less uncertainty errors compared to the second method pm 3 4 combined effect of rising temperature compost and deficit irrigation on grain yield and water productivity the combined effect of rising temperature compost and deficit irrigation on grain yield was shown in fig 6 averaging over irrigation and compost scenarios rising temperatures of 1 2 3 and 4 c decreased gy by 4 8 7 8 12 0 and 17 2 relative to baseline yield respectively this decrease also increased with irrigation deficits and higher compost levels averaged over irrigation treatment compost rates increased to c8 12 t ha 1 gy decreased by 7 2 11 6 16 0 and 21 5 relative to baseline yield due to rising temperatures of 1 2 3 and 4 c respectively fig 6a b c and d regarding the combined effect of temperature and deficit irrigation data showed that averaged over compost rates gy decreased only beyond i6 i3 i2 if temperature increased by 1 2 and 3 c respectively meanwhile with temperatures rising by 4 c the gy will be lowered relative to baseline under all irrigation scenarios with i11 the largest reduction in gy was expected showing a reduction in yields of 11 3 15 3 21 0 and 30 7 due to rising temperatures of 1 2 3 and 4 c relative to baseline yield fig 6 unlike gy wp impacts showed lower adverse effects under irrigation and compost interactions fig 7 averaged over all interactions of compost and irrigation rising temperature increased wp by 3 0 and 1 7 if temperature increased by 1 and 2 c respectively relative to baseline in the meantime higher temperature rates rose by 3 and 4 c the predicted wp dropped by 2 0 and 7 4 increasing compost up to c4 8 t ha 1 rates showed increase in wp only with rising temperature by 1 and 2 c respectively relative to baseline fig 7a b meanwhile in case of higher increase of temperature to 3 and 4 c the predicted values of wp increased with increasing compost rates by c3 7 t ha 1 and c1 5 t ha 1 respectively fig 7b c deficit irrigation averaged over compost applications decreased wp after i7 i7 i6 and i3 due to rising temperatures of 1 2 3 and 4 c respectively relative to baseline the higher temperature the higher irrigation deficit and the higher wp decrease the higher reduction in wp was predicted at lower irrigation i11 and recorded at 4 5 5 4 10 6 and 21 3 respectively due to rising temperatures of 1 2 3 and 4 c relative to baseline compost application favourable in optimizing yield and wp but not recommended as a climate change adaptation option in arid and semi arid regions 4 discussion 4 1 calibration and evaluation of dssat models determination of genetic parameters determination as per godwin and singh 1998 was done manually the values have been modified based on achieving the minimum root mean square deviation rmsd between predicted field data and observed data due to the positive relationships between yield growth and production simulated phenology achieved robust accuracy with observed as well as grain yield and biomass ceglar et al 2011 in ceres wheat anthesis date was calibrated using p1v and p1d meanwhile maturity date was controlled by p5 table 1 while in case of n wheat anthesis and maturity dates could be modified and controlled by vsen ppsen and p5 in the genotypic file table 1 accurate phenology is considered the first step for model calibration archontoulis et al 2014 due to achieving high accuracy and low uncertainty of phenology the genotypic variations could be captured by models which affect yield biomass and leaf area development robertson et al 2002 the main factors that can influence the production of biomass are the interception of solar radiation ri and radiation use efficiency rue our results were highly successful in predicting total biomass close to that obtained by arora et al 2007 due to the correlation between biomass and grain yield dettori et al 2011 simulations of biomass based on crop models are accurate and robust in these results biomass in ceres wheat was determined using standard non stressed dry weight total including grain of a single tiller at maturity g3 meanwhile in n wheat it was controlled by potential final dry weight of a single tiller stmmx table 1 grain yield is resulting from crop canopy and its ri harvest index hi and rue both models ceres wheat and n wheat achieved a high robust in simulating grain yield in ceres wheat the parameters that responsible for determining grain yield are kernel number per unit canopy weight at anthesis g1 and standard kernel size under optimum conditions g2 table 1 meanwhile in case of n wheat coefficient of kernel number per stem weight at the beginning of grain filling grno and kernel growth rate mxfil are the required parameters for grain yield calibration kassie et al 2016 therefore by modifying these parameters grain yield of the specific cultivar could be increased or decreased provided that modifying after process of crop phenology calibration ma et al 2011 4 2 difference between pt and pm in et calculations exploring the best et approach in crop models is very relevant and is still unclear in most models some related studies recommended using the pm approach for irrigation scheduling around the world since it generally yields robust results under different climatic conditions allen et al 2005 suleiman and hoogenboom 2007 on the other hand under mediterranean conditions utset et al 2004 proposed the use of pt than pm in irrigation scheduling our findings also found that in calculating et the pt approach is much better than pm achieving closable values with measured et meanwhile pm showed under estimation with measured et this is mainly attributed to the availability of additional climatic data required by pm such as wind speed and vapor pressure deficit along with temperature and solar radiation meanwhile pt approach characterizes with simplicity and its limited input requirements temperature and solar radiation hoogenboom 2001 therefore the pt approach is most suitable in arid and semi arid regions and with limited climatic data given the accurate estimates of evapotranspiration consequently the pt approach was later used to predict gy and wp under a large range of deficit irrigation compost rates and increasing temperature in both crop models figs 6 and 7 4 3 grain yield and water productivity subjected to irrigation and compost interactions water shortage has recently become a global concern owing to its negative effect on food security in arid and semi arid regions nouri et al 2019 therefore many attempts have been paid to reduce water use in agriculture included soil mulching pi et al 2017 plant breeding tester and langridge 2010 using drip irrigation to maximize irrigation efficiency nouri et al 2019 deficit irrigation to increase crop per drop wp chai et al 2016 ding et al 2020 conservation tillage azimzadeh 2012 and changing crop pattern to match the local growing conditions davis et al 2017 however there is still less exposure to the application of deficit irrigation with an effective management framework with compost and temperature interactions proving the significance of our findings in agricultural water management our novel approach used a multi model ensemble the suitable et calculation method as well as a broad range of deficit irrigation 11 scenarios and compost 8 rates interactions even under rising temperature here we focused on exploring the impact of a wide range of deficit irrigation and compost interactions on wheat yield and water productivity interestingly higher compost levels 12 t ha 1 led to a 21 4 and 11 3 increase in wheat yield under deficit irrigation irrigation at 85 depletion from soil available water for use of pm and pt approaches compared to lower compost levels 5 t ha 1 respectively this is mainly due to the role of compost in improving soil physical properties kranz et al 2020 in addition compost have been used to provide plants with macro and micronutrients donn et al 2014 gattinger et al 2012 ngo and cavagnaro 2018 from our findings in this relation it was found that nitrogen uptake by plant increased with higher compost levels supplementary fig 2 explaining the cause of increasing wheat yield with deficit irrigation at higher compost levels however there is no response to higher rates of compost with severe stress of deficit irrigation irrigation at 90 95 and 100 depletion from available water this is mainly attributed to the difficulty of extracting water by roots under limited available water thus in silty clay soils deficit irrigation up to depletion of 85 from soil available water could be used to tackle water scarcity and food insecurity provided that using higher rates of compost extreme deficit irrigation above 85 depletion from soil available water not recommended under arid and semi arid conditions 4 4 combined effect of temperature compost and irrigation on grain yield and water productivity unlike humid and semi humid regions the effect of compost on the wheat yield and water productivity under climate change increased temperature is unwise decreasing gy and wp with higher temperature levels reduced yield with increasing temperature is mainly due to shortened crop growth and canopy production accelerating the crop life cycle ali et al 2020 asseng et al 2015 correlated with less interception of solar radiation heng et al 2007 on the other hand due to the shorter crop period and declining total et the expected impact of increasing temperature on water productivity showed less adverse effects than gy figs 6 and 7 despite compost s wise role in alleviating negative impacts of deficit irrigation on gy and wp its role in climate change has been showing negative impacts through decreasing yield and wp with rising temperature this is may be due to decreasing et with higher compost rates with respect to deficit irrigation supplementary fig 3 additionally compost may not be recommended for climate change mitigation due to increased greenhouse gas ghg emissions associated with compost applications here we found that higher rates of compost associated with cumulative n2o emissions from soil supplementary fig 4 and cumulative co2 emissions from soil supplementary fig 5 this confirms that compost application to soils is favorable with water scarcity and food security but not recommended with climate change adaptation and mitigation in arid regions 5 conclusion climate change and water shortages have shown detrimental impacts on food and water shortages this problem could be overcome by applying a wide range of irrigation and compost to crop modeling however irrigation scheduling in crop modeling requires selecting the correct approach to determine evapotranspiration as it varies depending on the availability of climatic data in the studied region so far less attention has been paid to integrating compost into crop models to explore its effect on deficit irrigation and adaptation to climate change in addition exploring the potential impact of compost on greenhouse gases not studied yet before in arid regions in this paper we used a multi model approach with two methods of evapotranspiration estimation for each model to predict wheat grain yield and water productivity in a wide range of temperature compost and deficit irrigation interactions in a high temperate zone our novel findings showed that deficit irrigation up to depletion of 85 from soil available water achieved the highest water productivity provided that using higher rates of compost however compost technology does not help offset the negative impacts of temperature and increased yield reduction and greenhouse gas emissions higher compost rates used to mitigate the effect of deficit irrigation on wheat yield and water productivity but not compatible with adaptation
