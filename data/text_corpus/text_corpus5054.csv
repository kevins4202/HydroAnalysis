25270,the composition abundance and age structure of groundwater dependent vegetation gdv are tightly coupled with groundwater level variation modeling the space time dynamics of gdv is valuable for ecosystem conservation and recovery but there are few modeling frameworks on gdv space time dynamics in this study we propose a stochastic process based theoretical framework and develop a species specific theoretical evolution model stem to analyze and simulate gdv dynamics in the model the groundwater level variation is described as stochastic processes based on this method the temporal dimension of vegetation dynamics is involved the model focuses on the life cycle of same aged population and divides this life cycle into two evolution phases each phase is formulated with a stochastic differential equation respectively the solution processes interpret the probability distributions of gdv and the plot wised model application in a certain geomorphology area derives different typical distribution patterns for the population abundance and lifespan the results also reveal the positive effects of water regulations on vegetation restoration this framework describes the spatial temporal dynamics of gdv rather than providing a stationary solution it can adapt to the non stationarity of groundwater level variations and distinctive sensitivity during the plants life cycle because of the markov property of stochastic equations the model can also help to predict vegetation responses under the groundwater level variations keywords vegetation dynamics theoretical model groundwater fluctuations probability distribution life span 1 introduction in ecosystem groundwater dependent vegetation gdv uptake water from both soil moisture and groundwater system naumburg et al 2005 lowry and loheide 2010 groundwater level variations are controlled by natural environmental impacts and human activities as an important part of an ecosystem gow et al 2016 the abundance age structure and evolution of gdv community closely coupled with groundwater supply understanding the distribution and dynamics of gdv is necessary for sustainable management and maintenance of healthy ecosystems naumburg et al 2005 eamus et al 2015 gow et al 2016 the processes and mechanisms of groundwater vegetation interactions have attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years several conceptual models mckenney et al 1995 naumburg et al 2005 merritt et al 2010 baird et al 2005 and experimental methods cale et al 2013 xin et al 2013 sprenger et al 2016 have been developed to analyze the groundwater vegetation interactions generally groundwater table departure from the favorable level will impact the gdv growth negatively naumburg et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 eamus et al 2015 a decreasing groundwater table often increases water stress or the water potential gradient xylem cavitation will occur and plants will lose some branches and leaves as a response to the inadequate groundwater supply in the root area eamus et al 2015 while an excessively rising groundwater table may result in root anoxia bogino and jobb√°gy 2011 the photosynthetic activity of whole plants will thus decrease naumburg et al 2005 you et al 2015 if the groundwater level lies in an acceptable range plants can maintain metabolic activities through the redistribution of roots scott et al 2000 reducing the transpiration of branches and leaves smith and nowak 1990 forming aerenchyma cronk and fennessy 2001 to adapt to the groundwater variation but the growth rate of plants will decrease and some species may become dormant mensforth and walker 1996 otherwise when the groundwater table exceeds an upper or lower threshold of tolerance plants will experience mortality except for the negative responses of plant such as root mortality or reduced reproduction floods can also positively influence gdv by creating new germination sites delivering woody debris and spreading propagules bertoldi et al 2011 gurnell et al 2012 the water vegetation interactions are hard to trace and model precisely or completely on the one hand too many factors can jointly drive the groundwater table variation such as climate changes surface or underground runoff natural evaporation and groundwater extraction by human eamus et al 2015 on the other hand the quantification of water use by gdv remains unresolved due to the complexity of plant responses sibly and hone 2002 naumburg et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 eamus et al 2015 nevertheless variations of the groundwater level display significant random and non stationary fluctuations under natural and anthropogenic disturbances orellana et al 2012 eamus et al 2015 tron et al 2015 vesipa et al 2015 the gdv distribution also shows great randomness because it is closely coupled with the groundwater variation furthermore the water requirements of plants are time varying because the plants physiological properties will change during the life cycle in general mature plants are better able to withstand the flood inundation and survive low groundwater table than young plants friedman and auble 1999 lytle and merritt 2004 but seeds have more rigorous requirements for their germination furthermore seedling establishment usually occurs during specific seasons in which suitable soil moisture or groundwater levels emerge it is a critical life history stage that determines the scale of vegetation recovery or succession however there have been few specialized studies on the coupled mechanisms between plant life history and non stationary fluctuations of the depth to groundwater except for some conceptual or qualitative studies mahoney and rood 1998 magurran 2007 greet et al 2011 balke et al 2014 numerous models have concerned the stochastic properties of gdv distribution including the maximum information entropy maxent principle in ecology and the neutral theory hubbell 1997 chave 2004 the maxent principle in ecology harte et al 2008 described some macro scale distribution patterns in the forms of the species area relationships and the distribution of species abundance with the aid of macro metrics constraints on the vegetation community these metrics contain the mean number of individuals the total energy requirements and the spatial abundance maxent s theoretical conclusions were verified with tests on the macro ecology level harte and newman 2014 xiao et al 2015 the essential assumption of neutral theory is that all individuals in a community are equivalent with respect to random reproduction and death in the evolution of the vegetation community this gives rise to a birth and death process a specific stochastic process in modeling the formation mechanisms of species distribution patterns on a local scale there are some specific stochastic process methods used to analyze the riparian vegetation distribution under an altered river flow regime which is assumed to be the main driving factor of riparian vegetation dynamics camporeale and ridolfi 2006 magurran 2007 perucca et al 2007 merritt et al 2010 orellana et al 2012 tron et al 2015 most of the theoretical models derive limit form solutions in temporal or statistical sense which represent the stationary or quasi steady states of ecosystem table 1 the conclusions hence interpret a macroscopic spatial distribution but the temporal dynamics of gdv is seldom described the inherent non stationarity and seasonality of disturbances have been paid minimal consideration the statistical analysis that normally need large sample data does not reflect the spatial temporal dynamics of vegetation either in this article we propose a theoretical framework and a stochastic process based minimalistic model named the species specific theoretical evolution model stem to analyze and simulate the spatial temporal dynamics of gdv induced by the groundwater table fluctuations the stem is on the basis of stochastic process description of the coupling between groundwater fluctuation and vegetation dynamics it focuses on the evolution process of a same aged plant population rather than mix aged plant community and finally we concern the probability distribution of abundance rather than the quantification of physiological responses and groundwater use of plant individuals in the study to model the evolution process we divide the life cycle of the plant population into two sequential growth phases according to the time varying growth rate of plants population so that the spatial and temporal dynamics of gdv can be described simultaneously without omitting the time dimension the probability distribution of population abundance obtained from the stem could interpret some vegetation patterns observed from field investigation the markov property of stochastic differential equations in the stem allows the non stationary groundwater fluctuations involved in both seasonal and annual alterations to be easily dealt with if the parameters are calibrated by sample data computer simulation of gdv dynamics is also feasible taking advantage of the stem 2 methods 2 1 model development the gdv has a tendency to adapt to the groundwater supplies during their past life cycle stages their adaptability is time varying during the entire life cycle poff and zimmerman 2010 greet et al 2011 when considering a species specific population established in the same germinating season the germination percentage and death rates will determine the scale of this same aged population over time for example seedlings may successfully colonize at a site with favorable groundwater supply and develop to a persistent vegetation cover or they may occasionally sprout but fail to survive for the next unacceptable groundwater level balke et al 2014 as a result the seedling population may develop or shrink nevertheless a population composed of mature individuals will reduce its size under detrimental disturbances therefore the life cycle of the same aged population can be divided into two sequential phases the population forming phase pfp and the population declining phase pdp with the transition point at the end of seedling establishment stage fig 1 during the pfp plants sprout from seeds or cuttings and then try to colonize at a site the population will expand if the rising or falling of the groundwater table does not exceed the threshold determined by the organismic ecological niche sibly and hone 2002 naumburg et al 2005 otherwise the population will shrink at the end of the seedling establishment season successfully colonized seedlings begin to grow and enter the next stage of their life cycle and no more individuals will sprout in the population and then the population enters into the pdp individuals in the pdp will go through the remaining life stages from growth to age until they are totally destroyed under extreme groundwater conditions the tolerance of individuals to unfavorable groundwater table displays a nonmonotonic change it will increase as plants growing and decrease as plants aging merritt et al 2010 based on the randomness of groundwater supply variation we formulate the pfp and the pdp as stochastic processes driven by groundwater variation for mathematical simplification there are several assumptions in the model first the species abundance is much smaller than the environmental capacity which is normally determined by macro scale factors such as the climate zone soil nutrient supply and vegetation adaptability second the model neglected morphology changes because the time scale of morphology adjustments is normally much larger than that of vegetation dynamics merritt et al 2010 third because the subsystems of each species is considered to be far from an equilibrium state the model does not take into account the inter species competition yet see also thuiller et al 2015 therefore two stochastic differential equations can describe the two sequential phases respectively in the model growth rate is the unifying response variable that links the population dynamics and groundwater variation sibly and hone 2002 the gdv favors a moderate groundwater level in the saturated soil near plant roots fig 2 sperry et al 1998 cooper et al 2003 naumburg et al 2005 this corresponds to a species specific intrinsic growth rate of the population departures of the groundwater table from the moderate level will always affect this intrinsic growth rate negatively let h represent the fluctuating groundwater table fig 2 and Œ∑ represent favorable groundwater level for the plants of particular species the stochastic fluctuation of h drives the gdv dynamics in different ways in the pfp and pdp we take n 1 and n 2 as the normalized abundances of a specific same aged population at the pfp and pdp respectively the pfp is described mathematically according to the following logistic equation hunt et al 1982 1 n 1 r h n 1 1 n 1 where r h represents the random growth rate affected by the groundwater table h when the groundwater table departures from the favorable level the growth rate will decrease let the variable Œª represent the intrinsic growth rate that corresponds to the favorable groundwater table Œ∑ both Œª and Œ∑ are determined by the species specific organismic ecological niche introduce a sensitivity coefficient a f and a non negative metric function d of divergence between h and Œ∑ r can be written as follows 2 r h Œª a f d h Œ∑ for the pdp the intrinsic growth rate Œª becomes zero and the population scale would shrink friedman and auble 1999 lytle and merritt 2004 with a negative growth rate r which is modeled as follows 3 n 2 r h n 2 where r h a d d h Œ∑ a d 0 is the sensitivity coefficient in pdp the factors that can influence the sensitivity coefficients a f and a d are listed in table 3 the sensitivity coefficient a f is assumed to be a constant because of the relatively short duration of pfp and the scale of the population displays significant and rapid variation its value could be fitted according to the observation data of groundwater level and population abundance in the pfp during the pdp the mature individuals can generally resist greater flood inundation than younger ones and the roots of mature individuals allow them to tap deeper groundwater therefore the sensitivity coefficient a d is no longer constant but it is assumed to be a time varying variable considering both the growing and the senescence processes it could be represented as follows 4 a d t a b t ce dt where term a is a necessary intercept for the continuity between a f and a d term b t describes the sensitivity reducing in as plant growing and term c exp dt models the senescence process of vegetation allman and rhodes 2004 a d t f is set equal to a f for the continuity at time t f the transition point from pfp to pdp the continuity together with three other conditions as follows 1 the turning point or age of the plant growth process at which the plant begins to senesce from growing 2 the minimum sensitivity of mature individuals and 3 the velocity of the aging process of a specific species can be used to determine the parameters a b c and d fig 3 these conditions can be calibrated according to history investigation data or plant growth model e g jabowa for the forest growth botkin et al 1972 nanson and beach 1977 pearlstine et al 1985 botkin et al 1972 gave a growth model jabowa with complete model parameters for some forest species so that typical growth curves of these species could be plotted based on the jabowa model table 2 presents typical growth limit values of several species the coefficients of sensitivity a d are calculated according to parameters of jabowa we can see great differences of the coefficients among these species these differences correspond to the great species difference in their growth and morphological characteristics the divergency metric function d should be convex function with its minimum value 0 at point h Œ∑ in order to make it meaningful we adopt a quadratic divergence metric function in the stem as follows 5 d h Œ∑ h Œ∑ 2 which is also adopted in other ecological models phipps 1979 pearlstine et al 1985 camporeale and ridolfi 2006 the fluctuation of the groundwater table h is affected by various physical processes including precipitation evaporation surface and underground runoff human extractions and river regulation etc poff and zimmerman 2010 these processes are hardly traced precisely therefore we treat the fluctuation of h as a stochastic process h t the probability density function pdf fig 2 and time correlation function of h are the most two important functions required to characterize the stochastic process h t because the factors driving the groundwater table fluctuations are multi faceted and independent the interacting mechanisms between those factors are complex we assume a gaussian distribution for h in the stem the non stationarity of the fluctuation is also reflected by the changes of probability distribution and time correlation function the variables including the mean variance and correlation time can be used to characterize this stochastic process and they can also be easily calibrated through field investigation the order of mean and standard deviation are generally 100 to several 101 m orellana et al 2012 and the time scale of the fluctuation is typically 100 102 days richter et al 1996 balke et al 2014 however the time scale of gdv temporal dynamics generally ranges from several days to several months for the pfp and 100 102 years camporeale et al 2013 for the pdp therefore there are two cases must be distinguished according to the temporal correlation when modeling the coupling between the groundwater fluctuation and gdv dynamics when the groundwater table changes faster than the vegetation abundance the temporal correlation of the groundwater fluctuations can be neglected thus h could be considered as a gaussian white noise process this simplification is applicable during both the pfp and pdp for some slowly growing species under rapidly fluctuating groundwater tables if the groundwater table varies more slowly than the vegetation the temporal correlation cannot be neglected then an ornstein uhlenbeck process is normally used to model slowly varying stochastic process with non negligible temporal correlations and it also can be used to describe the fluctuation of the groundwater table van den broeck 1983 this case is only applicable during the pfp when there are ordinarily several orders of magnitude of difference between the temporal scales of groundwater fluctuations and flourishing young population representing the correlation time as œÑ c h t can be written as follows 6 h t Œº œÉ e Œ± t b e 2 Œ± t where Œ± 1 œÑ c and b represents a standard brownian motion the solution processes of eqs 1 and 3 can be obtained using the theory of stochastic differential equations then the spatial temporal dynamics of vegetation could be described by the processes 2 2 stochastic process description of the same aged population dynamics population dynamics generally starts from the occasionally germinated seedlings which corresponds to a small positive initial value of eq 1 n 1 0 œµ then the population enters the pfp n 1 t describes the changes of abundance in pfp with time at the end of the pfp n 1 t f represents the abundance of this successfully colonized population at time t f then the population enters the pdp until it disappears and n 2 t is used to describe the population abundance in pdp for the connectivity n 2 t f is set to equal to n 1 t f the stochastic process solutions of both eqs 1 and 3 describe the evolution of this same aged population from the solutions we can get the probability distribution of the abundance versus the characteristics of groundwater fluctuation and time for convenience let Œº and œÉ 2 represent the mean and variance of h respectively and introduce two new variables h t h t Œº and Œº Œº Œ∑ where h t represents the fluctuating part of the groundwater level and becomes a zero mean gaussian process Œº represents the average divergency between the actual and favorable groundwater level then eqs 1 and 3 can be rewritten as follows 7 n 1 Œª a f h Œº 2 n 1 1 n 1 8 n 2 a d t h Œº 2 n 2 substituting the variables m 1 ln n 1 ln 1 n 1 and m 2 ln n 2 and expanding the right sides of both equations as power series of h eqs 7 and 8 could be written as follows m 1 Œª a f h 2 2 Œº h Œº 2 m 2 a d t h 2 2 Œº h Œº 2 solution of the stochastic differential equation are dependent on calculating rules van kampen 1981 risken 1989 stratonovich rule is appointed here because of the clear physical meaning of h t according to the theory of stochastic processes about the quadratic variation process h 2 dt there is h 2 dt œÉ 2 t a s so that we have 9 m 1 Œª a f œÉ 2 Œº 2 2 a f Œº h 10 m 2 a d t œÉ 2 Œº 2 2 a d t Œº h which are some form of langevin equations with constant drift and diffusion coefficients in pfp and constant drift but time varying diffusion coefficient in pdp the pdf of m 1 and m 2 can be solved from corresponding fokker plank equations from eqs 9 and 10 we can infer that pdfs of m 1 and m 2 are still gaussian so that the probability characteristics of n 1 and n 2 can be obtained through inverse transformation between n i t and m i t i 1 2 the detailed description of the solutions are given in appendix a for the case that œÑ c is negligible and in appendix b for the case that œÑ c is nonnegligible 3 results from the solution processes of eqs 9 and 10 the theoretical description of gdv distribution patterns can be deduced 3 1 species abundance because expansion of population scale only occurs in pfp the changes of abundance n 1 t with time in the pfp will determine the population scale in the remaining life stages for the cases where œÑ c is negligible because the pdf of intermediate variable m 1 t is gaussian its mean Œº m 1 and variance œÉ m 1 2 are time varying and can be written as follows Œº m 1 m 0 Œª a f œÉ 2 Œº 2 t œÉ m 1 2 4 a f 2 œÉ 2 Œº 2 t so that the pdf of n 1 t fig 4 can be obtained as follows 11 p n 1 t c n 1 1 n 1 exp 1 2 œÉ m 1 2 ln n 1 1 n 1 Œº m 1 2 where m 0 ln œµ 1 œµ is the initial value of m 1 t c is an integral constant to keep p n 1 t normalized in fact p n 1 t represents a logit normal distribution which is inclined left relative to the log normal probability distribution from eq 11 the large Œº and œÉ 2 will both decrease the average growth rate r 1 Œª a f Œº 2 œÉ 2 whether the species generally adapts to the groundwater level at specific location during the pfp depends on the sign of the average growth rate if one species has a positive average growth rate in pfp seedlings population of it will develop to a greater scale with high probability at the end of the pfp the population 1 and 2 in fig 4 otherwise if the population has a negative average growth rate it has little possibility to survive in the pfp the population 3 in fig 4 although some seedlings had germinated fortunately at initial time the expression of p n 1 t shows that œÉ and Œº play similar roles in shaping the pdf of population abundance when the groundwater table experiences a rapid alteration relative to the temporal evolution of the seedling population if the groundwater level changes slowly so that the correlation time cannot be neglected the correlation time œÑ c of groundwater fluctuation has an added effect on the probability distribution of population abundance the non negligible correlation time has no effect on the mean of m 1 t but only adds its variance see eq b 1 however because of the nonlinear transformation between n 1 t and m 1 t both the mean and variance of n 1 t will increase because of the existence of œÑ c the nonnegligible correlation time œÑ c makes the pdf of abundance flatter than the negligible one fig 5 b this reflects positive effects of the groundwater fluctuations on the vegetation distribution the reason is that if the population is given more opportunities to survive current groundwater level it also gets more opportunities survive the future worse groundwater level the effect on the variance is just generally more significantly than that on mean fig 5a meanwhile if œÑ c is not negligible œÉ and Œº are not symmetric in the final solution the result that œÉ contributes additional terms to œÉ m 1 2 uner the effects of œÑ c and increases both mean and variance of n 1 t indicates that temporal variation in the groundwater supply will induce good vegetation distribution probably if the absolute disadvantage groundwater level exist it will also support the function of proper anthropogenic regulations of the groundwater and flow regime on the distribution of gdv and this gives two probable ways to develop the gdv population that is regulating the groundwater supply and keeping it in the proper scope as long as the vegetation needs in specific season if the total groundwater quantity is limited gherardi and sala 2015 draw a similar conclusion through a 6 year rainfall manipulation experiment the experiment shows that the relative abundance of rare plant is increased under the increased interannual precipitation variation and within season soil moisture variance then the plant diversity and functional diversity can be increased and the relative abundance increase of rare species are usually the first stage under anthropogenic disturbance 3 2 average vegetation lifespan and age structure after the seedling establishment season the survived individuals continue to grow up and the population enters declining phase eq 10 indicates that m 2 t is still a gaussian diffusion process with a decreasing mean and increasing variance over time if all of the individuals are deemed extinct and the population disappears when n 2 t is smaller than a lower limit n e for example one percent of œµ the time t d from the germination of seedlings to the eventual disappearance represents the lifespan of this population and the maximum age of the individuals within it from eqs 10 and a 2 m 2 t will randomly walk towards the lower limit ln n e from ln n 2 t f in the pdp so that t d is random variable and it has a complex probability distribution because of the time varying drift rates and diffusion coefficient fig 6 a shows the probability distribution of t d obtained using monte carlo method where pdf of t d looks like lognormal at part far away from the limit lifespan if we consider the mean of t d according to the idea of stopping time theory there is 12 m 2 t d m 2 t f œÉ 2 Œº 2 at b ln t c d exp dt t f t d where m 2 t d is in fact the lower limit ln n e then the average lifespan t d could be calculated using numerical solution methods fig 6b shows the relation between t d and metrics Œº and œÉ if the fluctuation process of groundwater level is steady during a long period at a vegetation plot the age structure of this species located at this area will be same as the decreasing tendency of abundance over time fig 7 illustrates the possible age structure under different average groundwater level and the shade belts represent corresponding 95 probability interval which is calculated according to the variance of m 2 t hence the drift and diffusion coefficients in eqs 9 and 10 also describe the temporal dynamics of population the mean value of population abundances displays a logarithmic decreasing tendency where the population lifespan is far from the natural max age the variance of n 2 t is increasing first and then decreasing for the inverse transformation from m 2 t see also nesslage et al 2016 3 3 vegetation spatial temporal dynamics eqs 9 and 10 imply that m 1 t and m 2 t involve brownian motions with drift mean over time these two random walk processes theoretically describe the spatial temporal dynamics of the same aged population at a local scale when the groundwater spatial distribution is combined the spatial dynamics of gdv can be investigated in a greater scale the groundwater regime is usually related to geographical position landform soil texture and sediments its space related characteristics therefore become Œº x y and œÉ 2 x y if the space coordinates are noted as x y the spatial dynamics induced by Œº x y and œÉ 2 x y will present different patterns of gdv distribution in the landforms although the relations of abundance and lifespan display similar single peak and monotonically decreasing tendencies respectively in Œº and œÉ dimensions see eqs 9 10 and 12 we assume a situation where the landscape is a downwards convex surface the center area has low altitude and edge has high altitude if there is a relatively horizontal groundwater level at this region the divergency Œº and variance œÉ 2 can still induce different vegetation patterns on the landscape first because the soil texture and sediments can hold water and block flow œÉ 2 is dependent on the thickness of soil layer generally it will decrease with the increase of soil layer thickness second about the divergency Œº there will be different cases according to the altitude of groundwater table in fig 8 a we illustrate four simulation cases for simplification œÉ 2 x y is set to an identical monotically decreasing tendency with the distance from center point in these cases the absolute value of Œº monotonically increase plot 1 or decrease at first and then increase plot 2 and 3 or monotonically decrease plot 4 respectively with the soil thickness increases the first case corresponds to a arid or semiarid regions the forth one corresponds to a humid region and the other two lie between them the abundance and lifespan corresponding to the combinations of different Œº x y and œÉ 2 x y are showed in fig 8b and c the population of 1 and 4 display monotically decrease and increase tendencies respectively the population of 2 and 3 display first increase and then decrease tendencies but the change rates show great different this is because the vegetation distribution is related to the value of Œº x y 2 œÉ 2 x y which will display different patterns from Œº and œÉ 2 the field spatial distribution patterns may be more diverse because of the variety of geographic conditions such as landscapes and soil composition 4 discussion the stem focuses on how the same aged population of specific gdv species evolves in spatial and temporal dimensions under the coupling of groundwater fluctuation and population dynamics the assumption of gaussian distribution of the groundwater level is reasonable as the factors and processes driving groundwater variation are numerous and complex furthermore the capillary fringe in the soil plays a role of water uptake and conserving like the capacitor and inductor do for shot noises in the circuits and these shot noises are generally assumed to be gaussian white wozencraft and jacobs 1965 the soil and sediments also weakens the fluctuation of the groundwater in the direction perpendicular to the ground and underground runoff the probability density function of p n abundance derived from the stem displays logit normal which is left inclined relative to log normal when the population is far below its environmental capacity with the abundance n decreasing the pdf is gradually approaching log normal distribution although this result is obtained based on the population of the same age it also holds for the community that is comprised of the mixed age populations and even various species see also chave 2004 magurran 2007 besides the results also show how the population of the same age evolves over its entire lifetime through giving the mean and variance of its probability distribution there are few data on the lifespan distribution of gdv except for the age investigation of cottonwoods by mahoney and rood 1998 the survey data in mahoney and rood 1998 confirm the forth pattern of vegetation lifespan fig 8c presented by the stem the correlation time œÑ c of groundwater fluctuation increases the variance of population distribution the result can be interpreted that the larger correlation time represents longer duration of favorable or unfavorable groundwater level therefore the probabilities of small and large abundance of the population would increase in spite that the mean of abundance may remain unchanged the increased probability of large abundance help the population survive under disadvantageous groundwater level the variance of groundwater fluctuation contributes supplementary term to the variance of population abundance this result supports the role of anthropogenic water regulation on the vegetation recovery and conservation in other words the model shows that it is possible to restore vegetation cover through artificially regulation if the younger population such as seedlings with low tolerance got favorable groundwater supply in the particular season through the water resources scheduling the population abundance might increase significantly according to the results of stem there are two important points must be concerned first a higher ground surface elevation does not obviously induce a larger divergency between the required and actual groundwater water table the existence of capillary fringe will resist part of the widening gap between elevating landscape and the groundwater level second the groundwater variation is also weakened by the soil and sediments as their thickness increases therefore the parameters Œº and œÉ 2 are linked to the geomorphology features or the geographical coordinates they should be studied adequately in the application of the stem modelling besides other environmental parameters also have effects on the gdv growing table 3 summarizes the direct and indirect factors that may influence the sensitivity coefficients these include most properties of groundwater supply and gdv distribution with the exception of external factors imposed on vegetation and changes in landforms the intrinsic growth rate and sensitivity coefficients could be estimated and fitted from field data sibly and hone 2002 lite et al 2005 nesslage et al 2016 previous studies of gdv systems have included a large quantity of water vegetation interaction data and most of them are based on the individual physiological requirement model however building a complete data set of the vegetation population based on samples from various locations is always difficult and time consuming here the stem uses macroscopic parameters to interpret many field investigations in the previous studies these parameters are easy estimated from the field investigation the stem derives similar tendencies between the abundance and lifespan the definition and implication of t d reflect this similarity the abundance describes the distribution in spatial dimension as well as the the age structure in temporal dimension t d represents the time span from the emerging of a population to its vanishment 5 conclusion this study aims to model the gdv dynamics under the random groundwater variations induced by natural and anthropogenic factors we propose an explicit and theoretical framework in which two sequential stochastic processes are adopted to describe the population evolution as a unifying link variable between groundwater fluctuation and gdv the population growth rate is modeled as a random variable its intrinsic part is determined by the macro environmental conditions and the randomly varying part is determined by groundwater variation the stem describes the groundwater table fluctuations and the gdv dynamics as stochastic processes this method allows the analytical expression and theoretical analysis of the gdv dynamics and the results reveal the consistency between different distribution patterns induced by groundwater variation it can be used for vegetation dynamics simulation or prediction when the parameters are calibrated based on the field data the stem also adapts to the cases of non stationary groundwater variations because of the markov property of stochastic differential equations the non stationary groundwater variations are generally induced by the seasonal or annual variations of the groundwater recharge the climate changes and the human activities when the groundwater table variation displays significant non stationarity we can divide this non stationary stochastic process into several stationary parts and then use the stem method to analyze the whole gdv dynamics with the continuity guaranteed the novelty of this work lies in a the stochastic processes based description of the groundwater variations and population evolution with the analysis of pdf and correlation time of the variations b the consideration of the time varying sensitivity of gdv during their entire life cycle c the explicit theoretical framework and its capability to describe both spatial and temporal dynamics of the gdv distribution and d its applicability to non stationary cases the model is also open to hydrological and vegetation growth models to improve its applicability authors contributions xiaoguang you and

25270,the composition abundance and age structure of groundwater dependent vegetation gdv are tightly coupled with groundwater level variation modeling the space time dynamics of gdv is valuable for ecosystem conservation and recovery but there are few modeling frameworks on gdv space time dynamics in this study we propose a stochastic process based theoretical framework and develop a species specific theoretical evolution model stem to analyze and simulate gdv dynamics in the model the groundwater level variation is described as stochastic processes based on this method the temporal dimension of vegetation dynamics is involved the model focuses on the life cycle of same aged population and divides this life cycle into two evolution phases each phase is formulated with a stochastic differential equation respectively the solution processes interpret the probability distributions of gdv and the plot wised model application in a certain geomorphology area derives different typical distribution patterns for the population abundance and lifespan the results also reveal the positive effects of water regulations on vegetation restoration this framework describes the spatial temporal dynamics of gdv rather than providing a stationary solution it can adapt to the non stationarity of groundwater level variations and distinctive sensitivity during the plants life cycle because of the markov property of stochastic equations the model can also help to predict vegetation responses under the groundwater level variations keywords vegetation dynamics theoretical model groundwater fluctuations probability distribution life span 1 introduction in ecosystem groundwater dependent vegetation gdv uptake water from both soil moisture and groundwater system naumburg et al 2005 lowry and loheide 2010 groundwater level variations are controlled by natural environmental impacts and human activities as an important part of an ecosystem gow et al 2016 the abundance age structure and evolution of gdv community closely coupled with groundwater supply understanding the distribution and dynamics of gdv is necessary for sustainable management and maintenance of healthy ecosystems naumburg et al 2005 eamus et al 2015 gow et al 2016 the processes and mechanisms of groundwater vegetation interactions have attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years several conceptual models mckenney et al 1995 naumburg et al 2005 merritt et al 2010 baird et al 2005 and experimental methods cale et al 2013 xin et al 2013 sprenger et al 2016 have been developed to analyze the groundwater vegetation interactions generally groundwater table departure from the favorable level will impact the gdv growth negatively naumburg et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 eamus et al 2015 a decreasing groundwater table often increases water stress or the water potential gradient xylem cavitation will occur and plants will lose some branches and leaves as a response to the inadequate groundwater supply in the root area eamus et al 2015 while an excessively rising groundwater table may result in root anoxia bogino and jobb√°gy 2011 the photosynthetic activity of whole plants will thus decrease naumburg et al 2005 you et al 2015 if the groundwater level lies in an acceptable range plants can maintain metabolic activities through the redistribution of roots scott et al 2000 reducing the transpiration of branches and leaves smith and nowak 1990 forming aerenchyma cronk and fennessy 2001 to adapt to the groundwater variation but the growth rate of plants will decrease and some species may become dormant mensforth and walker 1996 otherwise when the groundwater table exceeds an upper or lower threshold of tolerance plants will experience mortality except for the negative responses of plant such as root mortality or reduced reproduction floods can also positively influence gdv by creating new germination sites delivering woody debris and spreading propagules bertoldi et al 2011 gurnell et al 2012 the water vegetation interactions are hard to trace and model precisely or completely on the one hand too many factors can jointly drive the groundwater table variation such as climate changes surface or underground runoff natural evaporation and groundwater extraction by human eamus et al 2015 on the other hand the quantification of water use by gdv remains unresolved due to the complexity of plant responses sibly and hone 2002 naumburg et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 eamus et al 2015 nevertheless variations of the groundwater level display significant random and non stationary fluctuations under natural and anthropogenic disturbances orellana et al 2012 eamus et al 2015 tron et al 2015 vesipa et al 2015 the gdv distribution also shows great randomness because it is closely coupled with the groundwater variation furthermore the water requirements of plants are time varying because the plants physiological properties will change during the life cycle in general mature plants are better able to withstand the flood inundation and survive low groundwater table than young plants friedman and auble 1999 lytle and merritt 2004 but seeds have more rigorous requirements for their germination furthermore seedling establishment usually occurs during specific seasons in which suitable soil moisture or groundwater levels emerge it is a critical life history stage that determines the scale of vegetation recovery or succession however there have been few specialized studies on the coupled mechanisms between plant life history and non stationary fluctuations of the depth to groundwater except for some conceptual or qualitative studies mahoney and rood 1998 magurran 2007 greet et al 2011 balke et al 2014 numerous models have concerned the stochastic properties of gdv distribution including the maximum information entropy maxent principle in ecology and the neutral theory hubbell 1997 chave 2004 the maxent principle in ecology harte et al 2008 described some macro scale distribution patterns in the forms of the species area relationships and the distribution of species abundance with the aid of macro metrics constraints on the vegetation community these metrics contain the mean number of individuals the total energy requirements and the spatial abundance maxent s theoretical conclusions were verified with tests on the macro ecology level harte and newman 2014 xiao et al 2015 the essential assumption of neutral theory is that all individuals in a community are equivalent with respect to random reproduction and death in the evolution of the vegetation community this gives rise to a birth and death process a specific stochastic process in modeling the formation mechanisms of species distribution patterns on a local scale there are some specific stochastic process methods used to analyze the riparian vegetation distribution under an altered river flow regime which is assumed to be the main driving factor of riparian vegetation dynamics camporeale and ridolfi 2006 magurran 2007 perucca et al 2007 merritt et al 2010 orellana et al 2012 tron et al 2015 most of the theoretical models derive limit form solutions in temporal or statistical sense which represent the stationary or quasi steady states of ecosystem table 1 the conclusions hence interpret a macroscopic spatial distribution but the temporal dynamics of gdv is seldom described the inherent non stationarity and seasonality of disturbances have been paid minimal consideration the statistical analysis that normally need large sample data does not reflect the spatial temporal dynamics of vegetation either in this article we propose a theoretical framework and a stochastic process based minimalistic model named the species specific theoretical evolution model stem to analyze and simulate the spatial temporal dynamics of gdv induced by the groundwater table fluctuations the stem is on the basis of stochastic process description of the coupling between groundwater fluctuation and vegetation dynamics it focuses on the evolution process of a same aged plant population rather than mix aged plant community and finally we concern the probability distribution of abundance rather than the quantification of physiological responses and groundwater use of plant individuals in the study to model the evolution process we divide the life cycle of the plant population into two sequential growth phases according to the time varying growth rate of plants population so that the spatial and temporal dynamics of gdv can be described simultaneously without omitting the time dimension the probability distribution of population abundance obtained from the stem could interpret some vegetation patterns observed from field investigation the markov property of stochastic differential equations in the stem allows the non stationary groundwater fluctuations involved in both seasonal and annual alterations to be easily dealt with if the parameters are calibrated by sample data computer simulation of gdv dynamics is also feasible taking advantage of the stem 2 methods 2 1 model development the gdv has a tendency to adapt to the groundwater supplies during their past life cycle stages their adaptability is time varying during the entire life cycle poff and zimmerman 2010 greet et al 2011 when considering a species specific population established in the same germinating season the germination percentage and death rates will determine the scale of this same aged population over time for example seedlings may successfully colonize at a site with favorable groundwater supply and develop to a persistent vegetation cover or they may occasionally sprout but fail to survive for the next unacceptable groundwater level balke et al 2014 as a result the seedling population may develop or shrink nevertheless a population composed of mature individuals will reduce its size under detrimental disturbances therefore the life cycle of the same aged population can be divided into two sequential phases the population forming phase pfp and the population declining phase pdp with the transition point at the end of seedling establishment stage fig 1 during the pfp plants sprout from seeds or cuttings and then try to colonize at a site the population will expand if the rising or falling of the groundwater table does not exceed the threshold determined by the organismic ecological niche sibly and hone 2002 naumburg et al 2005 otherwise the population will shrink at the end of the seedling establishment season successfully colonized seedlings begin to grow and enter the next stage of their life cycle and no more individuals will sprout in the population and then the population enters into the pdp individuals in the pdp will go through the remaining life stages from growth to age until they are totally destroyed under extreme groundwater conditions the tolerance of individuals to unfavorable groundwater table displays a nonmonotonic change it will increase as plants growing and decrease as plants aging merritt et al 2010 based on the randomness of groundwater supply variation we formulate the pfp and the pdp as stochastic processes driven by groundwater variation for mathematical simplification there are several assumptions in the model first the species abundance is much smaller than the environmental capacity which is normally determined by macro scale factors such as the climate zone soil nutrient supply and vegetation adaptability second the model neglected morphology changes because the time scale of morphology adjustments is normally much larger than that of vegetation dynamics merritt et al 2010 third because the subsystems of each species is considered to be far from an equilibrium state the model does not take into account the inter species competition yet see also thuiller et al 2015 therefore two stochastic differential equations can describe the two sequential phases respectively in the model growth rate is the unifying response variable that links the population dynamics and groundwater variation sibly and hone 2002 the gdv favors a moderate groundwater level in the saturated soil near plant roots fig 2 sperry et al 1998 cooper et al 2003 naumburg et al 2005 this corresponds to a species specific intrinsic growth rate of the population departures of the groundwater table from the moderate level will always affect this intrinsic growth rate negatively let h represent the fluctuating groundwater table fig 2 and Œ∑ represent favorable groundwater level for the plants of particular species the stochastic fluctuation of h drives the gdv dynamics in different ways in the pfp and pdp we take n 1 and n 2 as the normalized abundances of a specific same aged population at the pfp and pdp respectively the pfp is described mathematically according to the following logistic equation hunt et al 1982 1 n 1 r h n 1 1 n 1 where r h represents the random growth rate affected by the groundwater table h when the groundwater table departures from the favorable level the growth rate will decrease let the variable Œª represent the intrinsic growth rate that corresponds to the favorable groundwater table Œ∑ both Œª and Œ∑ are determined by the species specific organismic ecological niche introduce a sensitivity coefficient a f and a non negative metric function d of divergence between h and Œ∑ r can be written as follows 2 r h Œª a f d h Œ∑ for the pdp the intrinsic growth rate Œª becomes zero and the population scale would shrink friedman and auble 1999 lytle and merritt 2004 with a negative growth rate r which is modeled as follows 3 n 2 r h n 2 where r h a d d h Œ∑ a d 0 is the sensitivity coefficient in pdp the factors that can influence the sensitivity coefficients a f and a d are listed in table 3 the sensitivity coefficient a f is assumed to be a constant because of the relatively short duration of pfp and the scale of the population displays significant and rapid variation its value could be fitted according to the observation data of groundwater level and population abundance in the pfp during the pdp the mature individuals can generally resist greater flood inundation than younger ones and the roots of mature individuals allow them to tap deeper groundwater therefore the sensitivity coefficient a d is no longer constant but it is assumed to be a time varying variable considering both the growing and the senescence processes it could be represented as follows 4 a d t a b t ce dt where term a is a necessary intercept for the continuity between a f and a d term b t describes the sensitivity reducing in as plant growing and term c exp dt models the senescence process of vegetation allman and rhodes 2004 a d t f is set equal to a f for the continuity at time t f the transition point from pfp to pdp the continuity together with three other conditions as follows 1 the turning point or age of the plant growth process at which the plant begins to senesce from growing 2 the minimum sensitivity of mature individuals and 3 the velocity of the aging process of a specific species can be used to determine the parameters a b c and d fig 3 these conditions can be calibrated according to history investigation data or plant growth model e g jabowa for the forest growth botkin et al 1972 nanson and beach 1977 pearlstine et al 1985 botkin et al 1972 gave a growth model jabowa with complete model parameters for some forest species so that typical growth curves of these species could be plotted based on the jabowa model table 2 presents typical growth limit values of several species the coefficients of sensitivity a d are calculated according to parameters of jabowa we can see great differences of the coefficients among these species these differences correspond to the great species difference in their growth and morphological characteristics the divergency metric function d should be convex function with its minimum value 0 at point h Œ∑ in order to make it meaningful we adopt a quadratic divergence metric function in the stem as follows 5 d h Œ∑ h Œ∑ 2 which is also adopted in other ecological models phipps 1979 pearlstine et al 1985 camporeale and ridolfi 2006 the fluctuation of the groundwater table h is affected by various physical processes including precipitation evaporation surface and underground runoff human extractions and river regulation etc poff and zimmerman 2010 these processes are hardly traced precisely therefore we treat the fluctuation of h as a stochastic process h t the probability density function pdf fig 2 and time correlation function of h are the most two important functions required to characterize the stochastic process h t because the factors driving the groundwater table fluctuations are multi faceted and independent the interacting mechanisms between those factors are complex we assume a gaussian distribution for h in the stem the non stationarity of the fluctuation is also reflected by the changes of probability distribution and time correlation function the variables including the mean variance and correlation time can be used to characterize this stochastic process and they can also be easily calibrated through field investigation the order of mean and standard deviation are generally 100 to several 101 m orellana et al 2012 and the time scale of the fluctuation is typically 100 102 days richter et al 1996 balke et al 2014 however the time scale of gdv temporal dynamics generally ranges from several days to several months for the pfp and 100 102 years camporeale et al 2013 for the pdp therefore there are two cases must be distinguished according to the temporal correlation when modeling the coupling between the groundwater fluctuation and gdv dynamics when the groundwater table changes faster than the vegetation abundance the temporal correlation of the groundwater fluctuations can be neglected thus h could be considered as a gaussian white noise process this simplification is applicable during both the pfp and pdp for some slowly growing species under rapidly fluctuating groundwater tables if the groundwater table varies more slowly than the vegetation the temporal correlation cannot be neglected then an ornstein uhlenbeck process is normally used to model slowly varying stochastic process with non negligible temporal correlations and it also can be used to describe the fluctuation of the groundwater table van den broeck 1983 this case is only applicable during the pfp when there are ordinarily several orders of magnitude of difference between the temporal scales of groundwater fluctuations and flourishing young population representing the correlation time as œÑ c h t can be written as follows 6 h t Œº œÉ e Œ± t b e 2 Œ± t where Œ± 1 œÑ c and b represents a standard brownian motion the solution processes of eqs 1 and 3 can be obtained using the theory of stochastic differential equations then the spatial temporal dynamics of vegetation could be described by the processes 2 2 stochastic process description of the same aged population dynamics population dynamics generally starts from the occasionally germinated seedlings which corresponds to a small positive initial value of eq 1 n 1 0 œµ then the population enters the pfp n 1 t describes the changes of abundance in pfp with time at the end of the pfp n 1 t f represents the abundance of this successfully colonized population at time t f then the population enters the pdp until it disappears and n 2 t is used to describe the population abundance in pdp for the connectivity n 2 t f is set to equal to n 1 t f the stochastic process solutions of both eqs 1 and 3 describe the evolution of this same aged population from the solutions we can get the probability distribution of the abundance versus the characteristics of groundwater fluctuation and time for convenience let Œº and œÉ 2 represent the mean and variance of h respectively and introduce two new variables h t h t Œº and Œº Œº Œ∑ where h t represents the fluctuating part of the groundwater level and becomes a zero mean gaussian process Œº represents the average divergency between the actual and favorable groundwater level then eqs 1 and 3 can be rewritten as follows 7 n 1 Œª a f h Œº 2 n 1 1 n 1 8 n 2 a d t h Œº 2 n 2 substituting the variables m 1 ln n 1 ln 1 n 1 and m 2 ln n 2 and expanding the right sides of both equations as power series of h eqs 7 and 8 could be written as follows m 1 Œª a f h 2 2 Œº h Œº 2 m 2 a d t h 2 2 Œº h Œº 2 solution of the stochastic differential equation are dependent on calculating rules van kampen 1981 risken 1989 stratonovich rule is appointed here because of the clear physical meaning of h t according to the theory of stochastic processes about the quadratic variation process h 2 dt there is h 2 dt œÉ 2 t a s so that we have 9 m 1 Œª a f œÉ 2 Œº 2 2 a f Œº h 10 m 2 a d t œÉ 2 Œº 2 2 a d t Œº h which are some form of langevin equations with constant drift and diffusion coefficients in pfp and constant drift but time varying diffusion coefficient in pdp the pdf of m 1 and m 2 can be solved from corresponding fokker plank equations from eqs 9 and 10 we can infer that pdfs of m 1 and m 2 are still gaussian so that the probability characteristics of n 1 and n 2 can be obtained through inverse transformation between n i t and m i t i 1 2 the detailed description of the solutions are given in appendix a for the case that œÑ c is negligible and in appendix b for the case that œÑ c is nonnegligible 3 results from the solution processes of eqs 9 and 10 the theoretical description of gdv distribution patterns can be deduced 3 1 species abundance because expansion of population scale only occurs in pfp the changes of abundance n 1 t with time in the pfp will determine the population scale in the remaining life stages for the cases where œÑ c is negligible because the pdf of intermediate variable m 1 t is gaussian its mean Œº m 1 and variance œÉ m 1 2 are time varying and can be written as follows Œº m 1 m 0 Œª a f œÉ 2 Œº 2 t œÉ m 1 2 4 a f 2 œÉ 2 Œº 2 t so that the pdf of n 1 t fig 4 can be obtained as follows 11 p n 1 t c n 1 1 n 1 exp 1 2 œÉ m 1 2 ln n 1 1 n 1 Œº m 1 2 where m 0 ln œµ 1 œµ is the initial value of m 1 t c is an integral constant to keep p n 1 t normalized in fact p n 1 t represents a logit normal distribution which is inclined left relative to the log normal probability distribution from eq 11 the large Œº and œÉ 2 will both decrease the average growth rate r 1 Œª a f Œº 2 œÉ 2 whether the species generally adapts to the groundwater level at specific location during the pfp depends on the sign of the average growth rate if one species has a positive average growth rate in pfp seedlings population of it will develop to a greater scale with high probability at the end of the pfp the population 1 and 2 in fig 4 otherwise if the population has a negative average growth rate it has little possibility to survive in the pfp the population 3 in fig 4 although some seedlings had germinated fortunately at initial time the expression of p n 1 t shows that œÉ and Œº play similar roles in shaping the pdf of population abundance when the groundwater table experiences a rapid alteration relative to the temporal evolution of the seedling population if the groundwater level changes slowly so that the correlation time cannot be neglected the correlation time œÑ c of groundwater fluctuation has an added effect on the probability distribution of population abundance the non negligible correlation time has no effect on the mean of m 1 t but only adds its variance see eq b 1 however because of the nonlinear transformation between n 1 t and m 1 t both the mean and variance of n 1 t will increase because of the existence of œÑ c the nonnegligible correlation time œÑ c makes the pdf of abundance flatter than the negligible one fig 5 b this reflects positive effects of the groundwater fluctuations on the vegetation distribution the reason is that if the population is given more opportunities to survive current groundwater level it also gets more opportunities survive the future worse groundwater level the effect on the variance is just generally more significantly than that on mean fig 5a meanwhile if œÑ c is not negligible œÉ and Œº are not symmetric in the final solution the result that œÉ contributes additional terms to œÉ m 1 2 uner the effects of œÑ c and increases both mean and variance of n 1 t indicates that temporal variation in the groundwater supply will induce good vegetation distribution probably if the absolute disadvantage groundwater level exist it will also support the function of proper anthropogenic regulations of the groundwater and flow regime on the distribution of gdv and this gives two probable ways to develop the gdv population that is regulating the groundwater supply and keeping it in the proper scope as long as the vegetation needs in specific season if the total groundwater quantity is limited gherardi and sala 2015 draw a similar conclusion through a 6 year rainfall manipulation experiment the experiment shows that the relative abundance of rare plant is increased under the increased interannual precipitation variation and within season soil moisture variance then the plant diversity and functional diversity can be increased and the relative abundance increase of rare species are usually the first stage under anthropogenic disturbance 3 2 average vegetation lifespan and age structure after the seedling establishment season the survived individuals continue to grow up and the population enters declining phase eq 10 indicates that m 2 t is still a gaussian diffusion process with a decreasing mean and increasing variance over time if all of the individuals are deemed extinct and the population disappears when n 2 t is smaller than a lower limit n e for example one percent of œµ the time t d from the germination of seedlings to the eventual disappearance represents the lifespan of this population and the maximum age of the individuals within it from eqs 10 and a 2 m 2 t will randomly walk towards the lower limit ln n e from ln n 2 t f in the pdp so that t d is random variable and it has a complex probability distribution because of the time varying drift rates and diffusion coefficient fig 6 a shows the probability distribution of t d obtained using monte carlo method where pdf of t d looks like lognormal at part far away from the limit lifespan if we consider the mean of t d according to the idea of stopping time theory there is 12 m 2 t d m 2 t f œÉ 2 Œº 2 at b ln t c d exp dt t f t d where m 2 t d is in fact the lower limit ln n e then the average lifespan t d could be calculated using numerical solution methods fig 6b shows the relation between t d and metrics Œº and œÉ if the fluctuation process of groundwater level is steady during a long period at a vegetation plot the age structure of this species located at this area will be same as the decreasing tendency of abundance over time fig 7 illustrates the possible age structure under different average groundwater level and the shade belts represent corresponding 95 probability interval which is calculated according to the variance of m 2 t hence the drift and diffusion coefficients in eqs 9 and 10 also describe the temporal dynamics of population the mean value of population abundances displays a logarithmic decreasing tendency where the population lifespan is far from the natural max age the variance of n 2 t is increasing first and then decreasing for the inverse transformation from m 2 t see also nesslage et al 2016 3 3 vegetation spatial temporal dynamics eqs 9 and 10 imply that m 1 t and m 2 t involve brownian motions with drift mean over time these two random walk processes theoretically describe the spatial temporal dynamics of the same aged population at a local scale when the groundwater spatial distribution is combined the spatial dynamics of gdv can be investigated in a greater scale the groundwater regime is usually related to geographical position landform soil texture and sediments its space related characteristics therefore become Œº x y and œÉ 2 x y if the space coordinates are noted as x y the spatial dynamics induced by Œº x y and œÉ 2 x y will present different patterns of gdv distribution in the landforms although the relations of abundance and lifespan display similar single peak and monotonically decreasing tendencies respectively in Œº and œÉ dimensions see eqs 9 10 and 12 we assume a situation where the landscape is a downwards convex surface the center area has low altitude and edge has high altitude if there is a relatively horizontal groundwater level at this region the divergency Œº and variance œÉ 2 can still induce different vegetation patterns on the landscape first because the soil texture and sediments can hold water and block flow œÉ 2 is dependent on the thickness of soil layer generally it will decrease with the increase of soil layer thickness second about the divergency Œº there will be different cases according to the altitude of groundwater table in fig 8 a we illustrate four simulation cases for simplification œÉ 2 x y is set to an identical monotically decreasing tendency with the distance from center point in these cases the absolute value of Œº monotonically increase plot 1 or decrease at first and then increase plot 2 and 3 or monotonically decrease plot 4 respectively with the soil thickness increases the first case corresponds to a arid or semiarid regions the forth one corresponds to a humid region and the other two lie between them the abundance and lifespan corresponding to the combinations of different Œº x y and œÉ 2 x y are showed in fig 8b and c the population of 1 and 4 display monotically decrease and increase tendencies respectively the population of 2 and 3 display first increase and then decrease tendencies but the change rates show great different this is because the vegetation distribution is related to the value of Œº x y 2 œÉ 2 x y which will display different patterns from Œº and œÉ 2 the field spatial distribution patterns may be more diverse because of the variety of geographic conditions such as landscapes and soil composition 4 discussion the stem focuses on how the same aged population of specific gdv species evolves in spatial and temporal dimensions under the coupling of groundwater fluctuation and population dynamics the assumption of gaussian distribution of the groundwater level is reasonable as the factors and processes driving groundwater variation are numerous and complex furthermore the capillary fringe in the soil plays a role of water uptake and conserving like the capacitor and inductor do for shot noises in the circuits and these shot noises are generally assumed to be gaussian white wozencraft and jacobs 1965 the soil and sediments also weakens the fluctuation of the groundwater in the direction perpendicular to the ground and underground runoff the probability density function of p n abundance derived from the stem displays logit normal which is left inclined relative to log normal when the population is far below its environmental capacity with the abundance n decreasing the pdf is gradually approaching log normal distribution although this result is obtained based on the population of the same age it also holds for the community that is comprised of the mixed age populations and even various species see also chave 2004 magurran 2007 besides the results also show how the population of the same age evolves over its entire lifetime through giving the mean and variance of its probability distribution there are few data on the lifespan distribution of gdv except for the age investigation of cottonwoods by mahoney and rood 1998 the survey data in mahoney and rood 1998 confirm the forth pattern of vegetation lifespan fig 8c presented by the stem the correlation time œÑ c of groundwater fluctuation increases the variance of population distribution the result can be interpreted that the larger correlation time represents longer duration of favorable or unfavorable groundwater level therefore the probabilities of small and large abundance of the population would increase in spite that the mean of abundance may remain unchanged the increased probability of large abundance help the population survive under disadvantageous groundwater level the variance of groundwater fluctuation contributes supplementary term to the variance of population abundance this result supports the role of anthropogenic water regulation on the vegetation recovery and conservation in other words the model shows that it is possible to restore vegetation cover through artificially regulation if the younger population such as seedlings with low tolerance got favorable groundwater supply in the particular season through the water resources scheduling the population abundance might increase significantly according to the results of stem there are two important points must be concerned first a higher ground surface elevation does not obviously induce a larger divergency between the required and actual groundwater water table the existence of capillary fringe will resist part of the widening gap between elevating landscape and the groundwater level second the groundwater variation is also weakened by the soil and sediments as their thickness increases therefore the parameters Œº and œÉ 2 are linked to the geomorphology features or the geographical coordinates they should be studied adequately in the application of the stem modelling besides other environmental parameters also have effects on the gdv growing table 3 summarizes the direct and indirect factors that may influence the sensitivity coefficients these include most properties of groundwater supply and gdv distribution with the exception of external factors imposed on vegetation and changes in landforms the intrinsic growth rate and sensitivity coefficients could be estimated and fitted from field data sibly and hone 2002 lite et al 2005 nesslage et al 2016 previous studies of gdv systems have included a large quantity of water vegetation interaction data and most of them are based on the individual physiological requirement model however building a complete data set of the vegetation population based on samples from various locations is always difficult and time consuming here the stem uses macroscopic parameters to interpret many field investigations in the previous studies these parameters are easy estimated from the field investigation the stem derives similar tendencies between the abundance and lifespan the definition and implication of t d reflect this similarity the abundance describes the distribution in spatial dimension as well as the the age structure in temporal dimension t d represents the time span from the emerging of a population to its vanishment 5 conclusion this study aims to model the gdv dynamics under the random groundwater variations induced by natural and anthropogenic factors we propose an explicit and theoretical framework in which two sequential stochastic processes are adopted to describe the population evolution as a unifying link variable between groundwater fluctuation and gdv the population growth rate is modeled as a random variable its intrinsic part is determined by the macro environmental conditions and the randomly varying part is determined by groundwater variation the stem describes the groundwater table fluctuations and the gdv dynamics as stochastic processes this method allows the analytical expression and theoretical analysis of the gdv dynamics and the results reveal the consistency between different distribution patterns induced by groundwater variation it can be used for vegetation dynamics simulation or prediction when the parameters are calibrated based on the field data the stem also adapts to the cases of non stationary groundwater variations because of the markov property of stochastic differential equations the non stationary groundwater variations are generally induced by the seasonal or annual variations of the groundwater recharge the climate changes and the human activities when the groundwater table variation displays significant non stationarity we can divide this non stationary stochastic process into several stationary parts and then use the stem method to analyze the whole gdv dynamics with the continuity guaranteed the novelty of this work lies in a the stochastic processes based description of the groundwater variations and population evolution with the analysis of pdf and correlation time of the variations b the consideration of the time varying sensitivity of gdv during their entire life cycle c the explicit theoretical framework and its capability to describe both spatial and temporal dynamics of the gdv distribution and d its applicability to non stationary cases the model is also open to hydrological and vegetation growth models to improve its applicability authors contributions xiaoguang you and

25271,pathogen transmission is a key process in epidemiology and its mathematical form plays a pivotal role when modeling pathogen spread much work has been devoted to the transmission function applied to a homogeneous population structure however between group transmission functions required when different groups are identified to account for a distinct epidemiological risk are much less documented the aim of this study is to detail the mathematical form of five between group transmission functions and to assess its influence on predictions in epidemiological modeling simulations with a two group model were carried out so as to generate prediction differences among between group transmission functions for a large range of situations defined by the within group transmission pattern the basic reproduction number the proportion of the whole transmission due to between group transmission and the ratio of population sizes pathogen spread simulations highlighted differences in prevalence among four transmission functions frequency dependent density dependent and functions representing either a temporary mixing or a proportion of visitors exposed to infectious individuals the differences could be seen either in long term or in transient simulated dynamics the fifth one representing limited interactions at a gate was shown to be equivalent to the density dependent function in our parametrization when keeping constant group sizes when considering population dynamics particularly with increasing group sizes this function and the density dependent one were shown to behave opposite from each other and to differ from the other functions this work highlights the need to carefully define the between group transmission function when modeling pathogen spread in a heterogeneous structure our work brings insight into the biological grounds that could guide the choice of such a function keywords epidemiology sir model heterogeneous population transmission population dynamics 1 introduction animal human as well as plant populations are structured in groups individuals generally having more contacts within their own group than with individuals from other groups such a contact structure results in multi group models and may arise because the population is structured by sex e g in wildlife during the non mating season beaun√©e et al 2015 by age e g in childhood diseases keeling and grenfell 1997 by physiological stages e g in livestock lurette et al 2008 spatially e g in plants with short and long distance dispersal sapoukhina et al 2010 or due to landscape heterogeneities smith et al 2002 or because of social interactions e g as related to human behavior funk et al 2010 accounting for population heterogeneity and structure is a central issue to predict pathogen spread it has received considerable attention in theoretical epidemiology over the last decades to cite only a few post et al 1983 dushoff and levin 1995 gudelj and white 2004 the impact of such a population structure on pathogen spread is controversial sometimes fastening sometimes reducing the spread keeling and rohani 2008 it is hard to evaluate especially i if individuals belonging to different groups have different levels of susceptibility and infectiousness e g in paratuberculosis in cattle where young animals are the most susceptible and adults the most infectious marc√© et al 2011 ii if there is a within group heterogeneity in individual infectiousness as for super shedding events lloyd smith et al 2005 and iii if contacts vary over space and time e g in vector borne diseases charron et al 2013 to better understand and predict pathogen spread within a structured population of hosts a modeling approach is appropriate and has been extensively used keeling and rohani 2008 ezanno et al 2012 riley 2007 a large number of papers concern pathogen spread on contact networks both in human and in animal populations keeling and eames 2005 danon et al 2011 dutta et al 2014 in these networks a node corresponds either to an individual or to a host population in a context of metapopulation jesse et al 2008 and a link corresponds to a contact between nodes however contacts between populations or groups of hosts also may occur through neighboring relationships because of airborne transmission ssematimba et al 2012 or because of host short go and return movements such as commuters working in a city and living in another one having contacts in both keeling and rohani 2008 moreno et al 2017 such contact patterns induce different interactions between groups in contact compared with individual movements as a contact then can be related to indirect transmission between groups for such an indirect transmission the function representing the force of infection is not straightforward leading to various definitions √∂gren and martin 2002 this is especially true in populations where between group contacts cannot be easily quantified edmunds et al 1997 tompkins et al 2011 therefore there is a need for a clearer definition of the biological meaning and implications of such between group functions as well as for the comparison of their impact on epidemiological model predictions the biological grounds that drive the choice of the within group transmission functions and the impact of such a choice on model predictions have largely been studied begon et al 2002 mccallum et al 2001 hoch et al 2008 murray 2009 some authors also compared within group transmission functions through the fitting to experimental data orlofske et al 2018 however such results can be only partly extended to the between group transmission issue firstly because epidemiological model outputs highly depend on the interactions between the groups secondly because the occurrence of between group contacts may arise from specific biological processes papers aiming at representing the spread of a specific pathogen in a given structured host population while using several between group functions and motivating their choice are very scarce √∂gren and martin 2002 performed simulations with several between group transmission functions in a model of an infection between airports they considered a fixed network of airports of constant size with empirically determined transmission parameters which prevents from a thorough comparison between functions our objective was therefore to compare the predictions of epidemiological models in structured populations among scenarios of between group transmission functions first functions encountered in the literature were reviewed and the biological assumptions that govern their use were described second simulations were compared for the different functions over a range of epidemiological characteristics in terms of basic reproduction number r 0 relative contribution of the between group transmission in r 0 computation within group transmission pattern and group size 2 methods 2 1 identification of between group transmission functions to investigate the influence of the mathematical form of between group transmission functions we chose to focus on transmission that occurs through direct contacts indirect transmission for instance through a common contaminated environment was therefore excluded from the analysis several mathematical forms for between group transmission functions are used in the literature both in theoretical and applied works they are summarized in table 1 the biological meaning of each of these functions is explained and illustrated thereafter in most cases especially for sake of simplicity the classical density dependent and frequency dependent transmission functions are used keeling and rohani 2002 gudelj and white 2004 if these two functions are equivalent when subgroups have the same fixed size it is not the case for groups of different or variable sizes a density dependent between group transmission hereafter called function d assumes that the contact rate with the group acting as the infection source is proportional to the density of individuals in this group such a function has largely been used for modeling the between herd spread of pathogens due to local animal or professional contacts durand et al 2004 noordegraaf et al 2000 barlow et al 1999 or contacts occurring only between groups such as between health care workers and patients in a hospital austin et al 1999 a density dependent function has also been used to represent between species transmission with specific infectivity for each species and assuming a homogeneous mixing riley et al 2008 a frequency dependent transmission hereafter called function f assumes that the contact rate is constant and does not depend on the size of the group acting as the infection source which is the case for instance for sexually transmissible diseases for the same number of infectious individuals the between group force of infection will be higher for small size receiving groups than for large size ones such a function has been widely used to model pathogen spread in a metapopulation keeling et al 2010 both in human e g varicella allen and thrasher 1998 sars bombardt 2006 hiv aids mukandavire et al 2009 influenza lunelli et al 2009 and in animal e g classical swine fever klinkenberg et al 2002 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome evans et al 2010 structured populations alternative functions are considered to represent other assumptions function v represents the case when a fraction of a group denoted by s i n i for instance doctors or other health care workers have contacts with infectious individuals i e the other group consists of patients potentially becoming infectious themselves here the size of the transmitting group has an effect on the risk of pathogen spread but not the one of the receiving group similarities with such a function can be found in vector borne diseases when the number of new cases in reservoir hosts does not depend on the size of this group function called reservoir frequency dependent by wonham et al 2006 function m is appropriate when the individuals of the two groups are temporarily mixed within a single one of total size n i n j and assuming a frequency dependent transmission this is the case for example when several host species manore et al 2011 or different social groups turner et al 2008 are interacting in a common area management group this function has been used also to estimate the between pen transmission of foot and mouth disease on experimental data ebl√© et al 2006 finally function g is employed when individuals from two different groups meet in an area whose access is limited for both groups such a function is particularly appropriate for modeling contacts between two groups of animals meeting at a gate or a barrier courcoul and ezanno 2010 viet et al 2004 √∂gren and martin 2002 actually in such a case the size of each group receiving or transmitting is not accounted for but only the proportions of susceptible and infectious individuals in each group such a function also can be used to represent the influence of travelers between subpopulations metcalf et al 2013 d agata et al 2007 2 2 the model to investigate the influence of different between group transmission functions we developed a simple sirs susceptible infectious removed susceptible model for a population divided into two groups interacting with each other the five between group transmission functions identified were taken into account d f v m and g representing five different scenarios the considered within group transmission functions were either frequency or density dependent transmission in order to first focus on the effect of transmission functions we began with a model that did not include demography and the population size was kept constant in each group so r i n i s i i i equations in group i i 1 or 2 are the following 1 ds i dt f w i x f b i y Œ≥ n i s i i i di i dt f w i x f b i y ŒΩ i i f w i x represents the within group transmission function which can be expressed as follows f w i f Œ≤ w f s i i i n i for frequency dependent transmission f w i d Œ≤ w d s i i i for density dependent transmission f b i y is the between group transmission function for group i with y corresponding to the considered function table 1 parameters Œ≤ w 1 Œ≥ and 1 ŒΩ represent respectively the within group transmission rate per time unit t u 1 and the durations of immunity and infectiousness periods t u between group transmission in group i from group j i j can be formalized by the following generic equation for all between group transmission functions except m 2 f b i y Œ≤ b i y s i i j and as follows for between group transmission function m 3 f b i m Œ≤ b i m s i i i i j where j represents the infecting group the between group transmission rate Œ≤ b i y depends on a rate specific to each transmission function and on group sizes n i and n j the basic reproduction number r 0 was calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix diekmann et al 1990 depending on the considered within group transmission function two cases were identified 2 2 1 frequency dependent within group transmission in this case the basic reproduction number is given by the following equation for all between group transmission functions except m 4 r 0 Œ≤ w f Œ≤ b a y Œ≤ b b y n 1 n 2 ŒΩ and as follows for between group transmission function m 5 r 0 Œ≤ w f Œ≤ b m ŒΩ let us denote by the basic reproductive number in the absence of between group transmission obtained by setting the between group transmission rates Œ≤ b 1 y Œ≤ b 2 y 0 to describe the contribution of the between group transmission to r 0 we define œÄ b as 6 the quantities œÄ b and 1 œÄ b give the proportions of r 0 due respectively to between group and within group transmission r 0 and œÄ b depend on the between group transmission function y however to facilitate the comparison between the different functions we set r 0 and œÄ b as parameters and reparametrize our equations accordingly from eqs 4 6 we can deduce the within group transmission rate as a function of ŒΩ r 0 and œÄ b for all between group transmission functions 7 Œ≤ w f r 0 1 œÄ b ŒΩ let r n 2 n 1 be the ratio between the two group sizes and n n 1 n 2 the total population size in the model all these sizes remain constant over time we are then able to express the between group transmission rate Œ≤ b i y in each group and for each scenario as a function of r 0 œÄ b r n and ŒΩ table 2 parameters r 0 œÄ b and r represent respectively the importance of the epidemic dynamics the between group contribution to transmission and the relative population sizes 2 2 2 density dependent within group transmission in this case the basic reproduction number is given by the following equation for all between group transmission functions except m 8 r 0 Œ≤ w d n 1 n 2 Œ≤ w d 2 n 1 n 2 2 4 Œ≤ b 1 y Œ≤ b 2 y n 1 n 2 2 ŒΩ and as follows for between group transmission function m 9 r 0 Œ≤ w d n 1 n 2 Œ≤ b m n 1 n 2 Œ≤ w d n 1 n 2 Œ≤ b m 2 n 1 n 2 2 4 Œ≤ b m 2 n 1 n 2 2 ŒΩ n 1 n 2 from eqs 8 9 and 6 we can deduce the density dependent within group transmission rate as a function of r 0 œÄ b r n and ŒΩ for all between group transmission functions 10 Œ≤ w d r 0 1 œÄ b ŒΩ 1 r n as shown in table 2 two between group functions d and g have the same transmission rates Œ≤ b 1 y and Œ≤ b 2 y with the new parametrization that is when r 0 œÄ b r n and ŒΩ are set this result can be generalized to all functions described by eq 2 that have the same transmission rates in both groups Œ≤ b 1 y Œ≤ b 2 y 2 3 equilibria for each transmission function the existence of a disease free equilibrium is trivial s 1 0 i 1 0 s 2 0 i 2 0 n 1 0 n 2 0 endemic equilibria were computed using maple software 1 1 maple software http www maplesoft com leading to the resolution of a degree 3 polynomial in i 2 see appendix a it produced untractable expressions except when within and between group functions are frequency dependent f for which we obtained the following values s 1 n 1 ŒΩ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f i 1 n 1 Œ≥ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f ŒΩ Œ≥ ŒΩ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f s 2 n 2 ŒΩ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f i 2 n 2 Œ≥ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f ŒΩ Œ≥ ŒΩ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f these quantities are positive when r 0 1 see table 2 and less than n 2 so they qualify for the endemic equilibrium the expressions for i 1 and i 2 imply that the prevalence at the endemic equilibrium is equal in both groups the remaining endemic equilibrium values were obtained numerically for the parameters used in the scenarios defined thereafter they were consistent with the simulation results see below 2 4 simulations with constant group size in addition to the calculation of equilibria numerical simulations were carried out to study the impact of between group transmission function on transient and long term behavior results were analyzed by studying the evolution of the prevalence which was investigated in the overall population and in both groups long term dynamics simulations were first carried out which allow us to verify results from equilibria analysis simulations were performed during 10 000 units of time so as to reach a quasi equilibrium for output variables they were initiated by considering one infectious individual in a fully susceptible group denoted thereafter as the primary case group long term simulations were carried out to assess the effect on prevalence of the four between group transmission functions corresponding to the functions given in table 1 except g which is equivalent to d for the two considered within group functions and for different values of the basic reproduction number r 0 the proportion of the transmission due to between group transmission œÄ b and the ratio of population sizes r n 2 n 1 without any loss of genericity we denoted by subscripts 1 and 2 respectively the large and the small groups so r 1 the remaining parameters Œ≥ 0 1 t u 1 and ŒΩ 0 05 t u 1 and the total population size n 1000 individuals were kept constant table 3 gives the values of the parameters considered from which the simulation design can be deduced the values for r 0 were chosen so as to test low middle and relatively high values no data are available in the literature to assess and give a plausible range of values for the contribution of between group transmission œÄ b we used therefore a large range of values in order to test a large number of possibilities parameter values for group size ratio r were also fixed for the same purpose apart from simulating the long term dynamics we also focused on the transient dynamics of prevalence depending on the pathogen considered the transient behavior of the infection dynamics could highly influence the type of control strategy to be implemented e g vaccination quarantine and the time available to control pathogen spread epidemic size and therefore the health damages and or the economic losses also could vary greatly with these short term dynamics we hypothesized that characteristics of the primary case group could have an influence on the transient dynamics of the infection as illustrated in fig 1 we carried out simulations where the primary case group differed and could be either the large or the small group therefore we investigated the transient behavior of the model by calculating the difference in prevalence Œ¥ for groups of the same size between simulations which differed according to the primary case group this difference was normalized by the prevalence value at equilibrium in the corresponding group k it results 11 Œ¥ p k t p k c t p k t p k where p k c t represents the prevalence p k c t i k t n k t in group k k s or l when this group represents the primary case group whereas p k t corresponds to the prevalence for the same group k when infection does not start in this group p k is the prevalence at equilibrium calculated numerically for the group k we chose a low value for the ratio of group sizes r 0 1 in order to have contrasting sizes simulations were performed using scilab software 2 2 scilab software http www scilab org differential equations were solved numerically thanks to adams method 2 5 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the influence of four factors between group transmission function r 0 œÄ b and r on the global prevalence at equilibrium which was calculated numerically only the transmission function f d and v were included in the analysis as f and m are asymptotically confounded the prevalence was expressed as a polynomial of these factors considering main effects and interactions as our simulations constitute a complete factorial experimental design we could estimate all the parameters of the polynomial with r software 3 3 r software http www r project org an anova was carried out between the overall prevalence and the four factors considering the three parameters as continuous variables and the transmission function as a discrete one for each factor a sensitivity index eq 12 was built that corresponds to the ratio between the variability explained by a factor i e the sum of squares related to this factor on the total sum of squares saltelli et al 2008 and expressed as a percentage 12 si x i ss x i ss t where ss x i and ss t represent respectively the sum of squares attached to concerned factor and the total sum of squares 2 6 influence of population dynamics in a sake for legibility we considered in the previous sections that group size was constant throughout the simulations with no birth and mortality processes included in the model however ignoring population dynamics may not be relevant for long term simulations some authors hoch et al 2008 show evidence of a distinct model behavior when considering constant or varying group sizes the population dynamics and fluctuating group sizes were accounted for by including birth and mortality rates in the equation system 1 following anderson and may 1979 mortality with a basal rate b and an infection related mortality rate Œº was similar in all groups whereas a birth rate a i whose value differs between groups was applied to all the individuals which give birth to susceptible the equation system 1 was therefore modified as follows 13 ds i dt a i n i f w i x f b i y Œ≥ r i b s i di i dt f w i x f b i y ŒΩ b Œº i i ds i dt ŒΩ i i Œ≥ b r i in such a system the equation for r 0 is the following when considering f d v and g between group transmission functions 14 r 0 Œ≤ w f Œ≤ b 1 y Œ≤ b 2 y n 1 n 2 b Œº ŒΩ similarly equation for function m is obtained by considering b Œº ŒΩ as the denominator in eq 5 the within and between group transmission rates were estimated accordingly in order to have identical r 0 values at the beginning of the simulations for each considered between group transmission function in order to disentangle the respective effects of population dynamics and of the initial group size difference we considered in this section that initial group sizes were equal i e r 1 we applied equation system 13 to two groups similarly as for the constant size case stable group sizes were obtained for the following parameter values a 1 a 2 0 01 t u 1 b 0 009 t u 1 and Œº 0 0025 t u 1 three cases were simulated a both groups increase a 1 a 2 0 0125 t u 1 b one of the groups increases while the other decreases a 1 0 0125 and a 2 0 0075 t u 1 and c one of the two groups increases while the other group size remains unchanged a 1 0 0125 t u 1 due to their initial equal sizes acting on either group would not change the results as they would behave symmetrically simulations were carried out with average respective values of 0 5 and 2 5 for œÄ b and r 0 3 results 3 1 long term dynamics fig 2 illustrates the overall prevalence over time for f d v and m for the two considered within group transmission functions we chose to use 0 1 for the ratio between group sizes r so as to have contrasted sizes when r increases to reach 1 prevalence differences diminish until they are confounded see appendix b results are similar whatever the considered within group transmission function equilibrium prevalence calculated at the end of the simulations for f d and v between group functions are ranked in the same order in both cases in particular the simulated prevalence with between group function f is much higher than with v approximately 0 4 versus 0 25 with d in between results for m differ slightly according to the considered within group function however this between group function depends on the number of infectious individuals in both groups which prevents from a strict comparison with other functions due to the identical simulated behavior between models with either within group function we chose to present only the frequency dependent function in the following sections simulations with density dependent within group function can be retrieved in appendix c the evolution of the prevalence in both groups for different values of r 0 and œÄ b is given in fig 3 as identified in section equilibria the equilibrium prevalence is the same in the two groups when using the f between group transmission function the continuous lines are confounded in fig 3 simulations with m are asymptotically confounded with results from f in contrast the simulated prevalence for d is higher in the small group and smaller in the large group compared with f this difference is even more striking with function v these differences could be explained by the expression of the generic transmission rate for each function table 2 when focusing on the largest group it arises that the values for Œ≤ b 1 y can be ranked in the following decreasing order f d v as within group transmission is identical whatever the between group transmission function this ranking of the transmission rate generates the simulated differences in the large group the reverse effect is simulated in the small group as expected for all curves the equilibrium is reached sooner as r 0 increases with higher simulated prevalences differences in prevalence between functions are also less marked for high r 0 at least for a low value of œÄ b increasing œÄ b and therefore the influence of the between group transmission leads to an increase in the differences between functions in the large group to a lesser extent in the small one 3 2 transient dynamics fig 4 highlights the difference in prevalence between groups of the same size but for different primary case groups see eq 11 at the beginning of simulations carried out with intermediate values of r 0 and œÄ b for the large group size the primary case generates less infectious individuals with function f and the difference in prevalence becomes rapidly negative this results from the use of a frequency dependent transmission function for both within and between group transmissions in this case within group force of infection is higher in the small group compared to the large group whereas between group force of infection is on the contrary higher in the large group therefore when the primary case occurs in the small group both processes interact leading to stronger infection dynamics in the large group compared to when the primary case occurs in the large one this feature is also found with function d to a lesser extent but not with functions m and v with the chosen parameter values the differences in prevalence for functions f and d reach a maximum value on around time unit 70 80 before declining to null value on approximately time unit 150 which constitutes the limit for the influence of the primary case 3 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed on the global prevalence at equilibrium with all factors simultaneously i e r 0 œÄ b r and between group transmission function from this analysis it results that the basic reproduction number r 0 plays a major role in the determination of the prevalence the variability explained by this factor reaches more than 90 of the total variability results not shown analyses were therefore carried out by differentiating r 0 values fig 5 see index values in appendix d in any case the model explains about 75 80 of the total variability in terms of main effects and regardless of r 0 value the ratio of group sizes r explains the major part of the variability sensitivity indices for the main effects of the other two factors œÄ b and between group transmission function appear weaker although non negligible these indices show a different evolution with the increase in r 0 sensitivity indices for r and the transmission function decrease with an increase in r 0 unlike the indice for main effects associated with œÄ b which shows an opposite evolution with r 0 the variability explained by main effects decreases therefore with r 0 whereas the variability associated with interactions increases with r 0 except for the interaction between r and the between group transmission function 3 4 simulations with varying group size taking into account population dynamics in the model through the inclusion of birth and death rates leads to a distinct behavior of the model depending on the considered between group transmission function fig 6 in any case the prevalence reaches an equilibrium at the end of the simulation whatever the considered birth rate the simulated prevalence does not change for f and m and is equivalent between both groups this is consistent with the simulations with constant group sizes where prevalence for both transmission functions only changes with r 0 values fig 3 when both group sizes increase case a prevalence curves are confounded for f m and v on account of an equivalent between group transmission function for each case and group prevalence increases similarly in both groups for d due to an equal increase in the number of infectious interestingly on the contrary to the constant size case prevalence for g differs from d and reaches a lower equilibrium value after an initial increase this is due to the fact that between group transmission function g decreases with the product of both group sizes unlike other functions case b with divergent group size evolution shows a similar pattern as when group sizes are initially distinct r 0 1 see fig 3 evolution of the prevalence for functions d and g is almost identical and functions v d and g are higher in the decreasing size group than in the increasing size one and distributed symmetrically to f when one size stays constant while the other increases case c the decrease in prevalence for d is lower that in case b due to a higher between group transmission for g the increase in one group size is not compensated by a decrease in the other and prevalence also decreases for this function in the decreasing size group results are symmetrical when considering a decrease instead of an increase in cases a and c i e by replacing death rate values of 0 0125 by 0 0075 t u 1 4 discussion this theoretical study highlights the influence of the between group transmission function on predictions from epidemiological models both for transient and long term dynamics simulations were carried out to disentangle the respective influence of the transmission function the infection dynamics the relative population sizes and the proportion of the transmission due to between group processes the frequency dependent between group transmission function f leads to the same prevalence at equilibrium in each group in all cases the function that represents a visit to infectious individuals v and to a lesser extent the density dependent function d give results that differ from one group to the other at least with distinct group sizes model reparametrization and analysis underline the equivalence between the density dependent function and a function that has the same rates in both groups g with a product of group sizes as denominator when the population size is kept constant relative differences in prevalence between functions are attenuated when the basic reproduction number is increased increasing the difference between group sizes generates an increase in the difference in prevalence between functions the influence of between group transmission depends both on the r 0 value and on the proportion of between group transmission œÄ b the higher the r 0 the more the differences between functions increase with œÄ b these tendencies are retrieved either with a frequency or a density dependent within group transmission the sensitivity analysis synthesizes the influence of parameters and the between group transmission function on the long term prevalence this analysis corroborates results from long term simulations r 0 has logically a major influence on model output differences in group sizes also emphasize prevalence differences especially for low r 0 whereas the relative contribution of between group transmission plays a role when r 0 is high enough the between group transmission function has an intermediate effect irrespective of r 0 value and cannot be neglected the analysis of the transient dynamics of the model reveals that the relative size of the primary case group could greatly modify the infection dynamics at the beginning of the simulations in contrast with long term dynamics the frequency dependent function generates the largest differences in prevalence between groups either primarily infected or not the influence of population dynamics and variable group sizes has been considered thereafter in order to clearly differentiate the effect of different factors involved in disease dynamics mainly within and between group transmission and group size evolution the most striking effect of including population dynamics in the model arises when considering that both groups increase in size in this case prevalences with density dependent function d and function g show a clear distinct evolution from each other and from the other considered functions this result highlights the relevance of the chosen transmission functions to study epidemiological model behavior results for the two other cases are consistent with the simulations considering constant but distinct group sizes with regard to between group transmission functions we chose to use functions for multi group modeling found in the literature other mathematical forms could have been considered but they were not retained either because they lacked biological meaning or because they could make model analysis untractable for instance for r 0 calculation which was required for function comparison for example theoretical non linear and power law functions are used to represent within group transmission Œ≤s p i q liu et al 1986 or Œ≤ s i p 1 Œ± i q hethcote and van den driessche 1991 and could be adapted to a two group model the inclusion of parameters other than the transmission rates and the difficulty in finding biological applications render them irrelevant for our study as for applied models beyer et al 2011 developed a metapopulation model of rabies dynamics where the within group infection dynamics is minimal assuming that a group is either infected with no effect of subsequent introduction of rabies or susceptible the between village transmission risk of rabies in a dog metapopulation was based on the distance between villages but the influence of the receiving and transmitting village sizes was also tested this hazard rate was fitted to observations and was found to depend mainly on distance and on the size of the receiving village due to the functional form of this hazard rate it was difficult to transpose this empirical approach to our theoretical study in conclusion this work emphasizes the need to carefully choose the mathematical form of the between group transmission function especially when low to intermediate values of r 0 are involved based on the literature we present five functions that give an overview of the used mathematical forms and represent different transmission processes when we are to simulate infection dynamics in a multi group system the choice has to be primarily based on our knowledge of the populations in contact and on the related infection processes the fitting of the model to an available data set could also help to select the most relevant between group transmission function

25271,pathogen transmission is a key process in epidemiology and its mathematical form plays a pivotal role when modeling pathogen spread much work has been devoted to the transmission function applied to a homogeneous population structure however between group transmission functions required when different groups are identified to account for a distinct epidemiological risk are much less documented the aim of this study is to detail the mathematical form of five between group transmission functions and to assess its influence on predictions in epidemiological modeling simulations with a two group model were carried out so as to generate prediction differences among between group transmission functions for a large range of situations defined by the within group transmission pattern the basic reproduction number the proportion of the whole transmission due to between group transmission and the ratio of population sizes pathogen spread simulations highlighted differences in prevalence among four transmission functions frequency dependent density dependent and functions representing either a temporary mixing or a proportion of visitors exposed to infectious individuals the differences could be seen either in long term or in transient simulated dynamics the fifth one representing limited interactions at a gate was shown to be equivalent to the density dependent function in our parametrization when keeping constant group sizes when considering population dynamics particularly with increasing group sizes this function and the density dependent one were shown to behave opposite from each other and to differ from the other functions this work highlights the need to carefully define the between group transmission function when modeling pathogen spread in a heterogeneous structure our work brings insight into the biological grounds that could guide the choice of such a function keywords epidemiology sir model heterogeneous population transmission population dynamics 1 introduction animal human as well as plant populations are structured in groups individuals generally having more contacts within their own group than with individuals from other groups such a contact structure results in multi group models and may arise because the population is structured by sex e g in wildlife during the non mating season beaun√©e et al 2015 by age e g in childhood diseases keeling and grenfell 1997 by physiological stages e g in livestock lurette et al 2008 spatially e g in plants with short and long distance dispersal sapoukhina et al 2010 or due to landscape heterogeneities smith et al 2002 or because of social interactions e g as related to human behavior funk et al 2010 accounting for population heterogeneity and structure is a central issue to predict pathogen spread it has received considerable attention in theoretical epidemiology over the last decades to cite only a few post et al 1983 dushoff and levin 1995 gudelj and white 2004 the impact of such a population structure on pathogen spread is controversial sometimes fastening sometimes reducing the spread keeling and rohani 2008 it is hard to evaluate especially i if individuals belonging to different groups have different levels of susceptibility and infectiousness e g in paratuberculosis in cattle where young animals are the most susceptible and adults the most infectious marc√© et al 2011 ii if there is a within group heterogeneity in individual infectiousness as for super shedding events lloyd smith et al 2005 and iii if contacts vary over space and time e g in vector borne diseases charron et al 2013 to better understand and predict pathogen spread within a structured population of hosts a modeling approach is appropriate and has been extensively used keeling and rohani 2008 ezanno et al 2012 riley 2007 a large number of papers concern pathogen spread on contact networks both in human and in animal populations keeling and eames 2005 danon et al 2011 dutta et al 2014 in these networks a node corresponds either to an individual or to a host population in a context of metapopulation jesse et al 2008 and a link corresponds to a contact between nodes however contacts between populations or groups of hosts also may occur through neighboring relationships because of airborne transmission ssematimba et al 2012 or because of host short go and return movements such as commuters working in a city and living in another one having contacts in both keeling and rohani 2008 moreno et al 2017 such contact patterns induce different interactions between groups in contact compared with individual movements as a contact then can be related to indirect transmission between groups for such an indirect transmission the function representing the force of infection is not straightforward leading to various definitions √∂gren and martin 2002 this is especially true in populations where between group contacts cannot be easily quantified edmunds et al 1997 tompkins et al 2011 therefore there is a need for a clearer definition of the biological meaning and implications of such between group functions as well as for the comparison of their impact on epidemiological model predictions the biological grounds that drive the choice of the within group transmission functions and the impact of such a choice on model predictions have largely been studied begon et al 2002 mccallum et al 2001 hoch et al 2008 murray 2009 some authors also compared within group transmission functions through the fitting to experimental data orlofske et al 2018 however such results can be only partly extended to the between group transmission issue firstly because epidemiological model outputs highly depend on the interactions between the groups secondly because the occurrence of between group contacts may arise from specific biological processes papers aiming at representing the spread of a specific pathogen in a given structured host population while using several between group functions and motivating their choice are very scarce √∂gren and martin 2002 performed simulations with several between group transmission functions in a model of an infection between airports they considered a fixed network of airports of constant size with empirically determined transmission parameters which prevents from a thorough comparison between functions our objective was therefore to compare the predictions of epidemiological models in structured populations among scenarios of between group transmission functions first functions encountered in the literature were reviewed and the biological assumptions that govern their use were described second simulations were compared for the different functions over a range of epidemiological characteristics in terms of basic reproduction number r 0 relative contribution of the between group transmission in r 0 computation within group transmission pattern and group size 2 methods 2 1 identification of between group transmission functions to investigate the influence of the mathematical form of between group transmission functions we chose to focus on transmission that occurs through direct contacts indirect transmission for instance through a common contaminated environment was therefore excluded from the analysis several mathematical forms for between group transmission functions are used in the literature both in theoretical and applied works they are summarized in table 1 the biological meaning of each of these functions is explained and illustrated thereafter in most cases especially for sake of simplicity the classical density dependent and frequency dependent transmission functions are used keeling and rohani 2002 gudelj and white 2004 if these two functions are equivalent when subgroups have the same fixed size it is not the case for groups of different or variable sizes a density dependent between group transmission hereafter called function d assumes that the contact rate with the group acting as the infection source is proportional to the density of individuals in this group such a function has largely been used for modeling the between herd spread of pathogens due to local animal or professional contacts durand et al 2004 noordegraaf et al 2000 barlow et al 1999 or contacts occurring only between groups such as between health care workers and patients in a hospital austin et al 1999 a density dependent function has also been used to represent between species transmission with specific infectivity for each species and assuming a homogeneous mixing riley et al 2008 a frequency dependent transmission hereafter called function f assumes that the contact rate is constant and does not depend on the size of the group acting as the infection source which is the case for instance for sexually transmissible diseases for the same number of infectious individuals the between group force of infection will be higher for small size receiving groups than for large size ones such a function has been widely used to model pathogen spread in a metapopulation keeling et al 2010 both in human e g varicella allen and thrasher 1998 sars bombardt 2006 hiv aids mukandavire et al 2009 influenza lunelli et al 2009 and in animal e g classical swine fever klinkenberg et al 2002 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome evans et al 2010 structured populations alternative functions are considered to represent other assumptions function v represents the case when a fraction of a group denoted by s i n i for instance doctors or other health care workers have contacts with infectious individuals i e the other group consists of patients potentially becoming infectious themselves here the size of the transmitting group has an effect on the risk of pathogen spread but not the one of the receiving group similarities with such a function can be found in vector borne diseases when the number of new cases in reservoir hosts does not depend on the size of this group function called reservoir frequency dependent by wonham et al 2006 function m is appropriate when the individuals of the two groups are temporarily mixed within a single one of total size n i n j and assuming a frequency dependent transmission this is the case for example when several host species manore et al 2011 or different social groups turner et al 2008 are interacting in a common area management group this function has been used also to estimate the between pen transmission of foot and mouth disease on experimental data ebl√© et al 2006 finally function g is employed when individuals from two different groups meet in an area whose access is limited for both groups such a function is particularly appropriate for modeling contacts between two groups of animals meeting at a gate or a barrier courcoul and ezanno 2010 viet et al 2004 √∂gren and martin 2002 actually in such a case the size of each group receiving or transmitting is not accounted for but only the proportions of susceptible and infectious individuals in each group such a function also can be used to represent the influence of travelers between subpopulations metcalf et al 2013 d agata et al 2007 2 2 the model to investigate the influence of different between group transmission functions we developed a simple sirs susceptible infectious removed susceptible model for a population divided into two groups interacting with each other the five between group transmission functions identified were taken into account d f v m and g representing five different scenarios the considered within group transmission functions were either frequency or density dependent transmission in order to first focus on the effect of transmission functions we began with a model that did not include demography and the population size was kept constant in each group so r i n i s i i i equations in group i i 1 or 2 are the following 1 ds i dt f w i x f b i y Œ≥ n i s i i i di i dt f w i x f b i y ŒΩ i i f w i x represents the within group transmission function which can be expressed as follows f w i f Œ≤ w f s i i i n i for frequency dependent transmission f w i d Œ≤ w d s i i i for density dependent transmission f b i y is the between group transmission function for group i with y corresponding to the considered function table 1 parameters Œ≤ w 1 Œ≥ and 1 ŒΩ represent respectively the within group transmission rate per time unit t u 1 and the durations of immunity and infectiousness periods t u between group transmission in group i from group j i j can be formalized by the following generic equation for all between group transmission functions except m 2 f b i y Œ≤ b i y s i i j and as follows for between group transmission function m 3 f b i m Œ≤ b i m s i i i i j where j represents the infecting group the between group transmission rate Œ≤ b i y depends on a rate specific to each transmission function and on group sizes n i and n j the basic reproduction number r 0 was calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix diekmann et al 1990 depending on the considered within group transmission function two cases were identified 2 2 1 frequency dependent within group transmission in this case the basic reproduction number is given by the following equation for all between group transmission functions except m 4 r 0 Œ≤ w f Œ≤ b a y Œ≤ b b y n 1 n 2 ŒΩ and as follows for between group transmission function m 5 r 0 Œ≤ w f Œ≤ b m ŒΩ let us denote by the basic reproductive number in the absence of between group transmission obtained by setting the between group transmission rates Œ≤ b 1 y Œ≤ b 2 y 0 to describe the contribution of the between group transmission to r 0 we define œÄ b as 6 the quantities œÄ b and 1 œÄ b give the proportions of r 0 due respectively to between group and within group transmission r 0 and œÄ b depend on the between group transmission function y however to facilitate the comparison between the different functions we set r 0 and œÄ b as parameters and reparametrize our equations accordingly from eqs 4 6 we can deduce the within group transmission rate as a function of ŒΩ r 0 and œÄ b for all between group transmission functions 7 Œ≤ w f r 0 1 œÄ b ŒΩ let r n 2 n 1 be the ratio between the two group sizes and n n 1 n 2 the total population size in the model all these sizes remain constant over time we are then able to express the between group transmission rate Œ≤ b i y in each group and for each scenario as a function of r 0 œÄ b r n and ŒΩ table 2 parameters r 0 œÄ b and r represent respectively the importance of the epidemic dynamics the between group contribution to transmission and the relative population sizes 2 2 2 density dependent within group transmission in this case the basic reproduction number is given by the following equation for all between group transmission functions except m 8 r 0 Œ≤ w d n 1 n 2 Œ≤ w d 2 n 1 n 2 2 4 Œ≤ b 1 y Œ≤ b 2 y n 1 n 2 2 ŒΩ and as follows for between group transmission function m 9 r 0 Œ≤ w d n 1 n 2 Œ≤ b m n 1 n 2 Œ≤ w d n 1 n 2 Œ≤ b m 2 n 1 n 2 2 4 Œ≤ b m 2 n 1 n 2 2 ŒΩ n 1 n 2 from eqs 8 9 and 6 we can deduce the density dependent within group transmission rate as a function of r 0 œÄ b r n and ŒΩ for all between group transmission functions 10 Œ≤ w d r 0 1 œÄ b ŒΩ 1 r n as shown in table 2 two between group functions d and g have the same transmission rates Œ≤ b 1 y and Œ≤ b 2 y with the new parametrization that is when r 0 œÄ b r n and ŒΩ are set this result can be generalized to all functions described by eq 2 that have the same transmission rates in both groups Œ≤ b 1 y Œ≤ b 2 y 2 3 equilibria for each transmission function the existence of a disease free equilibrium is trivial s 1 0 i 1 0 s 2 0 i 2 0 n 1 0 n 2 0 endemic equilibria were computed using maple software 1 1 maple software http www maplesoft com leading to the resolution of a degree 3 polynomial in i 2 see appendix a it produced untractable expressions except when within and between group functions are frequency dependent f for which we obtained the following values s 1 n 1 ŒΩ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f i 1 n 1 Œ≥ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f ŒΩ Œ≥ ŒΩ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f s 2 n 2 ŒΩ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f i 2 n 2 Œ≥ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f ŒΩ Œ≥ ŒΩ Œ≤ w Œ≤ b f these quantities are positive when r 0 1 see table 2 and less than n 2 so they qualify for the endemic equilibrium the expressions for i 1 and i 2 imply that the prevalence at the endemic equilibrium is equal in both groups the remaining endemic equilibrium values were obtained numerically for the parameters used in the scenarios defined thereafter they were consistent with the simulation results see below 2 4 simulations with constant group size in addition to the calculation of equilibria numerical simulations were carried out to study the impact of between group transmission function on transient and long term behavior results were analyzed by studying the evolution of the prevalence which was investigated in the overall population and in both groups long term dynamics simulations were first carried out which allow us to verify results from equilibria analysis simulations were performed during 10 000 units of time so as to reach a quasi equilibrium for output variables they were initiated by considering one infectious individual in a fully susceptible group denoted thereafter as the primary case group long term simulations were carried out to assess the effect on prevalence of the four between group transmission functions corresponding to the functions given in table 1 except g which is equivalent to d for the two considered within group functions and for different values of the basic reproduction number r 0 the proportion of the transmission due to between group transmission œÄ b and the ratio of population sizes r n 2 n 1 without any loss of genericity we denoted by subscripts 1 and 2 respectively the large and the small groups so r 1 the remaining parameters Œ≥ 0 1 t u 1 and ŒΩ 0 05 t u 1 and the total population size n 1000 individuals were kept constant table 3 gives the values of the parameters considered from which the simulation design can be deduced the values for r 0 were chosen so as to test low middle and relatively high values no data are available in the literature to assess and give a plausible range of values for the contribution of between group transmission œÄ b we used therefore a large range of values in order to test a large number of possibilities parameter values for group size ratio r were also fixed for the same purpose apart from simulating the long term dynamics we also focused on the transient dynamics of prevalence depending on the pathogen considered the transient behavior of the infection dynamics could highly influence the type of control strategy to be implemented e g vaccination quarantine and the time available to control pathogen spread epidemic size and therefore the health damages and or the economic losses also could vary greatly with these short term dynamics we hypothesized that characteristics of the primary case group could have an influence on the transient dynamics of the infection as illustrated in fig 1 we carried out simulations where the primary case group differed and could be either the large or the small group therefore we investigated the transient behavior of the model by calculating the difference in prevalence Œ¥ for groups of the same size between simulations which differed according to the primary case group this difference was normalized by the prevalence value at equilibrium in the corresponding group k it results 11 Œ¥ p k t p k c t p k t p k where p k c t represents the prevalence p k c t i k t n k t in group k k s or l when this group represents the primary case group whereas p k t corresponds to the prevalence for the same group k when infection does not start in this group p k is the prevalence at equilibrium calculated numerically for the group k we chose a low value for the ratio of group sizes r 0 1 in order to have contrasting sizes simulations were performed using scilab software 2 2 scilab software http www scilab org differential equations were solved numerically thanks to adams method 2 5 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the influence of four factors between group transmission function r 0 œÄ b and r on the global prevalence at equilibrium which was calculated numerically only the transmission function f d and v were included in the analysis as f and m are asymptotically confounded the prevalence was expressed as a polynomial of these factors considering main effects and interactions as our simulations constitute a complete factorial experimental design we could estimate all the parameters of the polynomial with r software 3 3 r software http www r project org an anova was carried out between the overall prevalence and the four factors considering the three parameters as continuous variables and the transmission function as a discrete one for each factor a sensitivity index eq 12 was built that corresponds to the ratio between the variability explained by a factor i e the sum of squares related to this factor on the total sum of squares saltelli et al 2008 and expressed as a percentage 12 si x i ss x i ss t where ss x i and ss t represent respectively the sum of squares attached to concerned factor and the total sum of squares 2 6 influence of population dynamics in a sake for legibility we considered in the previous sections that group size was constant throughout the simulations with no birth and mortality processes included in the model however ignoring population dynamics may not be relevant for long term simulations some authors hoch et al 2008 show evidence of a distinct model behavior when considering constant or varying group sizes the population dynamics and fluctuating group sizes were accounted for by including birth and mortality rates in the equation system 1 following anderson and may 1979 mortality with a basal rate b and an infection related mortality rate Œº was similar in all groups whereas a birth rate a i whose value differs between groups was applied to all the individuals which give birth to susceptible the equation system 1 was therefore modified as follows 13 ds i dt a i n i f w i x f b i y Œ≥ r i b s i di i dt f w i x f b i y ŒΩ b Œº i i ds i dt ŒΩ i i Œ≥ b r i in such a system the equation for r 0 is the following when considering f d v and g between group transmission functions 14 r 0 Œ≤ w f Œ≤ b 1 y Œ≤ b 2 y n 1 n 2 b Œº ŒΩ similarly equation for function m is obtained by considering b Œº ŒΩ as the denominator in eq 5 the within and between group transmission rates were estimated accordingly in order to have identical r 0 values at the beginning of the simulations for each considered between group transmission function in order to disentangle the respective effects of population dynamics and of the initial group size difference we considered in this section that initial group sizes were equal i e r 1 we applied equation system 13 to two groups similarly as for the constant size case stable group sizes were obtained for the following parameter values a 1 a 2 0 01 t u 1 b 0 009 t u 1 and Œº 0 0025 t u 1 three cases were simulated a both groups increase a 1 a 2 0 0125 t u 1 b one of the groups increases while the other decreases a 1 0 0125 and a 2 0 0075 t u 1 and c one of the two groups increases while the other group size remains unchanged a 1 0 0125 t u 1 due to their initial equal sizes acting on either group would not change the results as they would behave symmetrically simulations were carried out with average respective values of 0 5 and 2 5 for œÄ b and r 0 3 results 3 1 long term dynamics fig 2 illustrates the overall prevalence over time for f d v and m for the two considered within group transmission functions we chose to use 0 1 for the ratio between group sizes r so as to have contrasted sizes when r increases to reach 1 prevalence differences diminish until they are confounded see appendix b results are similar whatever the considered within group transmission function equilibrium prevalence calculated at the end of the simulations for f d and v between group functions are ranked in the same order in both cases in particular the simulated prevalence with between group function f is much higher than with v approximately 0 4 versus 0 25 with d in between results for m differ slightly according to the considered within group function however this between group function depends on the number of infectious individuals in both groups which prevents from a strict comparison with other functions due to the identical simulated behavior between models with either within group function we chose to present only the frequency dependent function in the following sections simulations with density dependent within group function can be retrieved in appendix c the evolution of the prevalence in both groups for different values of r 0 and œÄ b is given in fig 3 as identified in section equilibria the equilibrium prevalence is the same in the two groups when using the f between group transmission function the continuous lines are confounded in fig 3 simulations with m are asymptotically confounded with results from f in contrast the simulated prevalence for d is higher in the small group and smaller in the large group compared with f this difference is even more striking with function v these differences could be explained by the expression of the generic transmission rate for each function table 2 when focusing on the largest group it arises that the values for Œ≤ b 1 y can be ranked in the following decreasing order f d v as within group transmission is identical whatever the between group transmission function this ranking of the transmission rate generates the simulated differences in the large group the reverse effect is simulated in the small group as expected for all curves the equilibrium is reached sooner as r 0 increases with higher simulated prevalences differences in prevalence between functions are also less marked for high r 0 at least for a low value of œÄ b increasing œÄ b and therefore the influence of the between group transmission leads to an increase in the differences between functions in the large group to a lesser extent in the small one 3 2 transient dynamics fig 4 highlights the difference in prevalence between groups of the same size but for different primary case groups see eq 11 at the beginning of simulations carried out with intermediate values of r 0 and œÄ b for the large group size the primary case generates less infectious individuals with function f and the difference in prevalence becomes rapidly negative this results from the use of a frequency dependent transmission function for both within and between group transmissions in this case within group force of infection is higher in the small group compared to the large group whereas between group force of infection is on the contrary higher in the large group therefore when the primary case occurs in the small group both processes interact leading to stronger infection dynamics in the large group compared to when the primary case occurs in the large one this feature is also found with function d to a lesser extent but not with functions m and v with the chosen parameter values the differences in prevalence for functions f and d reach a maximum value on around time unit 70 80 before declining to null value on approximately time unit 150 which constitutes the limit for the influence of the primary case 3 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed on the global prevalence at equilibrium with all factors simultaneously i e r 0 œÄ b r and between group transmission function from this analysis it results that the basic reproduction number r 0 plays a major role in the determination of the prevalence the variability explained by this factor reaches more than 90 of the total variability results not shown analyses were therefore carried out by differentiating r 0 values fig 5 see index values in appendix d in any case the model explains about 75 80 of the total variability in terms of main effects and regardless of r 0 value the ratio of group sizes r explains the major part of the variability sensitivity indices for the main effects of the other two factors œÄ b and between group transmission function appear weaker although non negligible these indices show a different evolution with the increase in r 0 sensitivity indices for r and the transmission function decrease with an increase in r 0 unlike the indice for main effects associated with œÄ b which shows an opposite evolution with r 0 the variability explained by main effects decreases therefore with r 0 whereas the variability associated with interactions increases with r 0 except for the interaction between r and the between group transmission function 3 4 simulations with varying group size taking into account population dynamics in the model through the inclusion of birth and death rates leads to a distinct behavior of the model depending on the considered between group transmission function fig 6 in any case the prevalence reaches an equilibrium at the end of the simulation whatever the considered birth rate the simulated prevalence does not change for f and m and is equivalent between both groups this is consistent with the simulations with constant group sizes where prevalence for both transmission functions only changes with r 0 values fig 3 when both group sizes increase case a prevalence curves are confounded for f m and v on account of an equivalent between group transmission function for each case and group prevalence increases similarly in both groups for d due to an equal increase in the number of infectious interestingly on the contrary to the constant size case prevalence for g differs from d and reaches a lower equilibrium value after an initial increase this is due to the fact that between group transmission function g decreases with the product of both group sizes unlike other functions case b with divergent group size evolution shows a similar pattern as when group sizes are initially distinct r 0 1 see fig 3 evolution of the prevalence for functions d and g is almost identical and functions v d and g are higher in the decreasing size group than in the increasing size one and distributed symmetrically to f when one size stays constant while the other increases case c the decrease in prevalence for d is lower that in case b due to a higher between group transmission for g the increase in one group size is not compensated by a decrease in the other and prevalence also decreases for this function in the decreasing size group results are symmetrical when considering a decrease instead of an increase in cases a and c i e by replacing death rate values of 0 0125 by 0 0075 t u 1 4 discussion this theoretical study highlights the influence of the between group transmission function on predictions from epidemiological models both for transient and long term dynamics simulations were carried out to disentangle the respective influence of the transmission function the infection dynamics the relative population sizes and the proportion of the transmission due to between group processes the frequency dependent between group transmission function f leads to the same prevalence at equilibrium in each group in all cases the function that represents a visit to infectious individuals v and to a lesser extent the density dependent function d give results that differ from one group to the other at least with distinct group sizes model reparametrization and analysis underline the equivalence between the density dependent function and a function that has the same rates in both groups g with a product of group sizes as denominator when the population size is kept constant relative differences in prevalence between functions are attenuated when the basic reproduction number is increased increasing the difference between group sizes generates an increase in the difference in prevalence between functions the influence of between group transmission depends both on the r 0 value and on the proportion of between group transmission œÄ b the higher the r 0 the more the differences between functions increase with œÄ b these tendencies are retrieved either with a frequency or a density dependent within group transmission the sensitivity analysis synthesizes the influence of parameters and the between group transmission function on the long term prevalence this analysis corroborates results from long term simulations r 0 has logically a major influence on model output differences in group sizes also emphasize prevalence differences especially for low r 0 whereas the relative contribution of between group transmission plays a role when r 0 is high enough the between group transmission function has an intermediate effect irrespective of r 0 value and cannot be neglected the analysis of the transient dynamics of the model reveals that the relative size of the primary case group could greatly modify the infection dynamics at the beginning of the simulations in contrast with long term dynamics the frequency dependent function generates the largest differences in prevalence between groups either primarily infected or not the influence of population dynamics and variable group sizes has been considered thereafter in order to clearly differentiate the effect of different factors involved in disease dynamics mainly within and between group transmission and group size evolution the most striking effect of including population dynamics in the model arises when considering that both groups increase in size in this case prevalences with density dependent function d and function g show a clear distinct evolution from each other and from the other considered functions this result highlights the relevance of the chosen transmission functions to study epidemiological model behavior results for the two other cases are consistent with the simulations considering constant but distinct group sizes with regard to between group transmission functions we chose to use functions for multi group modeling found in the literature other mathematical forms could have been considered but they were not retained either because they lacked biological meaning or because they could make model analysis untractable for instance for r 0 calculation which was required for function comparison for example theoretical non linear and power law functions are used to represent within group transmission Œ≤s p i q liu et al 1986 or Œ≤ s i p 1 Œ± i q hethcote and van den driessche 1991 and could be adapted to a two group model the inclusion of parameters other than the transmission rates and the difficulty in finding biological applications render them irrelevant for our study as for applied models beyer et al 2011 developed a metapopulation model of rabies dynamics where the within group infection dynamics is minimal assuming that a group is either infected with no effect of subsequent introduction of rabies or susceptible the between village transmission risk of rabies in a dog metapopulation was based on the distance between villages but the influence of the receiving and transmitting village sizes was also tested this hazard rate was fitted to observations and was found to depend mainly on distance and on the size of the receiving village due to the functional form of this hazard rate it was difficult to transpose this empirical approach to our theoretical study in conclusion this work emphasizes the need to carefully choose the mathematical form of the between group transmission function especially when low to intermediate values of r 0 are involved based on the literature we present five functions that give an overview of the used mathematical forms and represent different transmission processes when we are to simulate infection dynamics in a multi group system the choice has to be primarily based on our knowledge of the populations in contact and on the related infection processes the fitting of the model to an available data set could also help to select the most relevant between group transmission function

25272,the interspecific competition among algal species is an important process that can change the community structure in aquatic ecosystems however there is still a lack of understanding of the impact of various factors on interspecific competition in this study both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches were employed to investigate how various combinations of the initial cell densities of pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and chlorella vulgaris and copper exposure levels affect interspecific competition between these species in the simulation results c vulgaris appeared to be superior to p subcapitata in the absence of copper exposure however in the copper exposed groups the competitive positions of both algal species varied with the initial cell density and the copper exposure level in particular at the highest copper concentration 10 Œºg l c vulgaris became less competitive than p subcapitata in most initial cell density combinations resulting in a shift in competitive dominance this study clearly showed that the dominant species in the interspecific competition could be altered by the two factors studied herein the developed model provided a more detailed and intuitive understanding of the effects of the two factors on the interspecific competition by simulating the competition at various combinations of initial algal density and copper exposure levels in this study the initial algal density and copper exposure levels were selected as the factors influencing the interspecific competition between p subcapitata and c vulgaris but the proposed model could be used to study the effects of other toxicants on the interspecific competition between other algal species keywords allelopathy competitive dominance competitive response pseudokirchneriella subcapitata chlorella vulgaris 1 introduction interspecific competition is one of the fundamental processes determining community structure chase et al 2002 which in turn alters ecosystem function in particular an interspecific competition is observed more frequently in aquatic ecosystems than in terrestrial ecosystems connell 1983 and the interactions among prey are known to have a significant impact on high level predator populations garvey et al 1994 since algae play a crucial ecological role in freshwater ecosystems as the basis of many food chains and primary producers stoiber et al 2012 it is important to understand interspecific competition among algal species intensified interspecific competition between algal species can lead to reduced growth of individuals resulting in succession and shifts in algal community structure furthermore the impacts of algal competition are likely to cascade through trophic levels gran√©li et al 2008 which in turn eventually alter the biodiversity and community structure of freshwater ecosystems several studies have demonstrated that various factors such as allelochemicals hulot and huisman 2004 nutrition chakraborty et al 2008 initial algal cell density tameishi et al 2009 qiu et al 2011 predators carusela et al 2009 and toxicants l√ºrling and roessink 2006 are involved in algal species competition among these factors allelochemicals which are the chemical substances released by the algal species for inhibiting the growth of the other algal species and initial cell densities are the most widely studied several algal species can have competitive dominance over others by producing allelochemicals reviewed by gran√©li et al 2008 tameishi et al 2009 and qiu et al 2011 reported that the initial densities had a significant impact on the interspecific competition between prorocentrum minimum skeletonema costatum and chattonella antiqua akashiwo sanguinea respectively but kuwata and miyazaki 2000 reported no significant effect of the initial densities of microcystis novacekii and scenedesmus quadricauda on interspecific competition although conflicting results have been reported in the literature the initial algal cell density can have a significant direct or indirect impact on algal competition as it is linked to the quantity of the allelochemicals produced and preoccupancy exploitation of limited nutrients hulot and huisman 2004 another important factor is the presence of exogenous toxic substances algal populations are frequently exposed to various toxicants in the environment and are one of the most toxicant sensitive biota among aquatic organisms stoiber et al 2012 thus because different algal species have different sensitivities the dominant species in an aquatic ecosystem could change through the replacement of the sensitive species by the more resistant one l√ºrling and roessink 2006 toxicants could be an even more important factor than the other factors involved in algal species competition because they have adverse effects on both species simultaneously although the above mentioned factors might affect the interspecific competition among algae species in a complex manner no studies have considered the combined effects of these factors since there are limits to experimentally observing the effects of various combinations of factors on the interspecific competition between algal species a mathematical model can be a useful tool however to date no mathematical model has taken into account the influences of both initial algal densities and toxicants on algal competition the model proposed by uchida et al 1999 has been widely used to study the effects of initial algal density on interspecific competition yamasaki et al 2007 tameishi et al 2009 qiu et al 2011 however it is difficult to include the effects of other factors because the interactions between two algal species are simply represented by a single parameter as an interaction rate on the other hand the model proposed by fergola et al 2007 describes an allelopathic interaction in more detail by adding extra information on how an allelochemical concentration affects the interspecific competition but no other factors were considered dellagreca et al 2010 in addition several models have been used to study the effects of specific factors on algal competition e g nutrient limitation chakraborty et al 2008 predators carusela et al 2009 but these models cannot be used to study the influence of initial algal density and toxicants on interspecific competition since the structure of a mathematical model depends on the research subjects a new modeling approach is necessary to improve the understanding of how the combination of initial algal density and toxicants affect algal competition therefore in this study a new mathematical model was proposed and the influence of initial algal density and toxicant on interspecific competition was evaluated two freshwater algal species pseudokirchneriella subcapitata formerly known as rhaphidocelis subcapitata and selenastrum capricornutum and chlorella vulgaris were selected as model species because of their ecological relevance and availability silva et al 2009 machado et al 2015 the production of an allelopathic substance called chlorellin by c vulgaris makes it ideal for investigating the allelopathic competitive interactions fergola et al 2007 copper was chosen as a toxic substance because of its frequent detection in aquatic environments and high toxicity to various algal species flemming and trevors 1989 the objective of this study was to investigate how various combinations of initial cell densities of two algal species p subcapitata and c vulgaris and copper exposure affect interspecific competition in a closed system through both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches the conceptual diagram for interspecific competition between the two algal species and the flowchart of the study processes are shown in fig 1 to obtain the data sets for model calibration various combinations of initial cell densities of both algal species were monitored periodically over time under copper exposure conditions 0 5 and 10 Œºg l a mathematical model including the effects of initial density copper exposure levels and allelopathy was developed in order to explore their combined effects on the interspecific competition between the two algal species using the experimental data sets the model was calibrated to predict the density dynamics of the two algal species over time and the interspecific competition between the two species was evaluated in terms of competitive dominance competitive response and time required to reach the maximum algal density 2 experiments 2 1 test algae and culture conditions two freshwater microalgal species p subcapitata strains ccap 278 4 and c vulgaris strains ag40003 were obtained from the culture collection of algae and protozoa ccap scottish marine institute uk and the korean collection for type cultures kctc korea research institute of bioscience and biotechnology korea respectively the growth medium was prepared in accordance with the united stated environment protection agency epa method 1003 0 epa 2002 both algal species were maintained in separate 200 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of synthetic algal medium epa 2002 the flasks were incubated at 20 1 c with a 16 h light 8 h dark photoperiod under illumination at 70 Œºmol photons m2 s with cool white fluorescent light tld 30 w philips the maximum densities of p subcapitata and c vulgaris were approximately 4 0 106 and 4 0 107 cells ml respectively under these culture conditions the flasks were hand agitated twice daily to minimize flocculation and clumping of algal cells all glassware used in the algal culture maintenance and experiments were completely immersed in 10 nitric acid for at least 1 d and was thoroughly rinsed with distilled water before use 2 2 experimental designs the copper stock solution was prepared by dissolving the reagent grade copper ii sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o 99 purity sigma aldrich in the synthetic algal medium the stock solution was diluted with the synthetic medium to make the final copper concentrations of 5 and 10 Œºg l these copper concentrations were selected based on our previous study unpublished data in which the growths of p subcapitata and c vulgaris were severely inhibited when exposed to 15 Œºg l or higher concentrations of copper in addition franklin et al 2002 reported that the 72 h ec50 values of copper for the growth inhibition of p subcapitata and chlorella sp were 17 and 16 Œºg l respectively the ph values of the test solutions were adjusted with 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh to remain in the range of 7 5 0 1 to investigate how various initial cell density combinations of p subcapitata and c vulgaris affect the interspecific competition in either the presence treatments or absence of copper exposure control algal growth experiments were conducted in 100 ml glass beakers filled with 70 ml medium with several combinations of initial cell densities to adjust the initial cell density of each species both algal species were harvested at steady growth phase by centrifuging at 600 g for 5 min and then resuspended in the growth medium the initial cell densities of p subcapitata and c vulgaris were adjusted to range from 3 0 104 to 3 5 105 cells ml and 2 0 105 to 4 0 106 cells ml respectively table 1 the combinations of initial cell densities were determined to include various p subcapitata c vulgaris ratios in the estimation of model parameters as reported previously hu and zhang 1993 franklin et al 2002 the initial cell density was set to a relatively high value in adverse conditions i e copper exposure in each combination five replicates were performed during the experiments all beakers were sealed with parafilm polyethylene to prevent the evaporation of the test medium and were kept at the same environmental conditions as those used for culture maintenance the beakers were shaken by hand twice a day the algal cell densities were checked periodically 1 16 d interval over the 78 days until the algal cell density in each beaker was close to zero the number of algal cells in each combination was counted using a hemocytometer marienfeld germany under an optical microscope e200 nikon japan by taking 5 Œºl of algal suspension from each test beaker four repeated measurements for each beaker no additional process was applied to distinguish the species because of the apparent differences in shape and size between the two algal species p subcapitata curved and twisted shape 8 14 Œºm in length c vulgaris spherical shape 5 9 Œºm in diameter 3 model formulation 3 1 generic assumption a mechanistic model that describes the population dynamics of each algal species consists of two phases growth and decline it is assumed that the habitat quality s the capacity of an environment to provide conditions appropriate for individual and population persistence is continuously reduced by a proportion to the population cell densities and growth rates at a given time in the given closed co culture as the cell density increases the nutrients in the beaker continue to decrease and the toxic wastes continue to accumulate subsequently degrading habitat quality thus s scaled to lie within a range of 0 1 reflecting habitat quality 0 fully degraded 1 initial condition is given as follows 1 d s d t m p s x d x d t n p s m c v y d y d t n c v where x and y are the cell densities cells ml m ps and m cv are the habitat depletion rates ml cells of the cell maintenance n ps and n cv are the habitat depletion rates ml cells of the growth of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively therefore an algal population continues growing when s is greater than zero growth phase and goes to extinction decline phase when s reaches zero 3 2 growth phase the growth phases of both algal species in the given closed co culture can be described as follows 2 d x d t Œº p s s x d p s x d y d x Œº c v s y d c v y where Œºps and Œºcv are the specific growth rates 1 d and d ps and d cv are the mortalities 1 d of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively since c vulgaris can produce allelochemicals chlorellin that inhibit the growth of both c vulgaris and p subcapitata the growth rate of each species can be expressed by incorporating the chlorellin concentration dependent growth rate growth rate exp rp into eq 2 fergola et al 2007 here r is the inhibition constant and p is chlorellin concentration therefore eq 2 can be rearranged as follows 3 d x d t Œº p s exp r p s p s x d p s x d y d x Œº c v exp r c v p s y d c v y where r ps and r cv are the inhibition constants 1 Œºg of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively to embed the cell density and growth rate dependent chlorellin product formation rate into the growth phase model the luedeking piret equation luedeking and piret 1959 was employed this can be expressed as follows 4 d p d t Œ± d y d t Œ≤ y where y is the cell density cells ml of c vulgaris Œ± and Œ≤ are the growth related and unrelated chlorellin formation coefficients Œºg cells respectively yang et al 2011 who studied the relationship between algal growth and its material formation in detail reported that the contribution of material formation on the growth unrelated coefficient was negligible hence eq 4 can be simplified as follows 5 d p d t Œ± d y d t in addition franklin et al 2002 suggested that the initial algal cell density was a determining factor affecting the available copper fraction in the media through algal cellular adsorption which in turn affects copper toxicity in p subcapitata and c vulgaris therefore once the available copper is taken up by the initial algal cells it has negligible toxic effect on their growth rate over the exposure duration because of the depletion of the available copper thus the toxic potency of copper can be assumed reciprocal to the initial cell density and hence eq 3 reflecting these assumptions can be rearranged as follows 6 d x d t Œº p s exp r p s p 1 k p s t p s x 0 t c v y 0 s x d p s x d y d t Œº c v exp r c v p 1 k c v t p s x 0 t c v y 0 s y d c v y where k ps and k cv are the copper toxicity coefficients cells ml t ps and t cv are the specific contribution rates on copper bioavailability and x 0 and y 0 are the initial cell densities cells ml of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively 3 3 decline phase to formulate the decline phase of each algal species in the given closed co culture it is assumed that the cell density of each algal species will decline and eventually become zero as the habitat quality s in the given condition degrades i e s is close to or equal to zero because of nutrient depletion and toxic waste accumulation thus the decline phase model considering the s dependent and natural mortality can be expressed as follows 7 d x d t a p s x m x x m x d p s x d y d t a c v y m y y m y d c v y where a ps and a cv are the algal specific density decrease rates 1 d and x m and y m are the maximum cell densities cells ml of p subcapitata and c vulgaris under the given closed co cultivation conditions respectively 4 model calibration local sensitivity analysis and simulation the four ordinary differential equations that describe the time dependent algal cell density degradation rate of the habitat quality and chlorellin formation rate can be described as follows 8 d x d t d p s x x Œº p s exp r p s p 1 k p s t p s x 0 t c v y 0 s f o r s 0 a p s x m x x m otherwise d y d t d c v y y Œº c v exp r c v p 1 k c v t p s x 0 t c v y 0 s f o r s 0 a c v y m y y m otherwise d

vulgaris respectively s is the habitat quality and p is the chlorellin concentration the four differential equations were simulated using the powersim studio powersim software as norway software employing the euler integration method with 0 01 d time step to calibrate the model parameters the values of the parameters minimizing the sum of square error the difference between the observed and predicted cell densities of p subcapitata and c vulgaris were estimated using the powersim solver analysis tools a local sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the relative contribution of the input parameters that influence the model output e g maximum algal cell density the model was implemented by incrementing or decrementing the individual parameter values by 10 with the other parameters fixed and then calculating the changes in the main model output johnston et al 2014 gonzalez et al 2015 the baseline of the sensitivity analysis was the model output calculated by using the estimated parameter values shown in table 2 the initial p subcapitata density of 2 0 105 cells ml and the initial c vulgaris density of 2 0 106 cells ml the parameters a ps and a cv which represent the specific density decrease rates of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively were excluded in the sensitivity analysis because these parameters affect algal density only in the decline phase the parameter sensitivity was expressed as a ratio of the relative change in the maximum algal cell density to the relative change in each parameter value to investigate how the initial cell density and copper exposure level affected the interspecific competition between the two algal species three indexes including the competitive dominance competitive response and time required to reach the maximum algal density were simulated by the calibrated model the competitive dominance was calculated as the log10 transformed ratio of the maximum cell density of c vulgaris to that of p subcapitata log10 c vulgaris p subcapitata at s 0 in the co culture thus when the calculated value is a positive or negative it means a competitive dominance of c vulgaris or p subcapitata respectively furthermore the competitive response index referred to herein as a cij in eq 9 proposed by fox 2002 was calculated based on each simulated algal cell density specifically the competitive response index in the control was calculated as follows 9 c i j k i n i j k i where cij is the competitive response of species i nij is the maximum cell density of species i in the co culture with a competitor j and ki is the maximum cell density of species i in the single culture a competitive response was considered a competitive exclusion if cij 1 or a facilitative effect if cij 0 similarly the effect of copper on the competitive response in the treatments was estimated using a modified version of eq 9 as follows 10 c i j c u k i n i j c u k i where cij cu is the competitive responses in the treatments copper exposed conditions ki is the maximum cell density of species i in the single culture and nij cu is the maximum cell density of species i with a competitor j in the co culture under copper exposure the closer the cij cu value is to 1 the greater the adverse effects of copper on the competitive responses of each algal species whereas the closer this value is to 0 the smaller the adverse effects on the competitive response for the competitive response calculations the maximum cell density of each algal species at s 0 as predicted by eq 8 was used the time required to reach the maximum algal density of each algal species was also predicted by eq 8 5 results 5 1 experimental results model calibration and sensitivity analysis experimental observations indicated that the degrees of growth inhibition of both algal species varied with the initial cell density of the competitor species figs 2 4 as shown in fig 2 the degree of growth inhibition of p subcapitata was greater than 70 and that of c vulgaris was less than 50 in the co culture compared with their maximum algal densities in the single culture it was clear that the higher the initial cell density of the competitor the higher the growth inhibition of the opponent in the co cultures in addition for both algal species the higher the initial cell density the shorter the time required to reach the maximum cell density fig 2d for p subcapitata fig 2c for c vulgaris both species began to decline after 20 days with a slight difference in their decline times and all initial cell density combinations in the control lasted for 45 60 days fig 2 when exposed to copper the degrees of growth inhibition of both algal species caused by their competitors were different from those observed in the control fig 3 at the copper concentration of 5 Œºg l the maximum cell densities of c vulgaris in the co cultures were less than 20 of that in the single culture except for the two combinations wherein the initial cell density of c vulgaris was extremely high however the maximum cell density of p subcapitata was 80 of that in the single culture in most initial density combinations except for two with extremely high initial cell densities with a copper exposure of 10 Œºg l p subcapitata grew close to the maximum cell density of a single culture in most combinations but the growth of c vulgaris was completely suppressed except when in combination with the highest initial cell densities for both algal species fig 4 a range of model input parameters obtained from the experiments was calibrated before simulating the model and the calibrated values are listed in table 2 the relationship between the predicted and observed cell density dynamics of the two algal species was significant with the coefficients of determination r 2 being larger than 0 96 for both p subcapitata and c vulgaris indicating that the developed models were adequately calibrated for the dynamics of both algal species figs 2 4 the results of the local sensitivity analysis are shown in table 3 in the control Œºps Œºcv and x 0 and Œºps Œºcv and m cv were found to be relatively important parameters affecting the cell density of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively similarly Œºps and Œºcv were found to be the most important parameters in the 5 Œºg l copper exposed group and the initial cell density of c vulgaris y 0 was also an important parameter determining the maximum cell densities of both algal species in the co culture on the other hand the parameters related to the effect of copper on p subcapitata and c vulgaris t ps and k cv and t cv respectively and the parameters related to the initial cell densities of both species x 0 and y 0 had the greatest effect on cell density in the 10 Œºg l copper exposed group 5 2 simulation results on competitive dominance when competitive dominance was calculated based on the simulated maximum cell density across a range of initial cell densities for both species c vulgaris showed competitive dominance over p subcapitata regardless of the initial cell densities of both species fig 5 a however it was also true that the higher the initial density of p subcapitata the greater the extent that the competitive dominance of c vulgaris over p subcapitata was offset the simulation results for the 5 Œºg l copper exposure showed that c vulgaris dominated the co culture when the initial cell density of c vulgaris was higher than 15 105 cells ml regardless of the initial cell density of p subcapitata however c vulgaris became less dominant when its initial cell density was less than 15 105 cells ml fig 5b however unlike the control and 5 Œºg l copper exposed groups the competitive dominance of c vulgaris over p subcapitata was completely reversed at an exposure to 10 Œºg l of copper as seen in fig 5c the competitive dominance of c vulgaris tended to be relatively low even at high initial cell densities of c vulgaris and low initial cell densities of p subcapitata the likelihood of the competitive dominance of c vulgaris over p subcapitata was achieved only when the initial cell densities of both algal species were high these results suggested that high initial cell densities of both algal species could mitigate copper toxicity specifically in c vulgaris 5 3 simulation results on competitive response the competitive response reflecting the extent to which each algal species was affected in the presence of the competitor is shown in fig 6 a and b the competitive response of each species tended to be close to zero as the initial cell density increased in the control fig 6a and b indicating that the higher the initial cell density of a species in the co culture the greater the probability of its dominating the competitor the simulated results also reflected that in the 5 Œºg l copper exposed group the competitive response of c vulgaris was weaker than that of the control as the initial density of p subcapitata increased reflecting a decrease in contour line values fig 6d while the opposite was observed for p subcapitata fig 6c p subcapitata was able to grow under copper exposure even with a low initial cell density in the co culture and could achieve the same cell density as in the single culture regardless of its own initial density as well as that of a competitor even at 10 Œºg l copper exposure fig 6e the growth inhibition of c vulgaris in co culture was more severe than that in the single culture for most initial cell densities of both species fig 6f 5 4 simulation results on the time required to reach maximum algal density the simulation results showed that the time required to reach the maximum algal density increases from less than 10 d to more than 50 d as the copper concentration increases fig 7 in detail the time required to reach the maximum density of p subcapitata increased under the conditions of relatively low initial densities of both algal species and 5 Œºg l of copper exposure fig 7a and c at 10 Œºg l of copper exposure the initial density of p subcapitata directly affected the time required for it to reach its maximum density fig 7e on the other hand the time for c vulgaris to reach its maximum density at 5 Œºg l of copper exposure showed a pattern similar to that of p subcapitata fig 7c and d but the initial density of c vulgaris had a considerable influence on the required time in the control and 10 Œºg l copper exposure conditions fig 7b and f the purple areas in fig 7d and f show short times to reach maximum c vulgaris density but in fact this result was due to its suppressed growth and low maximum density as shown in the same area in fig 6d and f overall the initial density of each algal species and the level of copper exposure dramatically influenced the time required to achieve maximum algal density in a co culture condition 6 discussion in this study both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches were employed to investigate how various combinations of the initial cell densities of p subcapitata and c vulgaris and copper exposure conditions affected interspecific competition between these species the results showed that the degree of growth inhibition and competition in the co cultures varied with the competitor s initial cell density and copper exposure level which in turn resulted in shifts in the competitive dominance of each algal species in the given co cultures furthermore the simulation results showed that the initial density of the two competing species had different effects on the competitive response and the time required to reach the maximum algal density depending on the copper exposure level these results indicate that the result of interspecific competition between algal species in natural ecosystems is not simply determined by the superiority or inferiority of the species and will show complex patterns due to environmental conditions including time and space several studies have demonstrated that the ecological phenomena observed in freshwater ecosystems such as algal blooms and the dominance of a specific algal species could be explained by understanding the competition between algal species tameishi et al 2009 qiu et al 2011 however in their study the effect of initial algal density on the interspecific competition showed different results e g qiu et al 2011 initial density dependency tameishi et al 2009 initial density independency these conflicting results between studies might be due in part to the differences between the tested species but might also be due to the differences in the initial cell density of the species tested our study provided a detailed description of how various initial cell density combinations of p subcapitata and c vulgaris affect the interspecific competition through numerical simulations in a range of initial algal cell densities our study clearly showed that the initial density of each algal species is a driving factor determining the growth of the competing species in the absence of copper exposure however c vulgaris could hold a dominant position in the co culture regardless of the initial cell densities of both species this was because c vulgaris which is known to produce allelochemicals could regulate the growth of p subcapitata in the co culture resulting in its competitive advantage over p subcapitata this result is in line with the studies conducted by tillmann et al 2007 and gran√©li et al 2008 who reported that the higher initial cell density of the algal species producing allelochemicals the greater the influence on the competing species in the present study we also examined how various combinations of the initial cell densities of p subcapitata and c vulgaris and copper exposure levels affect interspecific competition although the inhibitory effect of c vulgaris on p subcapitata was strong enough to reduce the growth of p subcapitata in the absence of copper exposure the outcome in the co culture highly varied with the initial cell densities of the competitor and the copper concentrations to which it is exposed while the influx of contaminants into aquatic ecosystems is common little research has been done on the impact of contaminants on the intraspecific or interspecific competition among algal species l√ºrling and roessink 2006 reported that an exposure to the herbicide metribuzin could reverse the interspecific competition between microcystis aeruginosa and scenedesmus obliquus suggesting that the difference in sensitivity to contaminants could lead to a change in the algal species dominating aquatic ecosystems similarly our results showed that competitive dominance could be reversed when the algal species are exposed to copper especially to a concentration of 10 Œºg l copper although the mechanisms underlying the impact of copper exposure on chlorellin production by c vulgaris could not be fully identified in this study the initial cell density and copper exposure levels influenced the interspecific competition by changing the algal growth and the amount of producing chlorellin especially at 10 Œºg l of copper exposure the copper sensitive c vulgaris was excluded from the competition providing the competitive advantage to the copper resistant p subcapitata however this copper exposure induced competitive advantage of p subcapitata weakens as the initial density of both algal species increases this result indicates that increased initial cell densities of both algal species can mitigate copper toxicity specifically in c vulgaris in addition to the factors considered in this study a wide variety of factors can influence the interspecific competition among algal species as a result predicting the dominant algal species will be complicated by the environmental conditions varied in time and space scales e g seasonal environmental conditions spatial locations and size of habitats the predator population that feeds on algae will be affected by the dominant algal species and the community structure of the freshwater ecosystem will change over time this near chaotic complexity of the algal community known as the paradox of the plankton has been proposed by hutchinson 1961 this is one of the abstruse questions in ecology determining why plankton communities can never be at equilibrium in real ecosystems although many researchers have accepted the unpredictable complexity of the algal community the mathematical model can be a useful tool to gain a mechanistic understanding for connecting the observations from the individual level to ecosystems zhao et al 2008 sommer et al 2012 the present study to our knowledge is the first modeling approach to elucidate the influence of initial cell density and copper exposure on the interspecific competition between two algae species previously fergola et al 2007 and dellagreca et al 2010 showed the mathematical models mechanistically describing the role of allelochemicals in the interspecific competition between p subcapitata and c vulgaris our study has further enhanced their findings by incorporating the effects of initial cell density and copper exposure into the new model structure in addition the model was verified using the experimental data for a sufficient number of initial cell density combinations although the model was applied to p subcapitata and c vulgaris it will be possible to study interspecific competition among other algae species using the proposed model structure in this study the experimental observations and mathematical modeling were performed to explain the essential mechanism rather than the quantitative realism of the algal competition the proposed mathematical model is too simple to describe algal dynamics in aquatic ecosystems but is useful for simulating the effects of a wide range of factors on the interspecific competition that are difficult to observe experimentally the simulation results showed that the changes in initial density and copper exposure levels greatly influenced algal competition in terms of competitive dominance competitive response and time required to reach maximum algal density and clearly explained how much these factors affected the interspecific competition of each algal species given that initial density and copper exposure levels have a great impact on the interspecific competition between two algal species as shown in this study further studies of the impact of other factors are needed to understand interspecific competition in aquatic ecosystems acknowledgments this subject is

25272,the interspecific competition among algal species is an important process that can change the community structure in aquatic ecosystems however there is still a lack of understanding of the impact of various factors on interspecific competition in this study both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches were employed to investigate how various combinations of the initial cell densities of pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and chlorella vulgaris and copper exposure levels affect interspecific competition between these species in the simulation results c vulgaris appeared to be superior to p subcapitata in the absence of copper exposure however in the copper exposed groups the competitive positions of both algal species varied with the initial cell density and the copper exposure level in particular at the highest copper concentration 10 Œºg l c vulgaris became less competitive than p subcapitata in most initial cell density combinations resulting in a shift in competitive dominance this study clearly showed that the dominant species in the interspecific competition could be altered by the two factors studied herein the developed model provided a more detailed and intuitive understanding of the effects of the two factors on the interspecific competition by simulating the competition at various combinations of initial algal density and copper exposure levels in this study the initial algal density and copper exposure levels were selected as the factors influencing the interspecific competition between p subcapitata and c vulgaris but the proposed model could be used to study the effects of other toxicants on the interspecific competition between other algal species keywords allelopathy competitive dominance competitive response pseudokirchneriella subcapitata chlorella vulgaris 1 introduction interspecific competition is one of the fundamental processes determining community structure chase et al 2002 which in turn alters ecosystem function in particular an interspecific competition is observed more frequently in aquatic ecosystems than in terrestrial ecosystems connell 1983 and the interactions among prey are known to have a significant impact on high level predator populations garvey et al 1994 since algae play a crucial ecological role in freshwater ecosystems as the basis of many food chains and primary producers stoiber et al 2012 it is important to understand interspecific competition among algal species intensified interspecific competition between algal species can lead to reduced growth of individuals resulting in succession and shifts in algal community structure furthermore the impacts of algal competition are likely to cascade through trophic levels gran√©li et al 2008 which in turn eventually alter the biodiversity and community structure of freshwater ecosystems several studies have demonstrated that various factors such as allelochemicals hulot and huisman 2004 nutrition chakraborty et al 2008 initial algal cell density tameishi et al 2009 qiu et al 2011 predators carusela et al 2009 and toxicants l√ºrling and roessink 2006 are involved in algal species competition among these factors allelochemicals which are the chemical substances released by the algal species for inhibiting the growth of the other algal species and initial cell densities are the most widely studied several algal species can have competitive dominance over others by producing allelochemicals reviewed by gran√©li et al 2008 tameishi et al 2009 and qiu et al 2011 reported that the initial densities had a significant impact on the interspecific competition between prorocentrum minimum skeletonema costatum and chattonella antiqua akashiwo sanguinea respectively but kuwata and miyazaki 2000 reported no significant effect of the initial densities of microcystis novacekii and scenedesmus quadricauda on interspecific competition although conflicting results have been reported in the literature the initial algal cell density can have a significant direct or indirect impact on algal competition as it is linked to the quantity of the allelochemicals produced and preoccupancy exploitation of limited nutrients hulot and huisman 2004 another important factor is the presence of exogenous toxic substances algal populations are frequently exposed to various toxicants in the environment and are one of the most toxicant sensitive biota among aquatic organisms stoiber et al 2012 thus because different algal species have different sensitivities the dominant species in an aquatic ecosystem could change through the replacement of the sensitive species by the more resistant one l√ºrling and roessink 2006 toxicants could be an even more important factor than the other factors involved in algal species competition because they have adverse effects on both species simultaneously although the above mentioned factors might affect the interspecific competition among algae species in a complex manner no studies have considered the combined effects of these factors since there are limits to experimentally observing the effects of various combinations of factors on the interspecific competition between algal species a mathematical model can be a useful tool however to date no mathematical model has taken into account the influences of both initial algal densities and toxicants on algal competition the model proposed by uchida et al 1999 has been widely used to study the effects of initial algal density on interspecific competition yamasaki et al 2007 tameishi et al 2009 qiu et al 2011 however it is difficult to include the effects of other factors because the interactions between two algal species are simply represented by a single parameter as an interaction rate on the other hand the model proposed by fergola et al 2007 describes an allelopathic interaction in more detail by adding extra information on how an allelochemical concentration affects the interspecific competition but no other factors were considered dellagreca et al 2010 in addition several models have been used to study the effects of specific factors on algal competition e g nutrient limitation chakraborty et al 2008 predators carusela et al 2009 but these models cannot be used to study the influence of initial algal density and toxicants on interspecific competition since the structure of a mathematical model depends on the research subjects a new modeling approach is necessary to improve the understanding of how the combination of initial algal density and toxicants affect algal competition therefore in this study a new mathematical model was proposed and the influence of initial algal density and toxicant on interspecific competition was evaluated two freshwater algal species pseudokirchneriella subcapitata formerly known as rhaphidocelis subcapitata and selenastrum capricornutum and chlorella vulgaris were selected as model species because of their ecological relevance and availability silva et al 2009 machado et al 2015 the production of an allelopathic substance called chlorellin by c vulgaris makes it ideal for investigating the allelopathic competitive interactions fergola et al 2007 copper was chosen as a toxic substance because of its frequent detection in aquatic environments and high toxicity to various algal species flemming and trevors 1989 the objective of this study was to investigate how various combinations of initial cell densities of two algal species p subcapitata and c vulgaris and copper exposure affect interspecific competition in a closed system through both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches the conceptual diagram for interspecific competition between the two algal species and the flowchart of the study processes are shown in fig 1 to obtain the data sets for model calibration various combinations of initial cell densities of both algal species were monitored periodically over time under copper exposure conditions 0 5 and 10 Œºg l a mathematical model including the effects of initial density copper exposure levels and allelopathy was developed in order to explore their combined effects on the interspecific competition between the two algal species using the experimental data sets the model was calibrated to predict the density dynamics of the two algal species over time and the interspecific competition between the two species was evaluated in terms of competitive dominance competitive response and time required to reach the maximum algal density 2 experiments 2 1 test algae and culture conditions two freshwater microalgal species p subcapitata strains ccap 278 4 and c vulgaris strains ag40003 were obtained from the culture collection of algae and protozoa ccap scottish marine institute uk and the korean collection for type cultures kctc korea research institute of bioscience and biotechnology korea respectively the growth medium was prepared in accordance with the united stated environment protection agency epa method 1003 0 epa 2002 both algal species were maintained in separate 200 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of synthetic algal medium epa 2002 the flasks were incubated at 20 1 c with a 16 h light 8 h dark photoperiod under illumination at 70 Œºmol photons m2 s with cool white fluorescent light tld 30 w philips the maximum densities of p subcapitata and c vulgaris were approximately 4 0 106 and 4 0 107 cells ml respectively under these culture conditions the flasks were hand agitated twice daily to minimize flocculation and clumping of algal cells all glassware used in the algal culture maintenance and experiments were completely immersed in 10 nitric acid for at least 1 d and was thoroughly rinsed with distilled water before use 2 2 experimental designs the copper stock solution was prepared by dissolving the reagent grade copper ii sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o 99 purity sigma aldrich in the synthetic algal medium the stock solution was diluted with the synthetic medium to make the final copper concentrations of 5 and 10 Œºg l these copper concentrations were selected based on our previous study unpublished data in which the growths of p subcapitata and c vulgaris were severely inhibited when exposed to 15 Œºg l or higher concentrations of copper in addition franklin et al 2002 reported that the 72 h ec50 values of copper for the growth inhibition of p subcapitata and chlorella sp were 17 and 16 Œºg l respectively the ph values of the test solutions were adjusted with 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh to remain in the range of 7 5 0 1 to investigate how various initial cell density combinations of p subcapitata and c vulgaris affect the interspecific competition in either the presence treatments or absence of copper exposure control algal growth experiments were conducted in 100 ml glass beakers filled with 70 ml medium with several combinations of initial cell densities to adjust the initial cell density of each species both algal species were harvested at steady growth phase by centrifuging at 600 g for 5 min and then resuspended in the growth medium the initial cell densities of p subcapitata and c vulgaris were adjusted to range from 3 0 104 to 3 5 105 cells ml and 2 0 105 to 4 0 106 cells ml respectively table 1 the combinations of initial cell densities were determined to include various p subcapitata c vulgaris ratios in the estimation of model parameters as reported previously hu and zhang 1993 franklin et al 2002 the initial cell density was set to a relatively high value in adverse conditions i e copper exposure in each combination five replicates were performed during the experiments all beakers were sealed with parafilm polyethylene to prevent the evaporation of the test medium and were kept at the same environmental conditions as those used for culture maintenance the beakers were shaken by hand twice a day the algal cell densities were checked periodically 1 16 d interval over the 78 days until the algal cell density in each beaker was close to zero the number of algal cells in each combination was counted using a hemocytometer marienfeld germany under an optical microscope e200 nikon japan by taking 5 Œºl of algal suspension from each test beaker four repeated measurements for each beaker no additional process was applied to distinguish the species because of the apparent differences in shape and size between the two algal species p subcapitata curved and twisted shape 8 14 Œºm in length c vulgaris spherical shape 5 9 Œºm in diameter 3 model formulation 3 1 generic assumption a mechanistic model that describes the population dynamics of each algal species consists of two phases growth and decline it is assumed that the habitat quality s the capacity of an environment to provide conditions appropriate for individual and population persistence is continuously reduced by a proportion to the population cell densities and growth rates at a given time in the given closed co culture as the cell density increases the nutrients in the beaker continue to decrease and the toxic wastes continue to accumulate subsequently degrading habitat quality thus s scaled to lie within a range of 0 1 reflecting habitat quality 0 fully degraded 1 initial condition is given as follows 1 d s d t m p s x d x d t n p s m c v y d y d t n c v where x and y are the cell densities cells ml m ps and m cv are the habitat depletion rates ml cells of the cell maintenance n ps and n cv are the habitat depletion rates ml cells of the growth of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively therefore an algal population continues growing when s is greater than zero growth phase and goes to extinction decline phase when s reaches zero 3 2 growth phase the growth phases of both algal species in the given closed co culture can be described as follows 2 d x d t Œº p s s x d p s x d y d x Œº c v s y d c v y where Œºps and Œºcv are the specific growth rates 1 d and d ps and d cv are the mortalities 1 d of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively since c vulgaris can produce allelochemicals chlorellin that inhibit the growth of both c vulgaris and p subcapitata the growth rate of each species can be expressed by incorporating the chlorellin concentration dependent growth rate growth rate exp rp into eq 2 fergola et al 2007 here r is the inhibition constant and p is chlorellin concentration therefore eq 2 can be rearranged as follows 3 d x d t Œº p s exp r p s p s x d p s x d y d x Œº c v exp r c v p s y d c v y where r ps and r cv are the inhibition constants 1 Œºg of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively to embed the cell density and growth rate dependent chlorellin product formation rate into the growth phase model the luedeking piret equation luedeking and piret 1959 was employed this can be expressed as follows 4 d p d t Œ± d y d t Œ≤ y where y is the cell density cells ml of c vulgaris Œ± and Œ≤ are the growth related and unrelated chlorellin formation coefficients Œºg cells respectively yang et al 2011 who studied the relationship between algal growth and its material formation in detail reported that the contribution of material formation on the growth unrelated coefficient was negligible hence eq 4 can be simplified as follows 5 d p d t Œ± d y d t in addition franklin et al 2002 suggested that the initial algal cell density was a determining factor affecting the available copper fraction in the media through algal cellular adsorption which in turn affects copper toxicity in p subcapitata and c vulgaris therefore once the available copper is taken up by the initial algal cells it has negligible toxic effect on their growth rate over the exposure duration because of the depletion of the available copper thus the toxic potency of copper can be assumed reciprocal to the initial cell density and hence eq 3 reflecting these assumptions can be rearranged as follows 6 d x d t Œº p s exp r p s p 1 k p s t p s x 0 t c v y 0 s x d p s x d y d t Œº c v exp r c v p 1 k c v t p s x 0 t c v y 0 s y d c v y where k ps and k cv are the copper toxicity coefficients cells ml t ps and t cv are the specific contribution rates on copper bioavailability and x 0 and y 0 are the initial cell densities cells ml of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively 3 3 decline phase to formulate the decline phase of each algal species in the given closed co culture it is assumed that the cell density of each algal species will decline and eventually become zero as the habitat quality s in the given condition degrades i e s is close to or equal to zero because of nutrient depletion and toxic waste accumulation thus the decline phase model considering the s dependent and natural mortality can be expressed as follows 7 d x d t a p s x m x x m x d p s x d y d t a c v y m y y m y d c v y where a ps and a cv are the algal specific density decrease rates 1 d and x m and y m are the maximum cell densities cells ml of p subcapitata and c vulgaris under the given closed co cultivation conditions respectively 4 model calibration local sensitivity analysis and simulation the four ordinary differential equations that describe the time dependent algal cell density degradation rate of the habitat quality and chlorellin formation rate can be described as follows 8 d x d t d p s x x Œº p s exp r p s p 1 k p s t p s x 0 t c v y 0 s f o r s 0 a p s x m x x m otherwise d y d t d c v y y Œº c v exp r c v p 1 k c v t p s x 0 t c v y 0 s f o r s 0 a c v y m y y m otherwise d

vulgaris respectively s is the habitat quality and p is the chlorellin concentration the four differential equations were simulated using the powersim studio powersim software as norway software employing the euler integration method with 0 01 d time step to calibrate the model parameters the values of the parameters minimizing the sum of square error the difference between the observed and predicted cell densities of p subcapitata and c vulgaris were estimated using the powersim solver analysis tools a local sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the relative contribution of the input parameters that influence the model output e g maximum algal cell density the model was implemented by incrementing or decrementing the individual parameter values by 10 with the other parameters fixed and then calculating the changes in the main model output johnston et al 2014 gonzalez et al 2015 the baseline of the sensitivity analysis was the model output calculated by using the estimated parameter values shown in table 2 the initial p subcapitata density of 2 0 105 cells ml and the initial c vulgaris density of 2 0 106 cells ml the parameters a ps and a cv which represent the specific density decrease rates of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively were excluded in the sensitivity analysis because these parameters affect algal density only in the decline phase the parameter sensitivity was expressed as a ratio of the relative change in the maximum algal cell density to the relative change in each parameter value to investigate how the initial cell density and copper exposure level affected the interspecific competition between the two algal species three indexes including the competitive dominance competitive response and time required to reach the maximum algal density were simulated by the calibrated model the competitive dominance was calculated as the log10 transformed ratio of the maximum cell density of c vulgaris to that of p subcapitata log10 c vulgaris p subcapitata at s 0 in the co culture thus when the calculated value is a positive or negative it means a competitive dominance of c vulgaris or p subcapitata respectively furthermore the competitive response index referred to herein as a cij in eq 9 proposed by fox 2002 was calculated based on each simulated algal cell density specifically the competitive response index in the control was calculated as follows 9 c i j k i n i j k i where cij is the competitive response of species i nij is the maximum cell density of species i in the co culture with a competitor j and ki is the maximum cell density of species i in the single culture a competitive response was considered a competitive exclusion if cij 1 or a facilitative effect if cij 0 similarly the effect of copper on the competitive response in the treatments was estimated using a modified version of eq 9 as follows 10 c i j c u k i n i j c u k i where cij cu is the competitive responses in the treatments copper exposed conditions ki is the maximum cell density of species i in the single culture and nij cu is the maximum cell density of species i with a competitor j in the co culture under copper exposure the closer the cij cu value is to 1 the greater the adverse effects of copper on the competitive responses of each algal species whereas the closer this value is to 0 the smaller the adverse effects on the competitive response for the competitive response calculations the maximum cell density of each algal species at s 0 as predicted by eq 8 was used the time required to reach the maximum algal density of each algal species was also predicted by eq 8 5 results 5 1 experimental results model calibration and sensitivity analysis experimental observations indicated that the degrees of growth inhibition of both algal species varied with the initial cell density of the competitor species figs 2 4 as shown in fig 2 the degree of growth inhibition of p subcapitata was greater than 70 and that of c vulgaris was less than 50 in the co culture compared with their maximum algal densities in the single culture it was clear that the higher the initial cell density of the competitor the higher the growth inhibition of the opponent in the co cultures in addition for both algal species the higher the initial cell density the shorter the time required to reach the maximum cell density fig 2d for p subcapitata fig 2c for c vulgaris both species began to decline after 20 days with a slight difference in their decline times and all initial cell density combinations in the control lasted for 45 60 days fig 2 when exposed to copper the degrees of growth inhibition of both algal species caused by their competitors were different from those observed in the control fig 3 at the copper concentration of 5 Œºg l the maximum cell densities of c vulgaris in the co cultures were less than 20 of that in the single culture except for the two combinations wherein the initial cell density of c vulgaris was extremely high however the maximum cell density of p subcapitata was 80 of that in the single culture in most initial density combinations except for two with extremely high initial cell densities with a copper exposure of 10 Œºg l p subcapitata grew close to the maximum cell density of a single culture in most combinations but the growth of c vulgaris was completely suppressed except when in combination with the highest initial cell densities for both algal species fig 4 a range of model input parameters obtained from the experiments was calibrated before simulating the model and the calibrated values are listed in table 2 the relationship between the predicted and observed cell density dynamics of the two algal species was significant with the coefficients of determination r 2 being larger than 0 96 for both p subcapitata and c vulgaris indicating that the developed models were adequately calibrated for the dynamics of both algal species figs 2 4 the results of the local sensitivity analysis are shown in table 3 in the control Œºps Œºcv and x 0 and Œºps Œºcv and m cv were found to be relatively important parameters affecting the cell density of p subcapitata and c vulgaris respectively similarly Œºps and Œºcv were found to be the most important parameters in the 5 Œºg l copper exposed group and the initial cell density of c vulgaris y 0 was also an important parameter determining the maximum cell densities of both algal species in the co culture on the other hand the parameters related to the effect of copper on p subcapitata and c vulgaris t ps and k cv and t cv respectively and the parameters related to the initial cell densities of both species x 0 and y 0 had the greatest effect on cell density in the 10 Œºg l copper exposed group 5 2 simulation results on competitive dominance when competitive dominance was calculated based on the simulated maximum cell density across a range of initial cell densities for both species c vulgaris showed competitive dominance over p subcapitata regardless of the initial cell densities of both species fig 5 a however it was also true that the higher the initial density of p subcapitata the greater the extent that the competitive dominance of c vulgaris over p subcapitata was offset the simulation results for the 5 Œºg l copper exposure showed that c vulgaris dominated the co culture when the initial cell density of c vulgaris was higher than 15 105 cells ml regardless of the initial cell density of p subcapitata however c vulgaris became less dominant when its initial cell density was less than 15 105 cells ml fig 5b however unlike the control and 5 Œºg l copper exposed groups the competitive dominance of c vulgaris over p subcapitata was completely reversed at an exposure to 10 Œºg l of copper as seen in fig 5c the competitive dominance of c vulgaris tended to be relatively low even at high initial cell densities of c vulgaris and low initial cell densities of p subcapitata the likelihood of the competitive dominance of c vulgaris over p subcapitata was achieved only when the initial cell densities of both algal species were high these results suggested that high initial cell densities of both algal species could mitigate copper toxicity specifically in c vulgaris 5 3 simulation results on competitive response the competitive response reflecting the extent to which each algal species was affected in the presence of the competitor is shown in fig 6 a and b the competitive response of each species tended to be close to zero as the initial cell density increased in the control fig 6a and b indicating that the higher the initial cell density of a species in the co culture the greater the probability of its dominating the competitor the simulated results also reflected that in the 5 Œºg l copper exposed group the competitive response of c vulgaris was weaker than that of the control as the initial density of p subcapitata increased reflecting a decrease in contour line values fig 6d while the opposite was observed for p subcapitata fig 6c p subcapitata was able to grow under copper exposure even with a low initial cell density in the co culture and could achieve the same cell density as in the single culture regardless of its own initial density as well as that of a competitor even at 10 Œºg l copper exposure fig 6e the growth inhibition of c vulgaris in co culture was more severe than that in the single culture for most initial cell densities of both species fig 6f 5 4 simulation results on the time required to reach maximum algal density the simulation results showed that the time required to reach the maximum algal density increases from less than 10 d to more than 50 d as the copper concentration increases fig 7 in detail the time required to reach the maximum density of p subcapitata increased under the conditions of relatively low initial densities of both algal species and 5 Œºg l of copper exposure fig 7a and c at 10 Œºg l of copper exposure the initial density of p subcapitata directly affected the time required for it to reach its maximum density fig 7e on the other hand the time for c vulgaris to reach its maximum density at 5 Œºg l of copper exposure showed a pattern similar to that of p subcapitata fig 7c and d but the initial density of c vulgaris had a considerable influence on the required time in the control and 10 Œºg l copper exposure conditions fig 7b and f the purple areas in fig 7d and f show short times to reach maximum c vulgaris density but in fact this result was due to its suppressed growth and low maximum density as shown in the same area in fig 6d and f overall the initial density of each algal species and the level of copper exposure dramatically influenced the time required to achieve maximum algal density in a co culture condition 6 discussion in this study both experimental and mathematical modeling approaches were employed to investigate how various combinations of the initial cell densities of p subcapitata and c vulgaris and copper exposure conditions affected interspecific competition between these species the results showed that the degree of growth inhibition and competition in the co cultures varied with the competitor s initial cell density and copper exposure level which in turn resulted in shifts in the competitive dominance of each algal species in the given co cultures furthermore the simulation results showed that the initial density of the two competing species had different effects on the competitive response and the time required to reach the maximum algal density depending on the copper exposure level these results indicate that the result of interspecific competition between algal species in natural ecosystems is not simply determined by the superiority or inferiority of the species and will show complex patterns due to environmental conditions including time and space several studies have demonstrated that the ecological phenomena observed in freshwater ecosystems such as algal blooms and the dominance of a specific algal species could be explained by understanding the competition between algal species tameishi et al 2009 qiu et al 2011 however in their study the effect of initial algal density on the interspecific competition showed different results e g qiu et al 2011 initial density dependency tameishi et al 2009 initial density independency these conflicting results between studies might be due in part to the differences between the tested species but might also be due to the differences in the initial cell density of the species tested our study provided a detailed description of how various initial cell density combinations of p subcapitata and c vulgaris affect the interspecific competition through numerical simulations in a range of initial algal cell densities our study clearly showed that the initial density of each algal species is a driving factor determining the growth of the competing species in the absence of copper exposure however c vulgaris could hold a dominant position in the co culture regardless of the initial cell densities of both species this was because c vulgaris which is known to produce allelochemicals could regulate the growth of p subcapitata in the co culture resulting in its competitive advantage over p subcapitata this result is in line with the studies conducted by tillmann et al 2007 and gran√©li et al 2008 who reported that the higher initial cell density of the algal species producing allelochemicals the greater the influence on the competing species in the present study we also examined how various combinations of the initial cell densities of p subcapitata and c vulgaris and copper exposure levels affect interspecific competition although the inhibitory effect of c vulgaris on p subcapitata was strong enough to reduce the growth of p subcapitata in the absence of copper exposure the outcome in the co culture highly varied with the initial cell densities of the competitor and the copper concentrations to which it is exposed while the influx of contaminants into aquatic ecosystems is common little research has been done on the impact of contaminants on the intraspecific or interspecific competition among algal species l√ºrling and roessink 2006 reported that an exposure to the herbicide metribuzin could reverse the interspecific competition between microcystis aeruginosa and scenedesmus obliquus suggesting that the difference in sensitivity to contaminants could lead to a change in the algal species dominating aquatic ecosystems similarly our results showed that competitive dominance could be reversed when the algal species are exposed to copper especially to a concentration of 10 Œºg l copper although the mechanisms underlying the impact of copper exposure on chlorellin production by c vulgaris could not be fully identified in this study the initial cell density and copper exposure levels influenced the interspecific competition by changing the algal growth and the amount of producing chlorellin especially at 10 Œºg l of copper exposure the copper sensitive c vulgaris was excluded from the competition providing the competitive advantage to the copper resistant p subcapitata however this copper exposure induced competitive advantage of p subcapitata weakens as the initial density of both algal species increases this result indicates that increased initial cell densities of both algal species can mitigate copper toxicity specifically in c vulgaris in addition to the factors considered in this study a wide variety of factors can influence the interspecific competition among algal species as a result predicting the dominant algal species will be complicated by the environmental conditions varied in time and space scales e g seasonal environmental conditions spatial locations and size of habitats the predator population that feeds on algae will be affected by the dominant algal species and the community structure of the freshwater ecosystem will change over time this near chaotic complexity of the algal community known as the paradox of the plankton has been proposed by hutchinson 1961 this is one of the abstruse questions in ecology determining why plankton communities can never be at equilibrium in real ecosystems although many researchers have accepted the unpredictable complexity of the algal community the mathematical model can be a useful tool to gain a mechanistic understanding for connecting the observations from the individual level to ecosystems zhao et al 2008 sommer et al 2012 the present study to our knowledge is the first modeling approach to elucidate the influence of initial cell density and copper exposure on the interspecific competition between two algae species previously fergola et al 2007 and dellagreca et al 2010 showed the mathematical models mechanistically describing the role of allelochemicals in the interspecific competition between p subcapitata and c vulgaris our study has further enhanced their findings by incorporating the effects of initial cell density and copper exposure into the new model structure in addition the model was verified using the experimental data for a sufficient number of initial cell density combinations although the model was applied to p subcapitata and c vulgaris it will be possible to study interspecific competition among other algae species using the proposed model structure in this study the experimental observations and mathematical modeling were performed to explain the essential mechanism rather than the quantitative realism of the algal competition the proposed mathematical model is too simple to describe algal dynamics in aquatic ecosystems but is useful for simulating the effects of a wide range of factors on the interspecific competition that are difficult to observe experimentally the simulation results showed that the changes in initial density and copper exposure levels greatly influenced algal competition in terms of competitive dominance competitive response and time required to reach maximum algal density and clearly explained how much these factors affected the interspecific competition of each algal species given that initial density and copper exposure levels have a great impact on the interspecific competition between two algal species as shown in this study further studies of the impact of other factors are needed to understand interspecific competition in aquatic ecosystems acknowledgments this subject is

ecological networks nutrients dissolved oxygen hysteresis regime shifts 1 introduction regime shifts in ecological systems are defined as rapid changes in the spatial or temporal dynamics of an otherwise resilient system ecological regime shifts are caused by slow directional changes in one or more underlying state variables such as species abundance dissolved oxygen content or nutrients scheffer et al 2001 2009 regime shifts are of particular concern when the return rate to a previous and perhaps more desirable state is slow or requires a larger input of energy or resources relative to what initiated the state change i e hysteresis in the last several years many researchers have suggested that a wide range of ecological systems are poised to tip into new regimes scheffer et al 2009 petraitis and dudgeon 2016 or even that we are approaching a planetary tipping point barnosky et al 2012 but see brook et al 2013 because identifying changes in the underlying state variables of most ecosystems require high frequency long term measurements wilson et al 2013 our understanding of the causes and consequences of ecological regime shifts has progressed relatively slowly more rapid progress could be achieved by working with well understood systems that can be described mathematically and manipulated experimentally over shorter time scales it is rare to find an ecological system in which the occurrence of a regime shift and its cause and effect relationship with one or more underlying environmental drivers is unambiguous bestelmeyer et al 2011 this is primarily because long time series of observations collected at meaningfully large spatial scales are required to identify the environmental driver s its relationship to the response variable of interest the stability of each state the breakpoint between them and hysteresis of the return time to the original state petraitis and dudgeon 2016 bestelmeyer et al 2011 detailed modeling and decades of observations and experiments have led to a thorough understanding of one canonical example of an ecological regime shift the rapid shift from oligotrophic low nutrient to eutrophic high nutrient states in lakes e g carpenter and brock 2006 carpenter et al 2011 the primary difficulties with using lakes as models for studying alternative states and ecological regime shifts are their large size which precludes extensive replication carpenter 1996 and the long time scales decades required to observe a regime shift subsequent ecosystem hysteresis and eventual recovery mittlebach et al 1995 contamin and ellison 2009 models of lake ecosystems and their food webs and associated empirical data have revealed that recovery of lakes from a eutrophic to an oligotrophic state can be very slow on the order of decades to centuries contamin and ellison 2009 and depends not only on slowing or reversing directional changes in underlying state variables but also on the internal feedback dynamics of the system other aquatic systems including fisheries biggs et al 2009 rocky intertidal communities and coral reefs petraitis and dudgeon 2016 have provided additional empirical support for these model results in terms of both dynamics and duration dakos et al 2012 in a previous study we experimentally demonstrated that organic matter loading i e the addition of excess insect prey to pitchers can cause a shift from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions in a naturally occurring microecosystem the water filled leaves of the northern or purple pitcher plant sarracenia purpurea l sirota et al 2013 we use the term microecosystem here because the pitcher plant and its inquiline food web is a naturally occurring co evolved community of organisms which is not necessarily the case for microcosms odum 1996 in the typically five trophic level sarracenia microecosystem bacteria reproduce rapidly and drive the nutrient cycling dynamics butler et al 2008 prey additions cause shifts from oligotrophic to eutrophic states in hours or days rather than years or decades further the comparatively small volume of individual pitchers the ease of growing them in greenhouses and the occurrence of large experimentally manipulable populations in the field srivastava et al 2004 have allowed for replicated studies of trophic dynamics and regime shifts in a whole ecosystem here we build on the original mathematical model of the sarracenia microecosystem sirota et al 2013 estimating parameter values using new empirical data and introducing more realism into the underlying environmental drivers of the model we then use sensitivity analysis to identify the model parameters that most strongly control the dynamics of the system we illustrate that once organic matter input is stopped the sarracenia microecosystem like large lakes can eventually overcome the hysteresis in the system and return to an oligotrophic state we conclude that the mathematical model illustrates dynamic behaviors that are qualitatively similar to models of regime shifts in lakes and other ecosystems and we suggest that the sarracenia microecosystem is useful model for studying ecological regime shifts in real time 2

out wash plains schnell 2002 their leaves are modified into pitchers arber 1941 tubular structures that attract and capture arthropods and occasionally small vertebrate prey e g ellison and gotelli 2009 butler et al 2005 in the pitchers prey are shredded by obligate pitcher inhabiting arthropods including histiostomatid sarraceniopus mites and larvae of sarcophagid fletcherimyia fletcheri and chironomid flies metrocnemius knabi jones 1923 addicott 1974 heard 1994 the shredded organic matter is further decomposed and mineralized by a diverse assemblage of microbes including protozoa cochran stafira and von ende 1998 yeasts boynton 2012 and bacteria peterson et al 2008 unlike other species of sarracenia that also secrete and use digestive enzymes to extract nutrients from their captured prey s purpurea pitchers secrete digestive enzymes for only a fraction of their lifespan gallie and chang 1997 instead s purpurea relies on its aquatic food web to decompose the prey and mineralize their nutrients butler and ellison 2007 as a result the rainwater filled pitchers of s purpurea are best considered a detrital based brown ecosystems in which bacterially mediated nutrient cycling determines whether it is in an oligotrophic or eutrophic state sirota et al 2013 butler et al 2008 bradshaw and creelman 1984 2 2 oxygen dynamics in lakes and pitchers oxygen dynamics in both lakes

function f x determines the shape of the switch between the states and the degree of hysteresis following scheffer et al 2001 we used a hill function for f x 2 f x x p x p h p the hill function provides a simple model that can produce threshold behaviors the dynamics of the state variable x is determined by parameters p and h which determine the rate of change and the inflection point of the curve respectively fig 1 a if p is set such that more than one possible state exists for the system h determines the threshold for the transition between these states when viewed in phase space fig 1b the transition between states can be seen as a path traversed by the system between distinct regions i e phases in part because of this threshold property the hill function has been applied to systems ranging from biochemistry and microbiology to ecology whose dynamics depend on a limiting resource e g mulder and hendriks 2014 we modeled the dynamics of the trophic state of the sarracenia microecosystem using an equation of the same underlying form as eq 1 3 x t 1 a t a t photosynthesis m a t w t 1 w t 1 k w bod d t x t diffusion each model term is described below and summarized in table 1 the model eq 3 of the sarracenia microecosystem fig 2 a is made up of the two main terms production of oxygen by photosynthesis and use of oxygen respiration during decomposition bod biological oxygen demand the pitcher fluid is oxygenated x at each discrete time step t in min as the plant photosynthesizes a t the value of a t is determined by sunlight which we modeled as a truncated sine function producing photosynthetically active radiation par fig 2b and by the maximum photosynthetic rate a max fig 2c which leads to the production of dissolved oxygen in the pitcher fluid fig 2d photoautotrophic bacteria but not algae have been detected in a recent molecular study of the proteome of s purpurea inquiline communities however the total number of peptides mapping to these bacterial species was low relative to other species in the community northrop et al 2017 thus although our model does not explicitly account for other photosynthetic organisms these previous findings suggest that their contributions to the oxygen dynamics of the pitcher plant fluid are likely to be small relative to that of the pitcher plant itself decomposition of shredded prey by bacteria requires oxygen the oxygen demand from respiration is modeled by the bod term in eq 3 the parameter m is the basal metabolic respiration of the food web with no prey to decompose in the system adding prey w induces decomposition which we model as a negative exponential function with rate parameter Œ≤ and a constant w maximum prey mass decomposed over 48 h using eq 4 and illustrated in fig 2e 4 w t 1 w t e Œ≤ w bacterial populations increase at a rate determined by a half saturation function with parameter k w eq 3 which increases bod and the depletion of oxygen from the pitcher fluid fig 2f demand of the food web for oxygen i e bod depends on the decomposition rate Œ≤ and the shape parameter k w but only when prey is present in the system w t 1 0 in eq 3 when prey is absent i e w t 1 0 bod terms simplify by multiplication to the basal metabolic rate m photosynthesis may be limited by available nutrients primarily nitrogen and phosphorus givnish et al 1984 ellison 2006 that are mineralized by bacteria from the prey butler et al 2008 photosynthesis is augmented a t by nutrient mineralization rate s we model a t as a saturating function with bounds determined by the range terms a min and a max s and the point of saturation d 5 a t 1 a t a max a min 1 e s n t d a min the other impact of prey addition and subsequent decomposition by the food web is the release of nutrients into the pitcher fluid the mineralization variable n t eq 5 which is modeled as proportional to the product of the amount of oxygen and prey in the system i e n t 1 c w t x t where c is a constant of proportionality creates a feedback from decomposition to oxygen production by the plant i e the path in fig 2a from the food web to nutrients to pitcher to oxygen and back to the food web thus the mineralization term couples respiration oxygen depletion to photosynthesis oxygen production when prey is introduced to the system and the food web begins to decompose the prey and release nutrients into the pitcher fluid finally a small amount of oxygen diffuses into the pitcher fluid directly from the atmosphere d x however the diffusion rate is generally so low that it is negligible relative to changes resulting from photosynthesis and bod 2 3 estimating decomposition rate we used data from a greenhouse pitcher feeding experiment to estimate the decomposition parameter the experiment was conducted over 35 days starting on july 6 2015 in a temperature controlled greenhouse at the university of vermont s biological research complex burlington vermont usa eighteen newly formed pitchers 8 ml in volume were rinsed with deionized water and randomly assigned to one of three organic matter addition treatments 0 0 0 5 or 5 0 mg ml 1 of pitcher fluid pitcher fluid was collected from randomly selected pitchers at molly bog morristown vermont usa 44 500 n 72 642 w on the morning of 6 july 2015 the fluid was transported to the greenhouse filtered through the 30 micron frit bed of a chromatography column biorad hercules california usa to remove larger organisms homogenized and added to experimental pitchers in the greenhouse pitchers were loaded with a single pulse of organic matter every morning for the first four days in this experiment and following darwin 1875 the organic matter was bovine serum albumin bsa dna from salmon testes at a concentration of 1 5 Œºg l 1 of bsa and trace elements potassium calcium sodium magnesium and manganese in a ratio of 1 0 115 0 044 0 026 0 0001 in a pilot study bsa yielded similar changes in dissolved oxygen as we had obtained previously using ground wasps as organic matter sirota et al 2013 and its use enabled us to measure changes in organic matter content via a simple bradford assay and in a pilot study yielded similar changes in dissolved oxygen as we had obtained previously using ground wasps as organic matter sirota et al 2013 three 100 Œºl aliquots of pitcher fluid were sampled from single pitchers of each of 14 individual plants sampling was conducted twice a day from day 0 to day 20 at 8 30 am and 5 00 pm 2 h once per day from day 20 to day 28 at 8 30 am 2 h and once each on days 30 31 33 and 35 8 30 am 2 h prior to sampling the pitcher fluid was stirred with the pipette submerged to get fluid representative of an average of the entire pitcher during sampling care was taken to minimize the introduction of additional oxygen from the sampling process itself pitcher fluid was topped off with deionized water after sampling to keep initial pitcher volumes consistent over the course of the 35 days the initial volumes varied from 8 ml to 28 6 ml with a mean of 16 7 ml and standard deviation of 4 82 ml although we did control for the water taken with each sample we did not adjust for the removal of nutrients and microscopic organisms that occurred at each sampling samples were centrifuged at 13000g after which the supernatant containing soluble bsa was removed placed in a sterile tube and frozen at 80 c until analyzed a simple bradford assay bradford 1976 was used to determine the concentration of bsa in each of the pitcher fluid samples the assay was done using bradford reagent vwr and the absorbance of each sample was measured on a biophotometer plus spectrophotometer eppendorf at an optical density of 600 nm samples were read randomly on the spectrophotometer to avoid reaction time as a confounding variable sample concentrations were determined by comparison to standard curves generated using r r core team 2016 we used an empirical least squares estimator lse approach to generate the best fitting values for the decomposition parameter Œ≤ in eq 4 given the quantity of prey added in the experiment and the duration of the prey addition as k w is not a part of the decomposition function we did not vary it during parameter estimation and model fitting we then ran a series of 35 day simulations equivalent to the run time of the prey addition experiment in which Œ≤ was sampled from a grid of values ranging from 1e 8 to 0 0007 and the amount of prey in the simulation was recorded at each simulated minute for each run the sum of squared errors sse was recorded as sim obs 2 the Œ≤ that minimized the sse in each simulation was considered to be the best fit value for each replicate pitcher n 12 all model fitting was also done using r r core team 2016 2 4 sensitivity analysis we used a sensitivity analysis in which we varied the prey addition rate w decomposition rate Œ≤ and the half saturation constant k w to explore the behavior of the microecosystem model across a wide range of parameter space rather than set combinations of fixed values for the three parameters of interest we sampled the model parameter space by drawing values independently from uniform distributions k w u 0 0001 3 Œ≤ u 1 0e 6 2 0e 3 and w u 0 100 to characterize baseline oligotrophic oxygen concentrations for each combination of Œ≤ and k w we ran one simulation in which no prey was added to the system w 0 in all simulations n 15 000 variables were initialized to 0 with the exception of oxygen x which was initialized using the photosynthesis term x 0 7 55 simulated prey additions occurred at mid day on days 4 6 i e t 6480 to t 9360 each simulation ran for 30 simulated days 43 200 min and output was saved for each simulated minute the simulations were initialized using a random sample of parameter values and run in parallel because the model is completely deterministic the resulting runs can be reproduced by starting the simulations with the exact values used to initialize and parameterize the models to aid in the detection of the impact of the most important parameters and variables in all simulations we set some parameter values to zero which altered the model in the following two ways first we ignored the d x t term because we assumed that the amount of oxygen diffusing directly into the pitcher fluid from the atmosphere would be orders of magnitude lower than oxygen produced by pitcher photosynthesis kingsolver 1979 second we noted that since the basal metabolic respiration of the food web parameter m is an additive constant any change in the value of the constant m basal respiration of the microbial community would result only in a proportional change in value of x not in the shape i e dx dt of the oxygen production over time thus we could set m 0 without loss of generality by setting m 0 we also observed that the photosynthetic augmentation term a t influenced photosynthesis a t and bod w t 1 w t 1 k w identically therefore the parameters s and d in eq 5 could be set as constants in the sensitivity analysis by ignoring diffusion setting m 0 and fixing s and d we reduced the dimensionality of the sensitivity analysis to three w Œ≤ and k w which eased the interpretation of the results we calculated two measures of the state of the system from the time series of oxygen concentration x t hypoxia and return rate we defined hypoxia in the model to be an oxygen concentration of 1 6 mg l 1 which is the median lethal o2 concentration o2 for aquatic animals vaquer sunyer and duarte 2008 we measured the return rate of the system as the linear trend in o2 i e after removing the daily cycle in oxygen resulting from photosynthesis across the entire simulation using pearson s correlation coefficient although the return trajectory can be non linear the linear trend measures the gross trends of returning positive little impact of feeding zero or remaining at depressed oxygen levels 2 5 code availability and execution the model was coded in the r programming language r core team 2016 the 15 000 model runs for the sensitivity analysis were run on the odyssey supercomputer cluster at harvard university research computing group fas division of science cambridge massachusetts data code for the simulations and output of analyses are available in the harvard forest data archive harvardforest fas harvard edu harvard forest data archive 3 results the equation representing decomposition and bod resembles the hill function in a general model of state changes with hysteresis eqs 1 and 2 in general when a hill function is used in a basic alternative states model e g rf x b in eq 1 the inflection point e g half saturation constant k w determines the threshold fig 1a thus modeling decomposition and bod using a hill function provided us with sufficient flexibility to yield a variety of state changes the simulations with the model produced dynamics observed in the empirical pitcher plant microecosystem because photosynthesis is nutrient limited in sarracenia ellison 2006 addition of prey increased modeled photosynthesis fig 3 a relative to oligotrophic prey free pitchers in the oligotrophic state and when no prey was added bod remained low throughout the entire simulation black line in fig 3b after prey was added on for example days 4 6 t 6480 to t 9360 min the system jumped into its alternative state bod increased rapidly then declined slowly as prey was mineralized grey line in fig 3b the combination of the smooth slow recovery response of photosynthesis to prey addition and the abrupt shift in bod following prey addition fig 3a and b resulted in an abrupt shift in the system from an oxygenated state into an anoxic state and a very slow hysteretic recovery fig 3c the hysteresis of the system was apparent when oxygen concentration was plotted as a time lagged phase plot lag 1440 min starting at t 720 which shows the change in oxygen following addition of prey at t 6480 and the slow return due to high bod fig 3d these results were corroborated by observations from field and greenhouse experiments in which oxygen was observed to decline with the capture or addition of insect prey to the pitcher sirota et al 2013 and demonstrate the presence of both state changes and hysteresis i e fig 3d for at least some parameterizations of the model the parameter fitting and sensitivity analysis revealed several key effects of the parameters that we varied first the lse model fitting procedure resulted in an estimate for Œ≤ of x 0 00041 0 0004 se fig 4 vertical lines second varying Œ≤ had a large effect both on the percent time spent in an hypoxic state and on the return rate steeper contours with increasing Œ≤ in fig 4 last varying the amount of prey by two orders of magnitude produced a sharp threshold for the effect of varying Œ≤ on hypoxia and return rate fig 4 although varying Œ≤ has a potentially larger effect on the dynamics of the microecosystem than varying k w the latter played an important role in determining the return trajectory of the oxygen for simulations with lower values of k w the oxygen concentration was still exponentially increasing when the simulation ended fig 5 a relative to simulations with higher k w the return rate was faster when Œ≤ was low enough and there was prey i e w t remaining in the pitcher at the last observed time fig 5b thus in this part of the parameter space if another round of feeding were to occur at a similar level of prey input the system would never recover and would remain in or near an hypoxic state 4 discussion general theoretical work in complex systems has suggested that the definition of system boundaries is arbitrary and carries the potential for system dynamics to be mechanistically connected to but unpredictable from lower levels or scales of organization ulanowicz 2012 levine et al 2016 however others have argued that food web dynamics of whole ecosystems can be inferred from the components i e motifs and modules of these ecosystems mccann 2012 overall our model of the sarracenia microecosystem supports the latter assertion a focus on particular pathways e g photosynthesis decomposition etc reproduced the non linear behavior of its oxygen dynamics including state changes and hysteresis the results of the sensitivity analysis also revealed that the carrying capacity of the bacterial community as simulated by the effect of k w could contribute to observed non linear state changes of the sarracenia microecosystem predictions based on the model are highly sensitive to changes in the parameterization of decomposition e g Œ≤ in the initial parameterization of this model we started with an empirical estimate of decomposition rate in which 99 of the average amount of prey captured could be decomposed in a single day sirota et al 2013 baiser et al 2011 this is extremely rapid decomposition relative to a set of 58 previously published food webs lau et al 2017 in which 1 27 66 2 of available detritus or organic matter is decomposed each day when we set the decomposition parameter Œ≤ equal to 2 57e 6 the overall decomposition rate approached the mean of the published food webs 24 22 2 79 se this value for Œ≤ is within the parameter space that we observed experimentally and used in our sensitivity analysis and suggests that insights gained from the sarracenia microecosystem should be scalable to larger systems although the dynamics of the sarracenia microecosystem share similarities with lake stream and other large scale ecosystems there are several differences that should be noted first oxygen levels in the pitcher plant are dynamically controlled by photosynthesis of the plant that serves as a strong driver of oxygen levels in lakes the primary oxygen production is carried out by phytoplankton which are immersed in the aquatic system second lake food webs are green i e plant based whereas pitcher plant food webs are brown detritus based butler et al 2008 in lakes the shift to a eutrophic state occurs through addition of limiting nutrients usually n or p accumulation of producer biomass that is uncontrolled by herbivores see wood et al 2017 and subsequent decomposition that increases biological oxygen demand carpenter et al 1995 chislock et al 2013 the sarracenia microecosystem s brown food web also experiences an increase in oxygen demand and microbial activity however this occurs during the breakdown of detritus that is characteristic of its shift from an oligotrophic to a eutrophic state sirota et al 2013 even though the source of the nutrients in the sarracenia microecosystem is brown the functional shape of the pathways involved in its nutrient cycling are similar to those in lakes with green food webs and are likely to lead to similar qualitative dynamics of both systems the results of our model and sensitivity analyses combined with previously published empirical data sirota et al 2013 suggest that the sarracenia microecosystem could be employed as a powerful system with which to develop new understanding of the dynamics of complex ecosystems the food web of s purpurea consists of species that share an evolutionary history multiple trophic levels and interactions that have been shaped by both environmental and co evolutionary forces ellison and gotelli 2009 bittleston et al 2016 its abiotic environment and food web are comparable in complexity to large lakes srivastava et al 2004 kitching 2000 baiser et al 2016 it features similar critical transitions and non linear dynamical behavior that are of broad interest for theoretical ecologists mesocosm studies have been critiqued for lacking any or all of these characteristics carpenter 1996 but a recent meta analysis of the scaling relationships of the half saturation constant k w provides evidence that uptake of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus by food webs and inter trophic nutrient transfers all are nearly invariant to spatial scale mulder and hendriks 2014 at the same time the dynamics of the sarracenia microecosystem play out over days rather than years decades centuries or even longer thus we conclude that similar to previous work that has demonstrated the ability to scale up ecosystems processes e g capps et al 2014 the pitcher plant microecosystem provides an experimental system and computational model with which to study the linkages between green and brown food webs butler et al 2008 wolkovich et al 2014 sitvarin et al 2016 in the context of a food web with an evolutionary history therefore this system provides a powerful tool for identifying early warning signals of state changes in ecosystems that are of crucial importance for environmental

model we then use sensitivity analysis to identify the model parameters that most strongly control the dynamics of the system we illustrate that once organic matter input is stopped the sarracenia microecosystem like large lakes can eventually overcome the hysteresis in the system and return to an oligotrophic state we conclude that the mathematical model illustrates dynamic behaviors that are qualitatively similar to models of regime shifts in lakes and other ecosystems and we suggest that the sarracenia microecosystem is useful model for studying ecological regime shifts in real time 2 methods 2 1 the pitcher plant microecosystem the eastern north american pitcher plants sarracenia spp are perennial carnivorous plants that grow in bogs low nutrient poor fens seepage swamps and sandy out wash plains schnell 2002 their leaves are modified into pitchers arber 1941 tubular structures that attract and capture arthropods and occasionally small vertebrate prey e g ellison and gotelli 2009 butler et al 2005 in the pitchers prey are shredded by obligate pitcher inhabiting arthropods including histiostomatid sarraceniopus mites and larvae of sarcophagid fletcherimyia fletcheri and chironomid flies metrocnemius knabi jones 1923 addicott 1974 heard 1994 the shredded organic matter is further decomposed and mineralized by a diverse assemblage of microbes including protozoa cochran stafira and von ende 1998 yeasts boynton 2012 and bacteria peterson et al 2008 unlike other species of sarracenia that also secrete and use digestive enzymes to extract nutrients from their captured prey s purpurea pitchers secrete digestive enzymes for only a fraction of their lifespan gallie and chang 1997 instead s purpurea relies on its aquatic food web to decompose the prey and mineralize their nutrients butler and ellison 2007 as a result the rainwater filled pitchers of s purpurea are best considered a detrital based brown ecosystems in which bacterially mediated nutrient cycling determines whether it is in an oligotrophic or eutrophic state sirota et al 2013 butler et al 2008 bradshaw and creelman 1984 2 2 oxygen dynamics in lakes and pitchers oxygen dynamics in both lakes and sarracenia pitchers can be described using a simple model that yields alternative oligotrophic and eutrophic states and hysteresis in the shift between them scheffer et al 2001 1 dx dt a bx rf x in this model the observed variable x e g oxygen concentration is positively correlated with state variable a e g rate of nutrient input or photosynthesis and negatively correlated with state variable

function f x determines the shape of the switch between the states and the degree of hysteresis following scheffer et al 2001 we used a hill function for f x 2 f x x p x p h p the hill function provides a simple model that can produce threshold behaviors the dynamics of the state variable x is determined by parameters p and h which determine the rate of change and the inflection point of the curve respectively fig 1 a if p is set such that more than one possible state exists for the system h determines the threshold for the transition between these states when viewed in phase space fig 1b the transition between states can be seen as a path traversed by the system between distinct regions i e phases in part because of this threshold property the hill function has been applied to systems ranging from biochemistry and microbiology to ecology whose dynamics depend on a limiting resource e g mulder and hendriks 2014 we modeled the dynamics of the trophic state of the sarracenia microecosystem using an equation of the same underlying form as eq 1 3 x t 1 a t a t photosynthesis m a t w t 1 w t 1 k w bod d t x t diffusion each model term is described below and summarized in table 1 the model eq 3 of the sarracenia microecosystem fig 2 a is made up of the two main terms production of oxygen by photosynthesis and use of oxygen respiration during decomposition bod biological oxygen demand the pitcher fluid is oxygenated x at each discrete time step t in min as the plant photosynthesizes a t the value of a t is determined by sunlight which we modeled as a truncated sine function producing photosynthetically active radiation par fig 2b and by the maximum photosynthetic rate a max fig 2c which leads to the production of dissolved oxygen in the pitcher fluid fig 2d photoautotrophic bacteria but not algae have been detected in a recent molecular study of the proteome of s purpurea inquiline communities however the total number of peptides mapping to these bacterial species was low relative to other species in the community northrop et al 2017 thus although our model does not explicitly account for other photosynthetic organisms these previous findings suggest that their contributions to the oxygen dynamics of the pitcher plant fluid are likely to be small relative to that of the pitcher plant itself decomposition of shredded prey by bacteria requires oxygen the oxygen demand from respiration is modeled by the bod term in eq 3 the parameter m is the basal metabolic respiration of the food web with no prey to decompose in the system adding prey w induces decomposition which we model as a negative exponential function with rate parameter Œ≤ and a constant w maximum prey mass decomposed over 48 h using eq 4 and illustrated in fig 2e 4 w t 1 w t e Œ≤ w bacterial populations increase at a rate determined by a half saturation function with parameter k w eq 3 which increases bod and the depletion of oxygen from the pitcher fluid fig 2f demand of the food web for oxygen i e bod depends on the decomposition rate Œ≤ and the shape parameter k w but only when prey is present in the system w t 1 0 in eq 3 when prey is absent i e w t 1 0 bod terms simplify by multiplication to the basal metabolic rate m photosynthesis may be limited by available nutrients primarily nitrogen and phosphorus givnish et al 1984 ellison 2006 that are mineralized by bacteria from the prey butler et al 2008 photosynthesis is augmented a t by nutrient mineralization rate s we model a t as a saturating function with bounds determined by the range terms a min and a max s and the point of saturation d 5 a t 1 a t a max a min 1 e s n t d a min the other impact of prey addition and subsequent decomposition by the food web is the release of nutrients into the pitcher fluid the mineralization variable n t eq 5 which is modeled as proportional to the product of the amount of oxygen and prey in the system i e n t 1 c w t x t where c is a constant of proportionality creates a feedback from decomposition to oxygen production by the plant i e the path in fig 2a from the food web to nutrients to pitcher to oxygen and back to the food web thus the mineralization term couples respiration oxygen depletion to photosynthesis oxygen production when prey is introduced to the system and the food web begins to decompose the prey and release nutrients into the pitcher fluid finally a small amount of oxygen diffuses into the pitcher fluid directly from the atmosphere d x however the diffusion rate is generally so low that it is negligible relative to changes resulting from photosynthesis and bod 2 3 estimating decomposition rate we used data from a greenhouse pitcher feeding experiment to estimate the decomposition parameter the experiment was conducted over 35 days starting on july 6 2015 in a temperature controlled greenhouse at the university of vermont s biological research complex burlington vermont usa eighteen newly formed pitchers 8 ml in volume were rinsed with deionized water and randomly assigned to one of three organic matter addition treatments 0 0 0 5 or 5 0 mg ml 1 of pitcher fluid pitcher fluid was collected from randomly selected pitchers at molly bog morristown vermont usa 44 500 n 72 642 w on the morning of 6 july 2015 the fluid was transported to the greenhouse filtered through the 30 micron frit bed of a chromatography column biorad hercules california usa to remove larger organisms homogenized and added to experimental pitchers in the greenhouse pitchers were loaded with a single pulse of organic matter every morning for the first four days in this experiment and following darwin 1875 the organic matter was bovine serum albumin bsa dna from salmon testes at a concentration of 1 5 Œºg l 1 of bsa and trace elements potassium calcium sodium magnesium and manganese in a ratio of 1 0 115 0 044 0 026 0 0001 in a pilot study bsa yielded similar changes in dissolved oxygen as we had obtained previously using ground wasps as organic matter sirota et al 2013 and its use enabled us to measure changes in organic matter content via a simple bradford assay and in a pilot study yielded similar changes in dissolved oxygen as we had obtained previously using ground wasps as organic matter sirota et al 2013 three 100 Œºl aliquots of pitcher fluid were sampled from single pitchers of each of 14 individual plants sampling was conducted twice a day from day 0 to day 20 at 8 30 am and 5 00 pm 2 h once per day from day 20 to day 28 at 8 30 am 2 h and once each on days 30 31 33 and 35 8 30 am 2 h prior to sampling the pitcher fluid was stirred with the pipette submerged to get fluid representative of an average of the entire pitcher during sampling care was taken to minimize the introduction of additional oxygen from the sampling process itself pitcher fluid was topped off with deionized water after sampling to keep initial pitcher volumes consistent over the course of the 35 days the initial volumes varied from 8 ml to 28 6 ml with a mean of 16 7 ml and standard deviation of 4 82 ml although we did control for the water taken with each sample we did not adjust for the removal of nutrients and microscopic organisms that occurred at each sampling samples were centrifuged at 13000g after which the supernatant containing soluble bsa was removed placed in a sterile tube and frozen at 80 c until analyzed a simple bradford assay bradford 1976 was used to determine the concentration of bsa in each of the pitcher fluid samples the assay was done using bradford reagent vwr and the absorbance of each sample was measured on a biophotometer plus spectrophotometer eppendorf at an optical density of 600 nm samples were read randomly on the spectrophotometer to avoid reaction time as a confounding variable sample concentrations were determined by comparison to standard curves generated using r r core team 2016 we used an empirical least squares estimator lse approach to generate the best fitting values for the decomposition parameter Œ≤ in eq 4 given the quantity of prey added in the experiment and the duration of the prey addition as k w is not a part of the decomposition function we did not vary it during parameter estimation and model fitting we then ran a series of 35 day simulations equivalent to the run time of the prey addition experiment in which Œ≤ was sampled from a grid of values ranging from 1e 8 to 0 0007 and the amount of prey in the simulation was recorded at each simulated minute for each run the sum of squared errors sse was recorded as sim obs 2 the Œ≤ that minimized the sse in each simulation was considered to be the best fit value for each replicate pitcher n 12 all model fitting was also done using r r core team 2016 2 4 sensitivity analysis we used a sensitivity analysis in which we varied the prey addition rate w decomposition rate Œ≤ and the half saturation constant k w to explore the behavior of the microecosystem model across a wide range of parameter space rather than set combinations of fixed values for the three parameters of interest we sampled the model parameter space by drawing values independently from uniform distributions k w u 0 0001 3 Œ≤ u 1 0e 6 2 0e 3 and w u 0 100 to characterize baseline oligotrophic oxygen concentrations for each combination of Œ≤ and k w we ran one simulation in which no prey was added to the system w 0 in all simulations n 15 000 variables were initialized to 0 with the exception of oxygen x which was initialized using the photosynthesis term x 0 7 55 simulated prey additions occurred at mid day on days 4 6 i e t 6480 to t 9360 each simulation ran for 30 simulated days 43 200 min and output was saved for each simulated minute the simulations were initialized using a random sample of parameter values and run in parallel because the model is completely deterministic the resulting runs can be reproduced by starting the simulations with the exact values used to initialize and parameterize the models to aid in the detection of the impact of the most important parameters and variables in all simulations we set some parameter values to zero which altered the model in the following two ways first we ignored the d x t term because we assumed that the amount of oxygen diffusing directly into the pitcher fluid from the atmosphere would be orders of magnitude lower than oxygen produced by pitcher photosynthesis kingsolver 1979 second we noted that since the basal metabolic respiration of the food web parameter m is an additive constant any change in the value of the constant m basal respiration of the microbial community would result only in a proportional change in value of x not in the shape i e dx dt of the oxygen production over time thus we could set m 0 without loss of generality by setting m 0 we also observed that the photosynthetic augmentation term a t influenced photosynthesis a t and bod w t 1 w t 1 k w identically therefore the parameters s and d in eq 5 could be set as constants in the sensitivity analysis by ignoring diffusion setting m 0 and fixing s and d we reduced the dimensionality of the sensitivity analysis to three w Œ≤ and k w which eased the interpretation of the results we calculated two measures of the state of the system from the time series of oxygen concentration x t hypoxia and return rate we defined hypoxia in the model to be an oxygen concentration of 1 6 mg l 1 which is the median lethal o2 concentration o2 for aquatic animals vaquer sunyer and duarte 2008 we measured the return rate of the system as the linear trend in o2 i e after removing the daily cycle in oxygen resulting from photosynthesis across the entire simulation using pearson s correlation coefficient although the return trajectory can be non linear the linear trend measures the gross trends of returning positive little impact of feeding zero or remaining at depressed oxygen levels 2 5 code availability and execution the model was coded in the r programming language r core team 2016 the 15 000 model runs for the sensitivity analysis were run on the odyssey supercomputer cluster at harvard university research computing group fas division of science cambridge massachusetts data code for the simulations and output of analyses are available in the harvard forest data archive harvardforest fas harvard edu harvard forest data archive 3 results the equation representing decomposition and bod resembles the hill function in a general model of state changes with hysteresis eqs 1 and 2 in general when a hill function is used in a basic alternative states model e g rf x b in eq 1 the inflection point e g half saturation constant k w determines the threshold fig 1a thus modeling decomposition and bod using a hill function provided us with sufficient flexibility to yield a variety of state changes the simulations with the model produced dynamics observed in the empirical pitcher plant microecosystem because photosynthesis is nutrient limited in sarracenia ellison 2006 addition of prey increased modeled photosynthesis fig 3 a relative to oligotrophic prey free pitchers in the oligotrophic state and when no prey was added bod remained low throughout the entire simulation black line in fig 3b after prey was added on for example days 4 6 t 6480 to t 9360 min the system jumped into its alternative state bod increased rapidly then declined slowly as prey was mineralized grey line in fig 3b the combination of the smooth slow recovery response of photosynthesis to prey addition and the abrupt shift in bod following prey addition fig 3a and b resulted in an abrupt shift in the system from an oxygenated state into an anoxic state and a very slow hysteretic recovery fig 3c the hysteresis of the system was apparent when oxygen concentration was plotted as a time lagged phase plot lag 1440 min starting at t 720 which shows the change in oxygen following addition of prey at t 6480 and the slow return due to high bod fig 3d these results were corroborated by observations from field and greenhouse experiments in which oxygen was observed to decline with the capture or addition of insect prey to the pitcher sirota et al 2013 and demonstrate the presence of both state changes and hysteresis i e fig 3d for at least some parameterizations of the model the parameter fitting and sensitivity analysis revealed several key effects of the parameters that we varied first the lse model fitting procedure resulted in an estimate for Œ≤ of x 0 00041 0 0004 se fig 4 vertical lines second varying Œ≤ had a large effect both on the percent time spent in an hypoxic state and on the return rate steeper contours with increasing Œ≤ in fig 4 last varying the amount of prey by two orders of magnitude produced a sharp threshold for the effect of varying Œ≤ on hypoxia and return rate fig 4 although varying Œ≤ has a potentially larger effect on the dynamics of the microecosystem than varying k w the latter played an important role in determining the return trajectory of the oxygen for simulations with lower values of k w the oxygen concentration was still exponentially increasing when the simulation ended fig 5 a relative to simulations with higher k w the return rate was faster when Œ≤ was low enough and there was prey i e w t remaining in the pitcher at the last observed time fig 5b thus in this part of the parameter space if another round of feeding were to occur at a similar level of prey input the system would never recover and would remain in or near an hypoxic state 4 discussion general theoretical work in complex systems has suggested that the definition of system boundaries is arbitrary and carries the potential for system dynamics to be mechanistically connected to but unpredictable from lower levels or scales of organization ulanowicz 2012 levine et al 2016 however others have argued that food web dynamics of whole ecosystems can be inferred from the components i e motifs and modules of these ecosystems mccann 2012 overall our model of the sarracenia microecosystem supports the latter assertion a focus on particular pathways e g photosynthesis decomposition etc reproduced the non linear behavior of its oxygen dynamics including state changes and hysteresis the results of the sensitivity analysis also revealed that the carrying capacity of the bacterial community as simulated by the effect of k w could contribute to observed non linear state changes of the sarracenia microecosystem predictions based on the model are highly sensitive to changes in the parameterization of decomposition e g Œ≤ in the initial parameterization of this model we started with an empirical estimate of decomposition rate in which 99 of the average amount of prey captured could be decomposed in a single day sirota et al 2013 baiser et al 2011 this is extremely rapid decomposition relative to a set of 58 previously published food webs lau et al 2017 in which 1 27 66 2 of available detritus or organic matter is decomposed each day when we set the decomposition parameter Œ≤ equal to 2 57e 6 the overall decomposition rate approached the mean of the published food webs 24 22 2 79 se this value for Œ≤ is within the parameter space that we observed experimentally and used in our sensitivity analysis and suggests that insights gained from the sarracenia microecosystem should be scalable to larger systems although the dynamics of the sarracenia microecosystem share similarities with lake stream and other large scale ecosystems there are several differences that should be noted first oxygen levels in the pitcher plant are dynamically controlled by photosynthesis of the plant that serves as a strong driver of oxygen levels in lakes the primary oxygen production is carried out by phytoplankton which are immersed in the aquatic system second lake food webs are green i e plant based whereas pitcher plant food webs are brown detritus based butler et al 2008 in lakes the shift to a eutrophic state occurs through addition of limiting nutrients usually n or p accumulation of producer biomass that is uncontrolled by herbivores see wood et al 2017 and subsequent decomposition that increases biological oxygen demand carpenter et al 1995 chislock et al 2013 the sarracenia microecosystem s brown food web also experiences an increase in oxygen demand and microbial activity however this occurs during the breakdown of detritus that is characteristic of its shift from an oligotrophic to a eutrophic state sirota et al 2013 even though the source of the nutrients in the sarracenia microecosystem is brown the functional shape of the pathways involved in its nutrient cycling are similar to those in lakes with green food webs and are likely to lead to similar qualitative dynamics of both systems the results of our model and sensitivity analyses combined with previously published empirical data sirota et al 2013 suggest that the sarracenia microecosystem could be employed as a powerful system with which to develop new understanding of the dynamics of complex ecosystems the food web of s purpurea consists of species that share an evolutionary history multiple trophic levels and interactions that have been shaped by both environmental and co evolutionary forces ellison and gotelli 2009 bittleston et al 2016 its abiotic environment and food web are comparable in complexity to large lakes srivastava et al 2004 kitching 2000 baiser et al 2016 it features similar critical transitions and non linear dynamical behavior that are of broad interest for theoretical ecologists mesocosm studies have been critiqued for lacking any or all of these characteristics carpenter 1996 but a recent meta analysis of the scaling relationships of the half saturation constant k w provides evidence that uptake of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus by food webs and inter trophic nutrient transfers all are nearly invariant to spatial scale mulder and hendriks 2014 at the same time the dynamics of the sarracenia microecosystem play out over days rather than years decades centuries or even longer thus we conclude that similar to previous work that has demonstrated the ability to scale up ecosystems processes e g capps et al 2014 the pitcher plant microecosystem provides an experimental system and computational model with which to study the linkages between green and brown food webs butler et al 2008 wolkovich et al 2014 sitvarin et al 2016 in the context of a food web with an evolutionary history therefore this system provides a powerful tool for identifying early warning signals of state changes in ecosystems that are of crucial importance for environmental management abbott and battaglia 2015 hoekman 2010 acknowledgements we would like to thank drs judith bronstein and greg dwyer and four anonymous reviewers for constructive feedback that greatly

25274,the ability of fish to swim upstream through regions of swiftly flowing water is ultimately dependent on their physiological capacity swimming performance the relationship between swim speed and time to fatigue has been used to design fishways and identify barriers to fish movement however existing numerical models do not all capture the variability in swimming abilities nor the turbulent unsteady and three dimensional aspect of natural flows this deficiency is particularly problematic for fish species whose behavior is poorly understood i e invasive fish and at sites with complex flow patterns here we combine species specific swimming performance with high resolution abstractions of fluid flow in a new agent based framework to model fatigue of upstream swimming fish under turbulent flow conditions our model simulates fish paths in the absence of information on their behavioral tendencies based on a rules set aimed at fish swimming as far upstream as possible before complete exhaustion by selecting the path of least fatigue we demonstrate how this model functions by examining theoretical passage of invasive silver carp hypopthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp h nobilis as well a native fish the lake sturgeon acipenser fulvescens through a typical mississippi river lock and dam lock and dam 8 near genoa wi the model then tests whether passage could be reduced by altering spillway gate operations model results suggest that passage of all three species is low under current gate operations and that passage of both carp species could be further reduced by about half through minor changes in spillway gate operation without apparent impacts on navigation scour or lake sturgeon passage model results are qualitatively consistent with observed passage rates monitored by other studies at similar lock and dams and are consistent with the possibility that the model likely overestimates passage rates by relying on physiological data only this approach could be exported to other applications and fish species to help manage and control fish migration and dispersal especially for fish whose behavior and ecology are poorly understood and not presently quantifiable keywords computational fluid dynamics fish passage asian carp agent based lock and dam mississippi river 1 introduction fish migration and dispersal are key life history traits that are highly susceptible to disruption by natural and man made obstructions like waterfalls dams and culverts upstream movement in particular is heavily impacted by hydraulic challenges i e regions of flow that exceed a fish s locomotor capacity however while understanding how fish movement is influenced by water flow is vital to the design of fishways and identification of barriers to movement relating fish movement to the naturally unsteady turbulent and three dimensional flow conditions found in these situations is not straightforward liao et al 2003 accordingly fisheries managers and engineers have developed computer models to help bridge the gap between water flow and fish movement preferably models of fish movement would incorporate environmental stimuli e g velocity temperature etc with data on physiology e g swimming performance and key information on behavioral attributes e g when and why particular fish move however while both environmental stimuli and physiological traits of certain species of fish are often either well understood or readily obtained using laboratory instrumentation e g swim tunnels fish behavior especially in situ is inherently difficult to obtain and usually unavailable thus with the exception of a handful of economically important species e g pacific salmon freshwater eels behavioral traits of upstream swimming fish in the field are largely unknown this is especially the case for non native fishes some of which are invasive since many existing models require information on behavioral traits which is lacking for invasive species new models that emphasize physiological limits of fish swimming i e how fast and how long can fish swim before exhaustion to examine barriers to fish passage and estimate movement ranges are needed one area where modelling of the physiological limits of fish movement in complex flows would be especially beneficial is the control of invasive species such as the asian or bigheaded carps a genus with two key species the silver carp hypopthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp h nobilis the bigheaded carps are large voracious microphagous fish that were introduced to north america in the 1970s kolar et al 2007 and are now disrupting food webs and negatively impacting fisheries across the mississippi river basin carlson et al 1995 schrank et al 2003 sass et al 2014 pendleton et al 2017 however while they are ubiquitous in much of this large watershed they have not yet invaded many peripheral and interconnected areas including the mississippi river headwaters area upper illinois river and the great lakes usfws 2014 identifying new ways to block upstream movement of bigheaded carp is a key objective of state regional and federal management strategies in these regions tsehaye et al 2013 the set of 29 mississippi river navigational lock and dams located in this river network and managed by the u s army corps of engineers usace offers a possible avenue to block bigheaded carp passage as all fish must pass through them water velocities increase as a result of passing through the lock and dam spillway gates which are also fully adjustable and have already been suggested to reduce passage of native migratory species in the mississippi river knights et al 2002 zigler et al 2003 2004 further a recent swim study on bigheaded carp swimming performance hoover et al 2017 showed that bigheaded carps are relatively weak swimmers the possibility that lock and dams could be used to block passage has also been supported by telemetry studies at lock and dams in the mississippi river tripp et al 2014 and illinois river lubejko et al 2017 which found bigheaded carp passage rates to be low and occur largely during open river conditions i e all spillway gates are raised out of the water and velocities are relatively low lock and dams near the headwaters of the mississippi river where bigheaded carp have not yet reached rarely experience open river conditions fishpro 2004 and represent the greatest likely impediment to fish passage depending on when specific fishes naturally move relative to open river conditions if gate operations could be modified in appropriate ways that do not increase scour near the structure or impair navigation these lock and dams would offer great potential to further restrict bigheaded carp passage however flows through these structures are complex and not easily measured and there are presently no data on carp behavior or movement near these structures models must therefore rely on swimming performance and hydraulic data alone a common approach to such models is to assume fish will swim to their maximum physiological capacity e g exhaustion resulting in conservative estimates of passage as fish are not naturally expected to swim to complete exhaustion models that calculate the highest number of fish passing a hydraulic challenge are of great value as a first step to evaluate whether and how to stop undesirable invasive species while allowing for the possible passage of other species like the lake sturgeon acipenser fulvescens a native fish of ecological and cultural importance that makes prolonged migrations throughout the mississippi river basin in this study we develop a new numeric model to describe fish swimming upstream through a hydraulic challenge by incorporating species specific data on fish swimming performance and hydraulic data around and through structures such as locks and dams we then use the model to both evaluate and then simulate fish passage through a typical lock and dam under various scenarios while comparing findings with known data at similar structures it is novel because of the manner in which we merge two attributes swimming performance and hydraulic conditions the first of which we now introduce fish swimming performance i e the relationship between swim speed and time to fatigue is generally categorized by two distinct modes sustainable and unsustainable swimming while fish can maintain relatively slow swim speeds almost indefinitely by relying on aerobic metabolism i e sustainable swimming they cannot do this at higher speeds as their ability to swim become limited by the contribution of anaerobic metabolism i e unsustainable swimming further fish can only maintain unsustainable swim speeds for limited durations that are inversely related to swim speed beamish 1978 thus after bouts of unsustainable swimming fish completely fatigue and may require several hours to recover see review in kieffer 2000 relationships between swim speed and time to fatigue are readily quantified through laboratory swim tunnel flume trials beamish 1978 castro santos 2005 hoover et al 2017 hydraulic conditions are the second key component of our model they can be generated using well established computational fluid dynamics cfd computer models that simulate water flows by solving the governing equations of fluid flow and is a practical method to model the complex flows in and around lock and dams in a framework that fish passage can be readily incorporated since cfd models provide fine scale resolution i e sub meter seconds minutes hydraulic data over a wide range of conditions it is already widely incorporated into modelling applications focused on the interface of hydraulics and ecology daraio et al 2010 harvey and clifford 2009 generating fine scale simulations of flow fields experienced by fish is critical as the efficacy of any model or assessment of fish movement is inexorably linked to the scale at which spatiotemporal changes in water velocity are modeled tullos et al 2016 our approach is driven by the need to expand upon existing fish passage models which either are limited by reliance upon simplified hydraulics and homogenized swimming performance ex fishxing furniss et al 2006 or require extensive usually nonexistent telemetry data gao et al 2016 arenas et al 2015 goodwin et al 2014 2006 haefner and bowen 2002 also with the exception of gao et al 2016 all extant behavioral models are intended to describe downstream movement of fish where the influence of swimming fatigue is minimized in this study we develop and describe a new agent based approach a mathematical model that simulates the interactions of individuals or agents with each other and or their environment our model incorporates swimming performance data with high resolution abstractions of complex fluid environments to evaluate fish swimming fatigue agent based approaches similar to this have proven to be effective in simulating many complex ecological phenomena like larval fish navigation staaterman and paris 2004 fish aggregations and movement gao et al 2016 arenas et al 2015 goodwin et al 2014 2006 nestler et al 2002 huth and wissel 1992 and mussel dispersal daraio et al 2010 but they have not been deployed to understand invasive fish passage at lock and dams before our model makes three primary assumptions 1 fish are only motivated to move upstream i e no backtracking 2 fish swim at their distance maximizing ground speed and 3 fish select a path of least energetic cost the percent endurance model developed by castro santos 2005 and partially used in other fish passage evaluations neary 2012 is used as a proxy for energy expenditure stochasticity is introduced by varying individual fish swimming performance and hydraulic fields based on turbulent fluctuations we describe the framework of a new agent based swimming fatigue model and discuss its general characteristics and intrinsic models we then demonstrate the applicability of the model by simulating bigheaded carp passage at lock and dam 8 genoa wi on the mississippi river a structure with similar geometry and hydrologic features to many other lock and dams and located upstream of the bigheaded carp invasion front we examine whether these invasive species are likely being blocked by current spillway gate operations at this typical lock and dam and whether changes to gate operating procedures i e gate opening height could enhance this feature without impacting navigation scour or passage of lake sturgeon we qualitatively compare model results to observed fish passage rates at other mississippi river lock and dams we also evaluate whether and how different gate operating procedures might alter the use of the navigational locks and scour downstream of the lock and dam 2 methods we develop a new type of agent based model to evaluate upstream swimming capabilities of fish based on swimming performance and then explore how it can be applied this fish swimming fatigue model is comprised of an environmental domain i e flow field in which agents i e fish are inserted and move throughout fig 1 the aquatic environment is represented by a computational mesh i e spatial grid of elements fig 2 where the location of each element water depth and water velocity are simulated using hydraulic models individual fish follow predefined movement rules in response to local hydraulic conditions e g velocity vectors when we force simulated fish to seek routes requiring the least amount of energy mcelroy et al 2012 the model can reveal which pathways fish must take to cover the maximum upstream distance possible these pathways emerge from the interaction of local hydraulic conditions and theoretical swimming performance once identified we investigate how passage along these paths can be increased or decreased by modifying the hydraulic conditions at our model site although there are many possible pathways fish can take through a complex flow environment we focus on the path with the least energetic cost as all other paths would be higher energy paths and less likely to lead to successful passage and we are interested in determining the highest possible number of fish passing the lock and dam following the schematic representation of the model in fig 1 we first describe how the aquatic environment and fish movement are represented and conclude with a demonstration of the model to identify how invasive bigheaded carps may already be moving through a typical mississippi river lock and dam and then how gate operations at this structure could be altered to block bigheaded carp 2 1 aquatic environment we determine 3d simulations of the flow field using the ansys release 17 1 fluent cfd software

direction cfd models are run using a cluster node equipped with two 2 4 ghz 14 core intel xeon processors and 128 gb memory 2 2 fish movement framework we examine fish movement through the field using an agent based approach to model fish movement and fatigue this process begins with an initialization step followed by a movement step which has several sub models 2 2 1 initialization we start by generating numeric fish agents with unique swimming performance metrics and total length swimming performance metrics for each individual fish are selected randomly from swim speed fatigue time curves see section 2 2 2 3 normalized by total body length based on experimental data mean estimates of coefficients a and b with standard deviation œÉ a and œÉ b and sustained swim speed limit once coefficients are selected swim speed fatigue relationships are transformed by total body length to create fish with unique swimming abilities this approach is similar to methods outlined by castro santos 2006 combining unique individual total lengths and normalized swimming performance metrics simulates natural biological variation and yield individuals with a range of swimming abilities e g small fast fish vs large slow fish fish are then randomly seeded along the downstream boundary of the flow field following a uniform distribution a uniform distribution is used in lieu of observed approach patterns and to ensure simulated fish approach a hydraulic challenge from as many different trajectories as possible 2 2 2 movement once seeded each fish advances upstream through the flow field by marching through nodes from the computational mesh following a step selection process that follows the upstream pathway that causes the least fatigue without backtracking and swimming at a theoretical distance maximizing ground speed see section 2 2 2 3 castro santos 2005 at each node fish survey neighboring nodes upstream of their current location for fatigue that would result from swimming to each node using the resultant velocity acting between the initial node and each neighboring node fig 3 the fish then selects and moves to the node that results in the lowest possible fatigue each simulation repeats this process for every fish until they completely exhaust or reach the upstream boundary of the flow field the process occurs via 5 sub models that follow the process outlined in fig 1 the sub models address 1 finding the upstream nodes neighboring the fish s current location 2 calculating the resultant velocity fish must swim against 3 calculating the swim speed and fatigue 4 locating the next position and allocating fatigue and 5 updating the agent variables and velocity field 2 2 2 1 sub model 1 locate neighboring nodes in this sub model fish search through the computational mesh to locate potential locations to move that are positioned in front of its current location and are within a specified sensory range Œ¥ see fig 4 since fish are assumed to be motivated to only move upstream only nodes located within an 180 arc upstream of the fish s position were considered i e no backtracking to ensure fish do not bypass regions of higher velocity that cannot otherwise be avoided Œ¥ was set to half the total length of the fish i e approximately three times the minimum node spacing for the smallest modeled fish if less than 3 nodes were located within this hemisphere Œ¥ was doubled until 3 or more nodes were present this limit was set to force fish to survey across a minimum number of movement directions and prevent fish movement paths from being overly restricted by node locations without this requirement fish could be forced to move to a node because of its proximity and not local hydraulic conditions as a measure to reduce computation time Œ¥ was set to twice the total body length in areas where the mesh is coarse nodes spaced 1 1 5 m apart and velocity gradients are low 2 2 2 2 sub model 2 calculate resultant velocity a resultant velocity is calculated for each neighboring node determined in the previous section we used resultant velocity instead of velocity magnitude as it enables modifications which allow for the direction of fluid flow to either aid or hinder movement if the flow vector at the neighboring node acts in the same direction as the potential swim vector the velocity fish must overcome is reduced i e fish movement is potentially aided by flow direction for any initial point x o y o z o and neighboring node x i y i z i with velocity vector u i v i w i and depth below the water surface d i the resultant velocity can be written as 2 u r e s u n 2 v n 2 w n 2 where u n v n w n are conditional velocity components dependent on the direction of movement between the initial point and neighboring node and velocity vector fig 4 the conditional velocity component in the horizontal plane is defined as 3 u n u i Œ¥ x Œ¥ x u i u i 0 Œ¥ x Œ¥ x u i u i in the x direction and 4 v n v i Œ¥ y Œ¥ y v i v i 0 Œ¥ y Œ¥ y v i v i in the y direction when the direction of movement is defined as 5 Œ¥ x x i x o Œ¥ y y i y o using this arrangement if the horizontal direction of movement between the initial position and next node are oriented in the same direction as the velocity component that portion of the velocity vector is set to zero in eqs 3 and 4 for example if the fish was to move to node 7 in fig 4a the horizontal velocity component u n would be set to zero because is acts in the same direction as the fish movement movement in the vertical plane is dependent on both the velocity direction and position relative to the preferred depth of the fish fig 4b fish regulate depth by altering the volume of their swim bladder since this process takes several minutes to achieve even a slight change in density i e time to change swim bladder volume time to pass hydraulic challenge strand et al 2005 fish are assumed to attempt passage with a constant swim bladder volume and thus a preferred depth d p the conditional velocity component in the vertical direction is then defined as 6 w n w i 0 d i d p w i 0 d i d p w i 0 w i 0 d i d p w i 0 d i d p w i 0 in this arrangement the vertical velocity component contributes to the resultant velocity only when the vertical velocity acts against the fish trying to return to its preferred depth 2 2 2 3 sub model 3 calculate swim speed and fatigue we estimated the swim speed and time to fatigue for each individual fish based on swimming performance data collected from swim tunnel tests when swim speeds exceed a fish s maximum sustained swim speed u s u s the relationship between swim speed u s and endurance i e time to fatigue t generally follows a log linear model castro santos 2005 peake et al 1997 7 ln t a b u s b 0 where a and b are the slope and intercept coefficients fit from experimental data swim speed can then be related to ground speed u g by 8 u g u s u r e s where u r e s is the resultant water velocity assumed to act against fish movement the distance swam can then be found as the product of ground speed and endurance castro santos 2005 used this relationship to derive a theoretical distance maximizing ground speed as 9 u g o p t 1 b the concept of distance maximizing ground speed is important because it assumes fish constantly adjust their swimming speed with water velocity to swim the maximum possible distance if u r e s u s u s fish were assumed to swim at a speed equal to u s u s and incur no fatigue however when u r e s u s u s fish must swim at unsustainable speeds i e requiring some level of anaerobic fueling to continue upstream to ensure fish reach as far upstream as possible through the flow field while swimming at unsustainable speeds the ground speed was assumed to be equal to the distance maximizing ground speed castro santos 2005 according to in eq 9 the time Œ¥ t for fish to swim between neighboring nodes can then be calculated as 10 Œ¥ t l u g o p t where l is the distance between nodes calculation of fatigue caused by fish swimming from their initial position to each of the neighboring nodes follows the percent endurance model castro santos 2006 neary 2012 given the fish s endurance t for a given effort and time required to swim between nodes Œ¥ t the percent fatigue Œ¥ f expended by fish to reach the next node can be derived as 11 Œ¥ f Œ¥ t t 100 u r e s u s u s 0 u r e s u s u s the fish s endurance t is not static but is recalculated during each step based on the required swim speed to reach the neighboring node this approach assumes fish have a predetermined energy budget and discrete bouts of swimming between nodes incrementally decreases the budget which if used entirely leads to complete exhaustion and termination of the passage attempt unsustainable swimming is commonly divided into two distinct modes prolonged and burst castro santos 2005 prolonged mode swimming is fueled by a mixture of anaerobic and aerobic metabolism that can be maintained for 20 s 200 min while burst mode swimming is fueled entirely by anaerobic metabolism and can typically only be maintained for 20 s beamish 1978 for each mode the relationship between swimming speed and endurance still follows eq 7 but with unique coefficients castro santos 2006 notably the distance maximizing ground speed eq 9 would also be unique for each swimming mode the percent endurance model can be modified to estimate fatigue during both prolonged and burst swim modes castro santos 2006 neary 2012 2 2 2 4 sub model 4 locate the next position and allocating fatigue step selection assumes fish follow the upstream pathway that causes the least amount of fatigue without backtracking at each decision point all neighboring nodes are surveyed based on percent fatigue in the event all neighboring nodes cause fatigue the node with the minimum percent fatigue is chosen in all other situations where at least one node does not cause fatigue the new position of the fish is selected at random from the group of non fatigue causing nodes because only nodes in front of the fish are surveyed the effect of the random node selection makes the default movement pattern reflect a biased random walk once the new position is selected the total fatigue f is updated based on the percent fatigue incurred during movement this way the total fatigue at any point along a given pathway is the accumulation of Œ¥ f at all prior steps complete exhaustion occurs when f Œ¥ f j Œ¥ f j 1 Œ¥ f n 100 where j 1 2 n denotes each step 2 2 2 5 sub model 5 update agent and velocity field after each step selection the velocity field is updated i e turbulent fluctuations approximated and agent variables are recorded the velocity field is updated by augmenting the steady state velocity with an approximation of turbulent fluctuations by selecting a new water velocity at each node from a normal distribution with mean u v w and standard deviation u v w this step incorporates turbulence into the flow field using a stochastic approach rather than attempting to directly correlate fish movement with specific time steps of an unsteady flow condition the agent variables recorded after each step include fish location x y z water depth d distance traveled l resultant velocity u r e s swimming speed u s u s percent fatigue Œ¥ f and swimming time Œ¥ t a collective summary of fish total length tl starting coordinates and binary passage result 0 success 1 failure is also recorded passage success is quantified by fish reaching a predetermined distance past a hydraulic challenge 2 3 applying the model to a typical mississippi river lock and dam to evaluate fish passage to demonstrate the functionality of our agent based model it was applied at lock and dam 8 genoa wi fig 5 a to determine first how current gate operations might be blocking bigheaded carp passage and then how this attribute might be enhanced lock and dam 8 has similar operation and geometry to other lock and dams in the upper mississippi river flow through lock and dam 8 is controlled by two types of spillways gates 1 ten 10 7 m wide tainter gates and 2 five 24 4 m wide roller gates the adjacent lock chamber is 152 4 m long x 33 5 m wide fig 5b to pass flow both sets of spillway gates raise off the river bottom following a pre determined operating schedule as documented in the usace water control manual usace 2003 water velocity through the gated openings is generally the greatest when the gates are barely open and decreases as the gates are raised when the gates are raised completely out of the water the dam is in so called open river conditions existing gate operating procedures aim to produce a uniform velocity distribution which does not exceed a depth averaged velocity of 1 5 m s at the endsill of the structure which is situated 23 m downstream of the roller gates and 17 m downstream of the tainter gates usace 2003 discharge rating curves for each gate type were established by the usace using velocity data collected from acoustic doppler current profiler adcp surveys 100 m downstream and a physical model study markussen and wilhelms 1987 but has never been modeled using cfd existing gate operation procedures dictate all tainter gates are opened to one uniform height and all roller gates are opened to a different uniform height the lock was not considered in our model because they have minimal attraction flow for fish operate intermittently with boat traffic and are not considered sustainable pathways for fish passage wilcox et al 2004 2 3 1 cfd models 3d cfd simulations were first run for five river discharges 625 1250 1475 2325 and 2720 m3 s at lock and dam 8 see table 2 for gate positions these flows represent the full range of gate controlled flows i e open river conditions at 2720 m3 s cfd velocity fields were qualitatively validated using adcp surveys 100 m downstream and results from a physical model study markussen and wilhelms 1987 see supplemental figs 1 12 additional cfd models of river discharge 1755 and 2067 m3 s were performed and qualitatively validated with physical model studies to further ensure cfd model accuracy but not analyzed for fish passage unstructured tetrahedral meshes 106 nodes were generated using the ansys workbench meshing application the mesh sizes ranged from 0 15 to 1 5 m 1 2 million nodes construction drawings and sub meter resolution river soundings data provided by the usace were used to generate boundaries for the cfd modelling upstream boundary conditions were specified as a uniform depth averaged velocity the downstream boundary was set as an outflow boundary where the diffusion flux of all variables was set to zero no slip zero fluid velocity boundaries were set at all solid surface interfaces and surface roughness roughness height of 0 03 m for all concrete surfaces and 0 3 m for river substrate was accounted for by applying the modified law of the wall equations and velocity shift formulas water surface boundary conditions were treated as a rigid lid i e zero shear stress set to match the longitudinal water surface profile obtained from gauge records although a rigid lid assumption can induce errors in velocity field calculations in areas were the water surface fluctuates substantially the water surface downstream of mississippi river lock and dam spillways experience only minor fluctuations due to the bottom release of water the rigid lid assumption was considered reasonable due good agreement with the physical model study that collected profiles of velocities through the spillway symmetry boundary conditions were set along portions of the right river bank looking downstream where river soundings were not available a hybrid initialization process was used to set the velocity field and domain averaged values for turbulence variables within the fluid domain the unsteady solution used to generated turbulent statistics used in eq 1 was run to a quasi steady state solution converges in a statistical sense with convergence criteria for residuals set at 10 4 unsteady calculations were run with a time step of Œ¥ t 0 2 s with a maximum of 15 dual time stepping iterations per physical time step a first order implicit solver was used to simulate 1000 physical time steps following ge and sotiropoulos 2005 the unsteady solution was considered converged once the difference between instantaneous velocity fluctuations about the mean were an order of magnitude less than the mean post processing of the cfd data e g velocity data and mesh coordinates included modifying the domain with artificial boundaries to create convex surfaces to prevent fish from getting stuck i e accessing regions where no continuous upstream pathways are available because the model prevents fish from backtracking in an unmodified domain instances could occur where fish move behind a spillway gate or lock chamber and are unable to pass without backtracking to remedy this situation artificial boundaries were constructed downstream of each tainter gate i e the gate s curve creates a region where fish can get stuck and the lock chamber at the tainter gates an artificial boundary was applied along a plane extending downstream from the lip of the gate and back to the water surface along a 1 1 slope at the lock chamber an artificial boundary was applied along a plane extending downstream from the apex of the interior lock wall across the lock chamber at a 1 1 slope these boundaries did not change the velocity field but merely prevent fish from accessing these regions and direct fish upstream 2 3 2 modeling fish passage under current usace gate operating procedures our fish passage model was used to simulate movement of silver carp bighead carp and a native species with known swimming performance the lake sturgeon through lock and dam 8 for each species 5000 fish agents were assigned a total body length from one of five 100 mm size classes adapted from published population size distributions these were adapted from seibert et al 2015 for silver carp tl 600 1000 mm schrank and guy 2002 for bighead carp tl 700 1100 mm and mcdougall et al 2013 for lake sturgeon tl 900 1300 mm in other large rivers as no data existed for lock and dam 8 see supplementary fig 13 these locations were believed to have relatively large unexploited fish thus making our models conservative or likely to overestimate passage because silver and bighead carps are pelagic feeders they were assigned a preferred depth of 1 m whereas lake sturgeon a benthic species was assumed to prefer the maximum depth of the domain swimming performance data of all three species showed no clear distinction between prolonged and burst swimming modes hoover et al 2017 peake et al 1997 so all endurance calculations used a single set of parameters for unsustainable swimming table 1 provides the size range maximum sustained swim speed u s u s and swimming performance curve coefficients of each species fish passage analyses were run for current gate operating conditions specified by the usace water control manual 2 3 3 modelling fish passage under modified gate operating procedures after evaluating theoretical passage of silver carp bighead carp and lake sturgeon during current gate operating procedures we used the model to evaluate whether and how modifications to gate operating procedures might further impede bigheaded carp passage while at the same time minimally impacting scour protection and lake sturgeon passage because our evaluation of current gate operating procedures found that they were producing a previously unknown and unexpected imbalance in flow through the gates a new set of gate operating procedures were sought the modified gate operating procedures were set to correct the flow imbalance and produce uniform velocity distributions downstream of the dam that were also less than the maximum allowable velocity at the endsill for scour protection set by the usace of 1 5 m s this was accomplished with modest modifications to gate operating procedures less than 0 6 m difference on average in gate opening height from current operating procedures in the usace water control manual see table 2 for changes in gate opening heights fish passage analyses were run for the modified gate operating procedures using the same number of individuals length distributions and swimming performance metrics as the analysis of current gate operations the efficacy of the modified gate operations to block silver carp and bighead carp was determined by comparing the modified passage results with current passage 2 3 4 statistical analysis of fish passage the passage index an estimate of the maximum percentage of a theoretical distribution of fish from each size class to pass was calculated by dividing the total number of successful passages by the total number of individuals passage index data for each size class were calculated according to eq 12 and binned into 10 equal sized groups to obtain the mean s d passage index p i t l across the group within each sub group the passage index is calculated as 12 p i t l c o u n t o f f i s h p a s s e d o f s i z e t l t o t a l o f f i s h s e e d e d i n t o m o d e l o f s i z e t l where each individual size class is designated by total length t l student s t tests equal variance two sided were used to test whether the mean passage index of a specific size class differed between current and modified conditions next population scale passage index p i p o p values were calculated by summing the products of the percent frequency p o p of each size class from species specific size distribution by the size specific passage index as demonstrated by eq 13 13 p i p o p i t l p i i p o p i the population scale passage index was calculated across the 10 sub groups and student s t tests equal variance two sided were used to test whether the mean passage index of a population differed between current and modified conditions for both analyses values were examined for normalcy shapiro wilk tests all analyses were conducted with custom scripts in matlab mathworks ma usa significance was determined at p 0 05 2 3 5 sensitivity analysis lastly a sensitivity analysis was performed to demonstrate that the model configuration used in our analysis resulted in the most conservative estimates of fish passage index and to understand how the stochastic features of the model swimming performance turbulence representation and path selection method might impact results this was performed in lieu of a traditional validation because bigheaded carp are so uncommon at this location as to be uncatchable and no data are available to relate bigheaded carp passage through individual lock and dam gates sensitivity analyses were conducted about a base condition using the results of the base model for 5000 silver carp with a body length of 800 mm during current gate operations at 2325 m3 s the sensitivity analysis was run for silver carp during a single discharge and gate operation condition because the impacts of the stochastic model features are conserved across all flow and gate operating conditions fish species and total length first we evaluated the impact of swimming performance metrics on model results by doubling maximum fatigue i e fatigue occurs at 200 and then by reducing the maximum fatigue by half i e fatigue occurs at 50 next we examined the impact of turbulent velocity fluctuations by using the steady state velocity field thereby allowing fish to move through a static flow field another model examined the impact of variation in swimming performance metrics by using only the mean swimming performance metrics section 2 2 1 table 1 for all individuals finally to ensure our fatigue based pathway selection method differed from a simple random walk we ran a model using the same swimming performance metrics and turbulent fluctuations approaches as our base model with step selection following a purely biased random walk 3 results 3 1 passage under current usace gate operating procedures model runs of our agent based model under current operating procedures indicated that there are flow imbalances across lock and dam 8 with low velocity regions that all fish could be exploiting to pass without exhausting fig 6 a and b cfd simulations revealed that the low velocity regions were caused by areas of rotational flow and an imbalance in discharge through the tainter and roller gates at all flow conditions flow rates through each gate type differed by as much as 27 from those expected in the water control manual usace 2003 the water volume ratio of flow through the tainter and roller gates was 39 61 across all discharges depth averaged velocities downstream of the roller gates exceed the usace maximum allowable velocity of 1 5 m s table 2 deceleration of flows downstream of the dam under current operating procedures also creates two zones of horizontal rotating flow along both banks and a third zone of vertical rotational flow in a downstream scour hole the passage index of both silver and bighead carp under all flows and current operating procedures was proportional to fish length with larger fish groups having a higher passage index than small fish fig 7 the population scale passage index i e maximum percentage of a theoretical distribution of fish to pass for silver and bighead carp populations ranged from 2 to 12 and 0 4 respectively table 3 across all flow conditions the highest passage indices of either species occurred for silver carp during both open river 2720 m3 s and the lowest modeled discharge 625 m3 s while high values of passage index were expected for open river conditions when velocities at the structure are lowest similarly high index values at the lowest discharge when velocities are highest were unexpected close inspection of silver carp trajectories through a tainter gate opening revealed it was possible to avoid the high velocity jet created by the narrow gate opening by utilizing regions of relatively slow and reversed flow caused by the stepped spillway and recirculating flows near the water surface fig 8 a results of the agent based model also indicated lake sturgeon passage during current gate operating procedures was relatively constant across all flows table 3 ranging from 2 to 6 similar to the silver carp lake sturgeon that passed through the dam did so through the outermost gates fig 6e and f the specified tendency of lake sturgeon to swim on the bottom resulted in pathways that shifted laterally in front of the roller gates as demonstrated by the increased line density near the roller gates in fig 6e and f a feature not observed in either silver or bighead carp although silver and bighead carp have superior swimming performance compared to lake sturgeon relative to body length table 1 lake sturgeon median tl 1000 mm can obtain similar absolute swim speeds as bighead carp median tl 700 mm due to their large size 3 2 passage under modified gate operating procedures gate operating procedures in the model were modified to match a constant water volume ratio of 45 55 through the tainter and roller gates respectively to mitigate the predicted high velocities downstream of the roller gates under current conditions this would result in modest modifications to gate operating procedures see table 2 which the model predicted to produce near uniform velocity distributions downstream of the dam while also seemingly minimizing regions silver carp and bighead carp could exploit fig 9 and supplementary fig 15 although the proposed modifications do not eliminate zones of rotational flow velocities are redistributed across the dam which minimized regions of low velocities the modifications caused an increase in depth averaged velocity below the tainter gates while decreasing the depth averaged velocities below the roller gate openings table 2 although the depth average velocity at 2325 m3 s still exceeded the maximum allowable velocity set by the usace of 1 5 m s the velocity at the roller gate was reduced from 2 1 m s to 1 8 m s no incremental increase in scour around the dam was expected since the average velocities under modified gate operating procedures do not exceed current conditions results of the agent based model indicated that both silver and bighead carp passage would be reduced during all flow conditions during modified gate operating procedures table 3 silver carp passage was reduced by over 50 from current conditions t test p 0 05 table 3 at discharges greater than 1250 m3 s while bighead carp passage was found to decrease at all flows but 1250 m3 s t test p 0 05 further bighead carp passage was reduced to nearly zero at 1475 and 2325 m3 s while uniform modifications to gate operation at 1250 m3 s increased the silver carp passage index slightly the overall index remained below 5 and the bighead carp passage index was unchanged table 3 at the lowest river discharge 625 m3 s a second modification case was considered because flow spread across all gates and minimally reduced passage of both bigheaded carp species fig 7a c and e to reduce carp passage flow had to be further restricted by closing the two outside roller gates flow distributed across all tainter gates and 3 of 5 roller gates figs 8b and 9a and supplementary fig 19 this modification produced velocity conditions similar to the current operation for a discharge of 1250 m3 s and reduced the silver carp passage index by 76 t test p 0 01 table 3 in general this low flow modification increased velocities in the center of the river and alters the shape of the recirculation zones fig 9a an analysis of outdraft conditions i e flow capable of pulling barges away from the lock approach and towards the spillway gates during river discharge of 625 m3 s indicated modified gate operations should not impact navigation as nearly no change in velocity or direction of flow is expected see supplementary fig 16 the passage index of lake sturgeon decreased during modified gate operations only for 625 m3 s t test p 0 05 table 3 while not significant the lake sturgeon passage index increased under all remaining discharges passage of lake sturgeon was not strongly related to total length under 625 m3 s the range of passage index for all size classes was between 0 5 fig 7e and f although somewhat diminished compared to current operations lake sturgeon pathways still exhibited significant lateral movement downstream of the roller gates under modified gate operating procedures as demonstrated by the increased line density near the roller gates in fig 9e and f 3 3 sensitivity analysis there were significant differences observed in the passage index between model variants fig 10 although repeated measures anova indicated that the passage index was not sensitive to a two fold increase in total fatigue a two fold decrease significantly decreased passage comparisons between the two stochastic parameters suggested variable swimming performance parameters have greater influence on passage indices than does velocity fluctuations as expected our fatigue based pathway selection method generated a significantly higher passage index than that resulting from a random walk process 4 discussion in this paper we introduce and describe a novel agent based approach built on the physiological limits of fish swimming performance as a broadly applicable fish passage model to estimate fatigue in fish swimming upstream in complex flows like those present around lock and dams our approach is novel because it computes the highest possible number of fish from a given population to pass a hydraulic challenge by forcing simulated fish to swim upstream and seek a path of least fatigue model results are considered conservative i e they likely overestimate fish passage from the perspective of invasive species control for which managers seek ways to reduce passage and do not want to underestimate passage as it would have devastating consequences importantly our model operated independently of fish behavioral data which can be hard to come by for newly invading species and do not yet exist for bigheaded carps we demonstrated the value of the model by simulating the potential passage of invasive bigheaded carp through a typical lock and dam in the mississippi river and found modifications to gate operating procedures that should decrease passage importantly we found that very modest modifications to gate operation which accomplish the usace goal of evenly distributing velocities across the dam can further reduce passage of bigheaded carp without seemingly impacting lake sturgeon passage modeling flow and fish passage in three dimensions highlights the importance the distribution of velocities through an opened gate plays on fish passage at mississippi river lock and dams initial attempts to correlate fish passage to gate operation used depth averaged velocities only to suggest fish were unlikely to pass through the dams when the head differential was 1 m i e low river discharge zigler et al 2004 however tripp et al 2014 recently found that aside from open river conditions the majority of fish passages observed in the lower mississippi river occurred at 1 m head differential our model also found that silver carp passage peaked at 10 when the river discharge was 625 m3 s and the head differential was 2 6 m increased passage can be attributed to fish being able to avoid high velocity jets through gate openings by utilizing adjacent regions of slow and reversed flow caused by the stepped spillway and recirculating flows near the water surface fig 8 we found that restricting flow across fewer gates at low discharge eliminates this weakness conventional fish passage models using depth and time averaged velocities would not have identified this condition because of their inability to resolve such fine flow details the low passage rates of carp predicted by our model at lock and dam 8 are very consistent with and may explain the low number of bigheaded carp captured in the upper mississippi river for instance over the past 21 years only 33 bigheaded carp have been captured upstream of lock and dam 8 usgs nonindigenous aquatic species database remarkably low passage rates of acoustically tagged bigheaded carp have also been described at the starved rock lock and dam on the illinois river 13 of 153 detected below the dam passed upstream over 3 years lubejko et al 2017 and between lock and dam 20 26 on the mississippi river 63 of 320 detected at any of the 6 dam s passed upstream over 4 years tripp et al 2014 consistent with previous tagging studies our model predicts most passages would occur during open river an ongoing telemetry study of common carp cyprinus carpio passage at lock and dam 2 on the mississippi river has also observed no successful passages through spillway gates an observation reinforced by preliminary runs of this model at lock and dam 2 finger et al unpublished data our assertion that the model overestimates fish passage rates draws support from three lines of evidence first the model assumes all fish will swim continuously upstream without backtracking this assumption represents an extreme condition because not all fish will try to pass a hydraulic challenge bunt et al 1997 haro et al 2004 castro santos 2004 in the case of silver carp coulter et al 2016 found that 15 30 of tagged individuals moved downstream during march and april in an unregulated river when fish were expected to move upstream to spawn second the model assumes fish are able to instantaneously adjust their swim speed to maintain the distance maximizing ground speed not only does this assumption lead to fish swimming the absolute maximum distance possible but instantaneous adjustments to swim speed result in simulated accelerations that are unrealistically high in nature the forward acceleration of a fish is determined by the balance of forces acting on the fish i e friction local velocities and pressure and thrust generated by locomotion even in simplified hydraulic conditions with uniform velocities castro santos 2005 observed only one of six species anadromous clupeids swam at their distance maximizing ground speed third the model assumes fish follow the path of least fatigue and swim continuously until they completely exhaust this assumption likely leads to overestimates of passage because real fish may terminate unsustainable swimming efforts prior to complete exhaustion castro santos 2005 peake and farrell 2006 fish may stop short of complete exhaustion to stage multiple passage attempts castro santos 2005 or facilitate intermittent locomotion i e fish exploit favorable hydraulic conditions to alternate unsustainable swimming efforts with periods of rest without losing ground kramer and mclaughlin 2001 while the model accounts for fish exploiting favorable hydraulic conditions through use of the resultant velocity periods of rest are not explicitly considered to address this potential issue we used the sensitivity analysis to examine a similar situation where fish are given a two fold increase in their time to fatigue this case is akin to fish swimming to exhaustion immediately recovering without losing ground and swimming to exhaustion again the fact increased time to fatigue did not significantly increase the passage index fig 10 lends greater support to our assumption that the path of least fatigue is analogous to pathways generated from multiple passage attempts although integrating hydraulics with swimming performance in a numerical model that predict upstream fish passage is not a new concept it has had limited application for example fishxing developed in the late 1990s has become a common software package used by fish passage practitioners furniss et al 2006 even though it relies on overly simplified representations of flow e g 1 d hydraulic models and assumes swimming performance is constant for all fish of a given species these simplifications can result in conservative estimates of fish passage which can lead to designs with limited biological benefit mahlum et al 2014 furniss et al 2006 more robust models pairing steady state three dimensional flow simulations with fish energetics have been used in contemporary analyses of fishway designs khan 2006 khan et al 2008 however these models only consider two or three prescribed movement paths meant to capture the range of conditions fish are expected to encounter this restriction of movement pathways essentially devolves the model to a one dimensional problem arguably the most robust fish movement model is the eulerian lagrangian agent method elam developed by goodwin et al 2006 2014 the elam forecasts fish movements in novel conditions using behavioral decision making algorithms that relate fish movements to water accelerations however while the elam has been successful at describing mechanisms governing downstream migrating salmon goodwin et al 2014 it requires large telemetry data sets to formulate and test the behavioral rules using a mechanistic approach arenas et al 2015 also pairs high resolution cfd output with large telemetry data sets 401 fish tracked with 63 465 positions to characterize fish behavior in responses to hydraulic conditions unfortunately such data sets are lacking for many species including invasive fish like bigheaded carp and upstream passage at dams in general moreover behavior based fish passage models like those developed by haefner and bowen 2002 and goodwin et al 2006 2014 minimize the influence of swimming fatigue as they were intended to describe downstream movement of juvenile pacific salmon this is a crucial feature since upstream movement through hydraulic challenges requires significant unsustainable swimming efforts whereas it is primarily used to avoid obstacles when swimming downstream modelled fish pathways emerged through discrete decisions made by individual fish based on physiological attributes and local velocity fields the pathways were unique to each simulated fish due to the introduction of physical e g turbulence fluctuations and biological variation e g swimming performance parameters size starting point the requirement of fish to seek the pathway of least fatigue manifested in routes that tended to move along shorelines and structure boundaries and concentrated near areas of low velocity high friction figs 6 8 and 9 this phenomenon appears consistent with the reduced velocity zone hypothesis which states fish accomplish upstream movements through culverts via pathways in low velocity low turbulence boundary layers johnson et al 2012 powers et al 1997 despite no explicit link to fish behavior and vastly different hydraulic conditions the fact our simplified model simulated pathways that are similar to coho salmon oncorhychus kisutch and brook trout salvelinus fontinalis passing through corrugated culverts johnson et al 2012 goerig et al 2016 reinforces the hypothesis that successful upstream passage at lock and dams has strong dependence on swimming ability regardless linking movement decisions to observed behaviors of fish in situ would further enhance model utility and should be sought for future installments of the model the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that modifications to our base assumptions including a two fold increase in time to fatigue do not produce higher estimates of fish passage the comparison between the two stochastic features of the model e g turbulence and swimming performance metrics revealed that swimming parameters accounts for more variation in the model than a fluctuating velocity field this may indicate that uncorrelated velocity fluctuations used here may offer little improvement over steady state velocity conditions and exact simulations of correlated velocity fluctuations are needed an alternative explanation of the low impact of turbulent fluctuations may be the minimal turbulence in areas the fish frequented since the model sought zones of least fatigue fish would presumably avoid regions where the turbulent fluctuations would be greatest i e chance for high instantaneous velocity thus reducing its influence on passage index further examination of unsteady flow statistics on fish passage is required the resolution of the computational mesh limits the model because of its effects on cfd simulations and fish movement decisions on mesh size selection must balance the need for accurate simulations with the requisite computational resources our computational meshes contained elements with a side length i e distance between nodes between 0 15 1 5 m which resulted in meshes containing nearly 2 million nodes and 12 million elements these mesh parameters limit simulation of turbulence with a length scale less than 0 15 m which is still more than 3 times smaller than the smallest fish modeled regardless there was good agreement between the cfd models and both field and laboratory velocity measurements so the potential benefit of a finer mesh was not considered mesh resolution could also impact fish trajectories because fish were restricted to moving between nodes we attempted to limit grid dependent paths by forcing simulated fish to examine 3 or more nodes during each movement step e g silver carp examined an average of 12 neighboring nodes at each step future improvements to the model should consider changes to the step selection process that minimizes mesh dependency i e lagrangian movement model additionally while selected lock and dam structures 2 5 and 8 are already anecdotally considered barriers to native fish passage in the mississippi river zigler et al 2003 2004 knights et al 2002 alterations to their gate operating procedures could be studied using our model to perhaps improve passage at least at certain times of the year while the conservative assumptions of the model preclude any definitive conclusions on lake sturgeon passage the results indicate that the opportunity for passage is not diminished by the proposed modifications further lake sturgeon represents just one of over 100 mississippi river species wilcox et al 2004 and swimming performance data on other species is limited to 10 species regardless there is always the possibility for fish to pass a lock and dam by swimming through the navigational lock chamber although bigheaded carp do pass through lock chambers the rate appears to be small lubejko et al 2017 tripp et al 2014 and could be further reduced using behavioral deterrents such as sound projectors to guide fish towards the gated spillway noatch and suski 2012 zielinski and sorensen 2016 these sound systems can be taxon specific as carp have an extraordinary sense of hearing zielinski and sorensen 2016 generally lock chambers are also not considered sustainable pathways for fish because they have minimal attraction flow and only operate intermittently with boat traffic wilcox et al 2004 although our model provides immediate utility to invasive fish control it could be improved recent advances in our understanding of fish swimming behavior otezia et al 2017 could allow inclusion of fish behavior in the model expanding on the fairly rigid movement rule set currently employed i e fish only swim upstream similarly fish behavior is not just influenced by flow alone it can be influenced by other environmental stimuli e g temperature light sound predators and further study is needed to understand how to account for these factors computationally adding these data would be especially useful for native fish 5 conclusions we describe and test a novel agent based fish passage model that can now be used to guide efforts to slow the upstream migration of non native invasive species whose behavior is not yet understood and that may be easily and safely implemented our findings show the utility of a novel computational tool to identify and potentially modify hydraulic conditions to benefit fish passage or control the agent based approach offers robust opportunity to test how different physiological characteristics i e fish with improved swimming performance could influence overall passage and is a critical first step in predicting passage of fish through hydraulic challenges in particular at lock and dam 8 we found that current gate operations inhibit bigheaded carp passage and that modest operational modifications could enhance this feature such modifications could be implemented quickly at little to no cost and seemingly would not interfere with the navigational function of lock and dams see supplemental fig 16 due to the possibility of improving velocity distributions downstream of the dam and the ancillary benefit of limiting upstream passage of invasive species the usace is now evaluating the potential to implement these gate operating procedures on a trial basis although gate operations alone cannot block all bigheaded carp in the mississippi river the modifications offer a management tool that could minimize passage of bigheaded carp to delay or possibly prevent establishment of populations upstream this approach could also be exported to other applications that require an improved understanding of fish fatigue such

25274,the ability of fish to swim upstream through regions of swiftly flowing water is ultimately dependent on their physiological capacity swimming performance the relationship between swim speed and time to fatigue has been used to design fishways and identify barriers to fish movement however existing numerical models do not all capture the variability in swimming abilities nor the turbulent unsteady and three dimensional aspect of natural flows this deficiency is particularly problematic for fish species whose behavior is poorly understood i e invasive fish and at sites with complex flow patterns here we combine species specific swimming performance with high resolution abstractions of fluid flow in a new agent based framework to model fatigue of upstream swimming fish under turbulent flow conditions our model simulates fish paths in the absence of information on their behavioral tendencies based on a rules set aimed at fish swimming as far upstream as possible before complete exhaustion by selecting the path of least fatigue we demonstrate how this model functions by examining theoretical passage of invasive silver carp hypopthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp h nobilis as well a native fish the lake sturgeon acipenser fulvescens through a typical mississippi river lock and dam lock and dam 8 near genoa wi the model then tests whether passage could be reduced by altering spillway gate operations model results suggest that passage of all three species is low under current gate operations and that passage of both carp species could be further reduced by about half through minor changes in spillway gate operation without apparent impacts on navigation scour or lake sturgeon passage model results are qualitatively consistent with observed passage rates monitored by other studies at similar lock and dams and are consistent with the possibility that the model likely overestimates passage rates by relying on physiological data only this approach could be exported to other applications and fish species to help manage and control fish migration and dispersal especially for fish whose behavior and ecology are poorly understood and not presently quantifiable keywords computational fluid dynamics fish passage asian carp agent based lock and dam mississippi river 1 introduction fish migration and dispersal are key life history traits that are highly susceptible to disruption by natural and man made obstructions like waterfalls dams and culverts upstream movement in particular is heavily impacted by hydraulic challenges i e regions of flow that exceed a fish s locomotor capacity however while understanding how fish movement is influenced by water flow is vital to the design of fishways and identification of barriers to movement relating fish movement to the naturally unsteady turbulent and three dimensional flow conditions found in these situations is not straightforward liao et al 2003 accordingly fisheries managers and engineers have developed computer models to help bridge the gap between water flow and fish movement preferably models of fish movement would incorporate environmental stimuli e g velocity temperature etc with data on physiology e g swimming performance and key information on behavioral attributes e g when and why particular fish move however while both environmental stimuli and physiological traits of certain species of fish are often either well understood or readily obtained using laboratory instrumentation e g swim tunnels fish behavior especially in situ is inherently difficult to obtain and usually unavailable thus with the exception of a handful of economically important species e g pacific salmon freshwater eels behavioral traits of upstream swimming fish in the field are largely unknown this is especially the case for non native fishes some of which are invasive since many existing models require information on behavioral traits which is lacking for invasive species new models that emphasize physiological limits of fish swimming i e how fast and how long can fish swim before exhaustion to examine barriers to fish passage and estimate movement ranges are needed one area where modelling of the physiological limits of fish movement in complex flows would be especially beneficial is the control of invasive species such as the asian or bigheaded carps a genus with two key species the silver carp hypopthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp h nobilis the bigheaded carps are large voracious microphagous fish that were introduced to north america in the 1970s kolar et al 2007 and are now disrupting food webs and negatively impacting fisheries across the mississippi river basin carlson et al 1995 schrank et al 2003 sass et al 2014 pendleton et al 2017 however while they are ubiquitous in much of this large watershed they have not yet invaded many peripheral and interconnected areas including the mississippi river headwaters area upper illinois river and the great lakes usfws 2014 identifying new ways to block upstream movement of bigheaded carp is a key objective of state regional and federal management strategies in these regions tsehaye et al 2013 the set of 29 mississippi river navigational lock and dams located in this river network and managed by the u s army corps of engineers usace offers a possible avenue to block bigheaded carp passage as all fish must pass through them water velocities increase as a result of passing through the lock and dam spillway gates which are also fully adjustable and have already been suggested to reduce passage of native migratory species in the mississippi river knights et al 2002 zigler et al 2003 2004 further a recent swim study on bigheaded carp swimming performance hoover et al 2017 showed that bigheaded carps are relatively weak swimmers the possibility that lock and dams could be used to block passage has also been supported by telemetry studies at lock and dams in the mississippi river tripp et al 2014 and illinois river lubejko et al 2017 which found bigheaded carp passage rates to be low and occur largely during open river conditions i e all spillway gates are raised out of the water and velocities are relatively low lock and dams near the headwaters of the mississippi river where bigheaded carp have not yet reached rarely experience open river conditions fishpro 2004 and represent the greatest likely impediment to fish passage depending on when specific fishes naturally move relative to open river conditions if gate operations could be modified in appropriate ways that do not increase scour near the structure or impair navigation these lock and dams would offer great potential to further restrict bigheaded carp passage however flows through these structures are complex and not easily measured and there are presently no data on carp behavior or movement near these structures models must therefore rely on swimming performance and hydraulic data alone a common approach to such models is to assume fish will swim to their maximum physiological capacity e g exhaustion resulting in conservative estimates of passage as fish are not naturally expected to swim to complete exhaustion models that calculate the highest number of fish passing a hydraulic challenge are of great value as a first step to evaluate whether and how to stop undesirable invasive species while allowing for the possible passage of other species like the lake sturgeon acipenser fulvescens a native fish of ecological and cultural importance that makes prolonged migrations throughout the mississippi river basin in this study we develop a new numeric model to describe fish swimming upstream through a hydraulic challenge by incorporating species specific data on fish swimming performance and hydraulic data around and through structures such as locks and dams we then use the model to both evaluate and then simulate fish passage through a typical lock and dam under various scenarios while comparing findings with known data at similar structures it is novel because of the manner in which we merge two attributes swimming performance and hydraulic conditions the first of which we now introduce fish swimming performance i e the relationship between swim speed and time to fatigue is generally categorized by two distinct modes sustainable and unsustainable swimming while fish can maintain relatively slow swim speeds almost indefinitely by relying on aerobic metabolism i e sustainable swimming they cannot do this at higher speeds as their ability to swim become limited by the contribution of anaerobic metabolism i e unsustainable swimming further fish can only maintain unsustainable swim speeds for limited durations that are inversely related to swim speed beamish 1978 thus after bouts of unsustainable swimming fish completely fatigue and may require several hours to recover see review in kieffer 2000 relationships between swim speed and time to fatigue are readily quantified through laboratory swim tunnel flume trials beamish 1978 castro santos 2005 hoover et al 2017 hydraulic conditions are the second key component of our model they can be generated using well established computational fluid dynamics cfd computer models that simulate water flows by solving the governing equations of fluid flow and is a practical method to model the complex flows in and around lock and dams in a framework that fish passage can be readily incorporated since cfd models provide fine scale resolution i e sub meter seconds minutes hydraulic data over a wide range of conditions it is already widely incorporated into modelling applications focused on the interface of hydraulics and ecology daraio et al 2010 harvey and clifford 2009 generating fine scale simulations of flow fields experienced by fish is critical as the efficacy of any model or assessment of fish movement is inexorably linked to the scale at which spatiotemporal changes in water velocity are modeled tullos et al 2016 our approach is driven by the need to expand upon existing fish passage models which either are limited by reliance upon simplified hydraulics and homogenized swimming performance ex fishxing furniss et al 2006 or require extensive usually nonexistent telemetry data gao et al 2016 arenas et al 2015 goodwin et al 2014 2006 haefner and bowen 2002 also with the exception of gao et al 2016 all extant behavioral models are intended to describe downstream movement of fish where the influence of swimming fatigue is minimized in this study we develop and describe a new agent based approach a mathematical model that simulates the interactions of individuals or agents with each other and or their environment our model incorporates swimming performance data with high resolution abstractions of complex fluid environments to evaluate fish swimming fatigue agent based approaches similar to this have proven to be effective in simulating many complex ecological phenomena like larval fish navigation staaterman and paris 2004 fish aggregations and movement gao et al 2016 arenas et al 2015 goodwin et al 2014 2006 nestler et al 2002 huth and wissel 1992 and mussel dispersal daraio et al 2010 but they have not been deployed to understand invasive fish passage at lock and dams before our model makes three primary assumptions 1 fish are only motivated to move upstream i e no backtracking 2 fish swim at their distance maximizing ground speed and 3 fish select a path of least energetic cost the percent endurance model developed by castro santos 2005 and partially used in other fish passage evaluations neary 2012 is used as a proxy for energy expenditure stochasticity is introduced by varying individual fish swimming performance and hydraulic fields based on turbulent fluctuations we describe the framework of a new agent based swimming fatigue model and discuss its general characteristics and intrinsic models we then demonstrate the applicability of the model by simulating bigheaded carp passage at lock and dam 8 genoa wi on the mississippi river a structure with similar geometry and hydrologic features to many other lock and dams and located upstream of the bigheaded carp invasion front we examine whether these invasive species are likely being blocked by current spillway gate operations at this typical lock and dam and whether changes to gate operating procedures i e gate opening height could enhance this feature without impacting navigation scour or passage of lake sturgeon we qualitatively compare model results to observed fish passage rates at other mississippi river lock and dams we also evaluate whether and how different gate operating procedures might alter the use of the navigational locks and scour downstream of the lock and dam 2 methods we develop a new type of agent based model to evaluate upstream swimming capabilities of fish based on swimming performance and then explore how it can be applied this fish swimming fatigue model is comprised of an environmental domain i e flow field in which agents i e fish are inserted and move throughout fig 1 the aquatic environment is represented by a computational mesh i e spatial grid of elements fig 2 where the location of each element water depth and water velocity are simulated using hydraulic models individual fish follow predefined movement rules in response to local hydraulic conditions e g velocity vectors when we force simulated fish to seek routes requiring the least amount of energy mcelroy et al 2012 the model can reveal which pathways fish must take to cover the maximum upstream distance possible these pathways emerge from the interaction of local hydraulic conditions and theoretical swimming performance once identified we investigate how passage along these paths can be increased or decreased by modifying the hydraulic conditions at our model site although there are many possible pathways fish can take through a complex flow environment we focus on the path with the least energetic cost as all other paths would be higher energy paths and less likely to lead to successful passage and we are interested in determining the highest possible number of fish passing the lock and dam following the schematic representation of the model in fig 1 we first describe how the aquatic environment and fish movement are represented and conclude with a demonstration of the model to identify how invasive bigheaded carps may already be moving through a typical mississippi river lock and dam and then how gate operations at this structure could be altered to block bigheaded carp 2 1 aquatic environment we determine 3d simulations of the flow field using the ansys release 17 1 fluent cfd software package the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and k Œµ turbulence model with wall functions are solved using the finite volume method pressure and velocity are coupled using the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm and second order discretization schemes are used for the convection and viscous terms of the governing equations unstructured tetrahedral meshes i e spatial grid of elements within which discrete versions of the governing equations are solved are generated using the ansys workbench meshing application fig 2 unsteady rans modeling is required to appropriately model complex flow at high reynolds numbers spalart 2000 and to obtain the mean velocity u v w and distribution of turbulent fluctuations u v w at all nodes in the fluid domain the instantaneous velocity at all nodes is described by 1 u x y z u x y z u x y z v x y z v x y z v x y z w x y z w x y z w x y z where u v and w are the instantaneous velocity in the x y and z direction cfd models are run using a cluster node equipped with two 2 4 ghz 14 core intel xeon processors and 128 gb memory 2 2 fish movement framework we examine fish movement through the field using an agent based approach to model fish movement and fatigue this process begins with an initialization step followed by a movement step which has several sub models 2 2 1 initialization we start by generating numeric fish agents with unique swimming performance metrics and total length swimming performance metrics for each individual fish are selected randomly from swim speed fatigue time curves see section 2 2 2 3 normalized by total body length based on experimental data mean estimates of coefficients a and b with standard deviation œÉ a and œÉ b and sustained swim speed limit once coefficients are selected swim speed fatigue relationships are transformed by total body length to create fish with unique swimming abilities this approach is similar to methods outlined by castro santos 2006 combining unique individual total lengths and normalized swimming performance metrics simulates natural biological variation and yield individuals with a range of swimming abilities e g small fast fish vs large slow fish fish are then randomly seeded along the downstream boundary of the flow field following a uniform distribution a uniform distribution is used in lieu of observed approach patterns and to ensure simulated fish approach a hydraulic challenge from as many different trajectories as possible 2 2 2 movement once seeded each fish advances upstream through the flow field by marching through nodes from the computational mesh following a step selection process that follows the upstream pathway that causes the least fatigue without backtracking and swimming at a theoretical distance maximizing ground speed see section 2 2 2 3 castro santos 2005 at each node fish survey neighboring nodes upstream of their current location for fatigue that would result from swimming to each node using the resultant velocity acting between the initial node and each neighboring node fig 3 the fish then selects and moves to the node that results in the lowest possible fatigue each simulation repeats this process for every fish until they completely exhaust or reach the upstream boundary of the flow field the process occurs via 5 sub models that follow the process outlined in fig 1 the sub models address 1 finding the upstream nodes neighboring the fish s current location 2 calculating the resultant velocity fish must swim against 3 calculating the swim speed and fatigue 4 locating the next position and allocating fatigue and 5 updating the agent variables and velocity field 2 2 2 1 sub model 1 locate neighboring nodes in this sub model fish search through the computational mesh to locate potential locations to move that are positioned in front of its current location and are within a specified sensory range Œ¥ see fig 4 since fish are assumed to be motivated to only move upstream only nodes located within an 180 arc upstream of the fish s position were considered i e no backtracking to ensure fish do not bypass regions of higher velocity that cannot otherwise be avoided Œ¥ was set to half the total length of the fish i e approximately three times the minimum node spacing for the smallest modeled fish if less than 3 nodes were located within this hemisphere Œ¥ was doubled until 3 or more nodes were present this limit was set to force fish to survey across a minimum number of movement directions and prevent fish movement paths from being overly restricted by node locations without this requirement fish could be forced to move to a node because of its proximity and not local hydraulic conditions as a measure to reduce computation time Œ¥ was set to twice the total body length in areas where the mesh is coarse nodes spaced 1 1 5 m apart and velocity gradients are low 2 2 2 2 sub model 2 calculate resultant velocity a resultant velocity is calculated for each neighboring node determined in the previous section we used resultant velocity instead of velocity magnitude as it enables modifications which allow for the direction of fluid flow to either aid or hinder movement if the flow vector at the neighboring node acts in the same direction as the potential swim vector the velocity fish must overcome is reduced i e fish movement is potentially aided by flow direction for any initial point x o y o z o and neighboring node x i y i z i with velocity vector u i v i w i and depth below the water surface d i the resultant velocity can be written as 2 u r e s u n 2 v n 2 w n 2 where u n v n w n are conditional velocity components dependent on the direction of movement between the initial point and neighboring node and velocity vector fig 4 the conditional velocity component in the horizontal plane is defined as 3 u n u i Œ¥ x Œ¥ x u i u i 0 Œ¥ x Œ¥ x u i u i in the x direction and 4 v n v i Œ¥ y Œ¥ y v i v i 0 Œ¥ y Œ¥ y v i v i in the y direction when the direction of movement is defined as 5 Œ¥ x x i x o Œ¥ y y i y o using this arrangement if the horizontal direction of movement between the initial position and next node are oriented in the same direction as the velocity component that portion of the velocity vector is set to zero in eqs 3 and 4 for example if the fish was to move to node 7 in fig 4a the horizontal velocity component u n would be set to zero because is acts in the same direction as the fish movement movement in the vertical plane is dependent on both the velocity direction and position relative to the preferred depth of the fish fig 4b fish regulate depth by altering the volume of their swim bladder since this process takes several minutes to achieve even a slight change in density i e time to change swim bladder volume time to pass hydraulic challenge strand et al 2005 fish are assumed to attempt passage with a constant swim bladder volume and thus a preferred depth d p the conditional velocity component in the vertical direction is then defined as 6 w n w i 0 d i d p w i 0 d i d p w i 0 w i 0 d i d p w i 0 d i d p w i 0 in this arrangement the vertical velocity component contributes to the resultant velocity only when the vertical velocity acts against the fish trying to return to its preferred depth 2 2 2 3 sub model 3 calculate swim speed and fatigue we estimated the swim speed and time to fatigue for each individual fish based on swimming performance data collected from swim tunnel tests when swim speeds exceed a fish s maximum sustained swim speed u s u s the relationship between swim speed u s and endurance i e time to fatigue t generally follows a log linear model castro santos 2005 peake et al 1997 7 ln t a b u s b 0 where a and b are the slope and intercept coefficients fit from experimental data swim speed can then be related to ground speed u g by 8 u g u s u r e s where u r e s is the resultant water velocity assumed to act against fish movement the distance swam can then be found as the product of ground speed and endurance castro santos 2005 used this relationship to derive a theoretical distance maximizing ground speed as 9 u g o p t 1 b the concept of distance maximizing ground speed is important because it assumes fish constantly adjust their swimming speed with water velocity to swim the maximum possible distance if u r e s u s u s fish were assumed to swim at a speed equal to u s u s and incur no fatigue however when u r e s u s u s fish must swim at unsustainable speeds i e requiring some level of anaerobic fueling to continue upstream to ensure fish reach as far upstream as possible through the flow field while swimming at unsustainable speeds the ground speed was assumed to be equal to the distance maximizing ground speed castro santos 2005 according to in eq 9 the time Œ¥ t for fish to swim between neighboring nodes can then be calculated as 10 Œ¥ t l u g o p t where l is the distance between nodes calculation of fatigue caused by fish swimming from their initial position to each of the neighboring nodes follows the percent endurance model castro santos 2006 neary 2012 given the fish s endurance t for a given effort and time required to swim between nodes Œ¥ t the percent fatigue Œ¥ f expended by fish to reach the next node can be derived as 11 Œ¥ f Œ¥ t t 100 u r e s u s u s 0 u r e s u s u s the fish s endurance t is not static but is recalculated during each step based on the required swim speed to reach the neighboring node this approach assumes fish have a predetermined energy budget and discrete bouts of swimming between nodes incrementally decreases the budget which if used entirely leads to complete exhaustion and termination of the passage attempt unsustainable swimming is commonly divided into two distinct modes prolonged and burst castro santos 2005 prolonged mode swimming is fueled by a mixture of anaerobic and aerobic metabolism that can be maintained for 20 s 200 min while burst mode swimming is fueled entirely by anaerobic metabolism and can typically only be maintained for 20 s beamish 1978 for each mode the relationship between swimming speed and endurance still follows eq 7 but with unique coefficients castro santos 2006 notably the distance maximizing ground speed eq 9 would also be unique for each swimming mode the percent endurance model can be modified to estimate fatigue during both prolonged and burst swim modes castro santos 2006 neary 2012 2 2 2 4 sub model 4 locate the next position and allocating fatigue step selection assumes fish follow the upstream pathway that causes the least amount of fatigue without backtracking at each decision point all neighboring nodes are surveyed based on percent fatigue in the event all neighboring nodes cause fatigue the node with the minimum percent fatigue is chosen in all other situations where at least one node does not cause fatigue the new position of the fish is selected at random from the group of non fatigue causing nodes because only nodes in front of the fish are surveyed the effect of the random node selection makes the default movement pattern reflect a biased random walk once the new position is selected the total fatigue f is updated based on the percent fatigue incurred during movement this way the total fatigue at any point along a given pathway is the accumulation of Œ¥ f at all prior steps complete exhaustion occurs when f Œ¥ f j Œ¥ f j 1 Œ¥ f n 100 where j 1 2 n denotes each step 2 2 2 5 sub model 5 update agent and velocity field after each step selection the velocity field is updated i e turbulent fluctuations approximated and agent variables are recorded the velocity field is updated by augmenting the steady state velocity with an approximation of turbulent fluctuations by selecting a new water velocity at each node from a normal distribution with mean u v w and standard deviation u v w this step incorporates turbulence into the flow field using a stochastic approach rather than attempting to directly correlate fish movement with specific time steps of an unsteady flow condition the agent variables recorded after each step include fish location x y z water depth d distance traveled l resultant velocity u r e s swimming speed u s u s percent fatigue Œ¥ f and swimming time Œ¥ t a collective summary of fish total length tl starting coordinates and binary passage result 0 success 1 failure is also recorded passage success is quantified by fish reaching a predetermined distance past a hydraulic challenge 2 3 applying the model to a typical mississippi river lock and dam to evaluate fish passage to demonstrate the functionality of our agent based model it was applied at lock and dam 8 genoa wi fig 5 a to determine first how current gate operations might be blocking bigheaded carp passage and then how this attribute might be enhanced lock and dam 8 has similar operation and geometry to other lock and dams in the upper mississippi river flow through lock and dam 8 is controlled by two types of spillways gates 1 ten 10 7 m wide tainter gates and 2 five 24 4 m wide roller gates the adjacent lock chamber is 152 4 m long x 33 5 m wide fig 5b to pass flow both sets of spillway gates raise off the river bottom following a pre determined operating schedule as documented in the usace water control manual usace 2003 water velocity through the gated openings is generally the greatest when the gates are barely open and decreases as the gates are raised when the gates are raised completely out of the water the dam is in so called open river conditions existing gate operating procedures aim to produce a uniform velocity distribution which does not exceed a depth averaged velocity of 1 5 m s at the endsill of the structure which is situated 23 m downstream of the roller gates and 17 m downstream of the tainter gates usace 2003 discharge rating curves for each gate type were established by the usace using velocity data collected from acoustic doppler current profiler adcp surveys 100 m downstream and a physical model study markussen and wilhelms 1987 but has never been modeled using cfd existing gate operation procedures dictate all tainter gates are opened to one uniform height and all roller gates are opened to a different uniform height the lock was not considered in our model because they have minimal attraction flow for fish operate intermittently with boat traffic and are not considered sustainable pathways for fish passage wilcox et al 2004 2 3 1 cfd models 3d cfd simulations were first run for five river discharges 625 1250 1475 2325 and 2720 m3 s at lock and dam 8 see table 2 for gate positions these flows represent the full range of gate controlled flows i e open river conditions at 2720 m3 s cfd velocity fields were qualitatively validated using adcp surveys 100 m downstream and results from a physical model study markussen and wilhelms 1987 see supplemental figs 1 12 additional cfd models of river discharge 1755 and 2067 m3 s were performed and qualitatively validated with physical model studies to further ensure cfd model accuracy but not analyzed for fish passage unstructured tetrahedral meshes 106 nodes were generated using the ansys workbench meshing application the mesh sizes ranged from 0 15 to 1 5 m 1 2 million nodes construction drawings and sub meter resolution river soundings data provided by the usace were used to generate boundaries for the cfd modelling upstream boundary conditions were specified as a uniform depth averaged velocity the downstream boundary was set as an outflow boundary where the diffusion flux of all variables was set to zero no slip zero fluid velocity boundaries were set at all solid surface interfaces and surface roughness roughness height of 0 03 m for all concrete surfaces and 0 3 m for river substrate was accounted for by applying the modified law of the wall equations and velocity shift formulas water surface boundary conditions were treated as a rigid lid i e zero shear stress set to match the longitudinal water surface profile obtained from gauge records although a rigid lid assumption can induce errors in velocity field calculations in areas were the water surface fluctuates substantially the water surface downstream of mississippi river lock and dam spillways experience only minor fluctuations due to the bottom release of water the rigid lid assumption was considered reasonable due good agreement with the physical model study that collected profiles of velocities through the spillway symmetry boundary conditions were set along portions of the right river bank looking downstream where river soundings were not available a hybrid initialization process was used to set the velocity field and domain averaged values for turbulence variables within the fluid domain the unsteady solution used to generated turbulent statistics used in eq 1 was run to a quasi steady state solution converges in a statistical sense with convergence criteria for residuals set at 10 4 unsteady calculations were run with a time step of Œ¥ t 0 2 s with a maximum of 15 dual time stepping iterations per physical time step a first order implicit solver was used to simulate 1000 physical time steps following ge and sotiropoulos 2005 the unsteady solution was considered converged once the difference between instantaneous velocity fluctuations about the mean were an order of magnitude less than the mean post processing of the cfd data e g velocity data and mesh coordinates included modifying the domain with artificial boundaries to create convex surfaces to prevent fish from getting stuck i e accessing regions where no continuous upstream pathways are available because the model prevents fish from backtracking in an unmodified domain instances could occur where fish move behind a spillway gate or lock chamber and are unable to pass without backtracking to remedy this situation artificial boundaries were constructed downstream of each tainter gate i e the gate s curve creates a region where fish can get stuck and the lock chamber at the tainter gates an artificial boundary was applied along a plane extending downstream from the lip of the gate and back to the water surface along a 1 1 slope at the lock chamber an artificial boundary was applied along a plane extending downstream from the apex of the interior lock wall across the lock chamber at a 1 1 slope these boundaries did not change the velocity field but merely prevent fish from accessing these regions and direct fish upstream 2 3 2 modeling fish passage under current usace gate operating procedures our fish passage model was used to simulate movement of silver carp bighead carp and a native species with known swimming performance the lake sturgeon through lock and dam 8 for each species 5000 fish agents were assigned a total body length from one of five 100 mm size classes adapted from published population size distributions these were adapted from seibert et al 2015 for silver carp tl 600 1000 mm schrank and guy 2002 for bighead carp tl 700 1100 mm and mcdougall et al 2013 for lake sturgeon tl 900 1300 mm in other large rivers as no data existed for lock and dam 8 see supplementary fig 13 these locations were believed to have relatively large unexploited fish thus making our models conservative or likely to overestimate passage because silver and bighead carps are pelagic feeders they were assigned a preferred depth of 1 m whereas lake sturgeon a benthic species was assumed to prefer the maximum depth of the domain swimming performance data of all three species showed no clear distinction between prolonged and burst swimming modes hoover et al 2017 peake et al 1997 so all endurance calculations used a single set of parameters for unsustainable swimming table 1 provides the size range maximum sustained swim speed u s u s and swimming performance curve coefficients of each species fish passage analyses were run for current gate operating conditions specified by the usace water control manual 2 3 3 modelling fish passage under modified gate operating procedures after evaluating theoretical passage of silver carp bighead carp and lake sturgeon during current gate operating procedures we used the model to evaluate whether and how modifications to gate operating procedures might further impede bigheaded carp passage while at the same time minimally impacting scour protection and lake sturgeon passage because our evaluation of current gate operating procedures found that they were producing a previously unknown and unexpected imbalance in flow through the gates a new set of gate operating procedures were sought the modified gate operating procedures were set to correct the flow imbalance and produce uniform velocity distributions downstream of the dam that were also less than the maximum allowable velocity at the endsill for scour protection set by the usace of 1 5 m s this was accomplished with modest modifications to gate operating procedures less than 0 6 m difference on average in gate opening height from current operating procedures in the usace water control manual see table 2 for changes in gate opening heights fish passage analyses were run for the modified gate operating procedures using the same number of individuals length distributions and swimming performance metrics as the analysis of current gate operations the efficacy of the modified gate operations to block silver carp and bighead carp was determined by comparing the modified passage results with current passage 2 3 4 statistical analysis of fish passage the passage index an estimate of the maximum percentage of a theoretical distribution of fish from each size class to pass was calculated by dividing the total number of successful passages by the total number of individuals passage index data for each size class were calculated according to eq 12 and binned into 10 equal sized groups to obtain the mean s d passage index p i t l across the group within each sub group the passage index is calculated as 12 p i t l c o u n t o f f i s h p a s s e d o f s i z e t l t o t a l o f f i s h s e e d e d i n t o m o d e l o f s i z e t l where each individual size class is designated by total length t l student s t tests equal variance two sided were used to test whether the mean passage index of a specific size class differed between current and modified conditions next population scale passage index p i p o p values were calculated by summing the products of the percent frequency p o p of each size class from species specific size distribution by the size specific passage index as demonstrated by eq 13 13 p i p o p i t l p i i p o p i the population scale passage index was calculated across the 10 sub groups and student s t tests equal variance two sided were used to test whether the mean passage index of a population differed between current and modified conditions for both analyses values were examined for normalcy shapiro wilk tests all analyses were conducted with custom scripts in matlab mathworks ma usa significance was determined at p 0 05 2 3 5 sensitivity analysis lastly a sensitivity analysis was performed to demonstrate that the model configuration used in our analysis resulted in the most conservative estimates of fish passage index and to understand how the stochastic features of the model swimming performance turbulence representation and path selection method might impact results this was performed in lieu of a traditional validation because bigheaded carp are so uncommon at this location as to be uncatchable and no data are available to relate bigheaded carp passage through individual lock and dam gates sensitivity analyses were conducted about a base condition using the results of the base model for 5000 silver carp with a body length of 800 mm during current gate operations at 2325 m3 s the sensitivity analysis was run for silver carp during a single discharge and gate operation condition because the impacts of the stochastic model features are conserved across all flow and gate operating conditions fish species and total length first we evaluated the impact of swimming performance metrics on model results by doubling maximum fatigue i e fatigue occurs at 200 and then by reducing the maximum fatigue by half i e fatigue occurs at 50 next we examined the impact of turbulent velocity fluctuations by using the steady state velocity field thereby allowing fish to move through a static flow field another model examined the impact of variation in swimming performance metrics by using only the mean swimming performance metrics section 2 2 1 table 1 for all individuals finally to ensure our fatigue based pathway selection method differed from a simple random walk we ran a model using the same swimming performance metrics and turbulent fluctuations approaches as our base model with step selection following a purely biased random walk 3 results 3 1 passage under current usace gate operating procedures model runs of our agent based model under current operating procedures indicated that there are flow imbalances across lock and dam 8 with low velocity regions that all fish could be exploiting to pass without exhausting fig 6 a and b cfd simulations revealed that the low velocity regions were caused by areas of rotational flow and an imbalance in discharge through the tainter and roller gates at all flow conditions flow rates through each gate type differed by as much as 27 from those expected in the water control manual usace 2003 the water volume ratio of flow through the tainter and roller gates was 39 61 across all discharges depth averaged velocities downstream of the roller gates exceed the usace maximum allowable velocity of 1 5 m s table 2 deceleration of flows downstream of the dam under current operating procedures also creates two zones of horizontal rotating flow along both banks and a third zone of vertical rotational flow in a downstream scour hole the passage index of both silver and bighead carp under all flows and current operating procedures was proportional to fish length with larger fish groups having a higher passage index than small fish fig 7 the population scale passage index i e maximum percentage of a theoretical distribution of fish to pass for silver and bighead carp populations ranged from 2 to 12 and 0 4 respectively table 3 across all flow conditions the highest passage indices of either species occurred for silver carp during both open river 2720 m3 s and the lowest modeled discharge 625 m3 s while high values of passage index were expected for open river conditions when velocities at the structure are lowest similarly high index values at the lowest discharge when velocities are highest were unexpected close inspection of silver carp trajectories through a tainter gate opening revealed it was possible to avoid the high velocity jet created by the narrow gate opening by utilizing regions of relatively slow and reversed flow caused by the stepped spillway and recirculating flows near the water surface fig 8 a results of the agent based model also indicated lake sturgeon passage during current gate operating procedures was relatively constant across all flows table 3 ranging from 2 to 6 similar to the silver carp lake sturgeon that passed through the dam did so through the outermost gates fig 6e and f the specified tendency of lake sturgeon to swim on the bottom resulted in pathways that shifted laterally in front of the roller gates as demonstrated by the increased line density near the roller gates in fig 6e and f a feature not observed in either silver or bighead carp although silver and bighead carp have superior swimming performance compared to lake sturgeon relative to body length table 1 lake sturgeon median tl 1000 mm can obtain similar absolute swim speeds as bighead carp median tl 700 mm due to their large size 3 2 passage under modified gate operating procedures gate operating procedures in the model were modified to match a constant water volume ratio of 45 55 through the tainter and roller gates respectively to mitigate the predicted high velocities downstream of the roller gates under current conditions this would result in modest modifications to gate operating procedures see table 2 which the model predicted to produce near uniform velocity distributions downstream of the dam while also seemingly minimizing regions silver carp and bighead carp could exploit fig 9 and supplementary fig 15 although the proposed modifications do not eliminate zones of rotational flow velocities are redistributed across the dam which minimized regions of low velocities the modifications caused an increase in depth averaged velocity below the tainter gates while decreasing the depth averaged velocities below the roller gate openings table 2 although the depth average velocity at 2325 m3 s still exceeded the maximum allowable velocity set by the usace of 1 5 m s the velocity at the roller gate was reduced from 2 1 m s to 1 8 m s no incremental increase in scour around the dam was expected since the average velocities under modified gate operating procedures do not exceed current conditions results of the agent based model indicated that both silver and bighead carp passage would be reduced during all flow conditions during modified gate operating procedures table 3 silver carp passage was reduced by over 50 from current conditions t test p 0 05 table 3 at discharges greater than 1250 m3 s while bighead carp passage was found to decrease at all flows but 1250 m3 s t test p 0 05 further bighead carp passage was reduced to nearly zero at 1475 and 2325 m3 s while uniform modifications to gate operation at 1250 m3 s increased the silver carp passage index slightly the overall index remained below 5 and the bighead carp passage index was unchanged table 3 at the lowest river discharge 625 m3 s a second modification case was considered because flow spread across all gates and minimally reduced passage of both bigheaded carp species fig 7a c and e to reduce carp passage flow had to be further restricted by closing the two outside roller gates flow distributed across all tainter gates and 3 of 5 roller gates figs 8b and 9a and supplementary fig 19 this modification produced velocity conditions similar to the current operation for a discharge of 1250 m3 s and reduced the silver carp passage index by 76 t test p 0 01 table 3 in general this low flow modification increased velocities in the center of the river and alters the shape of the recirculation zones fig 9a an analysis of outdraft conditions i e flow capable of pulling barges away from the lock approach and towards the spillway gates during river discharge of 625 m3 s indicated modified gate operations should not impact navigation as nearly no change in velocity or direction of flow is expected see supplementary fig 16 the passage index of lake sturgeon decreased during modified gate operations only for 625 m3 s t test p 0 05 table 3 while not significant the lake sturgeon passage index increased under all remaining discharges passage of lake sturgeon was not strongly related to total length under 625 m3 s the range of passage index for all size classes was between 0 5 fig 7e and f although somewhat diminished compared to current operations lake sturgeon pathways still exhibited significant lateral movement downstream of the roller gates under modified gate operating procedures as demonstrated by the increased line density near the roller gates in fig 9e and f 3 3 sensitivity analysis there were significant differences observed in the passage index between model variants fig 10 although repeated measures anova indicated that the passage index was not sensitive to a two fold increase in total fatigue a two fold decrease significantly decreased passage comparisons between the two stochastic parameters suggested variable swimming performance parameters have greater influence on passage indices than does velocity fluctuations as expected our fatigue based pathway selection method generated a significantly higher passage index than that resulting from a random walk process 4 discussion in this paper we introduce and describe a novel agent based approach built on the physiological limits of fish swimming performance as a broadly applicable fish passage model to estimate fatigue in fish swimming upstream in complex flows like those present around lock and dams our approach is novel because it computes the highest possible number of fish from a given population to pass a hydraulic challenge by forcing simulated fish to swim upstream and seek a path of least fatigue model results are considered conservative i e they likely overestimate fish passage from the perspective of invasive species control for which managers seek ways to reduce passage and do not want to underestimate passage as it would have devastating consequences importantly our model operated independently of fish behavioral data which can be hard to come by for newly invading species and do not yet exist for bigheaded carps we demonstrated the value of the model by simulating the potential passage of invasive bigheaded carp through a typical lock and dam in the mississippi river and found modifications to gate operating procedures that should decrease passage importantly we found that very modest modifications to gate operation which accomplish the usace goal of evenly distributing velocities across the dam can further reduce passage of bigheaded carp without seemingly impacting lake sturgeon passage modeling flow and fish passage in three dimensions highlights the importance the distribution of velocities through an opened gate plays on fish passage at mississippi river lock and dams initial attempts to correlate fish passage to gate operation used depth averaged velocities only to suggest fish were unlikely to pass through the dams when the head differential was 1 m i e low river discharge zigler et al 2004 however tripp et al 2014 recently found that aside from open river conditions the majority of fish passages observed in the lower mississippi river occurred at 1 m head differential our model also found that silver carp passage peaked at 10 when the river discharge was 625 m3 s and the head differential was 2 6 m increased passage can be attributed to fish being able to avoid high velocity jets through gate openings by utilizing adjacent regions of slow and reversed flow caused by the stepped spillway and recirculating flows near the water surface fig 8 we found that restricting flow across fewer gates at low discharge eliminates this weakness conventional fish passage models using depth and time averaged velocities would not have identified this condition because of their inability to resolve such fine flow details the low passage rates of carp predicted by our model at lock and dam 8 are very consistent with and may explain the low number of bigheaded carp captured in the upper mississippi river for instance over the past 21 years only 33 bigheaded carp have been captured upstream of lock and dam 8 usgs nonindigenous aquatic species database remarkably low passage rates of acoustically tagged bigheaded carp have also been described at the starved rock lock and dam on the illinois river 13 of 153 detected below the dam passed upstream over 3 years lubejko et al 2017 and between lock and dam 20 26 on the mississippi river 63 of 320 detected at any of the 6 dam s passed upstream over 4 years tripp et al 2014 consistent with previous tagging studies our model predicts most passages would occur during open river an ongoing telemetry study of common carp cyprinus carpio passage at lock and dam 2 on the mississippi river has also observed no successful passages through spillway gates an observation reinforced by preliminary runs of this model at lock and dam 2 finger et al unpublished data our assertion that the model overestimates fish passage rates draws support from three lines of evidence first the model assumes all fish will swim continuously upstream without backtracking this assumption represents an extreme condition because not all fish will try to pass a hydraulic challenge bunt et al 1997 haro et al 2004 castro santos 2004 in the case of silver carp coulter et al 2016 found that 15 30 of tagged individuals moved downstream during march and april in an unregulated river when fish were expected to move upstream to spawn second the model assumes fish are able to instantaneously adjust their swim speed to maintain the distance maximizing ground speed not only does this assumption lead to fish swimming the absolute maximum distance possible but instantaneous adjustments to swim speed result in simulated accelerations that are unrealistically high in nature the forward acceleration of a fish is determined by the balance of forces acting on the fish i e friction local velocities and pressure and thrust generated by locomotion even in simplified hydraulic conditions with uniform velocities castro santos 2005 observed only one of six species anadromous clupeids swam at their distance maximizing ground speed third the model assumes fish follow the path of least fatigue and swim continuously until they completely exhaust this assumption likely leads to overestimates of passage because real fish may terminate unsustainable swimming efforts prior to complete exhaustion castro santos 2005 peake and farrell 2006 fish may stop short of complete exhaustion to stage multiple passage attempts castro santos 2005 or facilitate intermittent locomotion i e fish exploit favorable hydraulic conditions to alternate unsustainable swimming efforts with periods of rest without losing ground kramer and mclaughlin 2001 while the model accounts for fish exploiting favorable hydraulic conditions through use of the resultant velocity periods of rest are not explicitly considered to address this potential issue we used the sensitivity analysis to examine a similar situation where fish are given a two fold increase in their time to fatigue this case is akin to fish swimming to exhaustion immediately recovering without losing ground and swimming to exhaustion again the fact increased time to fatigue did not significantly increase the passage index fig 10 lends greater support to our assumption that the path of least fatigue is analogous to pathways generated from multiple passage attempts although integrating hydraulics with swimming performance in a numerical model that predict upstream fish passage is not a new concept it has had limited application for example fishxing developed in the late 1990s has become a common software package used by fish passage practitioners furniss et al 2006 even though it relies on overly simplified representations of flow e g 1 d hydraulic models and assumes swimming performance is constant for all fish of a given species these simplifications can result in conservative estimates of fish passage which can lead to designs with limited biological benefit mahlum et al 2014 furniss et al 2006 more robust models pairing steady state three dimensional flow simulations with fish energetics have been used in contemporary analyses of fishway designs khan 2006 khan et al 2008 however these models only consider two or three prescribed movement paths meant to capture the range of conditions fish are expected to encounter this restriction of movement pathways essentially devolves the model to a one dimensional problem arguably the most robust fish movement model is the eulerian lagrangian agent method elam developed by goodwin et al 2006 2014 the elam forecasts fish movements in novel conditions using behavioral decision making algorithms that relate fish movements to water accelerations however while the elam has been successful at describing mechanisms governing downstream migrating salmon goodwin et al 2014 it requires large telemetry data sets to formulate and test the behavioral rules using a mechanistic approach arenas et al 2015 also pairs high resolution cfd output with large telemetry data sets 401 fish tracked with 63 465 positions to characterize fish behavior in responses to hydraulic conditions unfortunately such data sets are lacking for many species including invasive fish like bigheaded carp and upstream passage at dams in general moreover behavior based fish passage models like those developed by haefner and bowen 2002 and goodwin et al 2006 2014 minimize the influence of swimming fatigue as they were intended to describe downstream movement of juvenile pacific salmon this is a crucial feature since upstream movement through hydraulic challenges requires significant unsustainable swimming efforts whereas it is primarily used to avoid obstacles when swimming downstream modelled fish pathways emerged through discrete decisions made by individual fish based on physiological attributes and local velocity fields the pathways were unique to each simulated fish due to the introduction of physical e g turbulence fluctuations and biological variation e g swimming performance parameters size starting point the requirement of fish to seek the pathway of least fatigue manifested in routes that tended to move along shorelines and structure boundaries and concentrated near areas of low velocity high friction figs 6 8 and 9 this phenomenon appears consistent with the reduced velocity zone hypothesis which states fish accomplish upstream movements through culverts via pathways in low velocity low turbulence boundary layers johnson et al 2012 powers et al 1997 despite no explicit link to fish behavior and vastly different hydraulic conditions the fact our simplified model simulated pathways that are similar to coho salmon oncorhychus kisutch and brook trout salvelinus fontinalis passing through corrugated culverts johnson et al 2012 goerig et al 2016 reinforces the hypothesis that successful upstream passage at lock and dams has strong dependence on swimming ability regardless linking movement decisions to observed behaviors of fish in situ would further enhance model utility and should be sought for future installments of the model the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that modifications to our base assumptions including a two fold increase in time to fatigue do not produce higher estimates of fish passage the comparison between the two stochastic features of the model e g turbulence and swimming performance metrics revealed that swimming parameters accounts for more variation in the model than a fluctuating velocity field this may indicate that uncorrelated velocity fluctuations used here may offer little improvement over steady state velocity conditions and exact simulations of correlated velocity fluctuations are needed an alternative explanation of the low impact of turbulent fluctuations may be the minimal turbulence in areas the fish frequented since the model sought zones of least fatigue fish would presumably avoid regions where the turbulent fluctuations would be greatest i e chance for high instantaneous velocity thus reducing its influence on passage index further examination of unsteady flow statistics on fish passage is required the resolution of the computational mesh limits the model because of its effects on cfd simulations and fish movement decisions on mesh size selection must balance the need for accurate simulations with the requisite computational resources our computational meshes contained elements with a side length i e distance between nodes between 0 15 1 5 m which resulted in meshes containing nearly 2 million nodes and 12 million elements these mesh parameters limit simulation of turbulence with a length scale less than 0 15 m which is still more than 3 times smaller than the smallest fish modeled regardless there was good agreement between the cfd models and both field and laboratory velocity measurements so the potential benefit of a finer mesh was not considered mesh resolution could also impact fish trajectories because fish were restricted to moving between nodes we attempted to limit grid dependent paths by forcing simulated fish to examine 3 or more nodes during each movement step e g silver carp examined an average of 12 neighboring nodes at each step future improvements to the model should consider changes to the step selection process that minimizes mesh dependency i e lagrangian movement model additionally while selected lock and dam structures 2 5 and 8 are already anecdotally considered barriers to native fish passage in the mississippi river zigler et al 2003 2004 knights et al 2002 alterations to their gate operating procedures could be studied using our model to perhaps improve passage at least at certain times of the year while the conservative assumptions of the model preclude any definitive conclusions on lake sturgeon passage the results indicate that the opportunity for passage is not diminished by the proposed modifications further lake sturgeon represents just one of over 100 mississippi river species wilcox et al 2004 and swimming performance data on other species is limited to 10 species regardless there is always the possibility for fish to pass a lock and dam by swimming through the navigational lock chamber although bigheaded carp do pass through lock chambers the rate appears to be small lubejko et al 2017 tripp et al 2014 and could be further reduced using behavioral deterrents such as sound projectors to guide fish towards the gated spillway noatch and suski 2012 zielinski and sorensen 2016 these sound systems can be taxon specific as carp have an extraordinary sense of hearing zielinski and sorensen 2016 generally lock chambers are also not considered sustainable pathways for fish because they have minimal attraction flow and only operate intermittently with boat traffic wilcox et al 2004 although our model provides immediate utility to invasive fish control it could be improved recent advances in our understanding of fish swimming behavior otezia et al 2017 could allow inclusion of fish behavior in the model expanding on the fairly rigid movement rule set currently employed i e fish only swim upstream similarly fish behavior is not just influenced by flow alone it can be influenced by other environmental stimuli e g temperature light sound predators and further study is needed to understand how to account for these factors computationally adding these data would be especially useful for native fish 5 conclusions we describe and test a novel agent based fish passage model that can now be used to guide efforts to slow the upstream migration of non native invasive species whose behavior is not yet understood and that may be easily and safely implemented our findings show the utility of a novel computational tool to identify and potentially modify hydraulic conditions to benefit fish passage or control the agent based approach offers robust opportunity to test how different physiological characteristics i e fish with improved swimming performance could influence overall passage and is a critical first step in predicting passage of fish through hydraulic challenges in particular at lock and dam 8 we found that current gate operations inhibit bigheaded carp passage and that modest operational modifications could enhance this feature such modifications could be implemented quickly at little to no cost and seemingly would not interfere with the navigational function of lock and dams see supplemental fig 16 due to the possibility of improving velocity distributions downstream of the dam and the ancillary benefit of limiting upstream passage of invasive species the usace is now evaluating the potential to implement these gate operating procedures on a trial basis although gate operations alone cannot block all bigheaded carp in the mississippi river the modifications offer a management tool that could minimize passage of bigheaded carp to delay or possibly prevent establishment of populations upstream this approach could also be exported to other applications that require an improved understanding of fish fatigue such
