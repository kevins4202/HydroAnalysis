20015,microalgal and cyanobacterial resource recovery systems could significantly advance nutrient recovery from wastewater by achieving effluent nitrogen n and phosphorus p levels below the current limit of technology the successful implementation of phytoplankton however requires the formulation of process models that balance fidelity and simplicity to accurately simulate dynamic performance in response to environmental conditions this work synthesizes the range of model structures that have been leveraged for algae and cyanobacteria modeling and core model features that are required to enable reliable process modeling in the context of water resource recovery facilities results from an extensive literature review of over 300 published phytoplankton models are presented with particular attention to similarities with and differences from existing strategies to model chemotrophic wastewater treatment processes e g via the activated sludge models asms building on published

resource recovery facilities wrrfs are nearing the limit of current technologies e g the limit of biological nutrient removal bnr is roughly 3 mg n l 1 for total nitrogen and 0 1 mg p l 1 for total phosphorus usepa 2007 as effluent requirements become more stringent removal of both nitrogen and phosphorus past the current limit of technology requires the development of new technologies capable of reliably scavenging all forms of nutrients including dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved organic phosphorus bott and parker 2011 microalgal resource recovery systems could significantly advance nutrient management of wastewaters by simultaneously achieving effluent concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus below the current limit of technology and allowing for nutrient reuse e g as fertilizer leow et al 2015 metting 1996 although technical and economical bottlenecks still exist the broad and sustained adoption of algal and cyanobacterial treatment processes is contingent upon the ability to reliably and accurately simulate full scale performance in response to reactor and process design influent composition and environmental conditions this ability is hindered by a lack of model fidelity and transparency regarding model structure and underlying science some microalgae and cyanobacteria have the ability to utilize phototrophic heterotrophic or mixotrophic i e phototrophic and heterotrophic simultaneously metabolisms e g chlorella vulgaris adesanya et al 2014 spirulina platensis zhang et al 1998 and synechocystis sp lopo et al 2012 the metabolism being used depends on environmental conditions such as substrate availability and lighting additionally the presence or absence of nutrients both currently and in the cell s recent past can affect carbon uptake and partitioning e g as biomass or storage compounds these complex processes are frequently handled by formulating models with either i more variables i e compared to most models of heterotrophic bacteria or ii incorrect simplifying assumptions that diminish model accuracy these contrasting approaches have resulted in hundreds of models for algae indicating a lack of clear direction for this field initial modeling efforts sought to understand phytoplankton behavior in natural ecosystems e g jørgensen 1976 steele 1962 but translation of empirically derived models from nature to engineered systems requires verification and possibly modification additionally disparate approaches to algal and cyanobacterial process modeling highly variable experimental conditions for model calibration and validation and a lack of regard for existing chemotrophic model structures e g asms adm1 have also impeded the development of generalizable model structures and well defined parameters relevant to wrrfs a k a wastewater treatment plants wwtps recent review articles have summarized the breadth of models available to simulate algal growth e g darvehei et al 2018 lee et al 2015 but there is no clear indication of when subcomponents should be considered or excluded e g simulate organic carbon uptake or not nor is there a rationale or guidance for choosing any particular equation to simulate each subcomponent recent process models developed by the authors baroukh et al 2014 guest et al 2013 wágner et al 2016 have attempted to reconcile these differences but an industry wide harmonized consensus is still lacking to advance the broader implementation of algae and cyanobacteria process models by researchers and practitioners it is critical to establish a unified modeling framework that is capable of accounting for relevant process and environmental conditions while simultaneously avoiding unnecessary complexity the objective of this work was to critically review approaches to algae and cyanobacteria modeling and propose a unified framework for phytoplankton process modeling in the context of wrrfs as researchers attempt to balance model complexity with accuracy the range of disparate phytoplankton wastewater treatment models continues to grow to gain a better understanding of current approaches to modeling a critical literature review was performed to characterize core components of modeling algal and cyanobacterial bioprocesses and elucidate their relative importance to the overall accuracy and complexity of wastewater models based on the available information a modeling framework is proposed that can be used for future research and development in order to advance phytoplankton model fidelity and transparency as well as allow for its integration with current international water association iwa models e g batstone et al 2002 henze et al 2000 this work synthesizes the findings and recommendations from an international collaboration of phytoplankton modelers working toward the development of a unified modeling framework for microalgal and cyanobacterial process models building on recent process models developed by the authors and on recent reviews the results from an extensive critical literature review of 324 articles and conference proceedings presenting algae cyanobacteria models is presented to identify state variables and processes that can serve as the core unified modeling framework for phytoplankton based bioprocesses methods a comprehensive review of algal and cyanobacterial modeling literature was conducted through scopus based on the presence of search terms in the title abstract or keywords of research articles the search terms for this review utilized wildcards to efficiently search for multiple variants of a word at once e g model modeling and models are all found using the term model as well as a proximity search to ensure the word model was within 10 words of grow or metabol i e w 10 the specific search used was title abs key alga or cyanobact or phytoplank and grow or metabol w 10 model which yielded 2 402 research articles on january 26 2018 each paper was then screened to determine if it met any of the following exclusion criteria i it did not model growth ii it did not pertain to cyanobacteria or eukaryotic algae iii there was no new or updated model presented iv the model presented was a simple regression of experimental data or v the paper was a review following screening citations as well as citing papers were examined for each included paper in order to capture any research articles that may have been excluded from the scopus search these papers were included if they did not meet any of the exclusion criteria the literature review yielded a total of 324 articles and conference proceedings that met the inclusion criteria i e 2 078 did not meet inclusion criteria a full list of the included papers can be found in listing s1 of the supplementary information si for each research article included in this review model components were extracted and classified based on the processes being simulated including the process rate equations for growth nutrient uptake and storage as well as state variables e g inorganic carbon ammonium nitrate phosphate main forcing variables incident irradiance temperature background turbidity metabolisms considered phototrophic heterotrophic and or mixotrophic inclusion of photoacclimation and how the photosynthesis irradiance pi relationship was modeled finally approaches to explicitly model ph irradiance within the reactor gas transfer and other supporting processes were also evaluated to identify paths forward mechanistic modeling of phytoplankton energy sources photoautotrophic growth of microalgae and cyanobacteria is the most frequently modeled metabolism included in 93 of articles broadly speaking phytoplankton photosynthesize co2 into organic carbon using the energy garnered from light blankenship 2002 given this ability to convert inorganic carbon to organic carbon phytoplankton are considered to be primary producers falkowski and raven 2007 as a result of their dependence on light accurately simulating lighting conditions e g continuous vs diurnal light intensity and the response of phytoplankton to light e g increased decreased growth rate is of utmost importance which is rarely included as a consideration in other wrrf processes in addition to light and inorganic carbon photoautotrophic growth requires nutrients namely nitrogen and phosphorus in the absence of nutrients algae produce storage compounds that can later be metabolized once nutrients are available guest et al 2013 fig 1 discussions on how to model light carbon and nutrients can be found below modeling heterotrophic or mixotrophic growth of microalgae has recently received increased attention due to the higher productivities and lower operational costs associated with these growth regimes compared to photoautotrophic growth abreu et al 2012 adesanya et al 2014 liang et al 2009 while photoautotrophic growth primarily utilizes co2 as the carbon source heterotrophic growth involves organic carbon and mixotrophic growth can utilize both sources adesanya et al 2014 lowrey et al 2015 fig 1 experimental studies have shown that mixotrophic growth rates of some microalgae are the sum of autotrophic and heterotrophic growth rates operated independently adesanya et al 2014 lee 2001 but autotrophic activity can affect heterotrophic activity chojnacka and noworyta 2004 and vice versa nieva and valiente 1996 while mixotrophic growth does increase the number of uncertain parameters requiring calibration this metabolism has the potential to improve algal productivity at wrrfs lowering effluent nutrient concentrations and decreasing costs though interest in these growth conditions has increased only 9 6 of models reviewed considered non photoautotrophic metabolism initial heterotrophic and mixotrophic modeling efforts were developed to describe the production of specific molecules e g astaxanthin zhang et al 2016 phycocyanin zhang et al 1998 and lutein zhang et al 1999b or simulate high density monocultures e g haematococcus sp barbera and mestre 2002 garcía malea et al 2005 moya et al 1997 zhang et al 2016 chlamydomonas reinhardtii zhang et al 1999a chlorella protothecoides zhang et al 1999b or spirulina platensis zhang et al 1998 and often relied on mass balances coupled with a growth model more recent models have focused on specific growth rates yields and productivities as functions of carbon e g glucose acetate turon et al 2015 or glycerol villanova et al 2017 or nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus palabhanvi et al 2014 as well as ph o2 and irradiance i e for mixotrophic conditions bose and chakraborty 2016 when modeling either of these growth regimes the implications on dissolved oxygen do need to be considered e g produced during photoautotrophic growth and consumed during heterotrophic growth general model structures when attempting to simulate growth in silico models must possess adequate accuracy to represent the processes that are occurring while simultaneously minimizing complexity the simplest way to simulate growth is with a logistic model verhulst 1838 table 1 which does not explicitly represent the interactions between an organism and its internal or external environment growth is solely dependent on population however growth of microorganisms has long been observed to be affected by environmental conditions surrounding the cell especially regarding substrate and nutrient concentrations monod 1949 though using the logistic model is not computationally intensive its insensitivity to environmental conditions limits is applicability to wastewater treatment nonetheless 5 6 of papers reviewed used this model the empirically based monod model monod 1949 table 1 which is structurally the same as the mathematically derived michaelis menten model michaelis and menten 1913 approximates kinetics as a hyperbolic relationship between growth and an external factor e g organic carbon nutrients oxygen irradiance this relationship is defined by the maximum specific growth rate and half saturation constant i e the concentration at which the growth rate is half the maximum rate fig 2 the monod model is widely used in the wastewater industry because it can be calibrated easily due to having two parameters closely approximates reality for many chemotrophic prokaryotes and is accurate across a wide range of conditions for bacteria and archaea when substrate concentrations are below inhibitory levels as a result monod has been adapted for use in the asm models henze et al 2000 adm1 batstone et al 2002 and number of custom models embedded in simulation platforms e g gps xtm hydromantis 2017 biowin envirosim 2017 and sumo dynamita 2017 of the phytoplankton models reviewed 48 used a monod equation a layer of complexity was added to the substrate growth relationship when microalgae were observed to exhibit a notable lag between nutrient uptake and growth ketchum 1939 suggesting these two processes may be partially decoupled droop 2009 1968 further microalgae were found to take up and store nutrients notably nitrogen and phosphorus in excess of what was needed for growth ketchum 1939 in configurations or process designs in which algae are exposed to fluctuating nutrient concentrations the droop model formulation droop 1968 table 1 is better positioned to simulate the lag that occurs between uptake and growth due to luxury nutrient uptake and internal nutrient stores stevenson et al 1996 fig 2 this model which is based on phenomena observed in both batch and continuous cultures droop 1975 1974 utilizes maximum specific growth rate at high concentrations of internal stores similar to but different from monod but also includes a subsistence quota parameter i e the minimum internal concentration of a nutrient or substrate needed for growth to occur correlating the growth rate to internal substrate nutrient content the amount of which is determined by uptake and consumption allows this model to decouple nutrient uptake and growth cunningham and maas 1978 droop 2009 1968 flynn 2008 stevenson et al 1996 sunda et al 2009 though this formulation is more appropriate for modeling phytoplankton growth only 19 of the articles reviewed used a droop equation excessively high nutrient e g ammonia or substrate e g acetate concentrations have at times been shown to decrease growth rates due to inhibition e g through ammonia toxicity or increased maintenance energy requirements chen and johns 1996 high oxygen concentrations can also inhibit photosynthesis blankenship 2002 component concentrations that could be inhibitory may be modeled via the empirical haldane model for enzymatic reactions haldane 1930 table 1 also referred to as the andrews equation given that it was first used for growth of microorganisms based on observations by andrews 1968 and confirmed for phytoplankton in laboratory experiments by aiba 1982 which is formulated similarly to the monod model but includes an inhibition parameter 12 of models reviewed fig 2 when light reaches the cell phytoplankton can grow photoautotrophically as defined by the relationship between photosynthesis and irradiance pi the simplest way to achieve this is with a monod expression 18 of articles e g béchet et al 2015 concas et al 2012 slightly more intricate models have been developed and implemented for engineered systems including the poisson single hit model 5 0 sakshaug et al 1989 skjelbred et al 2012 the smith model 1 6 broekhuizen et al 2012 kenny and flynn 2016 smith 1936 and the jassby platt model 3 7 breuer et al 2015 jassby and platt 1976 van wagenen et al 2014 table 2 while more complex than monod these models do not account for the potential inhibitory effects of prolonged light exposure the steele model 10 drewry et al 2015 gonçalves et al 2016 steele 1962 wágner et al 2016 and the eilers and peeters model 11 guest et al 2013 ketheesan and nirmalakhandan 2013 peeters and eilers 1978 similar in structure to andrews 1968 are able to account for photoinhibition a further discussion of photoinhibition is included below when formulating a growth equation these models can be multiplied e g droop for phosphorus multiplied by andrews for nitrogen multiplication was first postulated by baule 1917 and used in 44 of papers or combined through a threshold formulation where growth rates are only impacted by the most limited nutrient or substrate von liebig 1841 used in 11 of papers however the multiplicative approach is only applicable when model components e g light nutrients carbon etc are independent indicating that multiplying model components is overused thus the threshold formulation should be used to account for scenarios where growth is dependent on multiple components e g limitation by n and p more complex relationships must be accounted for when the two compounds interact nonlinearly in the cell for example a phosphorus limitation reduces the nitrogen uptake efficiency bougaran et al 2010 nutrient uptake storage and mobilization in scenarios where phytoplankton are used for secondary or tertiary treatment of municipal wastewaters i e when treating waters with dilute nutrient concentrations phytoplankton growth can be dependent on either external or internal nutrients in terms of macronutrients phytoplankton are unique in their ability to metabolize multiple forms of nutrients e g no3 nh4 no2 and don for nitrogen dortch 1990 flynn et al 1997 liu et al 2012 po4 3 and dop for phosphorus brown and shilton 2014 liu et al 2012 the respective rates of n and p uptake are not independent rather algae can modify their n p ratio via growth rate typically between 2 3 1 to 23 1 on a mass basis in response to fluctuating nutrient concentrations which commonly occur at wrrfs gardner dale et al 2017 geider and la roche 2002 the form of nitrogen that is being taken up affects growth rate as well as ph specifically nitrate or nitrite must be reduced to be metabolized which results in slower growth due to expending reducing equivalents toward nitrogen fuggi et al 1981 sanz luque et al 2013 ammonia does not require reduction but its uptake lowers ph fuggi et al 1981 therefore the ph implications of the form of nitrogen being taken up should be considered when creating a model in addition to macronutrients micronutrients e g zinc manganese etc are necessary for growth kropat et al 2011 and can limit productivity if lacking carvalho et al 2006 singh et al 2016 micronutrients have been shown to be present in wastewaters westerhoff et al 2015 and in many cases can be sufficient to support growth daneshvar et al 2018 the simplest way to predict nutrient uptake rate is by making substrate a linear function of biomass growth rate with a yield coefficient e g yh henze et al 2000 16 of papers reviewed when modeling nutrient dynamics of phytoplankton however the decoupling between uptake and growth necessitates the two processes to be modeled separately droop 2009 ketchum 1939 in the case of microalgae it is not uncommon to expect nutrient uptake to tend to increase with nutrient concentration following michaelis menten kinetics michaelis and menten 1913 which is structurally similar to the monod model and be down regulated by the corresponding internal nutrient quota bougaran et al 2010 droop 1968 used in 39 of papers reviewed in non inhibitory nutrient replete conditions some phytoplankton will take up nutrients in excess of that required for growth this luxury uptake of nutrients will continue until the maximum internal quota is reached brown and shilton 2014 carey et al 2012 elrifi and turpin 1985 if nutrient concentrations become inhibitory e g free ammonia above 35 mg n l 1 abeliovich and azov 1976 haldane kinetics should be used in nutrient deplete conditions however growth does not simply cease though biomass growth rates decrease algae will continue to metabolize organic or inorganic carbon and will instead produce carbon storage compounds e g carbohydrates lipids or a combination of the two so that growth can resume when nutrients become available in the future see below ball et al 1990 guest et al 2013 guschina and harwood 2006 while michaelis menten kinetics are necessary to model nutrient uptake the model requires two calibrated parameters rather than one when utilizing a yield coefficient this equation can be simplified if nutrient concentration is several orders of magnitude greater than the half saturation coefficient e g when growing cultures on wrrf sidestreams such as anaerobic digester centrate in this case the uptake rate for that nutrient will be so close to the maximum specific uptake rate that the half saturation coefficient can be considered negligible simplifying the model following uptake nitrogen and phosphorus are metabolized to form intermediate biomass compounds when carbon is available blankenship 2002 when luxury uptake occurs algae have been shown to store phosphorus as polyphosphate brown and shilton 2014 additionally nitrogen may be stored either as intracellular pools coppens et al 2014 thoresen et al 1982 or as amino acids though not as readily as phosphorus elrifi and turpin 1985 these nutrient stores will then be utilized during nutrient deplete conditions if carbon is available as a result careful consideration must be taken when deciding how to incorporate the effect of nutrients on algal metabolism carbon uptake storage and mobilization in addition to nutrients the uptake of organic and or inorganic carbon should also be considered carefully included in 26 of articles carbon uptake is commonly modeled using michaelis menten or haldane kinetics depending on whether or not the compound can be inhibitory at higher concentrations baroukh et al 2017 and on the amount of existing internal carbon stores concas et al 2016 guest et al 2013 apart from uptake carbon utilization is dependent on several interrelated factors that must be considered concurrently for example under low light or dark conditions algae cannot photosynthesize enough to meet maintenance requirements so they will consume either external organic carbon i e mixotrophic or heterotrophic metabolism or stored carbohydrates lipids baroukh et al 2017 guest et al 2013 as a result carbon usage should be modeled with switching functions introduced in asm1 henze et al 1987 to account for these factors in many algal species e g chlorella sorokiniana chlamydomonas reinhardtii and scenedesmus obliquus guschina and harwood 2006 harwood and guschina 2009 subramanian et al 2013 vitova et al 2015 carbon storage compounds e g carbohydrates and lipids accumulate in the cell in response to nutrient deplete conditions fig 3 broadly these two compounds have been modeled in numerous ways most consistently as a function of biomass concentration using a yield coefficient 4 6 of articles e g dillschneider and posten 2013 mohammad mirzaie et al 2016 more complex models for these compounds involve switching functions dependent on nutrient availability as well as the relative concentrations of each storage compound these models do not have a consistent structure 7 1 of articles baroukh et al 2014 guest et al 2013 mairet et al 2011 given the relatively limited knowledge of storage compound dynamics in the timescale of dynamic wastewater processes there is no clear model that is optimal but in general carbohydrates and lipids should both be modeled separately 2 8 model carbohydrates only 8 7 model lipids only 3 7 model both together as a generic storage compound 1 2 model both separately additionally carbohydrates typically are produced and consumed faster than lipids but also reach the maximum internal concentration sooner davis et al 2016 laurens et al 2014 lipids conversely are produced at a slower rate but accumulate to a greater extent in many species of algae davis et al 2016 laurens et al 2014 as an added layer of complexity biomass composition can change both over diel cycles and also in response to design decisions e g srt gardner dale et al 2017 necessitating more mechanistic modeling of these metabolic processes oxygen consumption should also be accounted for using monod kinetics when modeling stored carbon usage in addition to this stored carbohydrates have been shown to be interconverted to lipids further increasing the potential intricacy of this sub process pick and avidan 2017 given the complexity of modeling carbohydrate and lipid accumulation carbon storage should only be considered if nutrient deplete conditions are expected to exist or if the cells are exposed to fluctuating lighting conditions e g diel natural lighting in the scenario being modeled light irradiance and dissipation light is an energy source during photoautotrophic and mixotrophic algal growth for photosynthesis accurately predicting light distribution is essential for modeling algal growth and metabolism photosynthetically active radiation par the spectral range of radiation that photosynthetic cells can use occurs between wavelengths of 400 750 nm wilhelm and jakob 2011 three types of irradiance models were identified in béchet et al 2013 type i models which use incident or average irradiance to predict the rate of photosynthesis for the entire culture type ii models which estimate overall reactor productivity as the sum of depth resolved productivities within the system and type iii models which account for both light gradients and short light cycles for individual cells type i models are simplest but type ii models tend to exhibit greater accuracy for a small increase in complexity type iii models are likely to be too complex for wrrfs given the need for individual based a k a microscopic models gujer 2002 as light penetrates a phytoplankton cultivation system it can be attenuated through absorption or scattering by cells or by the reactor itself posten 2009 wágner et al 2018 wang et al 2014 fig 4 light extinction can be exacerbated by high concentrations of highly diffusive particulate matter borowitzka 1998 the beer lambert law table 3 is widely used in phytoplankton modeling 35 of articles and accounts for light extinction due to absorption by pigments and scattering by the cells as well as absorption and diffusion due to non cellular components martínez et al 2018 often the extinction coefficient is taken as the absorption rate koller et al 2017 for dilute cultures the attenuation coefficient has been proposed to be expressed as a nonlinear function of absorption and scattering coefficients kirk 1984 morel 1988 modifications to this equation may be required to simulate the effects of multiple scattering when applicable e g tam and zardecki 1982 or to account for the disparity in coefficient values between natural and engineered systems photoinhibition and photoacclimation when modeling the effects of irradiance in engineered systems temporal changes in light intensity need to be considered especially in naturally lit scenarios which will follow a diel cycle some algae have developed the ability to adapt in response to changing lighting conditions carvalho et al 2011 photoinhibition i e the reduction in growth due to exposure to excess light can begin affecting growth within 1 min if irradiance is high enough béchet et al 2013 fig 5 under high light intensities photoacclimation processes are used to mitigate photoinhibition whereby the chlorophyll production is suppressed and carotenoids i e photo protective pigments are synthesized aburai et al 2015 anning et al 2000 garcía camacho et al 2012 guihéneuf and stengel 2015 koller et al 2017 macintyre et al 2002 safafar et al 2015 vaquero et al 2014 xie et al 2016 this photoacclimation strategy takes place at a time scale of days or weeks combe et al 2015 and contributes to chlorophyll carbon mass ratio variations typically within a factor of five falkowski 1983 anning et al 2000 studied the pi response curves of microalgae cultures pre acclimated at different light irradiances and showed 65 higher growth rates and higher chlorophyll content for the cells pre acclimated in the dark bouterfas et al 2002 compared multiple pi models and found that the eilers and peeters model is the most accurate when simulating growth in response to high irradiance this phenomenon is of utmost importance for wastewater treatment given that particulate and dissolved materials increase medium turbidity reducing the light penetration and maintaining a low average light in the water on top of this pigment synthesis can be strongly impacted by nitrogen limitation as the pigment content is related to the protein content which is itself related to the nitrogen status represented by the quota q in the droop model griffiths et al 2014 nitrogen limitation has also been shown to strongly reduce chlorophyll content breuer et al 2015 geider et al 1993 geider et al 1998 were among the first to introduce chlorophyll as a state variable in their models in addition to the carbon and nitrogen contents they expressed the rate of pigment synthesis per carbon unit as proportional to the product between the rates of photosynthesis and nitrogen uptake more recently bernard et al 2015 proposed a model whereby chlorophyll is proportional to the cellular nitrogen content beyond nitrogen temperature also has a strong effect on photoacclimation geider 1987 which has been represented by a model relating the chlorophyll quota to the current light irradiance and temperature more complex models exist flynn 2001 garcía camacho et al 2012 nikolaou et al 2016 but the computational intensity of these models relative to the increase in fidelity precludes their use in the context of modeling wrrfs accounting for photoacclimation in model development is crucial to represent successive phases with low turbidity where cells are subjected to high light and growth periods in a highly turbid medium for which average light is low only 6 8 of models reviewed included this process for studies focusing on growth in a permanently turbid medium cells will be mostly dark acclimated and photoacclimation can be neglected however growth model calibration must be carried out in low light conditions or equivalently in a very turbid medium in order to ensure sufficient accuracy temperature the influence of temperature on process dynamics can be tantamount to that of light ras et al 2013 34 of articles included temperature wastewater treatment processes cultivating phytoplankton typically have reduced depths i e less than 0 5 m and therefore lower thermal inertia than deeper in ground reactors when subjected to the solar irradiance temperatures within the reactor can vary from 5 c to as high as 56 c de luca et al 2017 dermoun et al 1992 talbot et al 1991 tredici and materassi 1992 microalgae and cyanobacteria can be particularly sensitive to environmental temperatures in engineered systems due to its effect on enzymatic activity and stability béchet et al 2011 bernard and rémond 2012 the impact of temperature on metabolism can be represented in mechanistic models accurately predicting the temperature dynamics over the course of the day béchet et al 2011 2010 but its effect has commonly been neglected or minimized in biological models often by using an arrhenius formulation arrhenius 1889 40 of models considering temperature fig 6 and table 4 the response of growth rate to temperature has been proposed to follow an asymmetric curve for most microorganisms rosso et al 1993 3 6 of articles that included temperature fig 6 and table 4 this response is defined by three cardinal temperatures t min the minimum temperature that will support growth t max the maximum temperature that will support growth and t opt the optimum temperature for growth the asymmetry of the growth curve results from differential effects on cellular physiology at temperatures lower or higher than t opt at low temperatures the rates of enzymatic biochemical reactions are affected blankenship 2002 at high temperatures structure and stability of some cellular components such as key enzymes or membrane compounds mainly lipids or proteins are denatured ras et al 2013 salvucci and crafts brandner 2004 the consequences on cell metabolism and integrity lead to an increase in mortality serra maia et al 2016 growth rates at temperatures greater than t max or less than t min are considered to be zero the deleterious effects of high temperature exposure are also temporally dependent and the concept of thermal dose has been used to quantify the damages at high temperature béchet et al 2017 holcomb et al 1999 given the potential impacts that temperature can have on biomass a temperature model should be carefully chosen and calibrated a more detailed review of temperature models can be found in grimaud et al 2017 respiration and maintenance while the main focus of this critical review is on phytoplankton growth and related processes carbon loss through endogenous respiration and maintenance should not be neglected when constructing a model included in 57 of models reviewed these processes are often considered to occur at a constant rate e g decostere et al 2013 47 of the models that included respiration this assumption is valid for maintenance energy requirements but endogenous respiration is impacted by multiple factors e g light temperature ph etc béchet et al 2017 ippoliti et al 2016 maintenance energy is dependent on the atp requirements of the organism and as such does not change beeftink et al 1990 the atp demand can be met through multiple routes depending on the situation being modeled i e if carbon storage products are being formed or not for instance cells can meet maintenance requirements first through storage products and only rely on endogenous respiration in the absence of these internal stores beeftink et al 1990 in addition to reducing biomass concentrations respiration can also lead to do consumption which can have an impact on any aerobic chemotrophic organisms in the system as such incorporation of maintenance and endogenous respiration as one mechanism to meet maintenance atp demands guest et

metabolic models of phototrophic technologies at wrrfs several models build upon the concept of metabolic reconstructions while taking a simpler approach that may be considered more accessible and valuable for developing processing parameters at wrrfs through metabolic modeling in wrrf modeling of chemotrophic processes e g enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr the concept of lumped pathway metabolic modeling has been applied e g smolders et al 1994 which groups reactions based on whether intermediate compounds accumulate these grouped or lumped reactions are assumed to occur simultaneously and are modeled as a function of one parameter roels 1983 as such lumped pathway metabolic modeling has the potential to simplify metabolic reconstructions given that they have on the order of 10 reaction equations as opposed to 100 equations present in some reconstructions filipe and daigger 1999 guest et al 2013 fig 7 wrrf modeling platforms typically use empirical yield coefficients for the asms to help describe sludge accumulation within the system figueroa torres et al 2017 henze et al 2007 fig 7 with the general recommendation to conduct experiments to develop yield coefficients for a specific wrrf henze et al 2007 rieger et al 2012 any variation in yield coefficients between wrrfs is generally believed to be caused solely by environmental influences such as ph temperature and fluctuating substrate concentrations henze et al 2007 however yield coefficients have a foundation in the metabolic pathways an organism is using e g glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway etc indicating that values for these coefficients can be theoretically grounded if metabolic pathways are conserved derived theoretical values can then be used regardless of situation being modeled variability in terms of growth rate will still exist due to environmental conditions but this variation can be accounted for in associated subprocesses e g maintenance rather than by yield coefficients lumped pathway metabolic models allow stoichiometric parameters to be based on phytoplankton metabolism while simultaneously reducing complexity relative to metabolic models and increasing reproducibility relative to empirical models using lumped pathways also grounds many parameters e g p o ratio in fundamental well established ranges while decreasing the number of unknown stoichiometric parameters in the model thus increasing the model s innate mechanistic friction lowering the degrees of freedom and simplifying the final model structure baroukh et al 2014 guest et al 2013 van aalst van leeuwen et al 1997 while there are many benefits to using full metabolic models the additional complexity often precludes their inclusion in algal models inclusion of other organisms in the context of wastewater treatment maintaining a community of one type of organism is challenging if not entirely unrealistic in the context of algae and cyanobacteria chemotrophic bacteria e g heterotrophic bacteria nitrifiers and predatory organisms e g zooplankton can be present which impact the dynamics of the entire system being modeled mehrabadi et al 2016 wolf et al 2007 other organisms were included in 21 of models the relationship between heterotrophic bacteria and photoautotrophic phytoplankton has long been known to be symbiotic where bacteria and phytoplankton exchange products chemotrophic bacteria produce co2 and consume do while phytoplankton take up co2 and produce do rich 1963 this interaction can be particularly beneficial for photoautotrophic phytoplankton because high do concentrations can inhibit photosynthesis kaplan and reinhold 1999 however higher biomass concentrations stemming from chemotrophic organism growth can also limit photosynthesis by reducing light to suboptimal levels additionally phytoplankton and chemotrophs including autotrophs will be competing for substrates n p inorganic carbon etc if the phytoplankton are utilizing mixotrophy or heterotrophy they will be competing with the chemotrophic bacteria for organic resources which can impact system performance grover 2000 thingstad et al 1998 predators and grazers commonly have much more detrimental impacts on algal performance which is primarily a result of algal biomass being directly reduced baird et al 2003 depending on the conditions predators can result in frequent turnover of algal communities preventing the system from treating the water as anticipated sutherland et al 2017 whether including bacteria predators or both considering other organisms can quickly increase the complexity of a model due to the need to account for all the parameters the organism can affect e g oxygen co2 organic carbon ph light penetration etc solimeno et al 2017 zambrano et al 2016 however if phytoplankton are in a closed system e g a closed photobioreactor invasive organisms can be assumed to be negligible if not present in the influent physico chemical processes gas liquid mass transfer gas liquid mass transfer was included in 17 of reviewed articles the most important dissolved gases in phytoplankton processes are oxygen o2 carbon dioxide co2 and ammonia nh3 depending on their concentration they can either promote or inhibit growth generally speaking algae require 1 8 2 4 g co2 for each gram of biomass grown which results in a n demand of 0 02 0 25 g per gram of algae given that the c n ratio can vary from roughly 2 6 32 g c g n 1 geider and la roche 2002 leow et al 2015 li et al 2017 microalgae also produce approximately 1 5 1 92 g o2 g biomass 1 grobbelaar et al 1988 muñoz and guieysse 2006 moreover co2 and nh3 can significantly impact ph see below co2 and nh3 are also involved in bacterial processes and consequently play an important role in algal bacterial interactions necessitating their accurate simulation in wrrf process models solimeno et al 2017 2015 in the case of gas liquid system with a relatively dilute liquid phase henry s law is generally used to describe the equilibrium relationship eq 1 in table 5 due to the continuous production and or consumption of gaseous components by biological processes however gas liquid mass transfers occur continuously the driving force of gas liquid mass transfer is therefore the difference between the saturation concentration and the real concentration in the liquid phase eq 2 in table 5 the local mass transfer coefficient represents the resistance of the interface to transfer for gases with low solubility e g o2 and co2 dissolution into the liquid phase is more challenging while more soluble gases e g nh3 are more difficult to remove from solution the mass transfer rate depends on gas and liquid physico chemical properties temperature and turbulence of the medium several models exist to describe this mass transfer rate including higbie s penetration theory higbie 1935 or the double layer model lewis and whitman 1924 however both the local mass transfer coefficient and the interfacial area require calibration and determining these parameters is challenging therefore the combination of both parameters i e the local mass transfer coefficient and the interfacial area is often considered this combined coefficient is typically referred to as kl ga the prevalence of aeration in the activated sludge process has resulted in extensive in situ determination of the oxygen specific kla value i e klao2 amaral et al 2017 kayser 1979 as well as models to describe it gillot et al 2005 overall mass transfer coefficients for other gases with low solubility e g co2 are usually calculated from the oxygen transfer rate using higbie s penetration theory eq 3 in table 5 in order to determine the effect that these gaseous compounds can have gas liquid mass transfer should be considered when constructing a wrrf model ph acid base equilibrium acid base equilibrium considers the change in concentration of one or several compounds of interest e g co2 aq hco3 and co3 2 in aqueous phase and the subsequent effect it has on ph and therefore microalgal processes brönsted 1923 lowry 1923 13 of models similar to compounds involved in liquid gas transfer these compounds are continuously produced or consumed by biological processes contrary to liquid gas transfer however acid base equilibrium occurs rapidly compared to biological processes as a result equilibrium is often assumed to be established instantaneously i e on the order of 104 and 105 d 1 jupsin et al 2003 reichert et al 2001 solimeno et al 2015 the direct impact of ph on algal growth included in 16 of models is rather limited when ph is between 5 8 5 depending on the algal species and other operational parameters such as temperature benemann et al 1987 berge et al 2012 mayo 1997 algal growth can affect ph by consuming co2 during photosynthesis resulting in a net increase in ph as protons are consumed to maintain chemical equilibrium berenguel et al 2004 in addition to the bicarbonate system the nitrogen species present in solution have an impact on ph if ammonium is applied as the nitrogen source ph drops due to the release of protons during assimilation conversely ph can rise when nitrate is used due to the consumption of protons needed to assimilate nitrate nguyen and rittmann 2015 most phytoplankton models for municipal wastewater treatment exclude ph dependence for algal growth broekhuizen et al 2012 james et al 2013 mayo 1997 but ph indirectly affects algal growth by changing the relative concentrations of substrates such as co2 decostere et al 2016 wolf et al 2007 additionally high ph i e above 9 may induce inhibition of algal growth by free ammonia abeliovich and azov 1976 konig et al 1987 some models simulate ph as a function of the bicarbonate system decostere et al 2016 fernández et al 2010 liehr et al 1988 but the simplicity of these models results in inaccuracy when other ph altering components are present the river water quality model 1 rwqm1 reichert et al 2001 introduced a set of differential equations to model the acid base equilibria for inorganic carbon ammonia and phosphate as well as the water acid base equilibrium this approach was later modified to a system of differential for biological process rates and algebraic for fast chemical reactions equations dae where ph is numerically estimated by closing the charge balance i e mono dimensional numerical methods in the system broekhuizen et al 2012 gehring et al 2010 wolf et al 2007 the application of dae systems to predict ph is commonly used to model other wastewater systems as it reduces the stiffness of the model compared to differential equation systems batstone et al 2012 2002 hellinga et al 1999 this approach has been improved by vangsgaard et al 2013 by formulating a set of equations describing the mass balances and equilibrium equations of weak acids and bases and a charge balance which are solved using a multidimensional newton raphson method during the last few years the acid base system has been better described by including the effect of ionic strength ion pairing and developing improved numeric solvers to ensure robustness in the calculations flores alsina et al 2015 lizarralde et al 2015 solon et al 2015 other common ways to estimate ph changes in water systems are by closing proton or alkalinity balances luff et al 2001 serralta et al 2004 calibration validation and uncertainty sensitivity analyses whether constructing a new model or tailoring an existing one to a specific scenario a model should always be calibrated and validated to the degree possible prior to use 69 of models were calibrated but only 36 were validated calibration involves adjusting parameter values to fit the model to collected and reconciled data i e data that have been cleaned and ensured are accurate hauduc et al 2010 validation ensures that the model also matches data from a different set of conditions distinct from the calibration dataset by comparing the calibrated model to another set of data rieger et al 2012 this step in building a model is important because it ensures that model outputs are both reliable and reproducible in the context of wastewater treatment a model that can accurately predict performance can mean the difference between meeting discharge requirements or not calibration of wrrf models is often performed manually which frequently results in unreliable output values sin et al 2005 though calibration protocols have been proposed e g biomath vanrolleghem et al 2003 stowa hulsbeek et al 2002 and the iwa unified protocol rieger et al 2012 there is no consensus on calibration methodology making the comparison and evaluation of calibration across models incredibly challenging while calibrating all parameters is extremely difficult and prone to errors particularly for complex models with many parameters e g rwqm1 and adm1 with 24 and 45 parameters respectively most of the variability in a model is often due to a subset of parameters this subset can be determined through a sensitivity analysis sin et al 2005 ensuring that these parameters are calibrated carefully is essential other parameters do not need to be calibrated as carefully or standard values can be sourced from previously published articles model prediction quality can be evaluated in relation to quality of fit e g through the use of akaike or bayesian information criterion grimaud et al 2017 or by examining the percentage of experimental data falling within the confidence interval of the model output ramin et al 2017 wágner et al 2018 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses can be used in tandem to determine how parameter variations affect output variability as well as which parameters affect model outputs the most broadly uncertainty analyses in wrrf modeling pass randomly chosen input values through the model and record the outputs to determine either the range of potential outputs or estimate the likelihood of meeting a target value e g discharge requirements loucks et al 2005 uncertainty analyses can be conducted with monte carlo simulation wherein probability density functions are assigned to inputs and are randomly sampled tens of thousands of times saltelli et al 2006 sin et al 2009 to reduce the computational burden of characterizing uncertainty around wrrf process model results latin hypercube sampling lhs can be used to reduce the required number of simulations in a monte carlo analysis by discretizing probability density functions into equal probability portions helton and davis 2003 mckay et al 1979 shoener et al 2016 following the uncertainty analysis model inputs and outputs can be compared to determine parameter sensitivity similar to calibration procedures there is no universal sensitivity analysis procedure though sensitivity analyses can be broadly categorized as local or global morris one factor at a time morris 1991 and markov chain monte carlo sharifi et al 2014 are examples of global sensitivity analyses whereas differential analysis brun et al 2002 is local sensitivity metrics can be used to concisely compare sensitivities of model outputs to individual inputs e g spearman s rank correlation coefficient iman and conover 1982 marino et al 2008 wang et al 2015 when evaluating a model the analysis chosen should depend on the core objective e g reducing model structural uncertainty or input uncertainty which should be explicitly stated when describing the model only 30 of models utilized sensitivity analyses 26 of which did not describe the procedure used rigorously performing uncertainty and sensitivity analyses will not only simplify model calibration and validation but will also help to inform future experimentation by identifying critical information needs for model application and development for instance if a particular model output is very sensitive to a highly uncertain parameter extensive experimentation could be conducted to ensure the parameter is accurately calibrated and the model can be validated integration with existing wrrf models standard wastewater modeling nomenclature as we seek to develop phytoplankton based processes for wastewater treatment the likelihood of broad adoption of developed models will be directly influenced by their alignment with existing wrrf modeling structure and nomenclature to the degree possible any phytoplankton models developed should be able to be integrated with the iwa s activated sludge models e g asm2d and adm3 and anaerobic digestion model 1 adm1 there may be circumstances or applications of phytoplankton modeling that necessitate or warrant alternative model structures but it should be recognized that any deviations will reduce transparency and the likelihood of adoption by industry the original iwa asm1 publication popularized a standard approach to naming the state variables upon which pseudo mechanistic model structures are built henze et al 1987 each state variable defines one fundamental component around which a dynamic mass balance is determined the asm1 state variable structure allows for grouping of different sets of variables by their fundamental composition e g chemical oxygen demand nitrogen phosphorus and by the processes which act upon them e g biomass state variables undergo growth and decay through rate equations in addition to establishing a straightforward nomenclature discussed below the asm1 also used a petersen matrix petersen 1965 which concisely displays an entire model both kinetics and stoichiometry and helps ensure the maintenance of mass balances the original asm1 henze et al 1987 sets out a nomenclature that specifies attributes of the state variables and allows straightforward grouping of the state variables based on inherent characteristics and the processes acting on them 46 of articles focusing solely on wastewater 5 0 of all articles a capital letter specifies the component category s for soluble and x for slowly biodegradable or particulate and subscripts are then used to uniquely identify the component subscripts may specify if a component is readily biodegradable e g ss or inert e g xi or can identify the short form chemical composition e g sno for soluble nitrate and nitrite biomass components typically use the nomenclature xb followed by a second subscript to distinguish between biomass types e g xb h for heterotrophs xb a for autotrophs the subsequent iwa models asm2 henze et al 1995 asm2d henze et al 1999 asm3 gujer et al 1999 and adm1 batstone et al 2002 maintained this nomenclature structure adhering to the s and x prefixes for soluble and particulate components the asm2 model report also explicitly states that the x components must be electrically neutral no ionic charges whereas the soluble components may carry charges further model development by academic researchers and commercial simulation companies has generally followed the established iwa nomenclature but diversity in model complexity and approach to naming state variables has led to some confusion and inconsistency across the wastewater modeling industry corominas et al 2010 summarized many of the issues faced with conflicting variable names including consistency of variable names and meanings e g b has been used to stand for biomass or biodegradable usage of upper or lower cases and different units associated with the same variable e g biomass has been represented by g cod m 3 g c m 3 or mol c m 3 additionally state variable definitions should incorporate the processes which act upon them this aspect is often disregarded when identifying variables corominas et al 2010 proposed a structured methodology for setting names for state variables and model parameters using a series of subscripts to represent biodegradability organic inorganic nature organism name if relevant and any other distinguishing characteristics this standardized nomenclature has not been broadly adopted however to the degree possible developers of new models should also use existing asm and adm variables e g xli for stored lipids xch for stored carbohydrates guest et al 2013 and only focus on adapting variables that are not already represented e g xalg for algae biomass ultimately nomenclature congruent with iwa naming conventions must be adhered to if phytoplankton pseudo mechanistic models are to be usable by the wastewater industry integration approaches in order to develop plant wide models that include phytoplankton based processes alongside activated sludge or anaerobic digestion processes existing integration techniques for asms and adm1 can be leveraged at present there are three main approaches to plant wide dynamic wrrf modeling i the interfaces approach nopens et al 2009 vanrolleghem et al 2005 volcke et al 2006 zaher et al 2007 ii the standard supermodel approach jones et al 2007 seco et al 2004 and iii the tailored supermodel approach grau et al 2007 a summary of these approaches can be found in grau et al 2009 a number of software packages are commercially available for whole plant simulations e g gps x biowin west and sumo taking advantage of both the interface and supermodel e g gps x biowin approaches for whole plant modeling although the interface approach can use state variable transformers to add new unit processes to models developing these transformers is typically difficult grau et al 2009 the supermodel approach requires the development of new state variables and processes but allows for greater flexibility in terms of model development and is therefore more frequently used in practice e g used in gps xtm biowin and sumo additionally when integrating models a continuity check should be performed to avoid inconsistencies in mass balances see rieger et al 2012 for details path forward model development algae modeling needs in wastewater treatment accurately modeling full scale phytoplankton treatment systems accounting for reactor design influent composition algal bacterial interactions and environmental conditions is essential models should be able to accommodate different reactor types e g hraps raceway ponds pbrs etc shoener et al 2014 as well as influents e g raw sewage primary or secondary effluent etc in order for a model to be useful an objective should be established prior to model construction e g prediction control monitoring etc which will help practitioners navigate tradeoffs between complexity and accuracy bernard et al 2015 a model should also be as simple as possible while maintaining the ability to assist with decision making daigger 2011 key factors in model development the number of disparate models uncovered during this review and the absence of critical model components e g calibration and validation methodology in many papers underscore the need for more rigorous phytoplankton model formulation procedures before constructing a model researchers must first consider environmental and reactor conditions to determine which processes to include and which equations can best simulate that process table 6 this consideration is of particular importance given that several influential components are frequently omitted from published models e g carbon phosphorus and temperature were only included in 27 26 and 24 of reviewed articles respectively when considering growth monod kinetics are adequate in circumstances with stable nutrient conditions e g chemostats with fixed environmental conditions and substrate concentrations below inhibitory values in configurations or process designs in which algae are exposed to fluctuating nutrient concentrations droop model formulation should be used to decouple nutrient uptake and growth additionally high ammonia or substrate e g acetate concentrations that could be inhibitory may be modeled via haldane andrews andrews 1968 haldane 1930 similarly inhibition from high irradiance can be modeled via the eilers and peeters or steele expressions eilers and peeters 1988 steele 1962 given that the choice of a pi sub model will only have an impact at high light intensities where photoinhibition and photoacclimation may occur eilers and peeters 1988 if only non photoinhibitory situations are being considered the simplest model that can still accurately simulate the process may be chosen for substrate uptake and utilization given the dynamicity of wrrfs organisms must be modeled with their history in mind for example if the organism was previously in n replete conditions but then experiences n deplete conditions it will continue growing off internal reserves before forming storage compounds additionally the impacts of changing environmental conditions on phytoplankton processes should be assessed e g temperature changes across seasons excluding environmental history or dynamic conditions will limit the accuracy of a model in addition to selecting model components carefully the model foundation should be built upon a mechanistic understanding of phenomena this will not only improve the generalizability and accuracy of the model but may also reduce the number of calibrated parameters provide a theoretically grounded range for biochemical model parameters and increase model transparency by reducing the number of empirical parameters this comprehensive understanding will also enable the integration of separate but related models e g hydrodynamics which will be critical to translate laboratory scale data into predictions of full scale performance also when gathering experimental data it should be noted that diel cycles will often necessitate frequent sampling multiple times per day to enable model validation high resolution models require multiple measurements each day or even each hour in order to capture diel variability this is crucial during model calibration and validation more broadly the lack of clearly defined calibration and validation procedures is a serious shortcoming in many of the papers reviewed 17 of papers that calibrated their models did not specify a procedure calibration and validation need to be conducted to assess the accuracy and precision of a model appropriately and ensure the fidelity of a model is upheld if a model cannot be calibrated and validated reliably it cannot be utilized for a full scale reactor let alone as a component of a wrrf model broader context wrrf practitioners are tasked with protecting the health of the public and the aquatic environment and an inaccurate model could have serious deleterious effects on wrrf investment design and performance when proposing a model the phytoplankton process should be considered as part of an entire wrrf not just an independent unit promising model structures should be able to handle the frequent changes that occur at wrrfs in order to ensure models are accessible to the broadest possible audience and can be compared easily iwa nomenclature should be used more frequently to increase wrrf model inter compatibility the asms proposed the use of a stoichiometric matrix to quickly and efficiently display the model structure however only 6 2 of papers reviewed used a stoichiometric matrix this approach should be used to make models simpler to interpret and to implement in simulation software thus widening the user base of phytoplankton models and accelerating their broader adoption at full scale wrrfs microalgal resource recovery systems have tremendous potential to improve wrrf function achieving effluent nutrient concentrations below the current limit of technology in order to realize this potential however wrrf practitioners must first believe that the tools available to them are accurate and reliable this trust can only be attained if algae process models adhere to the same level of rigor and transparency as current iwa models conclusion algal and cyanobacterial technologies have the potential to achieve effluent nutrient concentrations below existing biological nutrient removal systems but there is no established modeling framework for engineered phytoplankton treatment systems in the context of wastewater treatment a droop formulation for nutrient uptake and an eilers and peeters formulation for irradiance response can accurately simulate external and internal conditions the effects of temperature fluctuations on phytoplankton growth rates should be assessed with either an arrhenius or ctmi formulation lumped pathway metabolic models rooted in a mechanistic understanding of biochemical processes can simplify model structure and reduce parameter uncertainty calibration and validation should be rigorous and clearly defined acknowledgements this work

20015,microalgal and cyanobacterial resource recovery systems could significantly advance nutrient recovery from wastewater by achieving effluent nitrogen n and phosphorus p levels below the current

the ability to reliably and accurately simulate full scale performance in response to reactor and process design influent composition and environmental conditions this ability is hindered by a lack of model fidelity and transparency regarding model structure and underlying science some microalgae and cyanobacteria have the ability to utilize phototrophic heterotrophic or mixotrophic i e

clear indication of when subcomponents should be considered or excluded e g simulate organic carbon uptake or not nor is there a rationale or guidance for choosing any particular equation to simulate each subcomponent recent process models developed by the authors baroukh et al 2014 guest et al 2013 wágner et al 2016 have attempted to reconcile these differences but an industry wide harmonized consensus is still lacking to advance the broader implementation of algae and cyanobacteria process models by researchers and practitioners it is critical to establish a unified modeling framework that is capable of accounting for relevant process and environmental conditions while simultaneously avoiding unnecessary complexity the objective of this work was to critically review approaches to algae and cyanobacteria modeling and propose a unified framework for phytoplankton process modeling in the context of wrrfs as researchers attempt to balance model complexity with accuracy the range of disparate phytoplankton wastewater treatment models continues to grow to gain a better understanding of current approaches to modeling a critical literature review was performed to characterize core components of modeling algal and cyanobacterial bioprocesses and elucidate their relative importance to the overall accuracy and complexity of wastewater models based on the available information a modeling framework is proposed that can be used for future research and development in order to advance phytoplankton model fidelity and transparency as well as allow for its integration with current international water association iwa models e g batstone et al 2002 henze et al 2000 this work synthesizes the findings and recommendations from an international collaboration of phytoplankton modelers working toward the development of a unified modeling framework for microalgal and cyanobacterial process models building on recent process models developed by the authors and on recent reviews the results from an extensive critical literature review of 324 articles and conference proceedings presenting algae cyanobacteria models is presented to identify state variables and processes that can serve as the core unified modeling framework for phytoplankton based bioprocesses methods a comprehensive review of algal and cyanobacterial modeling literature was conducted through scopus

lighting conditions e g continuous vs diurnal light intensity and the response of phytoplankton to light e g increased decreased growth rate is of utmost importance which is rarely included as a consideration in other wrrf processes in addition to light and inorganic carbon photoautotrophic growth requires nutrients namely nitrogen and phosphorus in the absence of nutrients algae produce storage compounds that can later be metabolized once nutrients are available guest et al 2013 fig 1 discussions on how to model light carbon and nutrients can be found below modeling heterotrophic or mixotrophic growth of microalgae has recently received increased attention due to the higher productivities and lower operational costs associated with these growth regimes compared to photoautotrophic growth abreu et al 2012 adesanya et al 2014 liang et al 2009 while photoautotrophic growth primarily utilizes co2 as the carbon source heterotrophic growth involves organic carbon and mixotrophic growth can utilize both sources adesanya et al 2014 lowrey et al 2015 fig 1 experimental studies have shown that mixotrophic growth rates of some microalgae are the sum of autotrophic and heterotrophic growth rates operated independently adesanya et al 2014 lee 2001 but autotrophic activity can affect heterotrophic activity chojnacka and noworyta 2004 and vice versa nieva and valiente 1996 while mixotrophic growth does increase the number of uncertain parameters requiring calibration this metabolism has the potential to improve algal productivity at wrrfs lowering effluent nutrient concentrations and decreasing costs though interest in these growth conditions has increased only 9 6 of models reviewed considered non photoautotrophic metabolism initial heterotrophic and

and consumed during heterotrophic growth general model structures when attempting to simulate growth in silico models must possess adequate accuracy to represent the processes that are occurring while simultaneously minimizing complexity the simplest way to simulate growth is with a logistic model verhulst 1838 table 1 which does not explicitly represent the interactions between an organism and its internal or external environment growth is solely dependent on population however growth of microorganisms has long been observed to be affected by environmental conditions surrounding the cell especially regarding substrate and nutrient concentrations monod 1949 though using the logistic model is not computationally intensive its insensitivity to environmental conditions limits is applicability to wastewater treatment nonetheless 5 6 of papers reviewed used this model the empirically based monod model monod 1949 table 1 which is structurally the same as the mathematically derived michaelis menten model michaelis and menten 1913 approximates kinetics as a hyperbolic relationship between growth and an external factor e g organic carbon nutrients oxygen irradiance this relationship is defined by the maximum specific growth rate and half saturation constant i e the concentration at which the growth rate is half the maximum rate fig 2 the monod model is widely used in the wastewater industry because it can be calibrated easily due to having two parameters closely approximates reality for many chemotrophic prokaryotes and is accurate across a wide range of conditions for bacteria and archaea when substrate concentrations are below inhibitory levels as a result monod has been adapted for use in the asm models henze et al 2000 adm1 batstone et al 2002 and number of custom models embedded in simulation platforms e g gps xtm hydromantis 2017 biowin envirosim 2017 and sumo dynamita 2017 of the phytoplankton models reviewed 48 used a monod equation a layer of complexity was added to the substrate growth relationship when microalgae were observed to exhibit a notable lag between nutrient uptake and growth ketchum 1939 suggesting these two processes may be partially decoupled droop 2009 1968 further microalgae were found to take up and store nutrients notably nitrogen and phosphorus in excess of what was needed for growth ketchum 1939 in configurations or process designs in which algae are exposed to fluctuating nutrient concentrations the droop model formulation droop 1968 table 1 is better positioned to simulate the lag that occurs between uptake and growth due to luxury nutrient uptake and internal nutrient stores stevenson et al 1996 fig 2 this model which is based on phenomena observed in both batch and continuous cultures droop 1975 1974 utilizes maximum specific growth rate at high concentrations of internal stores similar to but different from monod but also includes a subsistence quota parameter i e the minimum internal concentration of a nutrient or substrate needed for growth to occur correlating the growth rate to internal substrate nutrient content the amount of which is determined by uptake and consumption allows this model to decouple nutrient uptake and growth cunningham and maas 1978 droop 2009 1968 flynn 2008 stevenson et al 1996 sunda et al 2009 though this formulation is more appropriate for modeling phytoplankton growth only 19 of the articles reviewed used a droop equation excessively high nutrient e g ammonia or substrate e g acetate concentrations have at times been shown to decrease growth rates due to inhibition e g through ammonia toxicity or increased maintenance energy requirements chen and johns 1996 high oxygen concentrations can also inhibit photosynthesis blankenship 2002 component concentrations that could be inhibitory may be modeled via the empirical haldane model for enzymatic reactions haldane 1930 table 1 also referred to as the andrews equation given that it was first used for growth of microorganisms based on observations by andrews 1968 and confirmed for phytoplankton in laboratory experiments by aiba 1982 which is formulated similarly to the monod model but includes an inhibition parameter 12 of models reviewed fig 2 when light reaches the cell phytoplankton can grow photoautotrophically as defined by the relationship between photosynthesis and irradiance pi the simplest way to achieve this is with a monod expression 18 of articles e g béchet et al 2015 concas et al 2012 slightly more intricate models have been developed and implemented for engineered systems including the poisson single hit model 5 0 sakshaug et al 1989 skjelbred et al 2012 the smith model 1 6 broekhuizen et al 2012 kenny and flynn 2016 smith 1936 and the jassby platt model 3 7 breuer et al 2015 jassby and platt 1976 van wagenen et al 2014 table 2 while more complex than monod these models do not account for the potential inhibitory effects of prolonged light exposure the steele model 10 drewry et al 2015 gonçalves et al 2016 steele 1962 wágner et al 2016 and the eilers and peeters model 11 guest et al 2013 ketheesan and nirmalakhandan 2013 peeters and eilers 1978 similar in structure to andrews 1968 are able to account for photoinhibition a further discussion of photoinhibition is included below when formulating a growth equation these models can be multiplied e g droop for phosphorus multiplied by andrews for nitrogen multiplication was first postulated by baule 1917 and used in 44 of papers or combined through a threshold formulation where growth rates are only impacted by the most limited nutrient or substrate von liebig 1841 used in 11 of papers however the multiplicative approach is only applicable when model components e g light nutrients carbon etc are independent indicating that multiplying model components is overused thus the threshold formulation should be used to account for scenarios where growth is dependent on multiple components e g limitation by n and p more complex relationships must be accounted for when the two compounds interact nonlinearly in the cell for example a phosphorus limitation reduces the nitrogen uptake efficiency bougaran et al 2010 nutrient uptake storage and mobilization in scenarios where phytoplankton are used for secondary or tertiary treatment of municipal wastewaters i e when treating waters with dilute nutrient concentrations phytoplankton growth can be dependent on either external or internal nutrients in terms of macronutrients phytoplankton are unique in their ability to metabolize multiple forms of nutrients e g no3 nh4 no2 and don for nitrogen dortch 1990 flynn et al 1997 liu et al 2012 po4 3 and dop for phosphorus brown and shilton 2014 liu et al 2012 the respective rates of n and p uptake are not independent rather algae can modify their n p ratio via growth rate typically between 2 3 1 to 23 1 on a mass basis in response to fluctuating nutrient concentrations which commonly occur at wrrfs gardner dale et al 2017 geider and la roche 2002 the form of nitrogen that is being taken up affects growth rate as well as ph specifically nitrate or nitrite must be reduced to be metabolized which results in slower growth due to expending reducing equivalents toward nitrogen fuggi et al 1981 sanz luque et al 2013 ammonia does not require reduction but its uptake lowers ph fuggi et al 1981 therefore the ph implications of the form of nitrogen being taken up should be considered when creating a model in addition to macronutrients micronutrients e g zinc manganese etc are necessary for growth kropat et al 2011 and can limit productivity if lacking carvalho et al 2006 singh et al 2016 micronutrients have been shown to be present in wastewaters westerhoff et al 2015 and in many cases can be sufficient to support growth daneshvar et al 2018 the simplest way to predict nutrient uptake rate is by making substrate a linear function of biomass growth rate with a yield coefficient e g yh henze et al 2000 16 of papers reviewed when modeling nutrient dynamics of phytoplankton however the decoupling between uptake and growth necessitates the two processes to be modeled separately droop 2009 ketchum 1939 in the case of microalgae it is not uncommon to expect nutrient uptake to tend to increase with nutrient concentration following michaelis menten kinetics michaelis and menten 1913 which is structurally similar to the monod model and be down regulated by the corresponding internal nutrient quota bougaran et al 2010 droop 1968 used in 39 of papers reviewed in non inhibitory nutrient replete conditions some phytoplankton will take up nutrients in excess of that required for growth this luxury uptake of nutrients will continue until the maximum internal quota is reached brown and shilton 2014 carey et al 2012 elrifi and turpin 1985 if nutrient concentrations become inhibitory e g free ammonia above 35 mg n l 1 abeliovich and azov 1976 haldane kinetics should be used in nutrient deplete conditions however growth does not simply cease though biomass growth rates decrease algae will continue to metabolize organic or inorganic carbon and will instead produce carbon storage compounds e g carbohydrates lipids or a combination of the two so that growth can resume when nutrients become available in the future see below ball et al 1990 guest et al 2013 guschina and harwood 2006 while michaelis menten kinetics are necessary to model nutrient uptake the model requires two calibrated parameters rather than one when utilizing a yield coefficient this equation can be simplified if nutrient concentration is several orders of magnitude greater than the half saturation coefficient e g when growing cultures on wrrf sidestreams such as anaerobic digester centrate in this case the uptake rate for that nutrient will be so close to the maximum specific uptake rate that the half saturation coefficient can be considered negligible simplifying the model following uptake nitrogen and phosphorus are metabolized to form intermediate biomass compounds when carbon is available blankenship 2002 when luxury uptake occurs algae have been shown to store phosphorus as polyphosphate brown and shilton 2014 additionally nitrogen may be stored either as intracellular pools coppens et al 2014 thoresen et al 1982 or as amino acids though not as readily as phosphorus elrifi and turpin 1985 these nutrient stores will then be utilized during nutrient deplete conditions if carbon is available as a result careful consideration must be taken when deciding how to incorporate the effect of nutrients on algal metabolism carbon uptake storage and mobilization in addition to nutrients the uptake of organic and or inorganic carbon should also be considered carefully included in 26 of articles carbon uptake is commonly modeled using michaelis menten or haldane kinetics depending on whether or not the compound can be inhibitory at higher concentrations baroukh et al 2017 and on the amount of existing internal carbon stores concas et al 2016 guest et al 2013 apart from uptake carbon utilization is dependent on several interrelated factors that must be considered concurrently for example under low light or dark conditions algae cannot photosynthesize enough to meet maintenance requirements so they will consume either external organic carbon i e mixotrophic or heterotrophic metabolism or stored carbohydrates lipids baroukh et al 2017 guest et al 2013 as a result carbon usage should be modeled with switching functions introduced in asm1 henze et al 1987 to account for these factors in many algal species e g chlorella sorokiniana chlamydomonas reinhardtii and scenedesmus obliquus guschina and harwood 2006 harwood and guschina 2009 subramanian et al 2013 vitova et al 2015 carbon storage compounds e g carbohydrates and lipids accumulate in the cell in response to nutrient deplete conditions fig 3 broadly these two compounds have been modeled in numerous ways most consistently as a function of biomass concentration using a yield coefficient 4 6 of articles e g dillschneider and posten 2013 mohammad mirzaie et al 2016 more complex models for these compounds involve switching functions dependent on nutrient availability as well as the relative concentrations of each storage compound these models do not have a consistent structure 7 1 of articles baroukh et al 2014 guest et al 2013 mairet et al 2011 given the relatively limited knowledge of storage compound dynamics in the timescale of dynamic wastewater processes there is no clear model that is optimal but in general carbohydrates and lipids should both be modeled separately 2 8 model carbohydrates only 8 7 model lipids only 3 7 model both together as a generic storage compound 1 2 model both separately additionally carbohydrates typically are produced and consumed faster than lipids but also reach the maximum internal concentration sooner davis et al 2016 laurens et al 2014 lipids conversely are produced at a slower rate but accumulate to a greater extent in many species of algae davis et al 2016 laurens et al 2014 as an added layer of complexity biomass composition can change both over diel cycles and also in response to design decisions e g srt gardner dale et al 2017 necessitating more mechanistic modeling of these metabolic processes oxygen consumption should also be accounted for using monod kinetics when modeling stored carbon usage in addition to this stored carbohydrates have been shown to be interconverted to lipids further increasing the potential intricacy of this sub process pick and avidan 2017 given the complexity of modeling carbohydrate and lipid accumulation carbon storage should only be considered if nutrient deplete conditions are expected to exist or if the cells are exposed to fluctuating lighting conditions e g diel natural lighting in the scenario being modeled light irradiance and dissipation light is an energy source during photoautotrophic and mixotrophic algal growth for photosynthesis accurately predicting light distribution is essential for modeling algal growth and metabolism photosynthetically active radiation par the spectral range of radiation that photosynthetic cells can use occurs between wavelengths of 400 750 nm wilhelm and jakob 2011 three types of irradiance models were identified in béchet et al 2013 type i models which use incident or average irradiance to predict the rate of photosynthesis for the entire culture type ii models which estimate overall reactor productivity as the sum of depth resolved productivities within the system and type iii models which account for both light gradients and short light cycles for individual cells type i models are simplest but type ii models tend to exhibit greater accuracy for a small increase in complexity type iii models are likely to be too complex for wrrfs given the need for individual based a k a microscopic models gujer 2002 as light penetrates a phytoplankton cultivation system it can be attenuated through absorption or scattering by cells or by the reactor itself posten 2009 wágner et al 2018 wang et al 2014 fig 4 light extinction can be exacerbated by high concentrations of highly diffusive particulate matter borowitzka 1998 the beer lambert law table 3 is widely used in phytoplankton modeling 35 of articles and accounts for light extinction due to absorption by pigments and scattering by the cells as well as absorption and diffusion due to non cellular components martínez et al 2018 often the extinction coefficient is taken as the absorption rate koller et al 2017 for dilute cultures the attenuation coefficient has been proposed to be expressed as a nonlinear function of absorption and scattering coefficients kirk 1984 morel 1988 modifications to this equation may be required to simulate the effects of multiple scattering when applicable e g tam and zardecki 1982 or to account for the disparity in coefficient values between natural and engineered systems photoinhibition and photoacclimation when modeling the effects of irradiance in engineered systems temporal changes in light intensity need to be considered especially in naturally lit scenarios which will follow a diel cycle some algae have developed the ability to adapt in response to changing lighting conditions carvalho et al 2011 photoinhibition i e the reduction in growth due to exposure to excess light can begin affecting growth within 1 min if irradiance is high enough béchet et al 2013 fig 5 under high light intensities photoacclimation processes are used to mitigate photoinhibition whereby the chlorophyll production is suppressed and carotenoids i e photo protective pigments are synthesized aburai et al 2015 anning et al 2000 garcía camacho et al 2012 guihéneuf and stengel 2015 koller et al 2017 macintyre et al 2002 safafar et al 2015 vaquero et al 2014 xie et al 2016 this photoacclimation strategy takes place at a time scale of days or weeks combe et al 2015 and contributes to chlorophyll carbon mass ratio variations typically within a factor of five falkowski 1983 anning et al 2000 studied the pi response curves of microalgae cultures pre acclimated at different light irradiances and showed 65 higher growth rates and higher chlorophyll content for the cells pre acclimated in the dark bouterfas et al 2002 compared multiple pi models and found that the eilers and peeters model is the most accurate when simulating growth in response to high irradiance this phenomenon is of utmost importance for wastewater treatment given that particulate and dissolved materials increase medium turbidity reducing the light penetration and maintaining a low average light in the water on top of this pigment synthesis can be strongly impacted by nitrogen limitation as the pigment content is related to the protein content which is itself related to the nitrogen status represented by the quota q in the droop model griffiths et al 2014 nitrogen limitation has also been shown to strongly reduce chlorophyll content breuer et al 2015 geider et al 1993 geider et al 1998 were among the first to introduce chlorophyll as a state variable in their models in addition to the carbon and nitrogen contents they expressed the rate of pigment synthesis per carbon unit as proportional to the product between the rates of photosynthesis and nitrogen uptake more recently bernard et al 2015 proposed a model whereby chlorophyll is proportional to the cellular nitrogen content beyond nitrogen temperature also has a strong effect on photoacclimation geider 1987 which has been represented by a model relating the chlorophyll quota to the current light irradiance and temperature more complex models exist flynn 2001 garcía camacho et al 2012 nikolaou et al 2016 but the computational intensity of these models relative to the increase in fidelity precludes their use in the context of modeling wrrfs accounting for photoacclimation in model development is crucial to represent successive phases with low turbidity where cells are subjected to high light and growth periods in a highly turbid medium for which average light is low only 6 8 of models reviewed included this process for studies focusing on growth in a permanently turbid medium cells will be mostly dark acclimated and photoacclimation can be neglected however growth model calibration must be carried out in low light conditions or equivalently in a very turbid medium in order to ensure sufficient accuracy temperature the influence of temperature on process dynamics can be tantamount to that of light ras et al 2013 34 of articles included temperature wastewater treatment processes cultivating phytoplankton typically have reduced depths i e less than 0 5 m and therefore lower thermal inertia than deeper in ground reactors when subjected to the solar irradiance temperatures within the reactor can vary from 5 c to as high as 56 c de luca et al 2017 dermoun et al 1992 talbot et al 1991 tredici and materassi 1992 microalgae and cyanobacteria can be particularly sensitive to environmental temperatures in engineered systems due to its effect on enzymatic activity and stability béchet et al 2011 bernard and rémond 2012 the impact of temperature on metabolism can be represented in mechanistic models accurately predicting the temperature dynamics over the course of the day béchet et al 2011 2010 but its effect has commonly been neglected or minimized in biological models often by using an arrhenius formulation arrhenius 1889 40 of models considering temperature fig 6 and table 4 the response of growth rate to temperature has been proposed to follow an asymmetric curve for most microorganisms rosso et al 1993 3 6 of articles that included temperature fig 6 and table 4 this response is defined by three cardinal temperatures t min the minimum temperature that will support growth t max the maximum temperature that will support growth and t opt the optimum temperature for growth the asymmetry of the growth curve results from differential effects on cellular physiology at temperatures lower or higher than t opt at low temperatures the rates of enzymatic biochemical reactions are affected blankenship 2002 at high temperatures structure and stability of some cellular components such as key enzymes or membrane compounds mainly lipids or proteins are denatured ras et al 2013 salvucci and crafts brandner 2004 the consequences on cell metabolism and integrity lead to an increase in mortality serra maia et al 2016 growth rates at temperatures greater than t max or less than t min are considered to be zero the deleterious effects of high temperature exposure are also temporally dependent and the concept of thermal dose has been used to quantify the damages at high temperature béchet et al 2017 holcomb et al 1999 given the potential impacts that temperature can have on biomass a temperature model should be carefully chosen and calibrated a more detailed review of temperature models can be found in grimaud et al 2017 respiration and maintenance while the main focus of this critical review is on phytoplankton growth and related processes carbon loss through endogenous respiration and maintenance should not be neglected when constructing a model included in 57 of models reviewed these processes are often considered to occur at a constant rate e g decostere et al 2013 47 of the models that included respiration this assumption is valid for maintenance energy requirements but endogenous respiration is impacted by multiple factors e g light temperature ph etc béchet et al 2017 ippoliti et al 2016 maintenance energy is dependent on the atp requirements of the organism and as such does not change beeftink et al 1990 the atp demand can be met through multiple routes depending on the situation being modeled i e if carbon storage products are being formed or not for instance cells can meet maintenance requirements first through storage products and only rely on endogenous respiration in the absence of these internal stores beeftink et al 1990 in addition to reducing biomass concentrations respiration can also lead to do consumption which can have an impact on any aerobic chemotrophic organisms in the system as such incorporation of maintenance and endogenous respiration as one mechanism to meet maintenance atp demands guest et

flux analyses baroukh et al 2015 chang et al 2011 although metabolic reconstructions provide a very thorough view of phytoplankton metabolism the complexity hinders process engineers from implementing metabolic models of phototrophic technologies at wrrfs several models build upon the concept of metabolic reconstructions while taking a simpler approach that may be considered more accessible and valuable for developing processing parameters at wrrfs through metabolic modeling in wrrf modeling of chemotrophic processes e g enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr the concept of lumped pathway metabolic modeling has been applied e g smolders et al 1994 which groups reactions based on whether intermediate compounds accumulate these grouped or lumped reactions are assumed to occur simultaneously and are modeled as a function of one parameter roels 1983 as such lumped pathway metabolic modeling has the potential to simplify metabolic reconstructions given that they have on the order of 10 reaction equations as opposed to 100 equations present in some reconstructions filipe and daigger 1999 guest et al 2013 fig 7 wrrf modeling platforms typically use empirical yield coefficients for the asms to help describe sludge accumulation within the system figueroa torres et al 2017 henze et al 2007 fig 7 with the general recommendation to conduct experiments to develop yield coefficients for a specific wrrf henze et al 2007 rieger et al 2012 any variation in yield coefficients between wrrfs is generally believed to be caused solely by environmental influences such as ph temperature and fluctuating substrate concentrations henze et al 2007 however yield coefficients have a foundation in the metabolic pathways an organism is using e g glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway etc indicating that values for these coefficients can be theoretically grounded if metabolic pathways are conserved derived theoretical values can then be used regardless of situation being modeled variability in terms of growth rate will still exist due to environmental conditions but this variation can be accounted for in associated subprocesses e g maintenance rather than by yield coefficients lumped pathway metabolic models allow stoichiometric parameters to be based on phytoplankton metabolism while simultaneously reducing complexity relative to metabolic models and increasing reproducibility relative to empirical models using lumped pathways also grounds many parameters e g p o ratio in fundamental well established ranges while decreasing the number of unknown stoichiometric parameters in the model thus increasing the model s innate mechanistic friction lowering the degrees of freedom and simplifying the final model structure baroukh et al 2014 guest et al 2013 van aalst van leeuwen et al 1997 while there are many benefits to using full metabolic models the additional complexity often precludes their inclusion in algal models inclusion of other organisms in the context of wastewater treatment maintaining a community of one type of organism is challenging if not entirely unrealistic in the context of algae and cyanobacteria chemotrophic bacteria e g heterotrophic bacteria nitrifiers and predatory organisms e g zooplankton can be present which impact the dynamics of the entire system being modeled mehrabadi et al 2016 wolf et al 2007 other organisms were included in 21 of models the relationship between heterotrophic bacteria and photoautotrophic phytoplankton has long been known to be symbiotic where bacteria and phytoplankton exchange products chemotrophic bacteria produce co2 and consume do while phytoplankton take up co2 and produce do rich 1963 this interaction can be particularly beneficial for photoautotrophic phytoplankton because high do concentrations can inhibit photosynthesis kaplan and reinhold 1999 however higher biomass concentrations stemming from chemotrophic organism growth can also limit photosynthesis by reducing light to suboptimal levels additionally phytoplankton and chemotrophs including autotrophs will be competing for substrates n p inorganic carbon etc if the phytoplankton are utilizing mixotrophy or heterotrophy they will be competing with the chemotrophic bacteria for organic resources which can impact system performance grover 2000 thingstad et al 1998 predators and grazers commonly have much more detrimental impacts on algal performance which is primarily a result of algal biomass being directly reduced baird et al 2003 depending on the conditions predators can result in frequent turnover of algal communities preventing the system from treating the water as anticipated sutherland et al 2017 whether including bacteria predators or both considering other organisms can quickly increase the complexity of a model due to the need to account for all the parameters the organism can affect e g oxygen co2 organic carbon ph light penetration etc solimeno et al 2017 zambrano et al 2016 however if phytoplankton are in a closed system e g a closed photobioreactor invasive organisms can be assumed to be negligible if not present in the influent physico chemical processes gas liquid mass transfer gas liquid mass transfer was included in 17 of reviewed articles the most important dissolved gases in phytoplankton processes are oxygen o2 carbon dioxide co2 and ammonia nh3 depending on their concentration they can either promote or inhibit growth generally speaking algae require 1 8 2 4 g co2 for each gram of biomass grown which results in a n demand of 0 02 0 25 g per gram of algae given that the c n ratio can vary from roughly 2 6 32 g c g n 1 geider and la roche 2002 leow et al 2015 li et al 2017 microalgae also produce approximately 1 5 1 92 g o2 g biomass 1 grobbelaar et al 1988 muñoz and guieysse 2006 moreover co2 and nh3 can significantly impact ph see below co2 and nh3 are also involved in bacterial processes and consequently play an important role in algal bacterial interactions necessitating their accurate simulation in wrrf process models solimeno et al 2017 2015 in the case of gas liquid system with a relatively dilute liquid phase henry s law is generally used to describe the equilibrium relationship eq 1 in table 5 due to the continuous production and or consumption of gaseous components by biological processes however gas liquid mass transfers occur continuously the driving force of gas liquid mass transfer is therefore the difference between the saturation concentration and the real concentration in the liquid phase eq 2 in table 5 the local mass transfer coefficient represents the resistance of the interface to transfer for gases with low solubility e g o2 and co2 dissolution into the liquid phase is more challenging while more soluble gases e g nh3 are more difficult to remove from solution the mass transfer rate depends on gas and liquid physico chemical properties temperature and turbulence of the medium several models exist to describe this mass transfer rate including higbie s penetration theory higbie 1935 or the double layer model lewis and whitman 1924 however both the local mass transfer coefficient and the interfacial area require calibration and determining these parameters is challenging therefore the combination of both parameters i e the local mass transfer coefficient and the interfacial area is often considered this combined coefficient is typically referred to as kl ga the prevalence of aeration in the activated sludge process has resulted in extensive in situ determination of the oxygen specific kla value i e klao2 amaral et al 2017 kayser 1979 as well as models to describe it gillot et al 2005 overall mass transfer coefficients for other gases with low solubility e g co2 are usually calculated from the oxygen transfer rate using higbie s penetration theory eq 3 in table 5 in order to determine the effect that these gaseous compounds can have gas liquid mass transfer should be considered when constructing a wrrf model ph acid base equilibrium acid base equilibrium considers the change in concentration of one or several compounds of interest e g co2 aq hco3 and co3 2 in aqueous phase and the subsequent effect it has on ph and therefore microalgal processes brönsted 1923 lowry 1923 13 of models similar to compounds involved in liquid gas transfer these compounds are continuously produced or consumed by biological processes contrary to liquid gas transfer however acid base equilibrium occurs rapidly compared to biological processes as a result equilibrium is often assumed to be established instantaneously i e on the order of 104 and 105 d 1 jupsin et al 2003 reichert et al 2001 solimeno et al 2015 the direct impact of ph on algal growth included in 16 of models is rather limited when ph is between 5 8 5 depending on the algal species and other operational parameters such as temperature benemann et al 1987 berge et al 2012 mayo 1997 algal growth can affect ph by consuming co2 during photosynthesis resulting in a net increase in ph as protons are consumed to maintain chemical equilibrium berenguel et al 2004 in addition to the bicarbonate system the nitrogen species present in solution have an impact on ph if ammonium is applied as the nitrogen source ph drops due to the release of protons during assimilation conversely ph can rise when nitrate is used due to the consumption of protons needed to assimilate nitrate nguyen and rittmann 2015 most phytoplankton models for municipal wastewater treatment exclude ph dependence for algal growth broekhuizen et al 2012 james et al 2013 mayo 1997 but ph indirectly affects algal growth by changing the relative concentrations of substrates such as co2 decostere et al 2016 wolf et al 2007 additionally high ph i e above 9 may induce inhibition of algal growth by free ammonia abeliovich and azov 1976 konig et al 1987 some models simulate ph as a function of the bicarbonate system decostere et al 2016 fernández et al 2010 liehr et al 1988 but the simplicity of these models results in inaccuracy when other ph altering components are present the river water quality model 1 rwqm1 reichert et al 2001 introduced a set of differential equations to model the acid base equilibria for inorganic carbon ammonia and phosphate as well as the water acid base equilibrium this approach was later modified to a system of differential for biological process rates and algebraic for fast chemical reactions equations dae where ph is numerically estimated by closing the charge balance i e mono dimensional numerical methods in the system broekhuizen et al 2012 gehring et al 2010 wolf et al 2007 the application of dae systems to predict ph is commonly used to model other wastewater systems as it reduces the stiffness of the model compared to differential equation systems batstone et al 2012 2002 hellinga et al 1999 this approach has been improved by vangsgaard et al 2013 by formulating a set of equations describing the mass balances and equilibrium equations of weak acids and bases and a charge balance which are solved using a multidimensional newton raphson method during the last few years the acid base system has been better described by including the effect of ionic strength ion pairing and developing improved numeric solvers to ensure robustness in the calculations flores alsina et al 2015 lizarralde et al 2015 solon et al 2015 other common ways to estimate ph changes in water systems are by closing proton or alkalinity balances luff et al 2001 serralta et al 2004 calibration validation and uncertainty sensitivity analyses whether constructing a new model or tailoring an existing one to a specific scenario a model should always be calibrated and validated to the degree possible prior to use 69 of models were calibrated but only 36 were validated calibration involves adjusting parameter values to fit the model to collected and reconciled data i e data that have been cleaned and ensured are accurate hauduc et al 2010 validation ensures that the model also matches data from a different set of conditions distinct from the calibration dataset by comparing the calibrated model to another set of data rieger et al 2012 this step in building a model is important because it ensures that model outputs are both reliable and reproducible in the context of wastewater treatment a model that can accurately predict performance can mean the difference between meeting discharge requirements or not calibration of wrrf models is often performed manually which frequently results in unreliable output values sin et al 2005 though calibration protocols have been proposed e g biomath vanrolleghem et al 2003 stowa hulsbeek et al 2002 and the iwa unified protocol rieger et al 2012 there is no consensus on calibration methodology making the comparison and evaluation of calibration across models incredibly challenging while calibrating all parameters is extremely difficult and prone to errors particularly for complex models with many parameters e g rwqm1 and adm1 with 24 and 45 parameters respectively most of the variability in a model is often due to a subset of parameters this subset can be determined through a sensitivity analysis sin et al 2005 ensuring that these parameters are calibrated carefully is essential other parameters do not need to be calibrated as carefully or standard values can be sourced from previously published articles model prediction quality can be evaluated in relation to quality of fit e g through the use of akaike or bayesian information criterion grimaud et al 2017 or by examining the percentage of experimental data falling within the confidence interval of the model output ramin et al 2017 wágner et al 2018 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses can be used in tandem to determine how parameter variations affect output variability as well as which parameters affect model outputs the most broadly uncertainty analyses in wrrf modeling pass randomly chosen input values through the model and record the outputs to determine either the range of potential outputs or estimate the likelihood of meeting a target value e g discharge requirements loucks et al 2005 uncertainty analyses can be conducted with monte carlo simulation wherein probability density functions are assigned to inputs and are randomly sampled tens of thousands of times saltelli et al 2006 sin et al 2009 to reduce the computational burden of characterizing uncertainty around wrrf process model results latin hypercube sampling lhs can be used to reduce the required number of simulations in a monte carlo analysis by discretizing probability density functions into equal probability portions helton and davis 2003 mckay et al 1979 shoener et al 2016 following the uncertainty analysis model inputs and outputs can be compared to determine parameter sensitivity similar to calibration procedures there is no universal sensitivity analysis procedure though sensitivity analyses can be broadly categorized as local or global morris one factor at a time morris 1991 and markov chain monte carlo sharifi et al 2014 are examples of global sensitivity analyses whereas differential analysis brun et al 2002 is local sensitivity metrics can be used to concisely compare sensitivities of model outputs to individual inputs e g spearman s rank correlation coefficient iman and conover 1982 marino et al 2008 wang et al 2015 when evaluating a model the analysis chosen should depend on the core objective e g reducing model structural uncertainty or input uncertainty which should be explicitly stated when describing the model only 30 of models utilized sensitivity analyses 26 of which did not describe the procedure used rigorously performing uncertainty and sensitivity analyses will not only simplify model calibration and validation but will also help to inform future experimentation by identifying critical information needs for model application and development for instance if a particular model output is very sensitive to a highly uncertain parameter extensive experimentation could be conducted to ensure the parameter is accurately calibrated and the model can be validated integration with existing wrrf models standard wastewater modeling nomenclature as we seek to develop phytoplankton based processes for wastewater treatment the likelihood of broad adoption of developed models will be directly influenced by their alignment with existing wrrf modeling structure and nomenclature to the degree possible any phytoplankton models developed should be able to be integrated with the iwa s activated sludge models e g asm2d and adm3 and anaerobic digestion model 1 adm1 there may be circumstances or applications of phytoplankton modeling that necessitate or warrant alternative model structures but it should be recognized that any deviations will reduce transparency and the likelihood of adoption by industry the original iwa asm1 publication popularized a standard approach to naming the state variables upon which pseudo mechanistic model structures are built henze et al 1987 each state variable defines one fundamental component around which a dynamic mass balance is determined the asm1 state variable structure allows for grouping of different sets of variables by their fundamental composition e g chemical oxygen demand nitrogen phosphorus and by the processes which act upon them e g biomass state variables undergo growth and decay through rate equations in addition to establishing a straightforward nomenclature discussed below the asm1 also used a petersen matrix petersen 1965 which concisely displays an entire model both kinetics and stoichiometry and helps ensure the maintenance of mass balances the original asm1 henze et al 1987 sets out a nomenclature that specifies attributes of the state variables and allows straightforward grouping of the state variables based on inherent characteristics and the processes acting on them 46 of articles focusing solely on wastewater 5 0 of all articles a capital letter specifies the component category s for soluble and x for slowly biodegradable or particulate and subscripts are then used to uniquely identify the component subscripts may specify if a component is readily biodegradable e g ss or inert e g xi or can identify the short form chemical composition e g sno for soluble nitrate and nitrite biomass components typically use the nomenclature xb followed by a second subscript to distinguish between biomass types e g xb h for heterotrophs xb a for autotrophs the subsequent iwa models asm2 henze et al 1995 asm2d henze et al 1999 asm3 gujer et al 1999 and adm1 batstone et al 2002 maintained this nomenclature structure adhering to the s and x prefixes for soluble and particulate components the asm2 model report also explicitly states that the x components must be electrically neutral no ionic charges whereas the soluble components may carry charges further model development by academic researchers and commercial simulation companies has generally followed the established iwa nomenclature but diversity in model complexity and approach to naming state variables has led to some confusion and inconsistency across the wastewater modeling industry corominas et al 2010 summarized many of the issues faced with conflicting variable names including consistency of variable names and meanings e g b has been used to stand for biomass or biodegradable usage of upper or lower cases and different units associated with the same variable e g biomass has been represented by g cod m 3 g c m 3 or mol c m 3 additionally state variable definitions should incorporate the processes which act upon them this aspect is often disregarded when identifying variables corominas et al 2010 proposed a structured methodology for setting names for state variables and model parameters using a series of subscripts to represent biodegradability organic inorganic nature organism name if relevant and any other distinguishing characteristics this standardized nomenclature has not been broadly adopted however to the degree possible developers of new models should also use existing asm and adm variables e g xli for stored lipids xch for stored carbohydrates guest et al 2013 and only focus on adapting variables that are not already represented e g xalg for algae biomass ultimately nomenclature congruent with iwa naming conventions must be adhered to if phytoplankton pseudo mechanistic models are to be usable by the wastewater industry integration approaches in order to develop plant wide models that include phytoplankton based processes alongside activated sludge or anaerobic digestion processes existing integration techniques for asms and adm1 can be leveraged at present there are three main approaches to plant wide dynamic wrrf modeling i the interfaces approach nopens et al 2009 vanrolleghem et al 2005 volcke et al 2006 zaher et al 2007 ii the standard supermodel approach jones et al 2007 seco et al 2004 and iii the tailored supermodel approach grau et al 2007 a summary of these approaches can be found in grau et al 2009 a number of software packages are commercially available for whole plant simulations e g gps x biowin west and sumo taking advantage of both the interface and supermodel e g gps x biowin approaches for whole plant modeling although the interface approach can use state variable transformers to add new unit processes to models developing these transformers is typically difficult grau et al 2009 the supermodel approach requires the development of new state variables and processes but allows for greater flexibility in terms of model development and is therefore more frequently used in practice e g used in gps xtm biowin and sumo additionally when integrating models a continuity check should be performed to avoid inconsistencies in mass balances see rieger et al 2012 for details path forward model development algae modeling needs in wastewater treatment accurately modeling full scale phytoplankton treatment systems accounting for reactor design influent composition algal bacterial interactions and environmental conditions is essential models should be able to accommodate different reactor types e g hraps raceway ponds pbrs etc shoener et al 2014 as well as influents e g raw sewage primary or secondary effluent etc in order for a model to be useful an objective should be established prior to model construction e g prediction control monitoring etc which will help practitioners navigate tradeoffs between complexity and accuracy bernard et al 2015 a model should also be as simple as possible while maintaining the ability to assist with decision making daigger 2011 key factors in model development the number of disparate models uncovered during this review and the absence of critical model components e g calibration and validation methodology in many papers underscore the need for more rigorous phytoplankton model formulation procedures before constructing a model researchers must first consider environmental and reactor conditions to determine which processes to include and which equations can best simulate that process table 6 this consideration is of particular importance given that several influential components are frequently omitted from published models e g carbon phosphorus and temperature were only included in 27 26 and 24 of reviewed articles respectively when considering growth monod kinetics are adequate in circumstances with stable nutrient conditions e g chemostats with fixed environmental conditions and substrate concentrations below inhibitory values in configurations or process designs in which algae are exposed to fluctuating nutrient concentrations droop model formulation should be used to decouple nutrient uptake and growth additionally high ammonia or substrate e g acetate concentrations that could be inhibitory may be modeled via haldane andrews andrews 1968 haldane 1930 similarly inhibition from high irradiance can be modeled via the eilers and peeters or steele expressions eilers and peeters 1988 steele 1962 given that the choice of a pi sub model will only have an impact at high light intensities where photoinhibition and photoacclimation may occur eilers and peeters 1988 if only non photoinhibitory situations are being considered the simplest model that can still accurately simulate the process may be chosen for substrate uptake and utilization given the dynamicity of wrrfs organisms must be modeled with their history in mind for example if the organism was previously in n replete conditions but then experiences n deplete conditions it will continue growing off internal reserves before forming storage compounds additionally the impacts of changing environmental conditions on phytoplankton processes should be assessed e g temperature changes across seasons excluding environmental history or dynamic conditions will limit the accuracy of a model in addition to selecting model components carefully the model foundation should be built upon a mechanistic understanding of phenomena this will not only improve the generalizability and accuracy of the model but may also reduce the number of calibrated parameters provide a theoretically grounded range for biochemical model parameters and increase model transparency by reducing the number of empirical parameters this comprehensive understanding will also enable the integration of separate but related models e g hydrodynamics which will be critical to translate laboratory scale data into predictions of full scale performance also when gathering experimental data it should be noted that diel cycles will often necessitate frequent sampling multiple times per day to enable model validation high resolution models require multiple measurements each day or even each hour in order to capture diel variability this is crucial during model calibration and validation more broadly the lack of clearly defined calibration and validation procedures is a serious shortcoming in many of the papers reviewed 17 of papers that calibrated their models did not specify a procedure calibration and validation need to be conducted to assess the accuracy and precision of a model appropriately and ensure the fidelity of a model is upheld if a model cannot be calibrated and validated reliably it cannot be utilized for a full scale reactor let alone as a component of a wrrf model broader context wrrf practitioners are tasked with protecting the health of the public and the aquatic environment and an inaccurate model could have serious deleterious effects on wrrf investment design and performance when proposing a model the phytoplankton process should be considered as part of an entire wrrf not just an independent unit promising model structures should be able to handle the frequent changes that occur at wrrfs in order to ensure models are accessible to the broadest possible audience and can be compared easily iwa nomenclature should be used more frequently to increase wrrf model inter compatibility the asms proposed the use of a stoichiometric matrix to quickly and efficiently display the model structure however only 6 2 of papers reviewed used a stoichiometric matrix this approach should be used to make models simpler to interpret and to implement in simulation software thus widening the user base of phytoplankton models and accelerating their broader adoption at full scale wrrfs microalgal resource recovery systems have tremendous potential to improve wrrf function achieving effluent nutrient concentrations below the current limit of technology in order to realize this potential however wrrf practitioners must first believe that the tools available to them are accurate and reliable this trust can only be attained if algae process models adhere to the same level of rigor and transparency as current iwa models conclusion algal and cyanobacterial technologies have the potential to achieve effluent nutrient concentrations below existing biological nutrient removal systems but there is no established modeling framework for engineered phytoplankton treatment systems in the context of wastewater treatment a droop formulation for nutrient uptake and an eilers and peeters formulation for irradiance response can accurately simulate external and internal conditions the effects of temperature fluctuations on phytoplankton growth rates should be assessed with either an arrhenius or ctmi formulation lumped pathway metabolic models rooted in a mechanistic understanding of biochemical processes can simplify model structure and reduce parameter uncertainty calibration and validation should be rigorous and clearly defined acknowledgements this work

20016,this study presents a new gel based technique to describe the pore water ammonium distribution through the sediment water interface in two dimensions at a millimeter scale the technique is an adaptation of the classical colorimetric method based on the berthelot s reaction after the thin film of the gel probe was equilibrated by diffusion either in standard solutions or in pore waters a colorimetric reagent gel was set on the gel probe allowing development of the characteristic green color a flatbed scanner and subsequent densitometry image analysis allowed to determine the concentration distribution of ammonium the gel probe was tested in the laboratory for two media deionized water and seawater within the range 0 3000 μm in nh4 detection limit is about 20 μm and accuracy about 25 μm the field validation was realized in a tidal mudflat of the french atlantic coast by comparison with conventional pore water extraction and colorimetric analysis the large range of concentrations and its applicability in continental and marine sediments suggest a wide range of applications of the technique for a reasonable cost graphical abstract image 1 keywords biogeochemistry high resolution porewater det densitometry 1 introduction in benthic coastal ecosystems ammonium is the most abundant nitrogenous form and is used preferentially in autotrophic reactions rather than nitrite and nitrate horrigan and mccarthy 1982 ivančič and degobbis 1984 then ammonium is recycled by micro and microbenthic fauna during remineralization of organic matter regnault 1987 including shorebirds jauffrais et al 2015 and tends to accumulate in the anoxic layer of sediments herbert 1999 therefore its availability to microalgae and macrophytes depends on its upward flux to the photic layer of the sediment welker et al 2002 ammonium is involved in several redox reactions such as reduction of manganese oxide anammox or nitrification influencing other biogeochemical cycles luther et al 1997 anschutz et al 2000 dalsgaard and thamdrup 2002 deflandre et al 2002 physical transport such as advection tidal pumping and bioirrigation may generate important spatial heterogeneity within the sediment santos et al 2012 as a consequence the rapid transfer of superficial water into the sediment may affect ammonium distribution at the scale of burrows enhancing for instance nitrification welsh and castadelli 2004 at a millimeter scale ammonium heterogeneity has never been documented in sediment pore waters whereas it is documented for other nutrients such as phosphorus pagès et al 2011 cesbron et al 2014 ding et al 2016 and nitrite and nitrate metzger et al 2016 see santner et al 2015 for an extensive review of pore water imaging techniques since ammonium is a nitrogen species playing a major role in primary and secondary early diagenetic reactions achieving its 2d distribution at high spatial resolution combined with other imaging techniques will help understanding nutrients and metal remobilization dynamics in coastal habitats furthermore it will improve our knowledge at fine scale of such habitats often exposed to anthropogenic pressure especially in a context of climate change and oxygen depleted zones spreading diaz and rosenberg 2009 several analytical techniques exist to measure ammonium concentration in aquatic environments among them a well known colorimetric method is the berthelot reaction berthelot 1859 this method is based on the reaction between ammonia a phenol and sodium hypochlorite in an alkaline solution that creates a blue complex wavelength of maximum absorbance of 690 nm color intensity corresponds to the sum of ammonium and ammonia concentrations in the sample through time this method was improved and adapted to different natural environments riley 1953 harwood and kühn 1970 patton and crouch 1977 ivančič and degobbis 1984 another photometric technique is based on fluorescence properties of ammonium in a solution this method allows detection of very low concentration about 100 nm however the kinetics of the reaction is very slow about 3 h and the reagent is highly photosensitive holmes et al 1999 to avoid fluorometric measurement limitations ammonium can also be measured by flow injection analysis kérouel and aminot 1997 holmes et al 1999 detection by selective electrode garside et al 1978 and by cathodic stripping voltammetry harbin and van den berg 1993 also exist but demand a large volume of sample several ml all these techniques need an initial separation of pore waters from sediments by squeezing or centrifugation of core slices the pore water characterization is a difficult task at high spatial resolution i e below few mm with these sampling methods as they are limited by the pore water volumes collected during extraction furthermore this resolution is insufficient to describe numerous biogeochemical processes occurring at millimeter scale that are typical of highly productive coastal environments in addition current methods show numerous disadvantages associated with the extraction procedure such as cellular lysis of living organisms during centrifugation that might give inaccurate measurements mudroch and macknight 1994 the development of in situ microelectrodes during the 80s allowed to measure at high resolution the ammonium concentration de beer and sweerts 1989 but its use to study lateral variability remains time consuming reducing its spatial relevance in addition the technique is sensitive to alkaline ions and is not applicable in marine waters planar optodes were also developed to characterize the ammonium turnover around roots strömberg 2008 but their applicability in situ remain limited due to their cost and complexity for all these reasons we developed an inexpensive and easy to use 2d det colorimetric technique for in situ ammonium analysis as an alternative to current analytical techniques this technique is based on the diffusion between pore waters and a hydrogel layer that contains 95 98 water according to its composition polyacrylamide or agarose respectively the main challenge with 2d det colorimetric techniques is to find the best compromise between reaction kinetics reagents concentration and diffusion in order to limit lateral diffusion causing relaxation of potential microenvironments cesbron et al 2014 jézéquel et al 2007 metzger et al 2016 this method has already been developed successfully for iron phosphates alkalinity and more recently for nitrite and nitrate see references above and is now adapted for the first time to ammonium this new method was then validated by comparison with current analytical methods for pore waters analysis of sediment cores 2 material and methods 2 1 colorimetric principle the first step of the reaction consists to raise the solution ph up to 11 with sodium hydroxide to convert ammonium into ammonia that reacts with sodium hypochlorite to form monochloramine then monochloramine reacts with a phenolic compound to form a blue dye 2 2 diisopropyl 5 5 dimethyl indophenol blue that absorbs light at 690 nm a phenol commonly used is thymol it can be replaced by sodium salicylate a less toxic searle 1984 but less sensitive compound krom 1980 sodium nitroprusside is added to catalyze this reaction in marine environments the high concentrations of calcium and magnesium about 10 and 53 mm respectively millero et al 2008 interfere in the reaction riley 1953 these alkali earth elements precipitate with carbonate when the solution ph is raised with sodium hydroxide to prevent precipitation chelating agents such as cdta cyclohexyl trans 1 2 diaminetetraacetid acid roskam and de langen 1964 or sodium citrate are used to complex magnesium and calcium however sodium citrate is photosensitive bower and holm hansen 1980 we thus replaced it by etidronic acid another chelating agent used in the merck ammonium kit 2 2 gel probe preparation and deployment the preparation of the 2d det probe and its colorimetric analysis is adapted from jézéquel et al 2007 the probe is a polycarbonate plate 250 mm high 150 mm width and 2 mm thick with a central depression 180 mm long 92 mm wide 1 mm thick this depression holds an agarose hydrogel that is covered by a pvdf porous membrane 0 2 μm durapore which is affixed with a pvc tape the gel layer is prepared with 1 5 g of pure agarose sigma aldrich cas 9012 36 6 dissolved in 100 ml of milliq water at 80 c to have a homogeneous gel thickness the heated agarose solution is quickly poured vertically between 2 polycarbonate plates separated by a u frame of 1 mm thickness the whole setting is then chilled in a fridge for few minutes to accelerate the gelation the probe is rinsed and stored with in milliq water until use unlike other 2d det gel probes made for iron alkalinity phosphorus or nitrate and nitrite analysis the use of polyacrylamide is prohibited because preliminary tests have shown that polyacrylamide reacts with the ammonium reagent probably because of its amide groups polyacrylamide gels are usually preferred to agarose despite their toxicity and additional preparation steps due to their softness and strength that make it handier to use than agarose gels however the 1 mm thickness used for the probe preparations is sufficient to have a robust and easy to use agarose gel despite its large dimensions to avoid oxygen contamination during probes deployment within the sediment the probes are deoxygenated by nitrogen bubbling in milliq water overnight before deployment the probes are then inserted in the sediment at two thirds of their total length and kept until chemical equilibrium with pore waters 2 3 calibration and reagent gel preparation ammonium standard solutions were prepared by dissolution of no3nh4 salt fluka cas 6484 52 2 in a solution of adequate ionic strength seven standard solutions from 0 μm to 500 μm or 3000 μm according to the test were placed in contact to a 1 mm thick agarose gel for 1 h see details in cesbron et al 2014 and further processed as a probe gel the color development of the in situ gel is achieved using two agarose gels equilibrated in reagent solutions for at least 30 min indeed unlike previous methods that use one single reagent gel jézéquel et al 2007 pagès et al 2011 bennett et al 2015 metzger et al 2016 two reagent gels are required for the reaction because reagents are not stable when mixed all at once the first colorimetric reagent solution contains 0 65 m sodium hydroxide sigma aldrich cas 1310 73 2 0 012 m sodium hypochlorite sigma aldrich cas 7681 52 9 and 0 12 m etidronic acid sigma aldrich cas 2809 21 4 in deionized water millipore milli q system the second coloring reagent solution contains 0 027 m sodium nitroprusside fluka cas 13755 38 9 and 0 12 m thymol sigma aldrich cas 89 83 8 in deionized water the latter reagent has to be prepared in two steps because thymol needs a non aqueous solvent to be incorporated to the final reagent solution here methanol 5 thymol in methanol reagent gels are exposed to 50 ml of their respective reagent solution in a plastic bag and gently mixed for at least 30 min for equilibration it is recommended to keep the bag on a stirring table to facilitate homogenization 2 4 gel assemblage and colorimetric reaction after equilibration reagent gels are removed from their respective bags and quickly drained before being laid down onto white plates after having wiped the drops of residual reactive solution the probe gel i e the one deployed in the field is laid onto the first reagent gel the second reagent gel is immediately placed on the assembled gels the three layer gel assemblage is then covered by a clean cellulose acetate film to avoid evaporation gradually the typical color of the indophenol blue develops associated with the yellow nitroprusside in alkaline medium it gives a green final color finally after 20 min of reaction at room temperature 20 c the three layer gel assemblage is scanned to acquire the 2d ammonium distribution in the sediment pore waters 2 5 2d imagery methods to obtain the ammonium distribution a simple commercial flatbed scanner canon canoscan lide 152 600f was used from scanned images intensity of coloration of the 2d probe was processed with imagej software schneider et al 2012 images were at first stripped from their edges 5 mm in order to avoid any edge effect and then decomposed into primary color intensities red green and blue at about 140 nm wavelength resolution each being converted to a gray scale image the red color intensity was found to give the most sensitive response since the dye formed is blue as this channel can saturate with high ammonium concentration the less sensitive green channel can also be used see results and discussion section a region of interest roi is selected for each zone of the standard gel corresponding to a circle of about 15 mm in diameter i e 30 000 pixels with the selected resolution this circle was the zone of equilibration of the gel with the standard solution 2 6 optimization tests the principle of the 2d det methods developed to date jézéquel et al 2007 robertson et al 2008 pagès et al 2011 cesbron et al 2014 bennett et al 2015 metzger et al 2016 is to adapt preexisting colorimetric reaction for solutions to the hydrogel 2d samples by superimposing one or two reagent gels over a sample gel that was previously equilibrated in the sediment the colorimetric method that was considered as a reference method to be adapted for the 2d determination was the colorimetric test from merck spectroquant which is derived from harwood and kühn 1970 the main difference between both protocols resides in the use of etidronic acid in our method to prevent interferences from alkali earth elements by chelation briefly in the harwood and kühn 1970 method a volume of sample reacts with a series of reagents that are concentrated to ensure excess for all reagents in our case the protocol combining gel layers induced a dilution of a factor three case of two reagent gels leading to possible changes in sensitivity and importance of interferences therefore optimization of reagent concentrations is necessary this testing was performed in two steps a first phase in spectrophotometric cuvettes in order to limit volume of chemicals and a second phase in gels by narrowing ranges found in the first stage the transposition from solutions to gels is not automatic since cross diffusion processes may affect locally kinetics and order of reactions in the case of a series of reactions to reach the colored indophenol dye these processes may induce precipitate formations that also affect analytical performance in the following sub sections we explore the concentration of the catalyst in the kinetics of the development of the indophenol dye secondly the importance of the chelating agent when working in seawater and then the amount of thymol in both a solution and a gel assemblage 2 7 field validation this technique was applied in the intertidal mudflat of bourgneuf bay the bay is located south of the loire estuary on the french atlantic coast fig 1 and is characterized by a presence of wild oyster reefs echappé et al 2018 and oyster and mussel farming areas the field validation consisted to deploy a 2d det probe near an observation site 47 00 56 9 n 2 02 27 6 w where sediment geochemistry was documented on a monthly basis the survey consisted of sampling three cores of 10 cm in diameter at each vertex of an equilateral triangle of 10 m fig 1 right panel sampling was carried out in june 2016 at low tide salinity was 33 and the temperature of the sediment was 18 c the 2d det probe was deployed for three hours within the sediment for equilibration between the gel and pore waters then the probe was carefully collected with its surrounding sediment that represents a slab of 3 cm of thickness using a jaw device thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 and transported to the laboratory to reach an equilibration time of 5 h in total the jaw device was then opened and the 2d det probe processed immediately the sediment cores were kept at in situ temperature until processing the next day 2 8 core processing and pore water analyses the cores were sliced under nitrogen atmosphere every 2 mm to a depth of 2 cm then every 5 mm to a depth of 5 cm and finally every centimeter to 11 cm depth sediment slices were immediately centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered using a 0 2 μm filter rc25 sartorius one aliquot was frozen for colorimetric analysis ammonium nitrite and nitrate a second one was acidified and diluted for total fe mn p si and s analysis and a third aliquot was used for immediate analysis of alkalinity ammonium was analyzed using a phenol hypochlorite method harwood and kühn 1970 with etidronic acid as chelating agent to prevent magnesium and calcium precipitation alkalinity was measured using the colorimetric bromophenol blue formic acid method sarazin et al 1999 all spectrophotometric analyses were performed using a genesys 20 from thermo fischer fe mn p si and s measurements were performed after a 50 fold dilution with a 1 ultrapure nitric acid with an icp oes icap 6300 thermo fischer analyzed elemental sulfur was interpreted as sulfate since sulfide is volatile and was removed from the sample solution under acidic conditions pore water samples were acidified at ph below 1 for storage before icp oes analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization tests 3 1 1 influence of nitroprusside content in the reagent a series of standard curves were realized using different sodium nitroprusside concentrations within a range from 0 025 to 0 056 m nitroprusside being a catalyst for the formation of the monochloramine thymol intermediate compound n chloro 2 isopropyl 5 methyl quinone monoimine the absorbance was measured at different times between 10 and 20 min and at different concentrations of ammonium between 15 and 1000 μm results did not show any variability within the range of nitroprusside concentrations this test did not show any effect of time either it suggests that a concentration of 0 025 m of sodium nitroprusside is concentrated enough to observe the complete formation of the indophenol blue in 10 min within a range of ammonium concentrations from 30 to 1000 μm at 15 μm of ammonium results were comparable to blanks for the final protocol a concentration of 0 025 m of sodium nitroprusside was retained for the reagent when moving to the gel the time retained for analysis after contact between gel probe and reagent gel was 20 min in order to allow diffusion and colorimetric reaction between gels 3 1 2 importance of etidronic acid two calibration curves for ammonium were carried out in spectrophotometric cuvettes fig 2 the two calibrations differed by the use or not of etidronic acid as a chelating agent to complex alkali earth elements that are susceptible to precipitate when sodium hydroxide is added rising ph over 13 without etidronic acid one can observe the rise of the intercept by a factor three a slight diminution of the slope about 10 furthermore the presence of precipitates in current analytical method for ammonium is less dramatic as particles may settle in the cuvette below the path of the beam light however in the case of a gel thin films the precipitates cannot be removed as the color of the surface is measured i e reflectance the presence of precipitates can have dramatic consequences at the pixel scale 3 1 3 influence of thymol concentration six calibration curves were performed in cuvettes to assess the optimal thymol concentration 0 012 m 0 018 m 0 03 m 0 06 m 0 09 m 0 12 m fig 3 all curves follow a linear pattern with similar slopes 0 0039 0 002 and r2 above 0 992 these results suggest that even at the lowest concentration there is enough thymol to react with the monochloramin within the range of 0 500 μm ammonium a simplified version of the previous test was performed on gel layers only two concentrations of thymol were tested 0 06 and 0 12 m fig 4 with a thymol concentration of 0 06 m grey squares the calibration curve shows a slope of 0 106 and r2 0 94 up to 260 μm of ammonium whereas using 0 12 m thymol dark diamonds the slope is 0 076 and r2 0 991 despite a rather lower slope the experiment using a higher amount of thymol shows a better linearity and a lower dispersion the linear correlation seems not to fit well with data indicating a probable saturation of the reagent with the lower concentration of thymol these results highlight the difficulty to transfer colorimetric techniques in cuvettes to gel layers the hydrophobic property of thymol probably explains the necessity to increase the amount of thymol in the reagent for gel layer protocol the high volatility of methanol the solvent of thymol may also affect the colorimetric reaction the high surface volume ratio enhances the evaporation of methanol and consequently the precipitation of thymol that will obviously affect the coloration reading this can also explain the apparent saturation effect in the experiment using 0 06 m of thymol better fit of a polynomial curve for the dark dots therefore 0 12m of thymol was the concentration retained for the field based tests 3 2 calibration curves standardization of images can be done using the red and the green channel of images after splitting color channels the protocol presented here shows a linear relation between ammonium concentration of pore waters and gray intensity for the red channel within the range 0 500 μm r2 0 9964 fig 5 a and within 0 3000 μm for the green channel r2 0 9943 fig 5a and b the blue channel gray intensity shows almost no relation with ammonium concentration and will not be considered thereafter the red channel is the most sensitive channel as it covers the wavelengths corresponding to the absorption peak of the green colored indophenol compound formed by the reaction this result enhances the range of use of the method indeed users can calibrate their 2d det probes with ammonium concentrations ranged between 0 and 500 μm using the red channel with a precision of about 25 μm using a linear regression model 95 percent of confidence and a detection limit of 17 μm ammonium corresponding to three times the blank of the standard curve the same channel can be used in a broader range by applying a polynomial relationship fig 5a indicates that up to 2000 μm a quadratic polynomial is acceptable r2 0 9998 precision of about 100 μm within the range 1000 2000 μm however if the 2d det probe shows results beyond that range users can switch to the green channel that shows a linear relationship with ammonium concentration up to 3000 μm despite a drop of precision about 250 μm the linearity of the relation allows the user to transform over ranged reflectance data into concentration 3 3 reproducibility of standardization several standard calibration curves were performed with the optimized protocol to assess the reproducibility of the method the slopes and intercepts of the different standard calibration curves showed variations of 12 and 17 respectively n 6 for a series of experiments performed in a 3 months period the variation at the intercept is attributed to the dilution of the nitroprusside for which broad reflectance spectrum covers the red channel used for ammonium quantification the slope variation may be due to the sum of variability in dilution of each reagent that occurs in the chain of reactions until the blue dye is formed another set of experiments realized one year after showed sensitivity 60 higher probably due to a different stock of reagents to bypass such difficulties it is recommended to prepare a fresh batch in a sufficient amount of reagents that can be used for standard and probe gels for the same session of analysis and to limit time between standardization and probe analysis because of the volatility of different reagents such as hypochlorite or methanol 3 4 kinetics vs lateral diffusion calibration curves established from gel at equilibrium with standard solutions discussed in the previous section also served to establish the colorimetric reaction kinetics between the calibration gel and both reagent gels after assemblage of the three gels a scan was realized every 5 mn in order to measure the increase of the intensity of the green color after 15 min no significant change was observed in the gray intensity for the red channel data not shown meaning that 20 min is a reasonable time to get a full reaction between ammonium and colorimetric reagents the sequence of scans also showed that lateral diffusion was also not observable indicating that the green dye has a diffusion coefficient sufficiently low compared to its reaction kinetics to impeach lateral diffusion to affect significantly ammonium distribution during processing this feature was already observed for nitrite iron and phosphorus cesbron et al 2014 metzger et al 2016 however it was also demonstrated that during deployment in the sediment a loss of fidelity of pore water distribution within microenvironments was possible meaning that the researcher must be cautious while interpreting sharp gradients at high spatial resolution we suggest that 1 mm represents the highest resolution at which chemical gradients can be reliably interpreted harper et al 1997 metzger et al 2016 3 5 in situ validation of the method in order to validate the method the 2d det probe was deployed in bourgneuf bay and compared with pore water profiling using slicing centrifugation sampling and classical spectrophotometric analysis fig 6 the image obtained after scanning has a green yellowish color corresponding to the reagent gel that turns more or less green according to the concentration in ammonium the 2d distribution of ammonium after calibration of the scan shows ammonium concentrations below the limit of detection 17 μm of the method in the overlying water and in the first two centimeters of sediment fig 6b then the ammonium content increases to reach maximum concentrations between 370 and 450 μm ammonium at the bottom of the image 12 cm depth the vertical ammonium profile calculated using the 2d det probe mean concentration of each line of pixels shows a profile in the same order of magnitude than the ammonium profiles obtained using conventional sediment pore waters analysis e g gieskes et al 1991 metzger et al 2007 of marine sediment cores sampled in bourgneuf bay fig 6c the differences in ammonium concentration in cores compared to the 2d det probe and between cores can be explained by the heterogeneity of mudflat systems at a metric to decametric scale this heterogeneity was recently demonstrated with microphytobenthic biomass in bourgneuf bay using satellite imagery echappé et al 2018 another explanation of a higher content in pore waters after extraction i e cores as mentioned in the introduction is the lysis of cells from bacteria algae or foraminifera that store ammonium for their physiological needs during centrifugation that may lead to an over estimation of ammonium mudroch and macknight 1994 nevertheless the results from cores validate the 2d det gel probe technique differences between the four profiles are about 50 while standard deviation along a pixel line within the gel is about 10 suggesting lower heterogeneity at the decimetric scale for ammonium 3 6 early diagenetic context and ammonium behavior to include into a biogeochemical context our ammonium results we present complementary pore water data from the sediment cores in the study site oxygen penetration depth was 1 9 0 3 mm 18 profiles were performed in darkness with clark type electrodes from unisense data not shown fig 7 shows the results for dissolved fe mn p si so4 2 and alkalinity the left panel dissolved fe and mn clearly shows a remobilization zone for manganese at 1 cm depth while iron shows a remobilization zone at 3 cm depth this is a common feature in coastal sediments and is coherent to the thermodynamic ladder of electron acceptors used during bacterial mineralization processes froelich et al 1979 bethke et al 2011 yücel 2013 however it can be noted that the pore water concentrations of manganese and iron reach high concentrations about 650 μmol l 1 and 1200 μmol l 1 for manganese and iron respectively such high concentrations suggest a high pool of reactive oxides in an environment rich in organic matter this may explain the absence of ammonium in the top 2 cm suggesting an efficient anoxic oxidation of ammonium in the upper sediment by mn oxides luther et al 1997 or by nitrate dalsgaard and thamdrup 2002 the dissolved si profile central panel of fig 7 shows a remobilization of silica that can be attributed to the dissolution of diatom frustules during early diagenesis tréguer and rocha 2013 one can observe the variations of silica gradients suggesting different zones of remobilization a first remobilization zone is observed within the first centimeter of sediment that would represent the layer of fast recycling of silica where diatoms have their highest biomass in the la coupelasse intertidal mudflat the microphytobenthic biomass is concentrated in the first 2 mm of sediment with a peak around 500 μm according to light exposure and tide méléder et al 2005 a second remobilization zone below the iron remobilization one would correspond to a slower loop of nutrient recycling in the anoxic sediment the fast recycling loop observed suggested for silica also contribute to keep pore water ammonium and phosphorus content in the first centimeter of sediment below quantification limit 15 μm the increase of alkalinity concomitant to the decrease of sulfate suggest the occurrence of sulfate reduction below the iron remobilization zone berner et al 1970 metzger et al 2007 this may be confirmed by the uptake of iron in the lower part of the profile while manganese seems to be buffered by thermodynamic equilibrium of carbonate phases burdige 1993 2006 mucci et al 2000 this ongoing process below the sampled layer of sediment may be an additional source of ammonium explaining the high ammonium concentrations observed at the bottom of the 2d det probe and sediment core profiles the variability between the 3 cores obtained from the calculation of the standard deviation decreases from fe rsd 46 55 to p rsd 38 16 to mn rsd 13 10 to si rsd 8 5 to so4 2 rsd 2 1 to alkalinity rsd 1 1 which confirms the little lateral heterogeneity at a decametric scale with the exception of fe and p paradoxically decametric heterogeneity for dissolved iron is probably driven by lateral heterogeneity at the decimetric scale previous studies showed that after a bioirrigation event the diffusive homogenization of iron is partially inhibited by the fast precipitation of iron oxides which maintain the heterogeneity thibault de chanvalon et al 2017 the fact that heterogeneity increases with depth for dissolved phosphorus suggests a buffering by adsorption on fe oxides in the top 2 cm anschutz et al 1998 thibault de chanvalon et al 2016 below iron is remobilized and the heterogeneity of p increases precisely because of fe heterogeneity 4 conclusions the 2d det ammonium probe is a good alternative to the current ammonia pore water profiling i e subsampling centrifugation analysis that is sample and time consuming when performed at a millimeter vertical resolution in addition the technique allows 2d imaging for documenting lateral heterogeneities at a scale compatible to diatom biofilm patchiness polychaetes burrowing or aquatic plants root development either in marine and freshwater systems at the condition these features stand over deployment time about 5 h the wide range of concentration 15 3000 μm covered by the present protocol provides a well adapted technique to describe chemical gradients in very rich systems such as dam sediments sewage effluents finally the present technique enriches the range of 2d det methods to describe the fate of most of major chemical species related

20016,this study presents a new gel based technique to describe the pore water ammonium distribution through the sediment water interface in two dimensions at a millimeter scale the technique is an adaptation of the classical colorimetric method based on the berthelot s reaction after the thin film of the gel probe was equilibrated by diffusion either in standard solutions or in pore waters a colorimetric reagent gel was set on the gel probe allowing development of the characteristic green color a flatbed scanner and subsequent densitometry image analysis allowed to determine the concentration distribution of ammonium the gel probe was tested in the laboratory for two media deionized water and seawater within the range 0 3000 μm in nh4 detection limit is about 20 μm and accuracy about 25 μm the field validation was realized in a tidal mudflat of the french atlantic coast by comparison with conventional pore water extraction and colorimetric analysis the large range of concentrations and its applicability in continental and marine sediments suggest a wide range of applications of the technique for a reasonable cost graphical abstract image 1 keywords biogeochemistry high resolution porewater det densitometry 1 introduction in benthic coastal ecosystems ammonium is the most abundant nitrogenous form and is used preferentially in autotrophic reactions rather than nitrite and nitrate horrigan and mccarthy 1982 ivančič and degobbis 1984 then ammonium is recycled by micro and microbenthic fauna during remineralization of organic matter regnault 1987 including shorebirds jauffrais et al 2015 and tends to accumulate in the anoxic layer of sediments herbert 1999 therefore its availability to microalgae and macrophytes depends on its upward flux to the photic layer of the sediment welker et al 2002 ammonium is involved in several redox reactions such as reduction of manganese oxide anammox or nitrification influencing other biogeochemical cycles luther et al 1997 anschutz et al 2000 dalsgaard and thamdrup 2002 deflandre et al 2002 physical transport such as advection tidal pumping and bioirrigation may generate important spatial heterogeneity within the sediment santos et al 2012 as a consequence the rapid transfer of superficial water into the sediment may affect ammonium distribution at the scale of burrows enhancing for instance nitrification welsh and castadelli 2004 at a millimeter scale ammonium heterogeneity has never been documented in sediment pore waters whereas it is documented for other nutrients such as phosphorus pagès et al 2011 cesbron et al 2014 ding et al 2016 and nitrite and nitrate metzger et al 2016 see santner et al 2015 for an extensive review of pore water imaging techniques since ammonium is a nitrogen species playing a major role in primary and secondary early diagenetic reactions achieving its 2d distribution at high spatial resolution combined with other imaging techniques will help understanding nutrients and metal remobilization dynamics in coastal habitats furthermore it will improve our knowledge at fine scale of such habitats often exposed to anthropogenic pressure especially in a context of climate change and oxygen depleted zones spreading diaz and rosenberg 2009 several analytical techniques exist to measure ammonium concentration in aquatic environments among them a well known colorimetric method is the berthelot reaction berthelot 1859 this method is based on the reaction between ammonia a phenol and sodium hypochlorite in an alkaline solution that creates a blue complex wavelength of maximum absorbance of 690 nm color intensity corresponds to the sum of ammonium and ammonia concentrations in the sample through time this method was improved and adapted to different natural environments riley 1953 harwood and kühn 1970 patton and crouch 1977 ivančič and degobbis 1984 another photometric technique is based on fluorescence properties of ammonium in a solution this method allows detection of very low concentration about 100 nm however the kinetics of the reaction is very slow about 3 h and the reagent is highly photosensitive holmes et al 1999 to avoid fluorometric measurement limitations ammonium can also be measured by flow injection analysis kérouel and aminot 1997 holmes et al 1999 detection by selective electrode garside et al 1978 and by cathodic stripping voltammetry harbin and van den berg 1993 also exist but demand a large volume of sample several ml all these techniques need an initial separation of pore waters from sediments by squeezing or centrifugation of core slices the pore water characterization is a difficult task at high spatial resolution i e below few mm with these sampling methods as they are limited by the pore water volumes collected during extraction furthermore this resolution is insufficient to describe numerous biogeochemical processes occurring at millimeter scale that are typical of highly productive coastal environments in addition current methods show numerous disadvantages associated with the extraction procedure such as cellular lysis of living organisms during centrifugation that might give inaccurate measurements mudroch and macknight 1994 the development of in situ microelectrodes during the 80s allowed to measure at high resolution the ammonium concentration de beer and sweerts 1989 but its use to study lateral variability remains time consuming reducing its spatial relevance in addition the technique is sensitive to alkaline ions and is not applicable in marine waters planar optodes were also developed to characterize the ammonium turnover around roots strömberg 2008 but their applicability in situ remain limited due to their cost and complexity for all these reasons we developed an inexpensive and easy to use 2d det colorimetric technique for in situ ammonium analysis as an alternative to current analytical techniques this technique is based on the diffusion between pore waters and a hydrogel layer that contains 95 98 water according to its composition polyacrylamide or agarose respectively the main challenge with 2d det colorimetric techniques is to find the best compromise between reaction kinetics reagents concentration and diffusion in order to limit lateral diffusion causing relaxation of potential microenvironments cesbron et al 2014 jézéquel et al 2007 metzger et al 2016 this method has already been developed successfully for iron phosphates alkalinity and more recently for nitrite and nitrate see references above and is now adapted for the first time to ammonium this new method was then validated by comparison with current analytical methods for pore waters analysis of sediment cores 2 material and methods 2 1 colorimetric principle the first step of the reaction consists to raise the solution ph up to 11 with sodium hydroxide to convert ammonium into ammonia that reacts with sodium hypochlorite to form monochloramine then monochloramine reacts with a phenolic compound to form a blue dye 2 2 diisopropyl 5 5 dimethyl indophenol blue that absorbs light at 690 nm a phenol commonly used is thymol it can be replaced by sodium salicylate a less toxic searle 1984 but less sensitive compound krom 1980 sodium nitroprusside is added to catalyze this reaction in marine environments the high concentrations of calcium and magnesium about 10 and 53 mm respectively millero et al 2008 interfere in the reaction riley 1953 these alkali earth elements precipitate with carbonate when the solution ph is raised with sodium hydroxide to prevent precipitation chelating agents such as cdta cyclohexyl trans 1 2 diaminetetraacetid acid roskam and de langen 1964 or sodium citrate are used to complex magnesium and calcium however sodium citrate is photosensitive bower and holm hansen 1980 we thus replaced it by etidronic acid another chelating agent used in the merck ammonium kit 2 2 gel probe preparation and deployment the preparation of the 2d det probe and its colorimetric analysis is adapted from jézéquel et al 2007 the probe is a polycarbonate plate 250 mm high 150 mm width and 2 mm thick with a central depression 180 mm long 92 mm wide 1 mm thick this depression holds an agarose hydrogel that is covered by a pvdf porous membrane 0 2 μm durapore which is affixed with a pvc tape the gel layer is prepared with 1 5 g of pure agarose sigma aldrich cas 9012 36 6 dissolved in 100 ml of milliq water at 80 c to have a homogeneous gel thickness the heated agarose solution is quickly poured vertically between 2 polycarbonate plates separated by a u frame of 1 mm thickness the whole setting is then chilled in a fridge for few minutes to accelerate the gelation the probe is rinsed and stored with in milliq water until use unlike other 2d det gel probes made for iron alkalinity phosphorus or nitrate and nitrite analysis the use of polyacrylamide is prohibited because preliminary tests have shown that polyacrylamide reacts with the ammonium reagent probably because of its amide groups polyacrylamide gels are usually preferred to agarose despite their toxicity and additional preparation steps due to their softness and strength that make it handier to use than agarose gels however the 1 mm thickness used for the probe preparations is sufficient to have a robust and easy to use agarose gel despite its large dimensions to avoid oxygen contamination during probes deployment within the sediment the probes are deoxygenated by nitrogen bubbling in milliq water overnight before deployment the probes are then inserted in the sediment at two thirds of their total length and kept until chemical equilibrium with pore waters 2 3 calibration and reagent gel preparation ammonium standard solutions were prepared by dissolution of no3nh4 salt fluka cas 6484 52 2 in a solution of adequate ionic strength seven standard solutions from 0 μm to 500 μm or 3000 μm according to the test were placed in contact to a 1 mm thick agarose gel for 1 h see details in cesbron et al 2014 and further processed as a probe gel the color development of the in situ gel is achieved using two agarose gels equilibrated in reagent solutions for at least 30 min indeed unlike previous methods that use one single reagent gel jézéquel et al 2007 pagès et al 2011 bennett et al 2015 metzger et al 2016 two reagent gels are required for the reaction because reagents are not stable when mixed all at once the first colorimetric reagent solution contains 0 65 m sodium hydroxide sigma aldrich cas 1310 73 2 0 012 m sodium hypochlorite sigma aldrich cas 7681 52 9 and 0 12 m etidronic acid sigma aldrich cas 2809 21 4 in deionized water millipore milli q system the second coloring reagent solution contains 0 027 m sodium nitroprusside fluka cas 13755 38 9 and 0 12 m thymol sigma aldrich cas 89 83 8 in deionized water the latter reagent has to be prepared in two steps because thymol needs a non aqueous solvent to be incorporated to the final reagent solution here methanol 5 thymol in methanol reagent gels are exposed to 50 ml of their respective reagent solution in a plastic bag and gently mixed for at least 30 min for equilibration it is recommended to keep the bag on a stirring table to facilitate homogenization 2 4 gel assemblage and colorimetric reaction after equilibration reagent gels are removed from their respective bags and quickly drained before being laid down onto white plates after having wiped the drops of residual reactive solution the probe gel i e the one deployed in the field is laid onto the first reagent gel the second reagent gel is immediately placed on the assembled gels the three layer gel assemblage is then covered by a clean cellulose acetate film to avoid evaporation gradually the typical color of the indophenol blue develops associated with the yellow nitroprusside in alkaline medium it gives a green final color finally after 20 min of reaction at room temperature 20 c the three layer gel assemblage is scanned to acquire the 2d ammonium distribution in the sediment pore waters 2 5 2d imagery methods to obtain the ammonium distribution a simple commercial flatbed scanner canon canoscan lide 152 600f was used from scanned images intensity of coloration of the 2d probe was processed with imagej software schneider et al 2012 images were at first stripped from their edges 5 mm in order to avoid any edge effect and then decomposed into primary color intensities red green and blue at about 140 nm wavelength resolution each being converted to a gray scale image the red color intensity was found to give the most sensitive response since the dye formed is blue as this channel can saturate with high ammonium concentration the less sensitive green channel can also be used see results and discussion section a region of interest roi is selected for each zone of the standard gel corresponding to a circle of about 15 mm in diameter i e 30 000 pixels with the selected resolution this circle was the zone of equilibration of the gel with the standard solution 2 6 optimization tests the principle of the 2d det methods developed to date jézéquel et al 2007 robertson et al 2008 pagès et al 2011 cesbron et al 2014 bennett et al 2015 metzger et al 2016 is to adapt preexisting colorimetric reaction for solutions to the hydrogel 2d samples by superimposing one or two reagent gels over a sample gel that was previously equilibrated in the sediment the colorimetric method that was considered as a reference method to be adapted for the 2d determination was the colorimetric test from merck spectroquant which is derived from harwood and kühn 1970 the main difference between both protocols resides in the use of etidronic acid in our method to prevent interferences from alkali earth elements by chelation briefly in the harwood and kühn 1970 method a volume of sample reacts with a series of reagents that are concentrated to ensure excess for all reagents in our case the protocol combining gel layers induced a dilution of a factor three case of two reagent gels leading to possible changes in sensitivity and importance of interferences therefore optimization of reagent concentrations is necessary this testing was performed in two steps a first phase in spectrophotometric cuvettes in order to limit volume of chemicals and a second phase in gels by narrowing ranges found in the first stage the transposition from solutions to gels is not automatic since cross diffusion processes may affect locally kinetics and order of reactions in the case of a series of reactions to reach the colored indophenol dye these processes may induce precipitate formations that also affect analytical performance in the following sub sections we explore the concentration of the catalyst in the kinetics of the development of the indophenol dye secondly the importance of the chelating agent when working in seawater and then the amount of thymol in both a solution and a gel assemblage 2 7 field validation this technique was applied in the intertidal mudflat of bourgneuf bay the bay is located south of the loire estuary on the french atlantic coast fig 1 and is characterized by a presence of wild oyster reefs echappé et al 2018 and oyster and mussel farming areas the field validation consisted to deploy a 2d det probe near an observation site 47 00 56 9 n 2 02 27 6 w where sediment geochemistry was documented on a monthly basis the survey consisted of sampling three cores of 10 cm in diameter at each vertex of an equilateral triangle of 10 m fig 1 right panel sampling was carried out in june 2016 at low tide salinity was 33 and the temperature of the sediment was 18 c the 2d det probe was deployed for three hours within the sediment for equilibration between the gel and pore waters then the probe was carefully collected with its surrounding sediment that represents a slab of 3 cm of thickness using a jaw device thibault de chanvalon et al 2015 and transported to the laboratory to reach an equilibration time of 5 h in total the jaw device was then opened and the 2d det probe processed immediately the sediment cores were kept at in situ temperature until processing the next day 2 8 core processing and pore water analyses the cores were sliced under nitrogen atmosphere every 2 mm to a depth of 2 cm then every 5 mm to a depth of 5 cm and finally every centimeter to 11 cm depth sediment slices were immediately centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered using a 0 2 μm filter rc25 sartorius one aliquot was frozen for colorimetric analysis ammonium nitrite and nitrate a second one was acidified and diluted for total fe mn p si and s analysis and a third aliquot was used for immediate analysis of alkalinity ammonium was analyzed using a phenol hypochlorite method harwood and kühn 1970 with etidronic acid as chelating agent to prevent magnesium and calcium precipitation alkalinity was measured using the colorimetric bromophenol blue formic acid method sarazin et al 1999 all spectrophotometric analyses were performed using a genesys 20 from thermo fischer fe mn p si and s measurements were performed after a 50 fold dilution with a 1 ultrapure nitric acid with an icp oes icap 6300 thermo fischer analyzed elemental sulfur was interpreted as sulfate since sulfide is volatile and was removed from the sample solution under acidic conditions pore water samples were acidified at ph below 1 for storage before icp oes analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization tests 3 1 1 influence of nitroprusside content in the reagent a series of standard curves were realized using different sodium nitroprusside concentrations within a range from 0 025 to 0 056 m nitroprusside being a catalyst for the formation of the monochloramine thymol intermediate compound n chloro 2 isopropyl 5 methyl quinone monoimine the absorbance was measured at different times between 10 and 20 min and at different concentrations of ammonium between 15 and 1000 μm results did not show any variability within the range of nitroprusside concentrations this test did not show any effect of time either it suggests that a concentration of 0 025 m of sodium nitroprusside is concentrated enough to observe the complete formation of the indophenol blue in 10 min within a range of ammonium concentrations from 30 to 1000 μm at 15 μm of ammonium results were comparable to blanks for the final protocol a concentration of 0 025 m of sodium nitroprusside was retained for the reagent when moving to the gel the time retained for analysis after contact between gel probe and reagent gel was 20 min in order to allow diffusion and colorimetric reaction between gels 3 1 2 importance of etidronic acid two calibration curves for ammonium were carried out in spectrophotometric cuvettes fig 2 the two calibrations differed by the use or not of etidronic acid as a chelating agent to complex alkali earth elements that are susceptible to precipitate when sodium hydroxide is added rising ph over 13 without etidronic acid one can observe the rise of the intercept by a factor three a slight diminution of the slope about 10 furthermore the presence of precipitates in current analytical method for ammonium is less dramatic as particles may settle in the cuvette below the path of the beam light however in the case of a gel thin films the precipitates cannot be removed as the color of the surface is measured i e reflectance the presence of precipitates can have dramatic consequences at the pixel scale 3 1 3 influence of thymol concentration six calibration curves were performed in cuvettes to assess the optimal thymol concentration 0 012 m 0 018 m 0 03 m 0 06 m 0 09 m 0 12 m fig 3 all curves follow a linear pattern with similar slopes 0 0039 0 002 and r2 above 0 992 these results suggest that even at the lowest concentration there is enough thymol to react with the monochloramin within the range of 0 500 μm ammonium a simplified version of the previous test was performed on gel layers only two concentrations of thymol were tested 0 06 and 0 12 m fig 4 with a thymol concentration of 0 06 m grey squares the calibration curve shows a slope of 0 106 and r2 0 94 up to 260 μm of ammonium whereas using 0 12 m thymol dark diamonds the slope is 0 076 and r2 0 991 despite a rather lower slope the experiment using a higher amount of thymol shows a better linearity and a lower dispersion the linear correlation seems not to fit well with data indicating a probable saturation of the reagent with the lower concentration of thymol these results highlight the difficulty to transfer colorimetric techniques in cuvettes to gel layers the hydrophobic property of thymol probably explains the necessity to increase the amount of thymol in the reagent for gel layer protocol the high volatility of methanol the solvent of thymol may also affect the colorimetric reaction the high surface volume ratio enhances the evaporation of methanol and consequently the precipitation of thymol that will obviously affect the coloration reading this can also explain the apparent saturation effect in the experiment using 0 06 m of thymol better fit of a polynomial curve for the dark dots therefore 0 12m of thymol was the concentration retained for the field based tests 3 2 calibration curves standardization of images can be done using the red and the green channel of images after splitting color channels the protocol presented here shows a linear relation between ammonium concentration of pore waters and gray intensity for the red channel within the range 0 500 μm r2 0 9964 fig 5 a and within 0 3000 μm for the green channel r2 0 9943 fig 5a and b the blue channel gray intensity shows almost no relation with ammonium concentration and will not be considered thereafter the red channel is the most sensitive channel as it covers the wavelengths corresponding to the absorption peak of the green colored indophenol compound formed by the reaction this result enhances the range of use of the method indeed users can calibrate their 2d det probes with ammonium concentrations ranged between 0 and 500 μm using the red channel with a precision of about 25 μm using a linear regression model 95 percent of confidence and a detection limit of 17 μm ammonium corresponding to three times the blank of the standard curve the same channel can be used in a broader range by applying a polynomial relationship fig 5a indicates that up to 2000 μm a quadratic polynomial is acceptable r2 0 9998 precision of about 100 μm within the range 1000 2000 μm however if the 2d det probe shows results beyond that range users can switch to the green channel that shows a linear relationship with ammonium concentration up to 3000 μm despite a drop of precision about 250 μm the linearity of the relation allows the user to transform over ranged reflectance data into concentration 3 3 reproducibility of standardization several standard calibration curves were performed with the optimized protocol to assess the reproducibility of the method the slopes and intercepts of the different standard calibration curves showed variations of 12 and 17 respectively n 6 for a series of experiments performed in a 3 months period the variation at the intercept is attributed to the dilution of the nitroprusside for which broad reflectance spectrum covers the red channel used for ammonium quantification the slope variation may be due to the sum of variability in dilution of each reagent that occurs in the chain of reactions until the blue dye is formed another set of experiments realized one year after showed sensitivity 60 higher probably due to a different stock of reagents to bypass such difficulties it is recommended to prepare a fresh batch in a sufficient amount of reagents that can be used for standard and probe gels for the same session of analysis and to limit time between standardization and probe analysis because of the volatility of different reagents such as hypochlorite or methanol 3 4 kinetics vs lateral diffusion calibration curves established from gel at equilibrium with standard solutions discussed in the previous section also served to establish the colorimetric reaction kinetics between the calibration gel and both reagent gels after assemblage of the three gels a scan was realized every 5 mn in order to measure the increase of the intensity of the green color after 15 min no significant change was observed in the gray intensity for the red channel data not shown meaning that 20 min is a reasonable time to get a full reaction between ammonium and colorimetric reagents the sequence of scans also showed that lateral diffusion was also not observable indicating that the green dye has a diffusion coefficient sufficiently low compared to its reaction kinetics to impeach lateral diffusion to affect significantly ammonium distribution during processing this feature was already observed for nitrite iron and phosphorus cesbron et al 2014 metzger et al 2016 however it was also demonstrated that during deployment in the sediment a loss of fidelity of pore water distribution within microenvironments was possible meaning that the researcher must be cautious while interpreting sharp gradients at high spatial resolution we suggest that 1 mm represents the highest resolution at which chemical gradients can be reliably interpreted harper et al 1997 metzger et al 2016 3 5 in situ validation of the method in order to validate the method the 2d det probe was deployed in bourgneuf bay and compared with pore water profiling using slicing centrifugation sampling and classical spectrophotometric analysis fig 6 the image obtained after scanning has a green yellowish color corresponding to the reagent gel that turns more or less green according to the concentration in ammonium the 2d distribution of ammonium after calibration of the scan shows ammonium concentrations below the limit of detection 17 μm of the method in the overlying water and in the first two centimeters of sediment fig 6b then the ammonium content increases to reach maximum concentrations between 370 and 450 μm ammonium at the bottom of the image 12 cm depth the vertical ammonium profile calculated using the 2d det probe mean concentration of each line of pixels shows a profile in the same order of magnitude than the ammonium profiles obtained using conventional sediment pore waters analysis e g gieskes et al 1991 metzger et al 2007 of marine sediment cores sampled in bourgneuf bay fig 6c the differences in ammonium concentration in cores compared to the 2d det probe and between cores can be explained by the heterogeneity of mudflat systems at a metric to decametric scale this heterogeneity was recently demonstrated with microphytobenthic biomass in bourgneuf bay using satellite imagery echappé et al 2018 another explanation of a higher content in pore waters after extraction i e cores as mentioned in the introduction is the lysis of cells from bacteria algae or foraminifera that store ammonium for their physiological needs during centrifugation that may lead to an over estimation of ammonium mudroch and macknight 1994 nevertheless the results from cores validate the 2d det gel probe technique differences between the four profiles are about 50 while standard deviation along a pixel line within the gel is about 10 suggesting lower heterogeneity at the decimetric scale for ammonium 3 6 early diagenetic context and ammonium behavior to include into a biogeochemical context our ammonium results we present complementary pore water data from the sediment cores in the study site oxygen penetration depth was 1 9 0 3 mm 18 profiles were performed in darkness with clark type electrodes from unisense data not shown fig 7 shows the results for dissolved fe mn p si so4 2 and alkalinity the left panel dissolved fe and mn clearly shows a remobilization zone for manganese at 1 cm depth while iron shows a remobilization zone at 3 cm depth this is a common feature in coastal sediments and is coherent to the thermodynamic ladder of electron acceptors used during bacterial mineralization processes froelich et al 1979 bethke et al 2011 yücel 2013 however it can be noted that the pore water concentrations of manganese and iron reach high concentrations about 650 μmol l 1 and 1200 μmol l 1 for manganese and iron respectively such high concentrations suggest a high pool of reactive oxides in an environment rich in organic matter this may explain the absence of ammonium in the top 2 cm suggesting an efficient anoxic oxidation of ammonium in the upper sediment by mn oxides luther et al 1997 or by nitrate dalsgaard and thamdrup 2002 the dissolved si profile central panel of fig 7 shows a remobilization of silica that can be attributed to the dissolution of diatom frustules during early diagenesis tréguer and rocha 2013 one can observe the variations of silica gradients suggesting different zones of remobilization a first remobilization zone is observed within the first centimeter of sediment that would represent the layer of fast recycling of silica where diatoms have their highest biomass in the la coupelasse intertidal mudflat the microphytobenthic biomass is concentrated in the first 2 mm of sediment with a peak around 500 μm according to light exposure and tide méléder et al 2005 a second remobilization zone below the iron remobilization one would correspond to a slower loop of nutrient recycling in the anoxic sediment the fast recycling loop observed suggested for silica also contribute to keep pore water ammonium and phosphorus content in the first centimeter of sediment below quantification limit 15 μm the increase of alkalinity concomitant to the decrease of sulfate suggest the occurrence of sulfate reduction below the iron remobilization zone berner et al 1970 metzger et al 2007 this may be confirmed by the uptake of iron in the lower part of the profile while manganese seems to be buffered by thermodynamic equilibrium of carbonate phases burdige 1993 2006 mucci et al 2000 this ongoing process below the sampled layer of sediment may be an additional source of ammonium explaining the high ammonium concentrations observed at the bottom of the 2d det probe and sediment core profiles the variability between the 3 cores obtained from the calculation of the standard deviation decreases from fe rsd 46 55 to p rsd 38 16 to mn rsd 13 10 to si rsd 8 5 to so4 2 rsd 2 1 to alkalinity rsd 1 1 which confirms the little lateral heterogeneity at a decametric scale with the exception of fe and p paradoxically decametric heterogeneity for dissolved iron is probably driven by lateral heterogeneity at the decimetric scale previous studies showed that after a bioirrigation event the diffusive homogenization of iron is partially inhibited by the fast precipitation of iron oxides which maintain the heterogeneity thibault de chanvalon et al 2017 the fact that heterogeneity increases with depth for dissolved phosphorus suggests a buffering by adsorption on fe oxides in the top 2 cm anschutz et al 1998 thibault de chanvalon et al 2016 below iron is remobilized and the heterogeneity of p increases precisely because of fe heterogeneity 4 conclusions the 2d det ammonium probe is a good alternative to the current ammonia pore water profiling i e subsampling centrifugation analysis that is sample and time consuming when performed at a millimeter vertical resolution in addition the technique allows 2d imaging for documenting lateral heterogeneities at a scale compatible to diatom biofilm patchiness polychaetes burrowing or aquatic plants root development either in marine and freshwater systems at the condition these features stand over deployment time about 5 h the wide range of concentration 15 3000 μm covered by the present protocol provides a well adapted technique to describe chemical

20017,innovative solutions are necessary to enable the decentralized recycling of greywater for applications requiring high quality water such as hand washing while physical barriers such as ultrafiltration membranes effectively prevent the passage of bacteria and chemical and biological treatments can effectively reduce the carbon content of the treated water there exists a knowledge gap regarding the application of anti bacterial strategies to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria following treatment in this study the effluent water from a household scale greywater treatment system was fed to seven parallel experimental post treatment tanks three receiving direct chlorination with free chlorine residuals of 0 2 1 or 5 mg cl2 l three with chlorine produced through electrolysis at the same residual concentrations and one control with no chlorine added for increasing concentrations of direct chlorination the median total cell count tcc values were 9 104 2 9 104 and 1 8 103 cells ml respectively electrolysis treatment produced very similar tcc concentrations 8 8 104 1 1 104 and 2 3 103 cells ml the tcc concentrations were lower than the concentration of the water entering each tank 3 105 cells ml intact cell count icc measurements indicated that the viable cell concentrations were less than 10 of the tcc values though electrolysis treatment can produce powerful oxidants such as hydroxyl radical there was no evidence that electrolysis in this system provided additional benefits beyond chlorine production for control of total or intact cell counts oxidation of bacteria by chlorine was the dominant anti bacterial mechanism in our system monitoring of dissolved organic carbon doc and assimilable organic carbon aoc did not suggest that carbon limitation significantly impacted cell counts when chlorination or electrolysis treatment was applied this work demonstrates that either direct chlorination or electrolysis treatment are able to reduce bacteria concentrations over long term operation of a hand washing water treatment system we recommend selecting chlorine residual targets such that a chlorine residual is maintained during periods of challenging operating conditions we observed that a target residual of 1 mg cl2 l in our system maintained the tcc below the concentration found in zürich drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords greywater regrowth decentralized assimilable organic carbon aoc biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi hydroxyl radical 1 introduction the sustainable development goals sdgs target 6 2 calls for access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030 un 2015 yet substantial progress is needed to meet this goal an estimated 47 of the population in the least developed countries lacked access to any hand washing facilities and a further 27 had access to hand washing facilities without soap or water who and unicef 2017 the sdgs promote hand washing in part because of the potential impacts on human health washing hands with soap could reduce the risk of diarrheal diseases by 42 47 curtis and cairncross 2003 enabling hand washing by constructing centralized water treatment and distribution networks is not practical in many regions of the developing world due to high costs of installation and maintenance uncertainties linked to population growth and institutional instability larsen et al 2016 household scale systems that recycle hand washing water may offer a more practical solution to improve sanitation in these areas but only if these systems can be used safely many existing greywater treatment systems utilize a disinfection step to reduce bacteria concentration at the effluent the most common form of disinfection in greywater treatment is chlorination boyjoo et al 2013 but in no previous case has the treatment system been designed to provide hand washing quality water and the chlorination configured to meet this objective there exists a specific knowledge gap in our understanding of how to configure a modern greywater treatment system with an effective chlorine disinfection step to achieve a water quality sufficient for hand washing this study seeks to close this gap by quantifying the anti bacterial performance and identifying the mechanisms of anti bacterial activity in water produced by an effective greywater treatment system subject to different chlorination strategies this study utilizes a previously developed water treatment system known as a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi künzle et al 2015 our primary reasons for selecting the bambi system are i the simplicity small footprint and the low maintenance operation of the bambi make the system practical and affordable for lower income communities künzle et al 2015 ravndal et al 2015 ii long term testing has demonstrated stable operation and effective contaminant removal from synthetic hand washing water ziemba et al 2018 the core technology of the bambi is an ultrafiltration membrane submerged in a treatment tank aeration below the membrane promotes the development of a thick but permeable biofilm on the membrane surface künzle et al 2015 long term testing with a bambi fed a mixture of feces urine soap and water has demonstrated 95 removal of organic carbon künzle et al 2015 as well as stable nitrification and denitrification ravndal et al 2015 similar performance has been demonstrated treating a synthetic hand washing greywater ziemba et al 2018 bambi utilizes a gravity driven membrane gdm which requires no additional pressure to be applied to the feed side of the membrane beyond the weight of water the flux of water through the membrane is lower than would be observed in a conventional membrane bioreactor mbr however the biofilm that develops in the gdm system is self regulating and requires no fouling control during operation derlon et al 2012 peter varbanets et al 2010 the ultrafiltration membrane in the bambi presents a physical barrier to the passage of pathogens to the treated water testing in our laboratory has demonstrated removal of 7 log bacteria and 3 log ms 2 bacteriophage unpublished data a significant concern however is the growth of bacteria that may be able to enter into the water after the membrane while the water is stored until use pathogen growth testing has demonstrated that the permeate of a bambi system treating a wastewater similar in composition to greywater can still contain significant concentrations of assimilable organic carbon aoc dissolved organic carbon doc and other nutrients sufficient to support the growth of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa nguyen et al 2017 therefore some form of disinfection or post treatment is necessary to maintain the safety of the water nguyen et al 2017 free chlorine hocl is a strong oxidant which affects a cell in many ways including damaging membranes disrupting membrane functions and damaging dna batch testing with permeate water from a bambi system treating hand washing water mixed with flushing water from a source separating toilet demonstrated that a free chlorine concentration of 0 5 mg l could inactivate 5 log of spiked escherichia coli within 5 min of exposure nguyen et al 2017 march et al 2004 showed total inactivation of coliforms with a 1 mg l free chlorine concentration in greywater following treatment with a 0 3 mm filter and sedimentation tank the amount of free chlorine that needs to be added to a system to reach a target concentration must first overcome the chlorine demand which is the amount of added chlorine that will rapidly react with organics and other compounds such as ammonium and nitrite lazarova et al 1999 winward et al 2008 chlorine can either be added from a reservoir or produced using electrolysis electrolysis can also produce other reactive oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals with greater oxidation potential than chlorine parsons and williams 2004 which may more effectively inactivate bacteria by direct oxidation jeong et al 2006 or may more effectively oxidize organic materials in the water kraft 2007 martínez huitle et al 2015 which could otherwise be used as substrate by the bacteria aoc and doc therefore a treatment system utilizing electrolysis to produce a certain concentration of chlorine may result in lower bacteria concentrations than a system in which the same concentration of chlorine is added directly in the context of a decentralized system electrolysis may offer an opportunity to produce sufficient chlorine without requiring refilling of a chemical chlorine dosing reservoir the specific goals of this study were to i evaluate bacterial content in systems employing different dosages of direct chlorination and electrolysis treatment ii compare the anti bacterial mechanisms employed in each condition direct inactivation of bacteria direct growth inhibition or indirect growth inhibition by carbon limitation and iii recommend optimal post treatment solutions for systems treating hand washing water or similar water types such as rainwater or greywater from other sources understanding the performance and mechanisms for each post treatment as well as how this performance could be affected by challenging operating conditions were ultimately necessary to determine an optimal process configuration 2 materials and methods 2 1 system overview a bambi system fig 1 has been constructed using a 52 l plastic tank and standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl module newterra ontario canada with 3 m2 total surface area polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany aeration 20 l min was delivered with coarse bubbles 3 mm diameter introduced directly below the membrane module an interruption in the aeration was discovered on the 43rd day of operation in which the air supply had been unintentionally disconnected the aeration was resumed at this time but the duration of the outage is not known the only pressure driving water though the membrane was generated by the water head on the feeding side approximately 35 mbar on average the bambi was fed 75 l day of a synthetic greywater solution section 2 2 the daily feed was a combination of 1 part of refrigerated 4 c 20x concentrated solution 3 75 l day and 19 parts chlorine free tap water 71 25 l day this total daily volume of 75 l day was divided into 50 simulated hand washing events 1 5 l event spaced evenly throughout the day the permeate from this reactor was then pumped at 5 min intervals to a submerged granular activated carbon gac filter containing 8 l of norit 830 coal based gac with 1 1 3 mm grain size cabot boston ma usa for an average residence time of approximately 2 5 h the water from the gac tank was pumped constantly into 7 different post treatment tanks each with a volume of 10 l and a residence time of 1 day the gac tank and the post treatment tanks used overflows to maintain volume gac was included in this system to remove organics from the water through a combination of sorption and biological degradation the improvements in water quality produced by a bambi system following the addition of a gac filter have been documented previously for a wastewater similar in composition to our nutrient balanced hand washing water nguyen et al 2017 three post treatment tanks were dosed with different concentrations of chlorine and three with different dosages of electrolysis the seventh tank was a control that did not receive chlorine or electrolysis treatment feeding permeate removal and chlorine addition pumps electrolysis power and electrolysis polarity switching were activated and deactivated using process control hardware endress hauser ag reinach bl switzerland and automation softwares codesys 3s smart software solutions gmbh kempten germany and citectscada schneider electric rueil malmaison france electrolysis and chlorination controls are explained in section 2 3 2 2 synthetic hand washing water feeding the recipe for the synthetic feed was taken directly from and is described in great detail by ziemba et al 2018 table 1 presents the components added to this feed at their final 1x concentrations the 1x strength of feed represents the loading of soap and other materials introduced into the corresponding volume of water during hand washing the feed was prepared as a 20x concentrated version of the concentrations in table 1 and it was diluted to the 1x version as it was used the concentration of sodium chloride was increased in this 1x feed to provide a total chloride concentration of 100 mg l the reason for this increase in sodium chloride is because we expect that repeated recycling of the same water in our system will cause the salts in the water to become concentrated over time the concentration of chloride in the water may significantly impact the production of chlorine through electrolysis therefore we have elected to conduct our testing with a potentially more representative concentration of chloride 2 3 chlorination and electrolysis post treatments chlorine was dosed using peristaltic pumps from refrigerated working solutions 4 c of 125 400 and 1200 mg l cl2 aq for low 0 2 mg l medium 1 mg l and high 5 mg l final free available chlorine concentrations the chlorine working solutions were prepared in chilled 4 c de ionized di water with final ph adjusted to 11 using naoh every 15 min about 0 6 ml of working solution was dosed to each tank the average flow rate of chlorine solution was approximately 0 6 of the flow rate of water entering each post treatment tank water in control and chlorination tanks were mixed by constant recirculation pumping at a rate of 0 5 l min boron doped diamond bdd electrolysis flow cells were employed for electrolysis treatment with 85 cm2 surface area parallel plate electrodes and a 3 mm separation distance waterdiam delémont switzerland water was pumped from the post treatment tank passed through an electrolysis cell and then returned to the post treatment tank at a rate of 0 5 l min electrolysis was operated at 0 3 a and 6 v with continuous on off cycles of approximately 1 89 1 14 and 1 4 minutes on minutes off for low medium and high doses respectively the amperage was selected though trial and error such that the all target doses could be achieved with the same amperage without imposing too lengthy off times for the lowest dose unintended variation occurred in electrolysis dosing between days 47 and 57 of operation the degree of electrolysis dosage that occurred during this period is unknown proper control was resumed on day 57 and dosage rates were intentionally modified to better achieve the target chlorine concentrations in each tank data collected between not including days 47 and 57 for electrolysis treatment and all data from days 43 and 44 when an aeration interruption occurred in bambi were not included in statistical analysis monitoring of chlorine concentrations resulting from the direct chlorination and the electrolysis treatment suggested that stable dosages of electrolysis resulted in increasing free chlorine production over time the on off times were modified to return the free chlorine residual concentrations to the desired targets the dosing was reduced 6 7 for the medium dose and 33 for the high dose on day 57 the medium dose was reduced an additional 10 and the low dosage was increased 19 on day 61 the polarity of the current was reversed between each on off cycle recirculation pumps were operated continuously electrolysis cells were examined for fouling every 1 2 weeks during testing but no significant fouling was observed 2 4 chemical analysis doc was monitored using a toc doc

total cell counts tcc intact cell counts icc and aoc tcc in the post treatment tanks and tcc for aoc measurements were conducted using sybr green i stain thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa and a flow cytometer cytoflex bechman coulter brea california usa with 30 s reads on 30 μl samples intact cell counts icc were conducted as with tcc except propidium iodide pi was also added during incubation flow cytometry analysis was selected for bacterial quantification because of the simplicity and speed of processing high quantities of samples relative to sequencing or qpcr techniques the ability to quantify bacteria that are non culturable and not captured by heterotrophic plate count and the ability to differentially identify cells with intact cell membranes tcc from cells with damaged cell membranes icc hammes et al 2011 joux and lebaron 2000 flow cytometry has also been demonstrated to descriptively quantify changes in cell counts through drinking water treatment processes hammes et al 2008 the aoc measurement procedure was based on the procedure of hammes and egli 2005 which consisted of filtering 50 ml of sample through a 0 2 μm polyethersulfone filter pall port washington new york usa into a 60 ml glass vial adding 1 ml of a standard and diverse inoculum of environmental bacteria dividing into three 45 ml glass vials incubating for 3 days at 30 c without light measuring tcc and then calculating aoc using the equation 1 μg aoc 107 cells all glassware was muffled at 450 c for 12 h ptfe lined vial caps were used and filters were prewashed with 50 ml of di water inoculum was prepared by combining one part each 1 evian water évian les bains france 2 water treated by a bambi system fed the synthetic greywater described in this study 3 water treated by a bambi system fed a mixture of soap urine and feces and 4 water collected from the chriesbach stream in dübendorf switzerland bacteria from the bambi waters and the stream water were twice washed and re suspended in mineral buffer lechevallier et al 1993 by centrifugations for 10 min at 3500g after each centrifugation the supernatant was discarded and the cells were re suspended in the buffer the tcc of the finished inoculum was determined to be 100 cells ml the composition of the inoculum was modified from that of hammes and egli 2005 because aoc measurements rely on inoculating with bacteria that are best able to grow on the carbon within the sample natural inoculum are often used to measure aoc in natural waters because of the diversity and because the bacteria can be well adapted to the carbon and the background materials in the water in engineered systems including bacteria adapted to these environments may also improve the quality of aoc measurements 3 results 3 1 direct chlorination and electrolysis generally achieved free chlorine targets the target residual free chlorine concentrations in the low medium and high dose conditions were 0 2 1 and 5 mg cl2 l for chlorine dosed directly or produced through electrolysis in each case the free chlorine concentrations observed were generally close to the target concentrations for direct chlorination the median free chlorine concentrations were 0 21 0 95 and 4 8 mg cl2 l respectively for increasing dosages fig 2 a for electrolysis the median free chlorine concentrations were 0 21 1 5 and 5 2 mg cl2 l respectively for increasing dosages fig 2b with the electrolysis treatment there was a clear increase in the free chlorine concentrations over time for the first 47 days of operation in the tanks treated with medium and high dosages the free chlorine concentration in the post treatment tank with the highest electrolysis dosage increased over the first 47 days 0 4 mg cl2 l free chlorine per week the electrolysis modules were not controlled properly between the 47 and 57 operating days resulting in unintended variation in the electrolysis dosing during this period resulting in free chlorine concentrations ranging from below detection to 3 mg cl2 l in the low dose from 1 7 to 6 4 mg cl2 l in the medium dose and 2 4 6 9 mg cl2 l in the high dose starting on day 57 proper control was resumed and the on off times were modified to achieve the initial target chlorine concentrations for each dosage 3 2 increasing chlorine residual reduced tcc and icc the tcc includes all cells that can be identified by the flow cytometer tcc and icc results are presented in fig 2c and d individually in fig 3 and in supporting information tables s1 and s2 the median tcc for the control tank was 5 6 105 cells ml for increasing concentrations of direct chlorination the median tcc values were 9 0 104 2 8 104 and 1 6 103 cells ml respectively for increasing dosages of electrolysis treatment the median tcc values were 8 6 104 1 0 104 and 1 7 103 cells ml respectively direct chlorination and electrolysis treatments produced similar tcc values for low medium and high residual free chlorine concentrations respectively the tcc of the water from the gac filter that was continuously added to each post treatment tank was characterized over a 4 day period to have a median and average of 3 1 105 cells ml with a standard deviation of 5 104 cells ml data in supporting information table s3 which is similar to but lower than the concentration observed in the control tank the tcc of all tanks dosed with chlorine or electrolysis were generally less than the tcc of the water entering each tank the tcc observed in drinking water in the city of zürich switzerland is also included in fig 2c and d at 8 97 104 cells ml hammes et al 2010 the tcc of the control tank that does not include any post treatment exceeded this drinking water concentration on every day sampled the median tcc values for the low dosages of direct chlorination and electrolysis match this drinking water value the daily tcc values for the high dosage of direct chlorination and both the medium and high dosages of electrolysis were consistently below the drinking water concentration and the medium direct chlorination tcc was below the drinking water concentration in 18 out of 20 samples icc in this study refers to a count of cells which are successfully stained by a total cell stain but cannot be stained by pi because pi is only able to enter cells with damaged cell membranes icc results for each tank are presented in fig 3 and in supporting information table s2 in general our results indicate that lower doses of chlorination and electrolysis treatments caused greater log reductions in icc relative to tcc and high doses produced similar reductions in tcc and icc the median value for the icc tcc ratio was 67 average is 70 for the control tank this was similar to the 58 icc tcc ratio observed in the water entering the post treatment tanks from the gac filter the median icc tcc ratios for low doses were 8 5 16 average for direct chlorination and 6 7 8 8 average for electrolysis icc data becomes limited for medium and high doses of chlorine and electrolysis because the icc concentrations were frequently or almost exclusively below the quantification limit for the samples in which the icc tcc ratio can be enumerated using values above the quantification limit the ratio may increase with increasing dosage to 19 and icc tcc median values for medium chlorination high chlorination produced no quantifiable icc values and 9 2 and 46 icc tcc median values for medium and high electrolysis treatments 3 3 doc and aoc may both be affected by chlorine and electrolysis treatments the doc concentrations measured in control and post treatment tanks are presented in fig 2e and f the doc of all tanks increased or decreased together at different sampling times possibly due to variation in the water produced by the bambi gac filter system the median doc of the control tank was 0 28 mg doc l with a range from 0 16 to 0 67 mg doc l the median doc values for increasing direct chlorination were slightly higher at 0 34 0 37 and 0 39 mg doc l respectively and for increasing electrolysis 0 34 0 38 and 0 35 mg doc l respectively rank analysis of individual sampling days indicated that the doc concentration of the control tank was lower than of the direct chlorination tanks for 12 out of 18 samples 13 out of 18 including equal values and lower than electrolysis tanks 8 out of 16 times 11 out of 16 including equal values friedman testing between either the control and the three dosages of direct chlorination or between the control and three dosages of electrolysis indicated that each ranking was not the result of random variation at a greater than 99 5 confidence level therefore the lower doc in the control tank was statistically significant compared to tanks that received chlorine or electrolysis it was difficult to discern clear relationships for doc rank between three dosages of direct chlorination or between the three dosages of electrolysis in each case low medium and high doses produced both highest and lowest doc values during the experiment resulting in similar average ranks ranging between 1 75 and 2 16 the concentrations of aoc in control and post treatment tanks are presented in fig 2g and h the aoc concentrations in different post treatment tanks would generally increase or decrease together at different sampling points suggesting an influence of variation in the influent water a similar increasing or decreasing together was apparent in doc concentrations but aoc concentrations were not necessarily correlated with doc concentrations the median aoc value of the control was 0 059 mg aoc l with a range from 0 006 to 0 315 mg aoc l the median aoc values for increasing direct chlorination dosages were 0 096 0 091 and 0 077 mg aoc l respectively the median aoc values for increasing electrolysis dosages were 0 080 0 086 and 0 054 mg aoc l the values for direct chlorination and for electrolysis were generally comparable with each producing values for low and medium dosages that are higher than the control and then high dosages that are more similar to the control rank analysis of individual sampling days indicated that the aoc concentration of the control was lower than the aoc of the three direct chlorination tanks 13 out of 29 times and lower than the three electrolysis tanks 7 out of 17 times the highest dosage of direct chlorination produced the lowest aoc concentration out of all three electrolysis tanks and the control 7 out of 17 times and electrolysis produced the lowest aoc the remaining 10 times friedman testing between either the control and the three dosages of direct chlorination or between the control and three dosages of electrolysis indicated that the ranking of each set is not the result of random variation at a greater than 97 5 confidence level 3 4 disruptions in the system impact anti bacterial performance monitoring both the chemical composition of bambi permeate and the chemical and microbial composition of water in each post treatment tank allows us to observe how variation and disruption in bambi can impact the safety of the finished water product fig 4 illustrates this connection based on a disruption that occurred on day 43 of testing fig 4a presents the combined concentrations of ammonium and ammonia ammonium ammonia in the permeate water produced by the bambi on day 43 a disruption occurred likely linked to a temporary interruption in aeration resulting in a failure of nitrification within the bambi and a spike in the concentration of ammonium ammonia in the permeate to 2 7 mg n l fig 4b demonstrates that there was variation in the concentrations of free and total chlorine in the low dose direct chlorination tank but shows how the free and total chlorine concentrations were quite similar under normal operating conditions total chlorine is the combination of unreacted free chlorine and free chlorine that has reacted with ammonia or ammonia containing organics on day 43 there is a clear drop in free chlorine to less than 0 05 mg cl2 l below quantification limit while the total chlorine meets the expected 0 2 mg cl2 l target value fig 4c plots the concentration of combined chlorine displaying the spike on day 43 due to the spike in ammonium ammonia in the system fig 4d shows that the reduced concentration of free chlorine has allowed bacteria to increase to a tcc value of 6 1 105 cells ml which is significantly higher than the median value over the course of the experiment 9 0 104 cells ml and higher than the concentration of zürich drinking water 8 97 104 cells ml hammes et al 2010 4 discussion the discussion is divided into three sections the first section focuses on understanding the anti bactreial mechanisms that produce the reductions in bacterial concentrations observed with both direct chlorination and electrolysis treatments the second section discusses why we do not see significant differences between direct chlorination and electrolysis treatments operating at similar concentrations of chlorine residual the third section looks specifically at how the different dosages of direct chlorination and electrolysis treatment perform with respect to bacterial concentrations and how this work advances our ability to design water recycling systems that ensure microbial safety 4 1 direct inactivation by chlorine is the dominant anti bacterial mechanism the three potential anti bacterial mechanisms that we might expect to observe with direct chlorination or electrolysis treatments are 1 direct inactivation of bacteria 2 direct growth inhibition of viable bacteria or 3 indirect growth inhibition by removal of carbon substrate our results demonstrate that inactivation is the dominant anti bacterial mechanism in every experimental condition tested we observed a net reduction in tcc and icc of at least one order of magnitude compared to the bacterial concentrations of the water entering each tank we cannot quantify from our data to what degree some growth might still occur in the presence of the different chlorine residual concentrations however any growth that does occur is less significant than the amount of inactivation the potential for growth in the presence of chlorine is likely significantly less than the potential for growth in the control which is itself quite small population doubles over 24 hour residence time a specific comparison between direct chlorination and electrolysis treatments is provided in section 4 2 results display similar concentrations of tcc icc doc and aoc as a function of free chlorine residual these results do not indicate that tcc icc doc or aoc concentrations are differentially affected by direct chlorination or electrolysis treatments if the concentration of free chlorine residual is the same this similarity in performance leads us to attribute all significant inactivation of bacteria and chemical reactions with organic compounds to chlorine and not to any other oxidants that may or may not be produced by the electrolysis treatment therefore we find that the dominant anti bacterial mechanism in our system is inactivation and we credit this inactivation solely to the presence of chlorine we have now described reductions in terms of both tcc and icc as inactivation though we would calculate dramatically different values of inactivation by each measure what constitutes life or death or inactivation in bacteria is a complex scientific question as is how best to measure the concentration and viability of cells buysschaert et al 2016 prest et al 2016 the fcm protocols for tcc and icc utilized in this study rely on staining nucleic acids within each cell hammes et al 2011 tcc stains such as sybr green i are generally able to permeate through a cellular membrane access and then stain the nucleic materials within a cell pi is used for icc staining because it is less permeable through the cellular membrane positive staining with pi indicates cells that have suffered membrane damage cells which stain positive with a tcc stain but do not stain positive with a membrane integrity stain like pi are generally considered intact reduction in icc is often credited as being a conservative indicator of losing viability because a cell must usually undergo significant membrane damage before it becomes permeable to the pi stain hammes et al 2011 joux and lebaron 2000 more extensive damage to a cell can result in the destruction of the nucleic materials within the cell which prevents positive enumeration as tcc sufficient destruction of nucleic materials to produce a reduction in tcc concentration has been observed previously following exposure to ozone ramseier et al 2011b in our study the reductions in tcc observed at low medium and high concentrations of chorine residual demonstrate a similar oxidation of the cells by chlorine this degree of oxidation is beyond the amount required to cause permanent inactivation as indicated by icc measurements the changes in icc concentration likely provide a more accurate measure of permanent bacterial inactivation in our system compared to the changes in tcc the work of mao et al 2018 presents a similar investigation of long term changes in tcc and icc due to chlorination over five days of exposure to 0 3 mg cl2 l pseudomonas aeruginosa in simulated drinking water displayed reductions of 4 or more log in icc and approximately 1 log in tcc these results are comparable with the moderate reductions in tcc and the much more significant reductions in icc observed in our study pseudomonas aeruginosa inactivation was conducted in pure culture while our study utilized a community of bacteria the presence of a community of bacteria introduces the possibility that some bacteria in our system may be inactivated in chlorine at faster comparable or slower rates than the pseudomonas aeruginosa tested by mao et al 2018 tcc and icc measurements cannot easy discrimination between subpopulations of bacteria this means that tcc and icc measurements cannot identify if some sub populations of bacteria are able to survive or grow as the total population decreases the results do demonstrate that in tanks fed the same diverse population of bacteria increasing chlorine or electrolysis exposure is able to reduce the populations of all bacteria to below detection our results do not indicate a clear difference in doc concentrations between tanks with low medium and high doses of direct chlorination or electrolysis treatments but all experimental tanks have higher doc than the control this behavior is consistent with a control tank where some doc is used for growth and the doc is not impacted in the other tanks where we do not expect significant growth the aoc results suggest similarly that aoc was consumed by growth in the control but that aoc was also consumed by reacting with chlorine at the highest residual concentration tanks 5 mg cl2 l previous research has indicated that chlorine oxidation is capable of transforming a portion of the doc to aoc in drinking water liu et al 2015 but alternative evidence suggests that chlorination can also reduce aoc concentrations ramseier et al 2011a an increase or a decrease in aoc with chlorination is likely driven by the specific forms of aoc and doc interacting with the chlorine in our study a high free chlorine residual results in an aoc reduction and this reduction may also impact the ability of bacteria to grow in the water biological stability is a concept for microbial control through which the concentrations of aoc or other nutrients are sufficiently low that bacterial growth within the water is prevented or extremely limited prest et al 2016 van der kooij 2000 the threshold for biological stability has been suggested to occur at approximately 0 01 mg aoc l prest et al 2016 van der kooij 2000 the median aoc values we observed in our system ranged from 5 to 11 times this threshold independent of nutrient availability and how chlorine might affect growth the dominant anti bacterial mechanism observed in our system remains inactivation by chlorine 4 2 anti bacterial performance of electrolysis matches the performance of direct chlorination for a given free chlorine concentration electrolysis treatment is capable of producing hydroxyl radicals martínez huitle et al 2015 and hydroxyl radicals are capable of both mineralizing organic materials to co2 martínez huitle et al 2015 von gunten 2003 and directly inactivating bacteria jeong et al 2006 the electrolysis treatment in this current study did not clearly impact tcc icc doc or aoc concentrations beyond the influence attributed to the free chlorine the electrolysis did produce studies utilizing bdd electrodes on drinking water have also found that chlorine production is the dominant disinfection mechanism kerwick et al 2005 kraft et al 1999 many parameters control the chemical effects of electrolysis treatment including the potential current density material and orientation of the electrodes the characteristics of the water being treated and the mass transport conditions within the electrolysis cell martínez huitle et al 2015 in this study it is likely that the water quality significantly impacted the dominance of chlorine production over carbon mineralization unlike concentrated wastewater sources the doc in our water following treatment with bambi and gac contains only 0 4 mg doc l the chloride concentration in the water was set at 100 mg cl l this chloride concentration is 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than the content of drinking water however this increase was designed to reflect water that had been recycled in the bambi system over and over again as we assume that repeated uses of the water will lead to salt accumulation the high ratio of chloride to doc compounds strongly favors chlorine production simply because there are more interaction opportunities for oxidation with the chloride experimental testing and electrochemical theory suggest that lower flow rates and higher current densities can promote mineralization over chlorine production scialdone et al 2009 while it is difficult to productively compare the flow rate used in this study with the flow rates tested by scialdone et al 2009 because the configuration of the flow cell must also be considered both current density vales 17 39 ma cm2 examined by scialdone et al 2009 were significantly higher than what we tested in this study 3 5 ma cm2 increasing the current density in our application might better promote mineralization but this might not overcome the influence of the chloride doc ratio of our water another study seeking to optimize bdd electrode disinfection this time in treated wastewater found that increasing current density incurred greater energy costs but did not improve inactivation of bacteria schmalz et al 2009 once again chlorine oxidation was identified as the dominant mechanism of inactivation schmalz et al 2009 4 3 implementing chlorination or electrolysis to achieve microbial safety there is not a scientific consensus for what must be done to water before it is safe for hand washing while it might not be necessary for hand washing water to reach the same level of microbial safety as drinking water drinking water quality could be considered as a conservative goal for recycled hand washing water drinking water is frequently used for hand washing in many well developed countries and is generally regarded as safe for human exposure in terms of organic carbon our bambi gac treatment system achieved 99 removal of doc and ultimately achieved a doc concentration consistent with drinking water levels 0 05 mg doc l city of zürich 2016 chlorination proved to be an effective strategy to reduce bacteria concentrations and to combat bacterial growth in our system as it has in municipal drinking water distribution networks when our system achieved stable operating conditions even the lowest doses 0 2 mg cl2 l residual of both direct chlorination and electrolysis treatment generally matched the tcc concentration 8 97 104 cells ml in drinking water in zürich switzerland hammes et al 2010 a detailed investigation of tcc concentrations throughout a municipal drinking water treatment plant concluded that changes in tcc concentrations described well the impacts of the main treatment processes hammes et al 2008 we expect that monitoring tcc also effectively captures the impacts of treatments in our smaller scale system the icc concentration in our system which better reflects viable bacteria was less than 10 of the tcc concentration there is some risk that reductions in tcc and icc do not reflect a chlorine resistant population that may persist during treatment this possibility could be explored in future testing yet the extreme destruction of cells resulting in reductions in tcc that we observed even at our lowest residual chlorine concentrations suggests an extremely difficult environment for potential survivors while we did observe effective inactivation at 0 2 mg cl2 l residual operating under stable conditions our testing indicated that chlorine residual targets should be designed to overcome more challenging operating conditions this concept is particularly important for small scale decentralized water recycling systems and particularly important for developing world applications the unintentional disruption in bambi aeration we experienced during our testing resulted in the tank with the lowest free chlorine residual 0 2 mg cl2 l failing to maintain tcc values below the drinking water concentration while the medium and high chlorine dosing still maintained enough chlorine residual to keep the tcc below drinking water concentration the results from variation and the unintended disruption observed in this study indicate that a free chlorine residual target of 1 mg cl2 l would be an effective treatment in our system this residual chlorine target of 1 mg cl2 l is a common design target or minimum threshold for many laboratory and case studies and has generally been observed to be sufficient anti bacterial control by different means of testing abdel kader 2013 friedler et al 2005 gual et al 2008 march et al 2004 winward et al 2008 these studies have not attempted to deliver drinking water or hand washing water quality the chief limitations of this study are based on not understanding the specific types and risks of bacteria in the system how these bacteria are affected by chlorination under dynamic conditions and how this relationship might change under realistic and challenging operating conditions a better informed strategy for target chlorine residual concentration should ultimately be based on a risk assessment that incorporates each of these considerations reliance on tcc concentrations alone introduces the possibility that lower concentration of a more harmful bacteria might present a greater risk than a higher concentration of a less harmful bacteria sequencing or qpcr techniques could be used to identify all bacteria or specific targets this study details the interactions between water constituents free chlorine and bacteria concentrations that were observed during an unintended disruptive event systematic testing examining realistic and intentional disruptive events with dynamic monitoring of relevant chemical species and bacteria concentrations would demonstrate if higher chlorine concentrations are needed but also what disruptive events may simply overload the system optimization of operational parameters i e aeration residence time recirculation rate or nutrient balance may mitigate demands on chlorine and these factors must also be considered though this study examined a residual chlorine concentration of 5 mg cl2 l the upper boundary for a real system might be 4 mg cl2 l which is the maximum residual disinfectant level for chlorine in drinking water us epa 2009 beyond this concentration the epa notes potential eye and or nose irritation which is a consideration that could also apply for hand washing applications us epa 2009 our results demonstrate that sufficient quantities of chlorine can be delivered by either direct chlorination or produced through electrolysis we have discussed that it may be possible to optimize electrolysis to promote mineralization of carbon and possible removal of aoc however it is not clear if this potential anti bacterial mechanism provides a benefit in a system that is currently dominated by destructive oxidation of the bacteria a more productive strategy could be to better understand the relationship between electrolysis and chlorine production in our system we have manually adjusted the dosages of electrolysis treatment to achieve our target residual concentrations to compensate for an apparent increase over time in chlorine production efficiency a thorough understanding of what caused this increase would make the application of electrolysis more accurate and require less monitoring automatic feedback on electrolysis or direct chlorination could allow the dosing of either post treatment to better adapt to variations or disruptions and perhaps allow the chorine residual target to be 1 mg cl2 l this study has demonstrated that both chlorine and electrolysis treatments complement well our primary bambi gac treatment to deliver hand washing water that achieves drinking water quality in terms of doc and tcc concentrations choosing between direct chlorination or electrolysis treatments and possible inclusion of any feedback dosing should likely be done in accordance with cost and service constrains within specific applications 5 conclusions the combined treatment of a bambi gac and either direct chlorination or electrolysis disinfection is suitable to reduce doc and tcc concentrations from hand washing water to values below drinking water concentrations in zürich switzerland the electrolysis treatment resulted in the production of chlorine and concentrations of tcc icc doc and aoc similar to systems in which the same concentration of chlorine was added directly this indicates that bacterial inactivation through oxidation by chlorine was the dominant anti bacterial mechanism and that more powerful oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals were either not produced or did not have any impact on the concentration or bioavailability of carbon or bacterial inactivation the dosing of chlorine through direct chlorination or electrolysis must include a factor of safety such that a free chlorine residual is maintained during challenging and disruptive

20017,innovative solutions are necessary to enable the decentralized recycling of greywater for applications requiring high quality water such as hand washing while physical barriers such as ultrafiltration membranes effectively prevent the passage of bacteria and chemical and biological treatments can effectively reduce the carbon content of the treated water there exists a knowledge gap regarding the application of anti bacterial strategies to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria following treatment in this study the effluent water from a household scale greywater treatment system was fed to seven parallel experimental post treatment tanks three receiving direct chlorination with free chlorine residuals of 0 2 1 or 5 mg cl2 l three with chlorine produced through electrolysis at the same residual concentrations and one control with no chlorine added for increasing concentrations of direct chlorination the median total cell count tcc values were 9 104 2 9 104 and 1 8 103 cells ml respectively electrolysis treatment produced very similar tcc concentrations 8 8 104 1 1 104 and 2 3 103 cells ml the tcc concentrations were lower than the concentration of the water entering each tank 3 105 cells ml intact cell count icc measurements indicated that the viable cell concentrations were less than 10 of the tcc values though electrolysis treatment can produce powerful oxidants such as hydroxyl radical there was no evidence that electrolysis in this system provided additional benefits beyond chlorine production for control of total or intact cell counts oxidation of bacteria by chlorine was the dominant anti bacterial mechanism in our system monitoring of dissolved organic carbon doc and assimilable organic carbon aoc did not suggest that carbon limitation significantly impacted cell counts when chlorination or electrolysis treatment was applied this work demonstrates that either direct chlorination or electrolysis treatment are able to reduce bacteria concentrations over long term operation of a hand washing water treatment system we recommend selecting chlorine residual targets such that a chlorine residual is maintained during periods of challenging operating conditions we observed that a target residual of 1 mg cl2 l in our system maintained the tcc below the concentration found in zürich drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords greywater regrowth decentralized assimilable organic carbon aoc biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi hydroxyl radical 1 introduction the sustainable development goals sdgs target 6 2 calls for access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030 un 2015 yet substantial progress is needed to meet this goal an estimated 47 of the population in the least developed countries lacked access to any hand washing facilities and a further 27 had access to hand washing facilities without soap or water who and unicef 2017 the sdgs promote hand washing in part because of the potential impacts on human health washing hands with soap could reduce the risk of diarrheal diseases by 42 47 curtis and cairncross 2003 enabling hand washing by constructing centralized water treatment and distribution networks is not practical in many regions of the developing world due to high costs of installation and maintenance uncertainties linked to population growth and institutional instability larsen et al 2016 household scale systems that recycle hand washing water may offer a more practical solution to improve sanitation in these areas but only if these systems can be used safely many existing greywater treatment systems utilize a disinfection step to reduce bacteria concentration at the effluent the most common form of disinfection in greywater treatment is chlorination boyjoo et al 2013 but in no previous case has the treatment system been designed to provide hand washing quality water and the chlorination configured to meet this objective there exists a specific knowledge gap in our understanding of how to configure a modern greywater treatment system with an effective chlorine disinfection step to achieve a water quality sufficient for hand washing this study seeks to close this gap by quantifying the anti bacterial performance and identifying the mechanisms of anti bacterial activity in water produced by an effective greywater treatment system subject to different chlorination strategies this study utilizes a previously developed water treatment system known as a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi künzle et al 2015 our primary reasons for selecting the bambi system are i the simplicity small footprint and the low maintenance operation of the bambi make the system practical and affordable for lower income communities künzle et al 2015 ravndal et al 2015 ii long term testing has demonstrated stable operation and effective contaminant removal from synthetic hand washing water ziemba et al 2018 the core technology of the bambi is an ultrafiltration membrane submerged in a treatment tank aeration below the membrane promotes the development of a thick but permeable biofilm on the membrane surface künzle et al 2015 long term testing with a bambi fed a mixture of feces urine soap and water has demonstrated 95 removal of organic carbon künzle et al 2015 as well as stable nitrification and denitrification ravndal et al 2015 similar performance has been demonstrated treating a synthetic hand washing greywater ziemba et al 2018 bambi utilizes a gravity driven membrane gdm which requires no additional pressure to be applied to the feed side of the membrane beyond the weight of water the flux of water through the membrane is lower than would be observed in a conventional membrane bioreactor mbr however the biofilm that develops in the gdm system is self regulating and requires no fouling control during operation derlon et al 2012 peter varbanets et al 2010 the ultrafiltration membrane in the bambi presents a physical barrier to the passage of pathogens to the treated water testing in our laboratory has demonstrated removal of 7 log bacteria and 3 log ms 2 bacteriophage unpublished data a significant concern however is the growth of bacteria that may be able to enter into the water after the membrane while the water is stored until use pathogen growth testing has demonstrated that the permeate of a bambi system treating a wastewater similar in composition to greywater can still contain significant concentrations of assimilable organic carbon aoc dissolved organic carbon doc and other nutrients sufficient to support the growth of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa nguyen et al 2017 therefore some form of disinfection or post treatment is necessary to maintain the safety of the water nguyen et al 2017 free chlorine hocl is a strong oxidant which affects a cell in many ways including damaging membranes disrupting membrane functions and damaging dna batch testing with permeate water from a bambi system treating hand washing water mixed with flushing water from a source separating toilet demonstrated that a free chlorine concentration of 0 5 mg l could inactivate 5 log of spiked escherichia coli within 5 min of exposure nguyen et al 2017 march et al 2004 showed total inactivation of coliforms with a 1 mg l free chlorine concentration in greywater following treatment with a 0 3 mm filter and sedimentation tank the amount of free chlorine that needs to be added to a system to reach a target concentration must first overcome the chlorine demand which is the amount of added chlorine that will rapidly react with organics and other compounds such as ammonium and nitrite lazarova et al 1999 winward et al 2008 chlorine can either be added from a reservoir or produced using electrolysis electrolysis can also produce other reactive oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals with greater oxidation potential than chlorine parsons and williams 2004 which may more effectively inactivate bacteria by direct oxidation jeong et al 2006 or may more effectively oxidize organic materials in the water kraft 2007 martínez huitle et al 2015 which could otherwise be used as substrate by the bacteria aoc and doc therefore a treatment system utilizing electrolysis to produce a certain concentration of chlorine may result in lower bacteria concentrations than a system in which the same concentration of chlorine is added directly in the context of a decentralized system electrolysis may offer an opportunity to produce sufficient chlorine without requiring refilling of a chemical chlorine dosing reservoir the specific goals of this study were to i evaluate bacterial content in systems employing different dosages of direct chlorination and electrolysis treatment ii compare the anti bacterial mechanisms employed in each condition direct inactivation of bacteria direct growth inhibition or indirect growth inhibition by carbon limitation and iii recommend optimal post treatment solutions for systems treating hand washing water or similar water types such as rainwater or greywater from other sources understanding the performance and mechanisms for each post treatment as well as how this performance could be affected by challenging operating conditions were ultimately necessary to determine an optimal process configuration 2 materials and methods 2 1 system overview a bambi system fig 1 has been constructed using a 52 l plastic tank and standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl module newterra ontario canada with 3 m2 total surface area polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany aeration 20 l min was delivered with coarse bubbles 3 mm diameter introduced directly below the membrane module an interruption in the aeration was discovered on the 43rd day of operation in which the air supply had been unintentionally disconnected the aeration was resumed at this time but the duration of the outage is not known the only pressure driving water though the membrane was generated by the water head on the feeding side approximately 35 mbar on average the bambi was fed 75 l day of a synthetic greywater solution section 2 2 the daily feed was a combination of 1 part of refrigerated 4 c 20x concentrated solution 3 75 l day and 19 parts chlorine free tap water 71 25 l day this total daily volume of 75 l day was divided into 50 simulated hand washing events 1 5 l event spaced evenly throughout the day the permeate from this reactor was then pumped at 5 min intervals to a submerged granular activated carbon gac filter containing 8 l of norit 830 coal based gac with 1 1 3 mm grain size cabot boston ma usa for an average residence time of approximately 2 5 h the water from the gac tank was pumped constantly into 7 different post treatment tanks each with a volume of 10 l and a residence time of 1 day the gac tank and the post treatment tanks used overflows to maintain volume gac was included in this system to remove organics from the water through a combination of sorption and biological degradation the improvements in water quality produced by a bambi system following the addition of a gac filter have been documented previously for a wastewater similar in composition to our nutrient balanced hand washing water nguyen et al 2017 three post treatment tanks were dosed with different concentrations of chlorine and three with different dosages of electrolysis the seventh tank was a control that did not receive chlorine or electrolysis treatment feeding permeate removal and chlorine addition pumps electrolysis power and electrolysis polarity switching were activated and deactivated using process control hardware endress hauser ag reinach bl switzerland and automation softwares codesys 3s smart software solutions gmbh kempten germany and citectscada schneider electric rueil malmaison france electrolysis and chlorination controls are explained in section 2 3 2 2 synthetic hand washing water feeding the recipe for the synthetic feed was taken directly from and is described in great detail by ziemba et al 2018 table 1 presents the components added to this feed at their final 1x concentrations the 1x strength of feed represents the loading of soap and other materials introduced into the corresponding volume of water during hand washing the feed was prepared as a 20x concentrated version of the concentrations in table 1 and it was diluted to the 1x version as it was used the concentration of sodium chloride was increased in this 1x feed to provide a total chloride concentration of 100 mg l the reason for this increase in sodium chloride is because we expect that repeated recycling of the same water in our system will cause the salts in the water to become concentrated over time the concentration of chloride in the water may significantly impact the production of chlorine through electrolysis therefore we have elected to conduct our testing with a potentially more representative concentration of chloride 2 3 chlorination and electrolysis post treatments chlorine was dosed using peristaltic pumps from refrigerated working solutions 4 c of 125 400 and 1200 mg l cl2 aq for low 0 2 mg l medium 1 mg l and high 5 mg l final free available chlorine concentrations the chlorine working solutions were prepared in chilled 4 c de ionized di water with final ph adjusted to 11 using naoh every 15 min about 0 6 ml of working solution was dosed to each tank the average flow rate of chlorine solution was approximately 0 6 of the flow rate of water entering each post treatment tank water in control and chlorination tanks were mixed by constant recirculation pumping at a rate of 0 5 l min boron doped diamond bdd electrolysis flow cells were employed for electrolysis treatment with 85 cm2 surface area parallel plate electrodes and a 3 mm separation distance waterdiam delémont switzerland water was pumped from the post treatment tank passed through an electrolysis cell and then returned to the post treatment tank at a rate of 0 5 l min electrolysis was operated at 0 3 a and 6 v with continuous on off cycles of approximately 1 89 1 14 and 1 4 minutes on minutes off for low medium and high doses respectively the amperage was selected though trial and error such that the all target doses could be achieved with the same amperage without imposing too lengthy off times for the lowest dose unintended variation occurred in electrolysis dosing between days 47 and 57 of operation the degree of electrolysis dosage that occurred during this period is unknown proper control was resumed on day 57 and dosage rates were intentionally modified to better achieve the target chlorine concentrations in each tank data collected between not including days 47 and 57 for electrolysis treatment and all data from days 43 and 44 when an aeration interruption occurred in bambi were not included in statistical analysis monitoring of chlorine concentrations resulting from the direct chlorination and the electrolysis treatment suggested that stable dosages of electrolysis resulted in increasing free chlorine production over time the on off times were modified to return the free chlorine residual concentrations to the desired targets the dosing was reduced 6 7 for the medium dose and 33 for the high dose on day 57 the medium dose was reduced an additional 10 and the low dosage was increased 19 on day 61 the polarity of the current was reversed between each on off cycle recirculation pumps were operated continuously electrolysis cells were examined for fouling every 1 2 weeks during testing but no significant fouling was observed 2 4 chemical analysis doc was monitored using a toc doc

total cell counts tcc intact cell counts icc and aoc tcc in the post treatment tanks and tcc for aoc measurements were conducted using sybr green i stain thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa and a flow cytometer cytoflex bechman coulter brea california usa with 30 s reads on 30 μl samples intact cell counts icc were conducted as with tcc except propidium iodide pi was also added during incubation flow cytometry analysis was selected for bacterial quantification because of the simplicity and speed of processing high quantities of samples relative to sequencing or qpcr techniques the ability to quantify bacteria that are non culturable and not captured by heterotrophic plate count and the ability to differentially identify cells with intact cell membranes tcc from cells with damaged cell membranes icc hammes et al 2011 joux and lebaron 2000 flow cytometry has also been demonstrated to descriptively quantify changes in cell counts through drinking water treatment processes hammes et al 2008 the aoc measurement procedure was based on the procedure of hammes and egli 2005 which consisted of filtering 50 ml of sample through a 0 2 μm polyethersulfone filter pall port washington new york usa into a 60 ml glass vial adding 1 ml of a standard and diverse inoculum of environmental bacteria dividing into three 45 ml glass vials incubating for 3 days at 30 c without light measuring tcc and then calculating aoc using the equation 1 μg aoc 107 cells all glassware was muffled at 450 c for 12 h ptfe lined vial caps were used and filters were prewashed with 50 ml of di water inoculum was prepared by combining one part each 1 evian water évian les bains france 2 water treated by a bambi system fed the synthetic greywater described in this study 3 water treated by a bambi system fed a mixture of soap urine and feces and 4 water collected from the chriesbach stream in dübendorf switzerland bacteria from the bambi waters and the stream water were twice washed and re suspended in mineral buffer lechevallier et al 1993 by centrifugations for 10 min at 3500g after each centrifugation the supernatant was discarded and the cells were re suspended in the buffer the tcc of the finished inoculum was determined to be 100 cells ml the composition of the inoculum was modified from that of hammes and egli 2005 because aoc measurements rely on inoculating with bacteria that are best able to grow on the carbon within the sample natural inoculum are often used to measure aoc in natural waters because of the diversity and because the bacteria can be well adapted to the carbon and the background materials in the water in engineered systems including bacteria adapted to these environments may also improve the quality of aoc measurements 3 results 3 1 direct chlorination and electrolysis generally achieved free chlorine targets the target residual free chlorine concentrations in the low medium and high dose conditions were 0 2 1 and 5 mg cl2 l for chlorine dosed directly or produced through electrolysis in each case the free chlorine concentrations observed were generally close to the target concentrations for direct chlorination the median free chlorine concentrations were 0 21 0 95 and 4 8 mg cl2 l respectively for increasing dosages fig 2 a for electrolysis the median free chlorine concentrations were 0 21 1 5 and 5 2 mg cl2 l respectively for increasing dosages fig 2b with the electrolysis treatment there was a clear increase in the free chlorine concentrations over time for the first 47 days of operation in the tanks treated with medium and high dosages the free chlorine concentration in the post treatment tank with the highest electrolysis dosage increased over the first 47 days 0 4 mg cl2 l free chlorine per week the electrolysis modules were not controlled properly between the 47 and 57 operating days resulting in unintended variation in the electrolysis dosing during this period resulting in free chlorine concentrations ranging from below detection to 3 mg cl2 l in the low dose from 1 7 to 6 4 mg cl2 l in the medium dose and 2 4 6 9 mg cl2 l in the high dose starting on day 57 proper control was resumed and the on off times were modified to achieve the initial target chlorine concentrations for each dosage 3 2 increasing chlorine residual reduced tcc and icc the tcc includes all cells that can be identified by the flow cytometer tcc and icc results are presented in fig 2c and d individually in fig 3 and in supporting information tables s1 and s2 the median tcc for the control tank was 5 6 105 cells ml for increasing concentrations of direct chlorination the median tcc values were 9 0 104 2 8 104 and 1 6 103 cells ml respectively for increasing dosages of electrolysis treatment the median tcc values were 8 6 104 1 0 104 and 1 7 103 cells ml respectively direct chlorination and electrolysis treatments produced similar tcc values for low medium and high residual free chlorine concentrations respectively the tcc of the water from the gac filter that was continuously added to each post treatment tank was characterized over a 4 day period to have a median and average of 3 1 105 cells ml with a standard deviation of 5 104 cells ml data in supporting information table s3 which is similar to but lower than the concentration observed in the control tank the tcc of all tanks dosed with chlorine or electrolysis were generally less than the tcc of the water entering each tank the tcc observed in drinking water in the city of zürich switzerland is also included in fig 2c and d at 8 97 104 cells ml hammes et al 2010 the tcc of the control tank that does not include any post treatment exceeded this drinking water concentration on every day sampled the median tcc values for the low dosages of direct chlorination and electrolysis match this drinking water value the daily tcc values for the high dosage of direct chlorination and both the medium and high dosages of electrolysis were consistently below the drinking water concentration and the medium direct chlorination tcc was below the drinking water concentration in 18 out of 20 samples icc in this study refers to a count of cells which are successfully stained by a total cell stain but cannot be stained by pi because pi is only able to enter cells with damaged cell membranes icc results for each tank are presented in fig 3 and in supporting information table s2 in general our results indicate that lower doses of chlorination and electrolysis treatments caused greater log reductions in icc relative to tcc and high doses produced similar reductions in tcc and icc the median value for the icc tcc ratio was 67 average is 70 for the control tank this was similar to the 58 icc tcc ratio observed in the water entering the post treatment tanks from the gac filter the median icc tcc ratios for low doses were 8 5 16 average for direct chlorination and 6 7 8 8 average for electrolysis icc data becomes limited for medium and high doses of chlorine and electrolysis because the icc concentrations were frequently or almost exclusively below the quantification limit for the samples in which the icc tcc ratio can be enumerated using values above the quantification limit the ratio may increase with increasing dosage to 19 and icc tcc median values for medium chlorination high chlorination produced no quantifiable icc values and 9 2 and 46 icc tcc median values for medium and high electrolysis treatments 3 3 doc and aoc may both be affected by chlorine and electrolysis treatments the doc concentrations measured in control and post treatment tanks are presented in fig 2e and f the doc of all tanks increased or decreased together at different sampling times possibly due to variation in the water produced by the bambi gac filter system the median doc of the control tank was 0 28 mg doc l with a range from 0 16 to 0 67 mg doc l the median doc values for increasing direct chlorination were slightly higher at 0 34 0 37 and 0 39 mg doc l respectively and for increasing electrolysis 0 34 0 38 and 0 35 mg doc l respectively rank analysis of individual sampling days indicated that the doc concentration of the control tank was lower than of the direct chlorination tanks for 12 out of 18 samples 13 out of 18 including equal values and lower than electrolysis tanks 8 out of 16 times 11 out of 16 including equal values friedman testing between either the control and the three dosages of direct chlorination or between the control and three dosages of electrolysis indicated that each ranking was not the result of random variation at a greater than 99 5 confidence level therefore the lower doc in the control tank was statistically significant compared to tanks that received chlorine or electrolysis it was difficult to discern clear relationships for doc rank between three dosages of direct chlorination or between the three dosages of electrolysis in each case low medium and high doses produced both highest and lowest doc values during the experiment resulting in similar average ranks ranging between 1 75 and 2 16 the concentrations of aoc in control and post treatment tanks are presented in fig 2g and h the aoc concentrations in different post treatment tanks would generally increase or decrease together at different sampling points suggesting an influence of variation in the influent water a similar increasing or decreasing together was apparent in doc concentrations but aoc concentrations were not necessarily correlated with doc concentrations the median aoc value of the control was 0 059 mg aoc l with a range from 0 006 to 0 315 mg aoc l the median aoc values for increasing direct chlorination dosages were 0 096 0 091 and 0 077 mg aoc l respectively the median aoc values for increasing electrolysis dosages were 0 080 0 086 and 0 054 mg aoc l the values for direct chlorination and for electrolysis were generally comparable with each producing values for low and medium dosages that are higher than the control and then high dosages that are more similar to the control rank analysis of individual sampling days indicated that the aoc concentration of the control was lower than the aoc of the three direct chlorination tanks 13 out of 29 times and lower than the three electrolysis tanks 7 out of 17 times the highest dosage of direct chlorination produced the lowest aoc concentration out of all three electrolysis tanks and the control 7 out of 17 times and electrolysis produced the lowest aoc the remaining 10 times friedman testing between either the control and the three dosages of direct chlorination or between the control and three dosages of electrolysis indicated that the ranking of each set is not the result of random variation at a greater than 97 5 confidence level 3 4 disruptions in the system impact anti bacterial performance monitoring both the chemical composition of bambi permeate and the chemical and microbial composition of water in each post treatment tank allows us to observe how variation and disruption in bambi can impact the safety of the finished water product fig 4 illustrates this connection based on a disruption that occurred on day 43 of testing fig 4a presents the combined concentrations of ammonium and ammonia ammonium ammonia in the permeate water produced by the bambi on day 43 a disruption occurred likely linked to a temporary interruption in aeration resulting in a failure of nitrification within the bambi and a spike in the concentration of ammonium ammonia in the permeate to 2 7 mg n l fig 4b demonstrates that there was variation in the concentrations of free and total chlorine in the low dose direct chlorination tank but shows how the free and total chlorine concentrations were quite similar under normal operating conditions total chlorine is the combination of unreacted free chlorine and free chlorine that has reacted with ammonia or ammonia containing organics on day 43 there is a clear drop in free chlorine to less than 0 05 mg cl2 l below quantification limit while the total chlorine meets the expected 0 2 mg cl2 l target value fig 4c plots the concentration of combined chlorine displaying the spike on day 43 due to the spike in ammonium ammonia in the system fig 4d shows that the reduced concentration of free chlorine has allowed bacteria to increase to a tcc value of 6 1 105 cells ml which is significantly higher than the median value over the course of the experiment 9 0 104 cells ml and higher than the concentration of zürich drinking water 8 97 104 cells ml hammes et al 2010 4 discussion the discussion is divided into three sections the first section focuses on understanding the anti bactreial mechanisms that produce the reductions in bacterial concentrations observed with both direct chlorination and electrolysis treatments the second section discusses why we do not see significant differences between direct chlorination and electrolysis treatments operating at similar concentrations of chlorine residual the third section looks specifically at how the different dosages of direct chlorination and electrolysis treatment perform with respect to bacterial concentrations and how this work advances our ability to design water recycling systems that ensure microbial safety 4 1 direct inactivation by chlorine is the dominant anti bacterial mechanism the three potential anti bacterial mechanisms that we might expect to observe with direct chlorination or electrolysis treatments are 1 direct inactivation of bacteria 2 direct growth inhibition of viable bacteria or 3 indirect growth inhibition by removal of carbon substrate our results demonstrate that inactivation is the dominant anti bacterial mechanism in every experimental condition tested we observed a net reduction in tcc and icc of at least one order of magnitude compared to the bacterial concentrations of the water entering each tank we cannot quantify from our data to what degree some growth might still occur in the presence of the different chlorine residual concentrations however any growth that does occur is less significant than the amount of inactivation the potential for growth in the presence of chlorine is likely significantly less than the potential for growth in the control which is itself quite small population doubles over 24 hour residence time a specific comparison between direct chlorination and electrolysis treatments is provided in section 4 2 results display similar concentrations of tcc icc doc and aoc as a function of free chlorine residual these results do not indicate that tcc icc doc or aoc concentrations are differentially affected by direct chlorination or electrolysis treatments if the concentration of free chlorine residual is the same this similarity in performance leads us to attribute all significant inactivation of bacteria and chemical reactions with organic compounds to chlorine and not to any other oxidants that may or may not be produced by the electrolysis treatment therefore we find that the dominant anti bacterial mechanism in our system is inactivation and we credit this inactivation solely to the presence of chlorine we have now described reductions in terms of both tcc and icc as inactivation though we would calculate dramatically different values of inactivation by each measure what constitutes life or death or inactivation in bacteria is a complex scientific question as is how best to measure the concentration and viability of cells buysschaert et al 2016 prest et al 2016 the fcm protocols for tcc and icc utilized in this study rely on staining nucleic acids within each cell hammes et al 2011 tcc stains such as sybr green i are generally able to permeate through a cellular membrane access and then stain the nucleic materials within a cell pi is used for icc staining because it is less permeable through the cellular membrane positive staining with pi indicates cells that have suffered membrane damage cells which stain positive with a tcc stain but do not stain positive with a membrane integrity stain like pi are generally considered intact reduction in icc is often credited as being a conservative indicator of losing viability because a cell must usually undergo significant membrane damage before it becomes permeable to the pi stain hammes et al 2011 joux and lebaron 2000 more extensive damage to a cell can result in the destruction of the nucleic materials within the cell which prevents positive enumeration as tcc sufficient destruction of nucleic materials to produce a reduction in tcc concentration has been observed previously following exposure to ozone ramseier et al 2011b in our study the reductions in tcc observed at low medium and high concentrations of chorine residual demonstrate a similar oxidation of the cells by chlorine this degree of oxidation is beyond the amount required to cause permanent inactivation as indicated by icc measurements the changes in icc concentration likely provide a more accurate measure of permanent bacterial inactivation in our system compared to the changes in tcc the work of mao et al 2018 presents a similar investigation of long term changes in tcc and icc due to chlorination over five days of exposure to 0 3 mg cl2 l pseudomonas aeruginosa in simulated drinking water displayed reductions of 4 or more log in icc and approximately 1 log in tcc these results are comparable with the moderate reductions in tcc and the much more significant reductions in icc observed in our study pseudomonas aeruginosa inactivation was conducted in pure culture while our study utilized a community of bacteria the presence of a community of bacteria introduces the possibility that some bacteria in our system may be inactivated in chlorine at faster comparable or slower rates than the pseudomonas aeruginosa tested by mao et al 2018 tcc and icc measurements cannot easy discrimination between subpopulations of bacteria this means that tcc and icc measurements cannot identify if some sub populations of bacteria are able to survive or grow as the total population decreases the results do demonstrate that in tanks fed the same diverse population of bacteria increasing chlorine or electrolysis exposure is able to reduce the populations of all bacteria to below detection our results do not indicate a clear difference in doc concentrations between tanks with low medium and high doses of direct chlorination or electrolysis treatments but all experimental tanks have higher doc than the control this behavior is consistent with a control tank where some doc is used for growth and the doc is not impacted in the other tanks where we do not expect significant growth the aoc results suggest similarly that aoc was consumed by growth in the control but that aoc was also consumed by reacting with chlorine at the highest residual concentration tanks 5 mg cl2 l previous research has indicated that chlorine oxidation is capable of transforming a portion of the doc to aoc in drinking water liu et al 2015 but alternative evidence suggests that chlorination can also reduce aoc concentrations ramseier et al 2011a an increase or a decrease in aoc with chlorination is likely driven by the specific forms of aoc and doc interacting with the chlorine in our study a high free chlorine residual results in an aoc reduction and this reduction may also impact the ability of bacteria to grow in the water biological stability is a concept for microbial control through which the concentrations of aoc or other nutrients are sufficiently low that bacterial growth within the water is prevented or extremely limited prest et al 2016 van der kooij 2000 the threshold for biological stability has been suggested to occur at approximately 0 01 mg aoc l prest et al 2016 van der kooij 2000 the median aoc values we observed in our system ranged from 5 to 11 times this threshold independent of nutrient availability and how chlorine might affect growth the dominant anti bacterial mechanism observed in our system remains inactivation by chlorine 4 2 anti bacterial performance of electrolysis matches the performance of direct chlorination for a given free chlorine concentration electrolysis treatment is capable of producing hydroxyl radicals martínez huitle et al 2015 and hydroxyl radicals are capable of both mineralizing organic materials to co2 martínez huitle et al 2015 von gunten 2003 and directly inactivating bacteria jeong et al 2006 the electrolysis treatment in this current study did not clearly impact tcc icc doc or aoc concentrations beyond the influence attributed to the free chlorine the electrolysis did produce studies utilizing bdd electrodes on drinking water have also found that chlorine production is the dominant disinfection mechanism kerwick et al 2005 kraft et al 1999 many parameters control the chemical effects of electrolysis treatment including the potential current density material and orientation of the electrodes the characteristics of the water being treated and the mass transport conditions within the electrolysis cell martínez huitle et al 2015 in this study it is likely that the water quality significantly impacted the dominance of chlorine production over carbon mineralization unlike concentrated wastewater sources the doc in our water following treatment with bambi and gac contains only 0 4 mg doc l the chloride concentration in the water was set at 100 mg cl l this chloride concentration is 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than the content of drinking water however this increase was designed to reflect water that had been recycled in the bambi system over and over again as we assume that repeated uses of the water will lead to salt accumulation the high ratio of chloride to doc compounds strongly favors chlorine production simply because there are more interaction opportunities for oxidation with the chloride experimental testing and electrochemical theory suggest that lower flow rates and higher current densities can promote mineralization over chlorine production scialdone et al 2009 while it is difficult to productively compare the flow rate used in this study with the flow rates tested by scialdone et al 2009 because the configuration of the flow cell must also be considered both current density vales 17 39 ma cm2 examined by scialdone et al 2009 were significantly higher than what we tested in this study 3 5 ma cm2 increasing the current density in our application might better promote mineralization but this might not overcome the influence of the chloride doc ratio of our water another study seeking to optimize bdd electrode disinfection this time in treated wastewater found that increasing current density incurred greater energy costs but did not improve inactivation of bacteria schmalz et al 2009 once again chlorine oxidation was identified as the dominant mechanism of inactivation schmalz et al 2009 4 3 implementing chlorination or electrolysis to achieve microbial safety there is not a scientific consensus for what must be done to water before it is safe for hand washing while it might not be necessary for hand washing water to reach the same level of microbial safety as drinking water drinking water quality could be considered as a conservative goal for recycled hand washing water drinking water is frequently used for hand washing in many well developed countries and is generally regarded as safe for human exposure in terms of organic carbon our bambi gac treatment system achieved 99 removal of doc and ultimately achieved a doc concentration consistent with drinking water levels 0 05 mg doc l city of zürich 2016 chlorination proved to be an effective strategy to reduce bacteria concentrations and to combat bacterial growth in our system as it has in municipal drinking water distribution networks when our system achieved stable operating conditions even the lowest doses 0 2 mg cl2 l residual of both direct chlorination and electrolysis treatment generally matched the tcc concentration 8 97 104 cells ml in drinking water in zürich switzerland hammes et al 2010 a detailed investigation of tcc concentrations throughout a municipal drinking water treatment plant concluded that changes in tcc concentrations described well the impacts of the main treatment processes hammes et al 2008 we expect that monitoring tcc also effectively captures the impacts of treatments in our smaller scale system the icc concentration in our system which better reflects viable bacteria was less than 10 of the tcc concentration there is some risk that reductions in tcc and icc do not reflect a chlorine resistant population that may persist during treatment this possibility could be explored in future testing yet the extreme destruction of cells resulting in reductions in tcc that we observed even at our lowest residual chlorine concentrations suggests an extremely difficult environment for potential survivors while we did observe effective inactivation at 0 2 mg cl2 l residual operating under stable conditions our testing indicated that chlorine residual targets should be designed to overcome more challenging operating conditions this concept is particularly important for small scale decentralized water recycling systems and particularly important for developing world applications the unintentional disruption in bambi aeration we experienced during our testing resulted in the tank with the lowest free chlorine residual 0 2 mg cl2 l failing to maintain tcc values below the drinking water concentration while the medium and high chlorine dosing still maintained enough chlorine residual to keep the tcc below drinking water concentration the results from variation and the unintended disruption observed in this study indicate that a free chlorine residual target of 1 mg cl2 l would be an effective treatment in our system this residual chlorine target of 1 mg cl2 l is a common design target or minimum threshold for many laboratory and case studies and has generally been observed to be sufficient anti bacterial control by different means of testing abdel kader 2013 friedler et al 2005 gual et al 2008 march et al 2004 winward et al 2008 these studies have not attempted to deliver drinking water or hand washing water quality the chief limitations of this study are based on not understanding the specific types and risks of bacteria in the system how these bacteria are affected by chlorination under dynamic conditions and how this relationship might change under realistic and challenging operating conditions a better informed strategy for target chlorine residual concentration should ultimately be based on a risk assessment that incorporates each of these considerations reliance on tcc concentrations alone introduces the possibility that lower concentration of a more harmful bacteria might present a greater risk than a higher concentration of a less harmful bacteria sequencing or qpcr techniques could be used to identify all bacteria or specific targets this study details the interactions between water constituents free chlorine and bacteria concentrations that were observed during an unintended disruptive event systematic testing examining realistic and intentional disruptive events with dynamic monitoring of relevant chemical species and bacteria concentrations would demonstrate if higher chlorine concentrations are needed but also what disruptive events may simply overload the system optimization of operational parameters i e aeration residence time recirculation rate or nutrient balance may mitigate demands on chlorine and these factors must also be considered though this study examined a residual chlorine concentration of 5 mg cl2 l the upper boundary for a real system might be 4 mg cl2 l which is the maximum residual disinfectant level for chlorine in drinking water us epa 2009 beyond this concentration the epa notes potential eye and or nose irritation which is a consideration that could also apply for hand washing applications us epa 2009 our results demonstrate that sufficient quantities of chlorine can be delivered by either direct chlorination or produced through electrolysis we have discussed that it may be possible to optimize electrolysis to promote mineralization of carbon and possible removal of aoc however it is not clear if this potential anti bacterial mechanism provides a benefit in a system that is currently dominated by destructive oxidation of the bacteria a more productive strategy could be to better understand the relationship between electrolysis and chlorine production in our system we have manually adjusted the dosages of electrolysis treatment to achieve our target residual concentrations to compensate for an apparent increase over time in chlorine production efficiency a thorough understanding of what caused this increase would make the application of electrolysis more accurate and require less monitoring automatic feedback on electrolysis or direct chlorination could allow the dosing of either post treatment to better adapt to variations or disruptions and perhaps allow the chorine residual target to be 1 mg cl2 l this study has demonstrated that both chlorine and electrolysis treatments complement well our primary bambi gac treatment to deliver hand washing water that achieves drinking water quality in terms of doc and tcc concentrations choosing between direct chlorination or electrolysis treatments and possible inclusion of any feedback dosing should likely be done in accordance with cost and service constrains within specific applications 5 conclusions the combined treatment of a bambi gac and either direct chlorination or electrolysis disinfection is suitable to reduce doc and tcc concentrations from hand washing water to values below drinking water concentrations in zürich switzerland the electrolysis treatment resulted in the production of chlorine and concentrations of tcc icc doc and aoc similar to systems in which the same concentration of chlorine was added directly this indicates that bacterial inactivation through oxidation by chlorine was the dominant anti bacterial mechanism and that more powerful oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals were either not produced or did not have any impact on the concentration or bioavailability of carbon or bacterial inactivation the dosing of chlorine through direct chlorination or electrolysis must include a factor of safety such that a free chlorine residual is maintained during challenging and disruptive

for more than sixty years their high durability on exposure to the most diverse media and environmental conditions combined with their versatile manufacturing methods and applications have made plastics highly attractive materials in our modern society ehrenstein and pongratz 2007 since 1950 world production of plastics has been continuously expanding plasticseurope 2009 2018 there are

the hormone level etc wright et al 2013 currently many research groups are engaged in the analysis of mp in surface waters sediments living organisms food and hygiene products in many mp studies light microscopy was used for sample analysis a comparison of the visually identified mpps and mpfs with analysis results from ftir and raman spectroscopy has shown that up to 70 of the finds are false positives hidalgo ruz et al 2012 lenz et al 2015 the reliability of visual identification methods decreases significantly in particular for mpps 100 μm lenz et al 2015 analysis by ftir spectroscopy reaches detection limits of down to 20 μm löder et al 2012 raman microspectroscopy can identify particles down to 1 μm in size ivleva et al 2017 and pyrolysis gc ms allows the polymer types of particles 100 μm to be identified dekiff et al 2014 so far there are very few studies using raman or ftir spectroscopy for mp analysis in waste water therefore in the present work an analysis method was developed to determine the mp concentration in the secondary clarifier effluent of a municipal waste water treatment plant wwtp using raman microspectroscopy the effluent sample from the secondary clarifier was concentrated on a stainless steel cartridge filter subsequent sample processing involved oxidative treatment to decompose natural organic matter present followed by density separation to remove inorganic material there are several different approaches to density separation the common feature is the use of a salt solution with high density e g zncl2 nai sodium polytungstate etc to separate mp from inorganic particles in some studies a separation funnel is used for separation mintenig et al 2017 vollertsen et al 2017 and in other studies a centrifuge is used carr et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 gündoğdu et al 2018 when using a separation funnel especially small particles are adsorbed at the glass wall of the thin outlet using a centrifuge it is not possible to quantitatively transfer mp by simply decanting within the scope of this study the method of centrifugation was further developed by using flexible centrifuge tubes made of silicone quantitative transfer of mp is possible therefor the silicone tube is being pinched off and then decanted adsorbed mp can be rinsed off multiple times subsequently 2 materials and methods 2 1 equipment and materials to minimize sample contamination through airborne fibers particles virtually all work steps were conducted in a laminar flow box msc advantage 12 thermo fisher scientific inc usa contamination through plastic tools materials was minimized by using glass and stainless steel equipment with the following exceptions polyethylene pe polypropylene pp original chemical containers polycarbonate pc filter membrane for water and chemicals filtration acrylonitrile butadiene rubber nbr and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe pump seal silicone pump inlet hose filter gasket centrifuge tubes perfluoroalkoxy polymer resin pfa squirt bottle nbr ptfe pfa and pc do not count among the plastics normally encountered in municipal waste water mintenig et al 2017 and were therefore not considered in the analyses as the use of silicone was unavoidable silicone was not considered either pe and pp were analyzed because all chemicals were filtered through an 0 6 μm fiberglass filter mn85 70 bf macherey nagel gmbh co kg germany and an 8 μm polycarbonate filter tetp 04700 merck kgaa germany prior to use in order to remove particulate contaminants the polycarbonate filter was used to retain glass fibers entrained from the fiberglass filter the equipment and materials used were rinsed with filtered deionized water prior to use rinses with filtered deionized water and n hexane hipersolv chromanorm vwr usa were carried out after each work step to ensure quantitative recovery of the mpps because of its non polar properties n hexane lends itself to the removal of adhering particles from surfaces preliminary trials with fluorescent tracer particles cospheric llc usa had shown that particles 20 μm can be quantitatively transferred by rinsing with hexane this is not possible with water the deionized water was produced in a reverse osmosis unit os 3050 h e gmbh germany and then filtered using the same method as for the other chemicals employed see above 2 2 sampling the water samples were collected in the secondary clarifier effluent launder at the wwtp operated by the rüsselsheim raunheim sewerage and water board serving 98 500 inhabitants effluent rate approx 10 000 m3 d the wwtp consists of a mechanical treatment stage and a biological stage comprising upstream denitrification nitrification and biological phosphorus removal during the period of november 2017 to january 2018 seven grab samples were collected the sampling apparatus fig 1 consisted of a centrifugal pump vgx 9 10 speck pumpen verkaufsgesellschaft gmbh germany and a 10 μm cartridge filter acurascreen fuhr gmbh germany both made of stainless steel a stainless steel housing and a silicone hose technikplaza gmbh germany the sample collection setup was adapted from the sampling procedure reported by mintenig et al 2017 the cartridge filter was installed under laboratory conditions in the laminar flow box before sampling to prevent airborne contamination the samples were collected on three dry weather and four wet weather days table 1 prior to sampling the pump was rinsed via a bypass rinsing loop for 3 min since the total amount of microplastics in the wastewater effluent is very low compared to the amount of inorganic or natural organic solids the maximum possible amount of water was filtered the filtered water volume was measured by a flow meter installed in the filter effluent line and was about 100 l on average between 40 and 200 l after sampling the apparatus was thoroughly rinsed with tap water for 10 min followed by rinsing with 50 l deionized water 2 3 sample processing 2 3 1 chemical purification to obtain reliable results the mp must be isolated from the sample matrix as completely as possible while inorganic components can hide mp on the used silicon si filter see 2 3 2 organic material may lead to interfering fluorescence signals in raman spectroscopy removal of organic material e g activated sludge flocs and algae was accomplished by treatment with oxidizing chemicals after sampling the residual water in the cartridge filter housing was filtered through a disk shaped stainless steel filter spörl kg germany same specifications as the mesh of the stainless steel cartridge filter using an all glass vacuum filter merck kgaa germany the loaded stainless steel filter cartridge was removed from the housing placed into a 2 l beaker together with the stainless steel filter disk and treated with h2o2 c 50 pure grade bernd kraft gmbh germany at 50 c for 24 h both filters were then rinsed and removed next the sample was filtered through a stainless steel filter disk fig 2 left the loaded filter was transferred to a 1 l beaker and treated with 400 ml naclo c 12 technical grade carl roth gmbh co kg germany at room temperature for 6 days the prepared sample was passed through another stainless steel filter disk for further concentration fig 2 right 2 3 2 density separation inorganic particles e g sand glass etc were removed by centrifugation sigma 3 16 l in a zncl2 solution ρ 1 9 g cm3 pure grade carl roth gmbh co kg germany using an ultrasonic cleaner s 100 h elma schmidbauer gmbh germany the sample matrix was separated from the stainless steel filter disk and transferred to silicone centrifuge tubes in house construction fig 3 that had been specifically developed for this purpose silicone tubes offer the advantage that they can be pinched off above the level of the heavy fraction at the bottom therefore there is no risk of mixing the light fraction with the inorganic fraction at the tube bottom while pouring out the tube floating mp were recovered from the supernatant by decanting and multiple rinsing with n hexane by using a glass syringe fortuna optima 20 ml poulten graf gmbh germany the isolated mp were transferred to a si filter smartmembranes gmbh germany with a pore size of 10 μm and an area of 1 cm2 silicon was selected as a substrate because its raman signals does not mask the polymer spectra of interest and it does not produce interfering fluorescence käppler et al 2015 thus facilitating identification of the polymers other advantages of si filters are the smooth surface and the uniform filter pores to reduce the filtration area a stainless steel funnel in house construction was used for sample transfer to the si filter fig 3 the funnel reduces the diameter from 47 mm to 8 mm 2 4 raman microspectroscopy analysis was conducted using a raman microspectrometer dxr2xi thermo fisher scientific inc usa before scanning the sample with a 785 nm laser an optical image was generated at 100 magnification other spectroscopy parameters selected were a laser power of 20 mw an exposure time of 0 025 s and a repetition rate of 10 the recorded spectral data were compared with the reference spectral library st japan by the instrument software omnicxi thermo fisher scientific inc usa and read out as a chemical image identified mp are colour coded by the software to reduce the analysis time a cross shaped mapping area see mintenig et al 2017 was analyzed this sub area represented 32 of the total filter area and was extrapolated to the total filter area for evaluation mpps mpfs lying only partly in the mapping area were counted proportionally all identified mpps and mpfs were measured for the determination of the mpp diameter a mean value was determined from a minimum of two lengths each 2 5 method validation 2 5 1 recovery rate to quantify the sample losses during sample processing the recovery rates were determined for the 90 106 μm and 250 300 μm size classes for this purpose spherical pe particles cospheric llc usa of a defined diameter were counted before sampling and placed into the cartridge filter housing sampling sample processing and analysis were carried out as described in 2 2 2 4 recovery rates were determined for both the total filter area and the extrapolated cross shaped sub area see 2 4 to find out if the choosen sub area represents the number of mp the recovery rates of the mpp on the whole filter area and on the cross shaped extrapolated to the whole area were compared due to their shape and specific colour the particles can be readily identified and enumerated no recovery rates were determined for microplastic fibers mpfs 2 5 2 blanks sample contamination cannot be completely ruled out during the individual steps of the analysis procedure sources of contamination include airborne particles and fibers contamination of the lab equipment chemicals and the rinse water used to quantify the contamination during the steps of the analysis procedure the process was simulated without sample matrix the blank determined covers analysis procedure as described in 2 3 and 2 4 this includes the use of all chemicals and other materials cleaned filters stainless steel cartridge filters and stainless steel filter disks were used for this purpose the blank determination was carried out as a single determination 2 5 3 chemical resistance of plastics granulates of different polymers table 2 were exposed to h2o2 and naclo as well as zncl2 and n hexane to test them for their resistance to the sample processing methods applied 2 3 a duplicate determination was carried out for each polymer resin testing and assessment were conducted following the procedure described in din en iso 175 to the extent possible this norm specifies a method for the chemical treatment of plastic specimens and methods for determining the properties resulting from this treatment the following basic conditions are specified for the treatment in this norm type of chemicals test temperature test duration specimen dimensions to determine the properties after chemical treatment the following parameters are specified change of mass dimensions appearance other physical properties parameters like e g the test duration and the type of chemicals had to be adapted to suit the time scales of the analysis method after treatment with deionized water the granulates were cleaned and dried subsequently the test objects were analyzed for changes by gravimetry visual inspection shape size colour hardness and spectroscopy new material no regranulate was used throughout moreover only unpigmented plastics were examined the plastic granulates ranged between 2 and 5 mm in size and differed in their shapes cylindrical spherical lentil shaped 3 results and discussion 3 1 sampling the analyses described in this study relate to grab samples due to the high fraction of natural organic matter the maximum filterable water volume was low and varied between 40 and 200 l under these conditions it is difficult to collect composite samples for the samples to be representative composite samples are needed qualified grab samples could be a solution to improve the representativeness of the samples as against grab samples grab samples are unsuited for determining diurnal and weekly mp concentration profiles in future the maximum filterable volume of treated waste water could be increased by using a cascade of a minimum of two cartridge filters with different pore sizes 3 2 sample processing the 7 day oxidative treatment of the samples produced very good results fig 2 a shorter exposure period proved to be insufficient in preliminary trials reliable identification of the polymers depends on as complete a destruction of the organic polymers as possible 3 3 raman microspectroscopy in the case of spectroscopic methods there is a conflict of interests between a high signal to noise ratio and a short analysis time main factors affecting the analysis time are the step size the exposure time and the repetition rate according to the manufacturer of the raman spectrometer used in the present study a good signal to noise ratio is normally achieved with a repetition rate of 8 16 thermo scientific 2016 in preliminary trials the effect of different repetition rates n 10 20 30 40 50 was investigated for seven different polymer resins using single factor variance analysis anova no significant differences were observed to reduce the analysis time an exposure time of 0 025 s was selected for the raman analyses in the present study the instrument manufacturer recommends an exposure time of typically 1 10 s thermo scientific 2016 to obtain high signal to noise ratios despite the short exposure time a laser power of 20 mw was selected compared to other studies involving mp analyses by raman spectroscopy this is very high käppler et al 2015 wiesheu et al 2017 with current state of the art techniques an analysis of the entire filter area is highly time consuming with the selected instrument settings see 2 4 the analysis of 1 3 of the 50 mm2 filter area at a step size of 4 μm takes 72 h for a detection limit of 10 μm the selected step size should cover at least four measurement points per particle when adapting the step size for a detection limit of 1 μm the measurement of the sub area would take more than one year there are various methods to define and reduce the mapping area and extrapolate the particle count one method is the measurement of a crossed shaped area described by mintenig et al 2017 as a result of the cross shape the center of the sample is weighted more strongly than the areas of the cross arms a circular sector wiesheu et al 2017 would allow a more representative analysis of the mapping areas currently the omnicxi software only allows rectangular shapes for the creation of mappings when using an appropriate scaling technique the mapping areas could be weighted by their distance to the center as described by pittroff et al 2017 these extrapolation methods presuppose a uniform distribution of the mpps however this is not the case because of the swirling motion imparted to the sample when rinsing the stainless steel funnel see 2 3 2 on sample transfer to the si filter an evenly distributed pattern of measurement windows over the entire filter area would allow a more representative acquisition of the non uniform distribution the analysis time of 72 h should not be increased any further a chequerboard pattern of reduced squares across the entire filter area would be suitable to meet this target in this way hot spots and other conspicuous features could be better captured and evaluated a similar arrangement of measurement windows is used in asbestos fiber analysis vdi 3492 3 4 recovery rate for particles 250 300 μm a recovery rate of 90 was determined for the total filter area the recovery rate for the total filter area extrapolated from the cross shaped sub area was 47 for particles 90 106 μm the recovery rate was 66 for the total filter area the extrapolated recovery rate was 71 the recovery rates were determined using spherical pe particles of different size classes such primary mpps are rarely observed in a natural waste water matrix mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 biofilms on the particles or aged particles may have an impact on the particle behavior e g surface adsorption behavior the use of such defined particles only allows an approximate estimate of the recovery rate the recovery rates determined show that extrapolation of the particle counts for the cross shaped mapping area can lead to over or understatements further research will be needed in preliminary trials a recovery rate of 80 was found for particles 250 300 μm the recovery rate for particles 90 106 μm was 83 in these trials the complete filter area was analyzed without extrapolation compared to the preliminary trials minor modifications were made to the procedural steps in this study for this reason the recovery rates of 47 and 71 determined for particles 250 300 μm and particles 90 106 μm respectively were classified as single determinations the great variations between the recovery rates determined in the preliminary trials and the present study are partly attributable to the extrapolation of the particle count for the non representative cross shaped measurement sub area further recovery studies will be needed 3 5 blank extrapolated to the total filter area three pet particles and seven pet fibers six pp particles and 25 ptfe particles were identified in addition 16 cobalt blue and copper phthalocyanine colour pigments were detected that could not be assigned to a polymer for nine particles no match was found in the reference spectral library the few pp and pet particles are likely to have been introduced via the indoor air or contaminated equipment pet fibers can also enter the sample via these pathways as polyester fibers widely used in textiles normally also consists of pet baur et al 2013 sample contamination with airborne textile fibers is likely of particular note are the determined ptfe particles given its density of 2 1 2 2 g m 3 baur et al 2013 ptfe should actually have been separated in the density separation step ptfe is used as a material for chemical process equipment for anti stick surface finishes and other surface coatings woebcken et al 1998 introduction via the laboratory tools and equipment cannot be ruled out the low blank value testifies to good laboratories practices and confirms the precautions and measures taken to prevent plastic contamination of the laboratory materials and equipment a minimum of three blanks have to be run to be able to make a statistical statement 3 6 chemical resistance of plastics raw material manufacturers have published laboratory test results on the chemical resistance of their products bürkle gmbh 2017 these results can be used as a reference for the durability of polymer resins the chemical resistance tests performed as part of this study complement the raw material manufacturers information they provide a clearer picture of the resistance of the polymers studied under the conditions of the applied mp analysis procedure the results from the chemical resistance test of the plastic granulates are summarized in table 3 the chemical resistance is ranked as follows adapted from bürkle gmbh 2017 1 highly resistant 2 resistant 3 conditionally resistant 4 not resistant the tests showed that eva pa6 ehlamid b natur 1000 and pu exhibit poor resistance to the chemicals employed these plastic granulates showed changes in shape mass the raman spectrum and partly also in colour the ps granulate was classified as conditionally resistant as it showed major changes in the surface structure after treatment the pa6 durethan b30s granulate is chemically resistant under the conditions of the test method pla pet and pvc exhibited a minor change in the visual appearance of the surface texture but did not show any fractionation so that they were classified as resistant fractionation was only observed with pa6 ehlamid b natur 1000 unlike the tested starting materials pc and abs the pc abs mixture exhibited a slightly changed surface texture after treatment san abs pc ldpe hdpe and pp showed no changes in the characteristics investigated and were classified as highly resistant the pe pet pp and pvc polymers frequently encountered in waste water samples exhibit good to very good chemical resistance under the conditions of the analysis procedure applied of particular note is the difference in the chemical resistance between the two different pa6 granulates according to bürkle gmbh 2017 pa is not resistant to the applied chemicals depending on the application plastics are blended with copolymers or additives domininghaus et al 2012 therefore a general statement on their resistance is not possible based on the observed poor chemical resistance observed with eva pa6 ad pu these polymers cannot be determined with the analysis procedure applied in this study 3 7 microplastics in the wwtp effluent the size distribution of the measured particles in all samples is summarized in table 4 approx 95 of all particles were in the 10 dp 30 μm and 30 dp 100 μm size classes few particles had a dp 100 μm and only two particles from the samples had a dp 500 μm the minimum mpp size in all samples was 10 μm and the maximum mpp size was 1000 μm the mp size classes in the dry and wet weather samples show a similar distribution particles tend to be larger in dry weather conditions and smaller in wet weather conditions all mp count results are rounded to two significant digits due to the sampling procedure grab sample and the extrapolation from the measured sub area to the total filter area the size distribution of the mpfs is presented in table 5 more than 80 of the mpfs had a length of between 100 μm and 1000 μm 58 of the mpfs had a fiber width of between 10 μm and 30 μm the minimum mpf length was 20 μm and width 2 μm the maximum mpf length was 3600 μm and width 180 μm fig 4 shows the extrapolated particle count results per sample blanks and recovery rates were not considered because of the single determination see 2 5 1 and 2 5 2 the highest particle count at 7900 mpps m 3 was found in sample 5 the lowest particle count at 1200 mpps m 3 in sample 1 pet pe pp and ps polymers were identified in each sample pet accounted for the largest share in all samples pvc was detected in three samples polymethyl methacrylate pmma and phenoxy resin were only found in sample 7 polysulfone psu only occurred in sample 5 the mean value across all samples was 3500 mpps m 3 the mpf counts for the individual samples are compiled in fig 5 the highest mpf count at 2500 m 3 was found in sample 5 wet weather sample with the shortest retention time in the wwtp the lowest mpf count at 300 m 3 in sample 1 in samples 2 7 the pet fiber fraction dominates pe fibers were detected only in sample 2 psu fibers occurred only in sample 1 the mean value across all samples was 1100 mpfs m 3 fig 6 plots the mpp and mpf counts as a function of the retention time of the waste water in the wwtp dry weather samples retention time 40 h tend to contain fewer fibers and particles than wet weather samples on average the wet weather samples contained 4500 mpps m 3 and 1500 mpfs m 3 the average mpp and mpf counts in the dry weather samples were 2300 m 3 and 730 m 3 respectively the mpp and mpf size distributions and the different polymer types identified underline the diversity of the matrix examined from a particle size of dp 100 μm it can be assumed that smaller particles will be hidden by these larger particles this particle size is present in minor proportions obviating the need for additional sample fractionation the result of mintenig et al 2017 that most of the mpps in municipal wwtp effluents are sized 500 μm was confirmed by the present work the small number of larger particles in the treated effluent suggests that these are separated with the excess sludge mintenig et al 2017 reports that 59 of the detected particles range between 50 μm and 100 μm in size in the present study 60 of all the mpps found in the dry weather samples can be assigned to a comparable size class 30 μm 100 μm table 4 due to the small number of grab samples analyzed a statistically significant correlation between the retention time and the mp count cannot be established the samples analyzed are indicative of an elevated particle input during wet weather and at short retention times in the wwtp for the results to be statistically significant the number of samples analyzed would have to be increased significantly alternatively representative results could be obtained by qualified grab samples the elevated mp count in the wwtp effluent during precipitation events can be explained by the higher flow velocity and hence the poorer settlability of the particles moreover mp can enter the water cycle via urban surface runoff andrady 2011 dris et al 2015 the total dry weather mp load determined is in good agreement with the loads reported by mintenig et al 2017 who analyzed exclusively dry weather samples with an average dry weather total load of 3000 mpps mpfs m 3 the rüsselsheim raunheim wwtp lies in the range of the schillig approx 2 103 mpps mpfs m 3 and holdorf wwtps approx 1 4 104 mpps mpfs m 3 mentioned in mintenig et al 2017 in the wwtp effluents examined by mintenig et al 2017 polyester fibers predominated this is confirmed by the results of the present study it is obvious that the polyester fibers originate from textiles and have entered the wwtp effluent via the residential waste water introduction via the washing of polyester fiber containing clothes decreases with increasing number of washings and the release of fibers during tumble drying is approx 3 5 times higher than during washing pirc et al 2016 in a danish study denmark s ten largest wwtps were sampled particle sizes between 20 and 500 μm were detected during dry weather 5800 mpps l 1 were found on average pe pa and pp were identified in the wwtp effluent pa accounting for the largest share fibers were not considered in the study vollertsen et al 2017 in a further study the above mentioned ten largest wwtps in denmark were examined as well simon et al 2018 with an average number of 120 mpps l 1 the results indicate a significant lower count of microplastic particles than the previous study nevertheless the results mentioned are high compared to other studies it remains to be clarified whether danish wwtps emit multiple times more mpps than the wwtps in lower saxony or the rüsselsheim raunheim wwtp based on the results of various studies miklos et al 2016 calculated the median of the mp count per m3 of water from various surface waters arriving at 3 28 mpps m 3 the quantity of mpps emitted by wwtps is multiple times higher mp emissions can be further reduced by an additional treatment stage especially by a membrane separation process or by adding activated carbon followed by cloth or sand filtration thus mintenig et al 2017 report that tertiary filtration cloth media disk filter at the oldenburg wwtp reduces the mp count by another 97 4 conclusion with the determination of the mp emission from a wwtp by raman microspectroscopy this study makes a contribution to identifying pathways of mp emissions to the environment the characterisation of the mp load is crucial to the assessment of potential environmental impacts visual detection methods do not allow a reliable identification of mpps due to major variations in the analysis methods applied results are hardly comparable across research groups a standardization of the sample processing and analysis procedures is needed based on the long analysis time with raman and ftir measurements currently many research groups are analyzing only a sub area of the filter this could lead to false results since there is no homogenius particle distribution on the filter an automated analysis method is currently under development the aim is to further reduce the overall analysis time by excluding filter areas without particles from the measurement analyzing mp in environmental samples is a critical component to estimate their abundance and identify emission pathways in a next step mp separation from waste water e g by flocculation and subsequent sedimentation or flotation should be investigated the long term goal is to prevent mp releases to the environment for mp emissions into aquatic systems via wwtp effluents this means the identification of emission sources moreover a comparative study of mp releases through surface runoff and residential waste water in the sewer system would be helpful if the main sources of plastics in the wwtp influent are known mp releases to aquatic environments can be mitigated through appropriate treatment systems and education of industrial dischargers and consumers acknowledgements this study was funded by haw hessen association of hessian universities of applied sciences 
20018,samples from the secondary clarifier effluent of a waste water treatment plant serving 98500 inhabitants were analyzed to determine the microplastics mp emission the samples were collected using a stainless steel centrifugal pump and filtered through a 10 μm stainless steel cartridge filter microplastics particles mpps and microplastics fibers mpfs were recovered by chemical and physical sample purification to remove natural organic matter the samples were first subjected to oxidative treatment with h2o2 and naclo inorganic materials were subsequently removed by density separation in zncl2 ρ 1 9 g cm3 using a centrifuge special centrifuge tubes were developed for this purpose sample analysis was performed on a si filter by raman micro spectroscopy particles with a diameter dp 10 μm were analyzed the results were differentiated by dry and wet weather samples on average 5900 mpps m 3 were identified in the effluent on wet weather days compared to 3000 mpps m 3 on dry weather days most of the mpps detected were in the 30 μm dp 100 μm size range the mpfs ranged between 100 μm and 1000 μm in length while most of the mpfs were of pet origin the mpps consisted mainly of pet pp pe and ps graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics emission wwtp effluent oxidative treatment centrifugation raman microspectroscopy si filter 1 introduction plastics have been mass produced for more than sixty years their high durability on exposure to the most diverse media and environmental conditions combined with their versatile manufacturing methods and applications have made plastics highly attractive materials in our modern society ehrenstein and pongratz 2007 since 1950 world production of plastics has been continuously expanding plasticseurope 2009 2018 there are manifold pathways by which plastics are introduced into the environment plastics enter the water cycle through wind entrainment urban surface runoff 1 1 surface runoff to the sewer system during precipitation events or improper disposal practices and ultimately end up in the sea dris et al 2015 estimates for 2010 show that up to 12 7 million tonnes of plastics entered the oceans through riverine inputs worldwide jambeck et al 2015 mp is ubiquitous in marine ecosystems and many inland waters wu et al 2018 plastics input into the environment through anthropogenic sources is substantial and still increasing under the influence of abiotic e g uv radiation and biotic processes biodegradation plastic items break down into increasingly smaller particles ojeda et al 2011 andrady 2011 forming secondary mp mp have been defined as synthetic organic polymer particles with a size of 5 mm particles 1 mm are sometimes referred to as small mpps there is no standard definition moore 2008 browne et al 2008 miklos et al 2016 the lower size boundary for mpps is 100 nm particles smaller than 100 nm are classified as nanoparticles iso ts 80004 2 2015 primary mp include particles that are purposefully manufactured in the required sizes for use as fillers or abrasives in paints and toothpaste lassen et al 2015 from ecotoxicological aspects mp are a source of concern as they can be mistaken for food and ingested by marine organisms thompson et al 2004 browne et al 2008 setälä et al 2014 studies have demonstrated that organic pollutants are sorbed to plastics at concentrations multiple times higher than in natural sediments teuten et al 2007 once ingested additives contained in or pollutants sorbed onto plastics can be released again in organisms batel et al 2016 in vertebrates and invertebrates mp ingestion can lead to reduced growth and fecundity physical damage to the digestive tract through intestinal blockage impaired enzyme production and adverse effects on the hormone level etc wright et al 2013 currently many research groups are engaged in the analysis of mp in surface waters sediments living organisms food and hygiene products in many mp studies light microscopy was used for sample analysis a comparison of the visually identified mpps and mpfs with analysis results from ftir and raman spectroscopy has shown that up to 70 of the finds are false positives hidalgo ruz et al 2012 lenz et al 2015 the reliability of visual identification methods decreases significantly in particular for mpps 100 μm lenz et al 2015 analysis by ftir spectroscopy reaches detection limits of down to 20 μm löder et al 2012 raman microspectroscopy can identify particles down to 1 μm in size ivleva et al 2017 and pyrolysis gc ms allows the polymer types of particles 100 μm to be identified dekiff et al 2014 so far there are very few studies using raman or ftir spectroscopy for mp analysis in waste water therefore in the present work an analysis method was developed to determine the mp concentration in the secondary clarifier effluent of a municipal waste water treatment plant wwtp using raman microspectroscopy the effluent sample from the secondary clarifier was concentrated on a stainless steel cartridge filter subsequent sample processing involved oxidative treatment to decompose natural organic matter present followed by density separation to remove inorganic material there are several different approaches to density separation the common feature is the use of a salt solution with high density e g zncl2 nai sodium polytungstate etc to separate mp from inorganic particles in some studies a separation funnel is used for separation mintenig et al 2017 vollertsen et al 2017 and in other studies a centrifuge is used carr et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 gündoğdu et al 2018 when using a separation funnel especially small particles are adsorbed at the glass wall of the thin outlet using a centrifuge it is not possible to quantitatively transfer mp by simply decanting within the scope of this study the method of centrifugation was further developed by using flexible centrifuge tubes made of silicone quantitative transfer of mp is possible therefor the silicone tube is being pinched off and then decanted adsorbed mp can be rinsed off multiple times subsequently 2 materials and methods 2 1 equipment and materials to minimize sample contamination through airborne fibers particles virtually all work steps were conducted in a laminar flow box msc advantage 12 thermo fisher scientific inc usa contamination through plastic tools materials was minimized by using glass and stainless steel equipment with the following exceptions polyethylene pe polypropylene pp original chemical containers polycarbonate pc filter membrane for water and chemicals filtration acrylonitrile butadiene rubber nbr and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe pump seal silicone pump inlet hose filter gasket centrifuge tubes perfluoroalkoxy polymer resin pfa squirt bottle nbr ptfe pfa and pc do not count among the plastics normally encountered in municipal waste water mintenig et al 2017 and were therefore not considered in the analyses as the use of silicone was unavoidable silicone was not considered either pe and pp were analyzed because all chemicals were filtered through an 0 6 μm fiberglass filter mn85 70 bf macherey nagel gmbh co kg germany and an 8 μm polycarbonate filter tetp 04700 merck kgaa germany prior to use in order to remove particulate contaminants the polycarbonate filter was used to retain glass fibers entrained from the fiberglass filter the equipment and materials used were rinsed with filtered deionized water prior to use rinses with filtered deionized water and n hexane hipersolv chromanorm vwr usa were carried out after each work step to ensure quantitative recovery of the mpps because of its non polar properties n hexane lends itself to the removal of adhering particles from surfaces preliminary trials with fluorescent tracer particles cospheric llc usa had shown that particles 20 μm can be quantitatively transferred by rinsing with hexane this is not possible with water the deionized water was produced in a reverse osmosis unit os 3050 h e gmbh germany and then filtered using the same method as for the other chemicals employed see above 2 2 sampling the water samples were collected in the secondary clarifier effluent launder at the wwtp operated by the rüsselsheim raunheim sewerage and water board serving 98 500 inhabitants effluent rate approx 10 000 m3 d the wwtp consists of a mechanical treatment stage and a biological stage comprising upstream denitrification nitrification and biological phosphorus removal during the period of november 2017 to january 2018 seven grab samples were collected the sampling apparatus fig 1 consisted of a centrifugal pump vgx 9 10 speck pumpen verkaufsgesellschaft gmbh germany and a 10 μm cartridge filter acurascreen fuhr gmbh germany both made of stainless steel a stainless steel housing and a silicone hose technikplaza gmbh germany the sample collection setup was adapted from the sampling procedure reported by mintenig et al 2017 the cartridge filter was installed under laboratory conditions in the laminar flow box before sampling to prevent airborne contamination the samples were collected on three dry weather and four wet weather days table 1 prior to sampling the pump was rinsed via a bypass rinsing loop for 3 min since the total amount of microplastics in the wastewater effluent is very low compared to the amount of inorganic or natural organic solids the maximum possible amount of water was filtered the filtered water volume was measured by a flow meter installed in the filter effluent line and was about 100 l on average between 40 and 200 l after sampling the apparatus was thoroughly rinsed with tap water for 10 min followed by rinsing with 50 l deionized water 2 3 sample processing 2 3 1 chemical purification to obtain reliable results the mp must be isolated from the sample matrix as completely as possible while inorganic components can hide mp on the used silicon si filter see 2 3 2 organic material may lead to interfering fluorescence signals in raman spectroscopy removal of organic material e g activated sludge flocs and algae was accomplished by treatment with oxidizing chemicals after sampling the residual water in the cartridge filter housing was filtered through a disk shaped stainless steel filter spörl kg germany same specifications as the mesh of the stainless steel cartridge filter using an all glass vacuum filter merck kgaa germany the loaded stainless steel filter cartridge was removed from the housing placed into a 2 l beaker together with the stainless steel filter disk and treated with h2o2 c 50 pure grade bernd kraft gmbh germany at 50 c for 24 h both filters were then rinsed and removed next the sample was filtered through a stainless steel filter disk fig 2 left the loaded filter was transferred to a 1 l beaker and treated with 400 ml naclo c 12 technical grade carl roth gmbh co kg germany at room temperature for 6 days the prepared sample was passed through another stainless steel filter disk for further concentration fig 2 right 2 3 2 density separation inorganic particles e g sand glass etc were removed by centrifugation sigma 3 16 l in a zncl2 solution ρ 1 9 g cm3 pure grade carl roth gmbh co kg germany using an ultrasonic cleaner s 100 h elma schmidbauer gmbh germany the sample matrix was separated from the stainless steel filter disk and transferred to silicone centrifuge tubes in house construction fig 3 that had been specifically developed for this purpose silicone tubes offer the advantage that they can be pinched off above the level of the heavy fraction at the bottom therefore there is no risk of mixing the light fraction with the inorganic fraction at the tube bottom while pouring out the tube floating mp were recovered from the supernatant by decanting and multiple rinsing with n hexane by using a glass syringe fortuna optima 20 ml poulten graf gmbh germany the isolated mp were transferred to a si filter smartmembranes gmbh germany with a pore size of 10 μm and an area of 1 cm2 silicon was selected as a substrate because its raman signals does not mask the polymer spectra of interest and it does not produce interfering fluorescence käppler et al 2015 thus facilitating identification of the polymers other advantages of si filters are the smooth surface and the uniform filter pores to reduce the filtration area a stainless steel funnel in house construction was used for sample transfer to the si filter fig 3 the funnel reduces the diameter from 47 mm to 8 mm 2 4 raman microspectroscopy analysis was conducted using a raman microspectrometer dxr2xi thermo fisher scientific inc usa before scanning the sample with a 785 nm laser an optical image was generated at 100 magnification other spectroscopy parameters selected were a laser power of 20 mw an exposure time of 0 025 s and a repetition rate of 10 the recorded spectral data were compared with the reference spectral library st japan by the instrument software omnicxi thermo fisher scientific inc usa and read out as a chemical image identified mp are colour coded by the software to reduce the analysis time a cross shaped mapping area see mintenig et al 2017 was analyzed this sub area represented 32 of the total filter area and was extrapolated to the total filter area for evaluation mpps mpfs lying only partly in the mapping area were counted proportionally all identified mpps and mpfs were measured for the determination of the mpp diameter a mean value was determined from a minimum of two lengths each 2 5 method validation 2 5 1 recovery rate to quantify the sample losses during sample processing the recovery rates were determined for the 90 106 μm and 250 300 μm size classes for this purpose spherical pe particles cospheric llc usa of a defined diameter were counted before sampling and placed into the cartridge filter housing sampling sample processing and analysis were carried out as described in 2 2 2 4 recovery rates were determined for both the total filter area and the extrapolated cross shaped sub area see 2 4 to find out if the choosen sub area represents the number of mp the recovery rates of the mpp on the whole filter area and on the cross shaped extrapolated to the whole area were compared due to their shape and specific colour the particles can be readily identified and enumerated no recovery rates were determined for microplastic fibers mpfs 2 5 2 blanks sample contamination cannot be completely ruled out during the individual steps of the analysis procedure sources of contamination include airborne particles and fibers contamination of the lab equipment chemicals and the rinse water used to quantify the contamination during the steps of the analysis procedure the process was simulated without sample matrix the blank determined covers analysis procedure as described in 2 3 and 2 4 this includes the use of all chemicals and other materials cleaned filters stainless steel cartridge filters and stainless steel filter disks were used for this purpose the blank determination was carried out as a single determination 2 5 3 chemical resistance of plastics granulates of different polymers table 2 were exposed to h2o2 and naclo as well as zncl2 and n hexane to test them for their resistance to the sample processing methods applied 2 3 a duplicate determination was carried out for each polymer resin testing and assessment were conducted following the procedure described in din en iso 175 to the extent possible this norm specifies a method for the chemical treatment of plastic specimens and methods for determining the properties resulting from this treatment the following basic conditions are specified for the treatment in this norm type of chemicals test temperature test duration specimen dimensions to determine the properties after chemical treatment the following parameters are specified change of mass dimensions appearance other physical properties parameters like e g the test duration and the type of chemicals had to be adapted to suit the time scales of the analysis method after treatment with deionized water the granulates were cleaned and dried subsequently the test objects were analyzed for changes by gravimetry visual inspection shape size colour hardness and spectroscopy new material no regranulate was used throughout moreover only unpigmented plastics were examined the plastic granulates ranged between 2 and 5 mm in size and differed in their shapes cylindrical spherical lentil shaped 3 results and discussion 3 1 sampling the analyses described in this study relate to grab samples due to the high fraction of natural organic matter the maximum filterable water volume was low and varied between 40 and 200 l under these conditions it is difficult to collect composite samples for the samples to be representative composite samples are needed qualified grab samples could be a solution to improve the representativeness of the samples as against grab samples grab samples are unsuited for determining diurnal and weekly mp concentration profiles in future the maximum filterable volume of treated waste water could be increased by using a cascade of a minimum of two cartridge filters with different pore sizes 3 2 sample processing the 7 day oxidative treatment of the samples produced very good results fig 2 a shorter exposure period proved to be insufficient in preliminary trials reliable identification of the polymers depends on as complete a destruction of the organic polymers as possible 3 3 raman microspectroscopy in the case of spectroscopic methods there is a conflict of interests between a high signal to noise ratio and a short analysis time main factors affecting the analysis time are the step size the exposure time and the repetition rate according to the manufacturer of the raman spectrometer used in the present study a good signal to noise ratio is normally achieved with a repetition rate of 8 16 thermo scientific 2016 in preliminary trials the effect of different repetition rates n 10 20 30 40 50 was investigated for seven different polymer resins using single factor variance analysis anova no significant differences were observed to reduce the analysis time an exposure time of 0 025 s was selected for the raman analyses in the present study the instrument manufacturer recommends an exposure time of typically 1 10 s thermo scientific 2016 to obtain high signal to noise ratios despite the short exposure time a laser power of 20 mw was selected compared to other studies involving mp analyses by raman spectroscopy this is very high käppler et al 2015 wiesheu et al 2017 with current state of the art techniques an analysis of the entire filter area is highly time consuming with the selected instrument settings see 2 4 the analysis of 1 3 of the 50 mm2 filter area at a step size of 4 μm takes 72 h for a detection limit of 10 μm the selected step size should cover at least four measurement points per particle when adapting the step size for a detection limit of 1 μm the measurement of the sub area would take more than one year there are various methods to define and reduce the mapping area and extrapolate the particle count one method is the measurement of a crossed shaped area described by mintenig et al 2017 as a result of the cross shape the center of the sample is weighted more strongly than the areas of the cross arms a circular sector wiesheu et al 2017 would allow a more representative analysis of the mapping areas currently the omnicxi software only allows rectangular shapes for the creation of mappings when using an appropriate scaling technique the mapping areas could be weighted by their distance to the center as described by pittroff et al 2017 these extrapolation methods presuppose a uniform distribution of the mpps however this is not the case because of the swirling motion imparted to the sample when rinsing the stainless steel funnel see 2 3 2 on sample transfer to the si filter an evenly distributed pattern of measurement windows over the entire filter area would allow a more representative acquisition of the non uniform distribution the analysis time of 72 h should not be increased any further a chequerboard pattern of reduced squares across the entire filter area would be suitable to meet this target in this way hot spots and other conspicuous features could be better captured and evaluated a similar arrangement of measurement windows is used in asbestos fiber analysis vdi 3492 3 4 recovery rate for particles 250 300 μm a recovery rate of 90 was determined for the total filter area the recovery rate for the total filter area extrapolated from the cross shaped sub area was 47 for particles 90 106 μm the recovery rate was 66 for the total filter area the extrapolated recovery rate was 71 the recovery rates were determined using spherical pe particles of different size classes such primary mpps are rarely observed in a natural waste water matrix mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 biofilms on the particles or aged particles may have an impact on the particle behavior e g surface adsorption behavior the use of such defined particles only allows an approximate estimate of the recovery rate the recovery rates determined show that extrapolation of the particle counts for the cross shaped mapping area can lead to over or understatements further research will be needed in preliminary trials a recovery rate of 80 was found for particles 250 300 μm the recovery rate for particles 90 106 μm was 83 in these trials the complete filter area was analyzed without extrapolation compared to the preliminary trials minor modifications were made to the procedural steps in this study for this reason the recovery rates of 47 and 71 determined for particles 250 300 μm and particles 90 106 μm respectively were classified as single determinations the great variations between the recovery rates determined in the preliminary trials and the present study are partly attributable to the extrapolation of the particle count for the non representative cross shaped measurement sub area further recovery studies will be needed 3 5 blank extrapolated to the total filter area three pet particles and seven pet fibers six pp particles and 25 ptfe particles were identified in addition 16 cobalt blue and copper phthalocyanine colour pigments were detected that could not be assigned to a polymer for nine particles no match was found in the reference spectral library the few pp and pet particles are likely to have been introduced via the indoor air or contaminated equipment pet fibers can also enter the sample via these pathways as polyester fibers widely used in textiles normally also consists of pet baur et al 2013 sample contamination with airborne textile fibers is likely of particular note are the determined ptfe particles given its density of 2 1 2 2 g m 3 baur et al 2013 ptfe should actually have been separated in the density separation step ptfe is used as a material for chemical process equipment for anti stick surface finishes and other surface coatings woebcken et al 1998 introduction via the laboratory tools and equipment cannot be ruled out the low blank value testifies to good laboratories practices and confirms the precautions and measures taken to prevent plastic contamination of the laboratory materials and equipment a minimum of three blanks have to be run to be able to make a statistical statement 3 6 chemical resistance of plastics raw material manufacturers have published laboratory test results on the chemical resistance of their products bürkle gmbh 2017 these results can be used as a reference for the durability of polymer resins the chemical resistance tests performed as part of this study complement the raw material manufacturers information they provide a clearer picture of the resistance of the polymers studied under the conditions of the applied mp analysis procedure the results from the chemical resistance test of the plastic granulates are summarized in table 3 the chemical resistance is ranked as follows adapted from bürkle gmbh 2017 1 highly resistant 2 resistant 3 conditionally resistant 4 not resistant the tests showed that eva pa6 ehlamid b natur 1000 and pu exhibit poor resistance to the chemicals employed these plastic granulates showed changes in shape mass the raman spectrum and partly also in colour the ps granulate was classified as conditionally resistant as it showed major changes in the surface structure after treatment the pa6 durethan b30s granulate is chemically resistant under the conditions of the test method pla pet and pvc exhibited a minor change in the visual appearance of the surface texture but did not show any fractionation so that they were classified as resistant fractionation was only observed with pa6 ehlamid b natur 1000 unlike the tested starting materials pc and abs the pc abs mixture exhibited a slightly changed surface texture after treatment san abs pc ldpe hdpe and pp showed no changes in the characteristics investigated and were classified as highly resistant the pe pet pp and pvc polymers frequently encountered in waste water samples exhibit good to very good chemical resistance under the conditions of the analysis procedure applied of particular note is the difference in the chemical resistance between the two different pa6 granulates according to bürkle gmbh 2017 pa is not resistant to the applied chemicals depending on the application plastics are blended with copolymers or additives domininghaus et al 2012 therefore a general statement on their resistance is not possible based on the observed poor chemical resistance observed with eva pa6 ad pu these polymers cannot be determined with the analysis procedure applied in this study 3 7 microplastics in the wwtp effluent the size distribution of the measured particles in all samples is summarized in table 4 approx 95 of all particles were in the 10 dp 30 μm and 30 dp 100 μm size classes few particles had a dp 100 μm and only two particles from the samples had a dp 500 μm the minimum mpp size in all samples was 10 μm and the maximum mpp size was 1000 μm the mp size classes in the dry and wet weather samples show a similar distribution particles tend to be larger in dry weather conditions and smaller in wet weather conditions all mp count results are rounded to two significant digits due to the sampling procedure grab sample and the extrapolation from the measured sub area to the total filter area the size distribution of the mpfs is presented in table 5 more than 80 of the mpfs had a length of between 100 μm and 1000 μm 58 of the mpfs had a fiber width of between 10 μm and 30 μm the minimum mpf length was 20 μm and width 2 μm the maximum mpf length was 3600 μm and width 180 μm fig 4 shows the extrapolated particle count results per sample blanks and recovery rates were not considered because of the single determination see 2 5 1 and 2 5 2 the highest particle count at 7900 mpps m 3 was found in sample 5 the lowest particle count at 1200 mpps m 3 in sample 1 pet pe pp and ps polymers were identified in each sample pet accounted for the largest share in all samples pvc was detected in three samples polymethyl methacrylate pmma and phenoxy resin were only found in sample 7 polysulfone psu only occurred in sample 5 the mean value across all samples was 3500 mpps m 3 the mpf counts for the individual samples are compiled in fig 5 the highest mpf count at 2500 m 3 was found in sample 5 wet weather sample with the shortest retention time in the wwtp the lowest mpf count at 300 m 3 in sample 1 in samples 2 7 the pet fiber fraction dominates pe fibers were detected only in sample 2 psu fibers occurred only in sample 1 the mean value across all samples was 1100 mpfs m 3 fig 6 plots the mpp and mpf counts as a function of the retention time of the waste water in the wwtp dry weather samples retention time 40 h tend to contain fewer fibers and particles than wet weather samples on average the wet weather samples contained 4500 mpps m 3 and 1500 mpfs m 3 the average mpp and mpf counts in the dry weather samples were 2300 m 3 and 730 m 3 respectively the mpp and mpf size distributions and the different polymer types identified underline the diversity of the matrix examined from a particle size of dp 100 μm it can be assumed that smaller particles will be hidden by these larger particles this particle size is present in minor proportions obviating the need for additional sample fractionation the result of mintenig et al 2017 that most of the mpps in municipal wwtp effluents are sized 500 μm was confirmed by the present work the small number of larger particles in the treated effluent suggests that these are separated with the excess sludge mintenig et al 2017 reports that 59 of the detected particles range between 50 μm and 100 μm in size in the present study 60 of all the mpps found in the dry weather samples can be assigned to a comparable size class 30 μm 100 μm table 4 due to the small number of grab samples analyzed a statistically significant correlation between the retention time and the mp count cannot be established the samples analyzed are indicative of an elevated particle input during wet weather and at short retention times in the wwtp for the results to be statistically significant the number of samples analyzed would have to be increased significantly alternatively representative results could be obtained by qualified grab samples the elevated mp count in the wwtp effluent during precipitation events can be explained by the higher flow velocity and hence the poorer settlability of the particles moreover mp can enter the water cycle via urban surface runoff andrady 2011 dris et al 2015 the total dry weather mp load determined is in good agreement with the loads reported by mintenig et al 2017 who analyzed exclusively dry weather samples with an average dry weather total load of 3000 mpps mpfs m 3 the rüsselsheim raunheim wwtp lies in the range of the schillig approx 2 103 mpps mpfs m 3 and holdorf wwtps approx 1 4 104 mpps mpfs m 3 mentioned in mintenig et al 2017 in the wwtp effluents examined by mintenig et al 2017 polyester fibers predominated this is confirmed by the results of the present study it is obvious that the polyester fibers originate from textiles and have entered the wwtp effluent via the residential waste water introduction via the washing of polyester fiber containing clothes decreases with increasing number of washings and the release of fibers during tumble drying is approx 3 5 times higher than during washing pirc et al 2016 in a danish study denmark s ten largest wwtps were sampled particle sizes between 20 and 500 μm were detected during dry weather 5800 mpps l 1 were found on average pe pa and pp were identified in the wwtp effluent pa accounting for the largest share fibers were not considered in the study vollertsen et al 2017 in a further study the above mentioned ten largest wwtps in denmark were examined as well simon et al 2018 with an average number of 120 mpps l 1 the results indicate a significant lower count of microplastic particles than the previous study nevertheless the results mentioned are high compared to other studies it remains to be clarified whether danish wwtps emit multiple times more mpps than the wwtps in lower saxony or the rüsselsheim raunheim wwtp based on the results of various studies miklos et al 2016 calculated the median of the mp count per m3 of water from various surface waters arriving at 3 28 mpps m 3 the quantity of mpps emitted by wwtps is multiple times higher mp emissions can be further reduced by an additional treatment stage especially by a membrane separation process or by adding activated carbon followed by cloth or sand filtration thus mintenig et al 2017 report that tertiary filtration cloth media disk filter at the oldenburg wwtp reduces the mp count by another 97 4 conclusion with the determination of the mp emission from a wwtp by raman microspectroscopy this study makes a contribution to identifying pathways of mp emissions to the environment the characterisation of the mp load is crucial to the assessment of potential environmental impacts visual detection methods do not allow a reliable identification of mpps due to major variations in the analysis methods applied results are hardly comparable across research groups a standardization of the sample processing and analysis procedures is needed based on the long analysis time with raman and ftir measurements currently many research groups are analyzing only a sub area of the filter this could lead to false results since there is no homogenius particle distribution on the filter an automated analysis method is currently under development the aim is to further reduce the overall analysis time by excluding filter areas without particles from the measurement analyzing mp in environmental samples is a critical component to estimate their abundance and identify emission pathways in a next step mp separation from waste water e g by flocculation and subsequent sedimentation or flotation should be investigated the long term goal is to prevent mp releases to the environment for mp emissions into aquatic systems via wwtp effluents this means the identification of emission sources moreover a comparative study of mp releases through surface runoff and residential waste water in the sewer system would be helpful if the main sources of plastics in the wwtp influent are known mp releases to aquatic environments can be mitigated through appropriate treatment systems and education of industrial dischargers and consumers acknowledgements this

20019,culture based methods to measure escherichia coli e coli are used by beach administrators to inform whether bacteria levels represent an elevated risk to swimmers since results take up to 12 h statistical models are used to forecast bacteria levels in lieu of test results however they underestimate days with elevated fecal indicator bacteria levels quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr tests return results within 3 h but are 2 5 times more expensive than culture based methods this paper presents a prediction model which uses limited deployments of qpcr tested sites with inter beach correlation to predict when bacteria will exceed acceptable thresholds the model can be used to inform management decisions on when to warn residents or close beaches due to exposure to the bacteria using data from chicago collected between 2006 and 2016 the model proposed in this paper increased sensitivity from 3 4 percent to 11 2 percent a 230 percent increase we find that the correlation between beaches are substantial enough to provide higher levels of precision and sensitivity to predictive models thus limited deployments of qpcr testing can be used to deliver better predictions for beach administrators at lower cost and less complexity keywords random forest escherichia coli recreational water quality fecal indicator bacteria chicago 1 introduction swimming in recreational waters contaminated with high levels of fecal indicator bacteria fib is associated with higher incidence of gastrointestinal gi illnesses prüss 1998 the risk of exposure is associated with the amount of fib measured in the water a logarithmic increase in average enterococcus was associated with a 1 4 increase in the odds ratio of contracting gi illness wade et al 2006 evidence also suggests that children are more likely to contract gi illnesses when exposed to the same contaminated water as adults wade et al 2008 to prevent this managers of recreational beaches use culture based methods to measure fib levels sampling is typically conducted early in the morning but results take upward of 12 h kinzelman et al 2003 between the time of sampling and subsequent results beach conditions will often change so the water sample is not relevant to today s beach conditions whitman et al 1999 boehm et al 2002 to get around this researchers have developed statistical models dubbed nowcast models to estimate fib for the day based on the previous day e coli levels and factors such as precipitation wind and water conditions francy et al 2013 these models often incorrectly predict that beaches will not have elevated fib levels known as type ii errors or false negatives nevers and whitman 2011 rabinovici et al 2004 boehm et al 2002 for instance in 2015 chicago beaches had 200 events where fib levels were too high however only 14 7 percent of these beach days were forecasted by an existing predictive model used by the chicago park district these models do have good overall fit but elevated fib levels are statistically rare events and models often fail to predict them known as low sensitivity meanwhile scientists have developed new methods which measure fib levels in water with substantially less delay enterococci quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods can determine fib levels within 3 4 h and yield similar results as culture based methods haugland et al 2005 kinzelman et al 2003 the rapid turnaround lets managers determine warnings or closures based on tests within the same day instead of relying on statistical models however this approach has a drawback of cost and equipment availability qpcr testing can cost between 2 and 5 times more than traditional culture based methods bienkowski 2017 thus managers are faced with a dilemma of choosing between expensive qpcr methods or choosing slower culture based methods and using predictive models to produce swim advisories both of these tests have thresholds for acceptable fib levels the environmental protection agency epa publishes water quality criteria in accordance with the clean water act the current epa recreational water quality criteria accepts culture based or qpcr based methods environmental protection agency 2012 acceptable levels for culture based methods of testing e coli should not exceed 235 cfu 100 ml while acceptable levels for qpcr testing of enterococci should not exceed 1000 cell equivalents ce byappanahalli et al 2010 these rules can be leveraged to create a new predictive model which mixes the short turn around of qpcr with statistical models to produce swim advisories in this study we exploit the historical correlation between beaches to estimate fib readings we also use limited enterococci qpcr results at specific beaches to predict elevated e coli levels at other beaches using clustering algorithms and random forest regressions this hybrid approach allows limited deployment of qpcr equipment to reduce overall costs and provides a higher quality statistical model we use 10 years of historical e coli measurements from 20 beaches in chicago to create a model to forecast whether e coli levels at a beach will be elevated 2 material and methods 2 1 prior day nowcast models timing is a crucial factor for monitoring fib levels we adopt the typical shorthand to denote time periods by t to denote now t 1 t 2 t n to denote last period two periods ago and some periods ago and t 1 t 2 t n to denote the next period two periods from now and some period in the future for the purposes of this paper we often use t to denote today t 1 to denote yesterday and t 1 to denote tomorrow the defining characteristic of prior day nowcast models is using fib levels from the previous day t 1 to predict bacteria levels for the current day t models will also incorporate covariates or predictors to improve the accuracy of models such as precipitation ackerman and weisberg 2003 morrison et al 2003 sunlight whitman et al 2004 wind smith et al 1999 olyphant and whitman 2004 wave and tidal levels le fevre and lewis 2003 crowther et al 2001 lake levels francy et al 2009 turbidity olyphant et al 2003 and density of humans and animals boehm et al 2003 reeves et al 2004 these models rely on prior day data since culture based testing is not available until upward of 12 h after the samples were collected the prediction at beach x i at time t is dependent on the prior periods culture based results x i t 1 and aforementioned covariates w 1 w 2 w j these models often take the form of x i t f x i t 1 w 1 w 2 w j where f is a some function or algorithm that inputs raw data and outputs a probability for instance the linear regression model is typically x i t β 1 x i t 1 β 2 w 1 β 3 w 2 β j w j where β j are the coefficients that weight the importance of each input various models are used to improve accuracy such as log transformations nevers and whitman 2005 polynomial coefficients frick et al 2008 logistic regression partial least squares hou et al 2006 generlized boosted regression modeling cyterski et al 2014 random forest and genetic algorithm approaches brooks et al 2016 these classes of models often has the same structure of using fib levels from time t 1 the prior day and covariates from time t to predict beaches at time t yet the reliance on prior day fib levels is likely the source of inaccuracy the cause of elevated levels is unlikely to persist between days morrison et al 2003 cheung et al 1991 brenniman et al 1981 covariates can help determine when conditions are optimal for bacteria growth but are still imprecise importantly most statistical models are tuned to maximize overall accuracy e g high r 2 but elevated fib levels are often rare events thus models frequently have low sensitivity that is the ratio of accurately estimated elevated fib levels over instances of actual exceedences 2 2 chicago prior day nowcast model chicago park district measures water quality of 20 beaches along 26 miles against lake michigan on chicago s eastern shore shown in fig 1 there is no single source of microbial contamination in lake michigan rather it is likely introduced by birds land based animals beaches and people the chicago river is contiguous to lake michigan but a lock limits water flowing into the lake while the lock is sometimes opened it is generally less than once per year and beaches are immediately closed chicago metropolitan water reclamation district 2016 beaches operate from memorial day weekend which is just before the last monday in may through labor day which is the first monday in september approximately 122 days as a result there are approximately 2440 beach days which each represent an observation in the model if fib levels exceed the acceptable threshold for a given beach day a public advisory notice is issued warning potential swimmers about the heigtened risk between 2011 and 2016 chicago park district placed hydrometeorological sensors to automatically collect covariates on water and atmospheric conditions buoys were installed at five chicago beaches foster montrose oak 63rd street and calumet to collect turbidity wave height wave period water temperature and depth of the sensor weather stations were installed at three beaches foster oak and 63rd street and collected wind direction wind speed air temperature rainfall solar radiation relative humidity and barometric pressure data were collected from the hydrometeorological sensors between every 2 and 5 min from may through setpember and aggregated water samples were collected for culture based testing each morning and recorded usually around noon sampling was done on weekdays however weekend and holiday sampling was conducted if the prior readings were elevated or if chicago park district determined the weekend was busy between 2006 and 2016 only 3 percent of the samples were taken on weekends shively et al 2016 used this data to build a prior day nowcast model which used the prior day culture tests and same day hydrometeorological data to predict fib levels at all beaches the novel model leveraged the sensors to automate the management process by providing estimates to beach managers each weekday predictions were obtained from a random forest model and the predictions were published online for beach visitors in 2015 and 2016 the overall accuracy was 90 and 93 percent respectively and specificity true negative rate was 98 and 99 percent however the sensitivity true positive rate was only 7 and 11 9 percent for all chicago beaches beginning in 2015 chicago park district began to use limited qpcr testing of enterococci at 5 beaches data were collected but not incorporated into the predictive model during the summer of 2017 qpcr testing was expanded to all 20 beaches and culture based testing of e coli was paused 2 3 hybrid nowcast model whitman and nevers 2008 observed that fib levels at chicago beaches often correlated with nearby beaches on the same day where extreme highs and extreme lows were simultaneous for most beaches fig 2 shows the correlation of culture based e coli measurements between chicago beaches from 2006 through 2017 the branches denote the nearest neighbor for each pair of beaches a simple way to show similar beaches beaches were not uniformally correlated some beaches displayed strong clusters of correlation that exceed the correlation of readings within the same beach between days we identified clusters of beaches that had correlated fib levels a clustering algorithm j assigned beaches x i to a cluster k based on correlation between historical bacteria levels between 2006 and 2016 k j x 1 t x 2 t x n t we selected one beach x ˆ i t in each cluster to be the feature beach for predicting bacteria levels for the remaining m beaches in the cluster x i t thus each cluster k had the following membership k i x ˆ 1 t x 1 t x 2 t x m t to generate the predictions we formulated a model that limits predictions to each cluster x i k t f x ˆ i k t so the feature beach x ˆ i k t the i th beach in cluster k used data from time t to predict the remaining beaches x i k t in the same cluster in the same time period this model leverages observations from the same time t to predict fib levels at the other beaches on the same day the rapid results from qpcr testing of enterococci allows recreational beach managers to observe beach readings at selected beaches x ˆ i k t to predict culture based e coli levels at other beaches the factors and conditions which led to elevated levels are captured and preserved in the model to render predictions 2 4 identifying beach clusters we applied the above approach to chicago s beach data we used k means clustering algorithm to detect when beaches had similar movements first there was an initial random guess for which beaches belong in clusters the distance or error was then measured for all clusters then membership of clusters was slightly altered and we calculated whether the error had increased or decreased this process was repeated until the lowest measured error was obtained mathematically j x k y k i 1 k x i b k x i μ k 2 we chose to limit to 5 clusters k 5 because it aligned to the number of qpcr testing sites by chicago park district starting in 2015 k means was applied to beaches based on latitude longitude total e coli exceedances and length of the longest breakwater each of these variables was scaled and centered by calculating z scores prior to clustering some beaches were removed from the clustering because they were historical outliers for bacteria levels or had distinct physical features we removed beaches that have lengthy breakwaters since it has an impact on bacteria levels at those beaches we tested this hypothesis by measuring the distance of the southernmost part of the beach to the northeasternmost edge of the breakwater the correlation between the breakwater length and total bacteria exceedances between 2006 and 2017 was positive r 0 73 we removed 63rd street rainbow montrose and ohio which have long breakwaters or a similar feature likewise our earlier analytical modeling showed that beaches with a high frequency of high bacteria levels often confounded the model calumet which had high exceedances as well as a medium sized breakwater was also removed from the analytical model these 5 removed beaches comprised two of the clusters from the initial k means analysis the final list of beaches and their respective clusters are listed in table 1 and mapped in fig 1 within each cluster the beach with the most historical culture based e coli exceedances was selected to be the feature beach whose enterococci qpcr result would be input to the model by rapid testing the beaches with the most frequest exceedances we captured an added operational benefit of maximizing the number of correct advisories the remaining beaches were selected to be predicted by the model 2 5 predictors and covariates previous literature has focused on using a variety of covariates to predict e coli levels we created and tested an analytical model which relied on interbeach correlations and also used other variables cited in previous literature to predict fib in lake michigan the model resembled the model constructed in section 3 of the paper ackerman and weisberg 2003 morrison et al 2003 found that large rainstorms increased fib levels 2 5 days after the rain has ceased we collected data from the dark sky application programmer interface api to understand forecasted rainfall for a day of water measurement and also understand various historical measures of rainfall likewise the same data source was used to determine the amount of sunlight the lake was exposed to at the beaches whitman et al 2004 found that increased sunlight inactivated e coli at a chicago beach whereas cloudy days decreased e coli similar to precipitation dark sky data was used to measure forecasted cloud cover as well as historical measurements of cloud cover preceding water quality tests we included various measurements of wind since smith et al 1999 and olyphant and whitman 2004 found that wind is a reliable predictor of fib levels in particular beaches downwind from point pollution sources or where fib was active are more likely to experience elevated e coli levels we used the dark sky api to determine the wind direction and intensity each day as well has historical data preceeding a beach sample similarly wave and tidal patterns seem to influence observed fib levels le fevre and lewis 2003 found that e coli levels could be resuspended under tidal waves allowing e coli to be observed in locations only reached by waves or tidal levels in a multivariate model crowther et al 2001 showed that tidal levels affected observed fib levels unfortunately our team did not have access to suffucient historical data to determine tidal levels but we approximated their effect by using the lunar phase additionally we used the previous day s lake michigan water level and 3 day average water level as measured and obtained by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa at calumet harbor in chicago finally researchers have found the human and animal activity at the beaches can influence fib levels animal activity whether domesticated pets or wildlife may introduce fecal bacteria to the environment boehm et al 2003 reeves et al 2004 likewise human activity alongside rain and runoff can introduce bacteria from the beaches into the water while chicago park district does not have frequent surveys of beach visitors for each beach we used indicators for weekday and weekend as well as the julian date to approximate activity at each beach table 2 shows the covariates considered 2 6 building the predictive model a random forest regression model was trained with the predicted beach s name and 10 years of culture based e coli test results for each of the feature beaches variable importance for the random forest model was assessed by calculating the percentage increase in mean squared error mse as a result of permuting the values for each variable fig 3 the most important feature was the e coli level at leone beach in fact the importance of each beach s e coli level decreased as the beach location was further south this is likely due to the fact that more beaches on the north side 10 are being predicted than on the south side 5 and due to the north to south current of the lake the name of the beach being predicted had the lowest importance without this predictor the predicted e coli for a specific day would be the same for each beach indeed because of the correlation that exists between certain beaches it is not surprising that beach identity would rank last against the importance of e coli levels along the whole lakefront still permuting the beach name variable led to a 15 6 percent increase in the mse the random forest regression model predicted e coli levels in cfu 100 ml units these raw levels were transformed to a binary advisory decision due to left censoring at 1 cfu 100 ml and an abundance of low e coli readings a limit can be observed at the lower left portion of a plot of residuals and fitted values fig 4 as the number of trees in the random forest model grew model error decreased until around 400 trees no performance benefit was observed beyond 400 trees fig 5 2 7 validation the model was tuned and validated using leave one year out cross validation in which the validation set consisted of all the observations in one year and the training set consisted of all other observations the process was repeated until each year had been in the validation set the year 2016 was left out as a final validation set historically the chicago prior day model from 2015 through 2016 had a false positive rate of 1 8 percent for all beaches that is the model falsely predicted elevated bacteria levels 1 8 percent of all beach days over the course of the summer typically 30 beach days per season we chose to align the parameters of our model to this historical false positive rate as fig 6 shows we could have increased the number of times we correctly predicted elevated fib levels but it would come at a cost of also increasing the number unnecessary warnings to beach goers fig 6 shows the receiver operating characteristic roc which shows the trade off between increasing the number of days with true predictions versus days with falsely identified elevated levels by constraining the model to only have a 1 8 percent false positive rate the true positive rate is forecasted to be 22 percent a threshold was chosen to transform the model prediction to a binary outcome to keep the model s false positive rate fpr near 1 8 percent the threshold within each year that corresponded to a 1 8 percent was noted and the mean threshold was then used to generate predictions for the holdout validation set 3 results and discussion to correctly assess the accuracy of the model we needed to use out of sample predictions as can happen with machine learning it is possible that the accuracy of the model was caused by the analysts tuning the model to fit existing data and accompanying noise fitting existing data too well can lead to the model failing to accurately predict when encountering new data pilot analytical models were created using historical data from 2015 to 2016 using the modeling concept described in section 2 pilot models were live tested at chicago beaches in 2017 on newly collected data in summer 2017 the pilot analytical model went live with some limitations imposed by available data the model inputs were enterococci qpcr test results for calumet rainbow south shore 63rd street and montrose and the predicted beaches were the other 15 regularly tested beaches the model was trained using results from the qpcr pilot for 2015 and 2016 and predicted the culture based e coli levels for the predicted beach on the same day an application was developed and deployed which regularly checked chicago s public data portal for qpcr results for the feature beaches every day during the summer once all the qpcr results were posted the application automatically ran the model and uploaded the predictions on the public data portal within 5 min beginning on friday may 26 water samples were collected by the chicago park district and qpcr testing was completed by the university of illinois at chicago those results were then posted to the city of chicago data portal typically around noon city of chicago 2016b about 5 min later we posted the predictions based on our model to the data portal city of chicago 2016a the last predictions and samples were conducted on september 4th while qpcr data were available for all beaches we ignored any qpcr reading except for the 5 beaches used as model inputs both predictions and samples were collected each day during the week this process was different from prior years where samples were usually collected only during weekdays and non holidays except when levels had been elevated on the previous friday or it was suspected to be a busy weekend on the beaches to translate the predicted e coli level to an advisory decision beaches that were forecasted to exceed 381 cfu 100 ml were predicted to have a swim advisory due to fib even though this threshold exceeds environmental protection agency epa requirements that threshold was empircally shown to be the best correlate to actual exceedances using epa standards subsequent lab testing and swim advisories due to fib were issued only if fib exceeded epa standards over the summer of 2017 we compared predictions to the results from the actual qpcr enterococci test results city of chicago 2016c and calculated several standard measurements to evaluate the performance of the model we specifically compared the predictions at the 15 beaches where the hybrid modeling was used to formulate predictions not on all 20 beaches because some were not predicted but were inputs for predictions at other beaches 3 1 results table 3 and fig 7 show the hybrid analytical model had a sensitivity true positive rate of 11 2 percent for the predicted beaches compared to an average of 3 4 percent at the same beaches in 2015 and 2016 that is the hybrid model increased the true positive rate by 230 percent over the historical average additionally these beaches have typically not been predicted as well as the other beaches the same prior model that averaged 3 4 percent for the 15 predicted beaches averaged 9 5 percent for all 20 beaches the precision of the model the portion of predicted high fib that were accurate compared to all predicted fib beach days also grew from 17 to 27 percent a 59 percent increase however the false positive rate was slightly higher at 2 percent during 2017 compared to our 1 8 percent target area under curve auc is a measure that shows the trade off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for the model the auc for the hybrid model is 0 753 which is higher than the prior day model that was around 0 64 in 2015 and 2016 a higher auc does indicate the model has improved the ability to estimate beaches with elevated bacteria levels without raising a disproportionate number of false positives the matthews correlation coefficient mcc provides an approximation for the goodness of fit for predictors like other correlation coefficients it ranges between 1 perfect prediction of elevated fib levels to 1 complete disagreement unlike auc it accounts for all four classification outcomes true positives true negatives false positives and false negatives the mcc for the hybrid model was substantially higher at 0 142 compared to 0 052 and 0 036 respectively for 2016 and 2015 it is another indication in the relatively improved model performance compared to prior day modeling we also compared performance to a model that combines interbeach correlation with predictors for precipitation sunlight wind proxies for human density and tidal and lake levels discussed in section 2 6 the performance of the multivariate hybrid model was similar to the hybrid model without other predictors auc for the multivate hybrid model was 0 738 0 015 lower the mcc for the multivarite model was substantially lower for the multivariate model at 0 044 key metrics for sensitivity 6 percent and precision 12 percent were lower than the hybrid only model this indicated that our predictors did not provide improvements to the precision of the predictions and most of the predictive power is provided by the interbeach correlation accuracy of the hybrid nowcast model was in line with the previous performance of the chicago prior day nowcast model since most days do not have elevated e coli levels the increase in sensitivity true positive rate did not make a major impact on overall accuracy which remained around 93 percent 3 2 discussion attempts in prior literature to forecast fib levels in beaches have used essentially the same functional form nevers and whitman 2005 frick et al 2008 hou et al 2006 lab data on fib from the previous day are combined with hydrometeorological and other predictors to predict whether fib levels will exceed the suggested thresholds ackerman and weisberg 2003 whitman et al 2004 smith et al 1999 recent innovations such as hydrometeorological sensors shively et al 2016 have enabled novel ways to collect the predictors leading to improved accuracy and reduced latency likewise more sophisticated algorithms such as machine learning and genetic algorithms cyterski et al 2014 brooks et al 2016 have been used to improve performance by allowing for more complex interactions between predictors yet the concept of these models still predominately relies on prior day laboratory results which we ve dubbed the prior day nowcast model evidence suggests that the contributors to high fib levels do not persist from day to day morrison et al 2003 cheung et al 1991 brenniman et al 1981 which can explain why many attempts to predict fib levels in beaches have not sustained high levels of accuracy previous research has found that fib levels in chicago s beaches are highly correlated and rarely encounter consecutive days of elevated fib levels whitman and nevers 2008 at the same time qpcr testing has become more widely used but is still expensive bienkowski 2017 because qpcr testing provides immediate results we proposed the hybrid nowcast model to use limited qpcr data from selected beaches to predict fib levels in other beaches by exploiting correlations between beaches the hybrid nowcast model removes the dependency on day old fib information commonly used in other models this approach more closely resembles a missing data problem where we are attempting to fill in the missing values beaches without qpcr testing for beach networks that are highly correlated like chicago s hybrid nowcasting was able to increase model sensitivity 230 percent without increasing the rate of false positives when a beach was predicted to have an elevated level it was 59 2 percent less likely to have been a false positive type i error the increase in correct predictions however was not induced by simply raising more erroneous warnings type ii errors as those only increased two tenths of a percent in terms of impact on beachgoers the hybrid model resulted in 90 correct advisories while there were 71 incorrect advisories in 2016 the chicago prior day nowcast model issued 12 correct advisories while issuing 184 incorrect advisories likewise in 2015 the prior day model issued 14 correct advisories versus 184 incorrect advisories the difference in performance was likely due to the use of qpcr to obtain fib levels on the same day since chicago beaches rarely encounter consecutive days of elevated fib levels prior day readings do not accurately predict elevated levels on the next day the factors that cause fib levels to grow rarely persist between days as few beaches have consecutive days of beach warnings however elevated fib levels portend ideal conditions for fib in other beaches on the same day we explored the addition of other predictors and covariates but it did not increase the model performance over the model only using interbeach correlation information and predictive power provided by covariates have already been captured by the qpcr testing conducted at other beaches for instance while rainfall can approximate the conditions for fib growth the variation of fib levels at other beaches is a better predictor since it is reliant on actual beach conditions the temporal linkage between observations for ideal fib conditions and actual fib growth has been hard to demonstrate in a large ecosystem like lake michigan meanwhile the interbeach correlations seem to provide a better signal that ideal conditions already exist nothwithstanding we also realize our hydrometeorological data is based on third party sources instead of active sensors in the water which may be more accurate and stronger predictors chicago beaches do have hydrometeorological sensors in place but those data are only available for a couple of years our measurements for visitor density are very loose approximations based on available data but does not mirror the methodology used in studies that have shown the relationship between human activity and fib levels these could be improved in the future and may provide better capability for prediction although chicago was able to deploy qpcr testing at all 20 beaches the cost and complexity of qpcr equipment limits widescale deployment moreover we removed four beaches from this model because of physical characteristics such as long breakwaters that prevented them from being clustered with other beaches one beach was removed due to frequently high readings and we used 5 beaches to predict culture based e coli levels as a result 10 total beaches would need to undergo enterococci qpcr testing and 10 beaches would be able to forgo any testing of the 10 undergoing qpcr testing 5 would be tested to estimate fib levels for 10 other beaches and the other 5 would need qpcr testing since they have distinct geographies breakwaters or other unique physical characteristics the hybrid model used predictor beaches that were more prone to elevated fib levels than all other beaches in each cluster foster north avenue leone 31st and south shore moreover we removed calumet from the model since it frequently had elevated levels beach monitors could levarage a similar strategy of deploying qpcr testing to frequently contaminated beaches and relying on statistical models for the remaining beaches this will naturally improve model performance since beaches which comprise the mode number of issues will be accurately measured leading to more accurate beach warnings and limits expensive equipment needed for rapid testing while this paper showed a 230 percent increase in sensitivity the ability to predict elevated fib levels is still relatively low one method to improve sensitivity without increasing auc is increasing the rate of false positives this method certainly would be an inconvenience for beachgoers but also increase the chance of warning beachgoers of elevated fib however there are a lack of guidelines or studies on acceptable levels of false positives our target rate was determined based on the average false positive rate for prior years it may be worthwhile to incorrectly predict additional beach warnings if it deters exposure to fib especially for children or those with weak immune systems research on predicting elevated fib can be guided by further research on the economic impact of incorrectly providing warnings when none were warranted that analysis can help this strand of research determine a target for an appropriate level of false negatives 4 conclusions hybrid nowcast modeling preserves information from the current day instead of test data from the prior day the modeling technique allows for limited deployments of the costly qpcr testing equipment sensitivity of predicting elevated fib levels increased from 3 4 percent to 11 2 percent a 230 percent increase while reducing false positive rates by 59 2 percent and maintaining similar rate for false negatives declarations of interest none acknowledgements we are indebted to chicago park district staff especially cathy

20019,culture based methods to measure escherichia coli e coli are used by beach administrators to inform whether bacteria levels represent an elevated risk to swimmers since results take up to 12 h statistical models are used to forecast bacteria levels in lieu of test results however they underestimate days with elevated fecal indicator bacteria levels quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr tests return results within 3 h but are 2 5 times more expensive than culture based methods this paper presents a prediction model which uses limited deployments of qpcr tested sites with inter beach correlation to predict when bacteria will exceed acceptable thresholds the model can be used to inform management decisions on when to warn residents or close beaches due to exposure to the bacteria using data from chicago collected between 2006 and 2016 the model proposed in this paper increased sensitivity from 3 4 percent to 11 2 percent a 230 percent increase we find that the correlation between beaches are substantial enough to provide higher levels of precision and sensitivity to predictive models thus limited deployments of qpcr testing can be used to deliver better predictions for beach administrators at lower cost and less complexity keywords random forest escherichia coli recreational water quality fecal indicator bacteria chicago 1 introduction swimming in recreational waters contaminated with high levels of fecal indicator bacteria fib is associated with higher incidence of gastrointestinal gi illnesses prüss 1998 the risk of exposure is associated with the amount of fib measured in the water a logarithmic increase in average enterococcus was associated with a 1 4 increase in the odds ratio of contracting gi illness wade et al 2006 evidence also suggests that children are more likely to contract gi illnesses when exposed to the same contaminated water as adults wade et al 2008 to prevent this managers of recreational beaches use culture based methods to measure fib levels sampling is typically conducted early in the morning but results take upward of 12 h kinzelman et al 2003 between the time of sampling and subsequent results beach conditions will often change so the water sample is not relevant to today s beach conditions whitman et al 1999 boehm et al 2002 to get around this researchers have developed statistical models dubbed nowcast models to estimate fib for the day based on the previous day e coli levels and factors such as precipitation wind and water conditions francy et al 2013 these models often incorrectly predict that beaches will not have elevated fib levels known as type ii errors or false negatives nevers and whitman 2011 rabinovici et al 2004 boehm et al 2002 for instance in 2015 chicago beaches had 200 events where fib levels were too high however only 14 7 percent of these beach days were forecasted by an existing predictive model used by the chicago park district these models do have good overall fit but elevated fib levels are statistically rare events and models often fail to predict them known as low sensitivity meanwhile scientists have developed new methods which measure fib levels in water with substantially less delay enterococci quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods can determine fib levels within 3 4 h and yield similar results as culture based methods haugland et al 2005 kinzelman et al 2003 the rapid turnaround lets managers determine warnings or closures based on tests within the same day instead of relying on statistical models however this approach has a drawback of cost and equipment availability qpcr testing can cost between 2 and 5 times more than traditional culture based methods bienkowski 2017 thus managers are faced with a dilemma of choosing between expensive qpcr methods or choosing slower culture based methods and using predictive models to produce swim advisories both of these tests have thresholds for acceptable fib levels the environmental protection agency epa publishes water quality criteria in accordance with the clean water act the current epa recreational water quality criteria accepts culture based or qpcr based methods environmental protection agency 2012 acceptable levels for culture based methods of testing e coli should not exceed 235 cfu 100 ml while acceptable levels for qpcr testing of enterococci should not exceed 1000 cell equivalents ce byappanahalli et al 2010 these rules can be leveraged to create a new predictive model which mixes the short turn around of qpcr with statistical models to produce swim advisories in this study we exploit the historical correlation between beaches to estimate fib readings we also use limited enterococci qpcr results at specific beaches to predict elevated e coli levels at other beaches using clustering algorithms and random forest regressions this hybrid approach allows limited deployment of qpcr equipment to reduce overall costs and provides a higher quality statistical model we use 10 years of historical e coli measurements from 20 beaches in chicago to create a model to forecast whether e coli levels at a beach will be elevated 2 material and methods 2 1 prior day nowcast models timing is a crucial factor for monitoring fib levels we adopt the typical shorthand to denote time periods by t to denote now t 1 t 2 t n to denote last period two periods ago and some periods ago and t 1 t 2 t n to denote the next period two periods from now and some period in the future for the purposes of this paper we often use t to denote today t 1 to denote yesterday and t 1 to denote tomorrow the defining characteristic of prior day nowcast models is using fib levels from the previous day t 1 to predict bacteria levels for the current day t models will also incorporate covariates or predictors to improve the accuracy of models such as precipitation ackerman and weisberg 2003 morrison et al 2003 sunlight whitman et al 2004 wind smith et al 1999 olyphant and whitman 2004 wave and tidal levels le fevre and lewis 2003 crowther et al 2001 lake levels francy et al 2009 turbidity olyphant et al 2003 and density of humans and animals boehm et al 2003 reeves et al 2004 these models rely on prior day data since culture based testing is not available until upward of 12 h after the samples were collected the prediction at beach x i at time t is dependent on the prior periods culture based results x i t 1 and aforementioned covariates w 1 w 2 w j these models often take the form of x i t f x i t 1 w 1 w 2 w j where f is a some function or algorithm that inputs raw data and outputs a probability for instance the linear regression model is typically x i t β 1 x i t 1 β 2 w 1 β 3 w 2 β j w j where β j are the coefficients that weight the importance of each input various models are used to improve accuracy such as log transformations nevers and whitman 2005 polynomial coefficients frick et al 2008 logistic regression partial least squares hou et al 2006 generlized boosted regression modeling cyterski et al 2014 random forest and genetic algorithm approaches brooks et al 2016 these classes of models often has the same structure of using fib levels from time t 1 the prior day and covariates from time t to predict beaches at time t yet the reliance on prior day fib levels is likely the source of inaccuracy the cause of elevated levels is unlikely to persist between days morrison et al 2003 cheung et al 1991 brenniman et al 1981 covariates can help determine when conditions are optimal for bacteria growth but are still imprecise importantly most statistical models are tuned to maximize overall accuracy e g high r 2 but elevated fib levels are often rare events thus models frequently have low sensitivity that is the ratio of accurately estimated elevated fib levels over instances of actual exceedences 2 2 chicago prior day nowcast model chicago park district measures water quality of 20 beaches along 26 miles against lake michigan on chicago s eastern shore shown in fig 1 there is no single source of microbial contamination in lake michigan rather it is likely introduced by birds land based animals beaches and people the chicago river is contiguous to lake michigan but a lock limits water flowing into the lake while the lock is sometimes opened it is generally less than once per year and beaches are immediately closed chicago metropolitan water reclamation district 2016 beaches operate from memorial day weekend which is just before the last monday in may through labor day which is the first monday in september approximately 122 days as a result there are approximately 2440 beach days which each represent an observation in the model if fib levels exceed the acceptable threshold for a given beach day a public advisory notice is issued warning potential swimmers about the heigtened risk between 2011 and 2016 chicago park district placed hydrometeorological sensors to automatically collect covariates on water and atmospheric conditions buoys were installed at five chicago beaches foster montrose oak 63rd street and calumet to collect turbidity wave height wave period water temperature and depth of the sensor weather stations were installed at three beaches foster oak and 63rd street and collected wind direction wind speed air temperature rainfall solar radiation relative humidity and barometric pressure data were collected from the hydrometeorological sensors between every 2 and 5 min from may through setpember and aggregated water samples were collected for culture based testing each morning and recorded usually around noon sampling was done on weekdays however weekend and holiday sampling was conducted if the prior readings were elevated or if chicago park district determined the weekend was busy between 2006 and 2016 only 3 percent of the samples were taken on weekends shively et al 2016 used this data to build a prior day nowcast model which used the prior day culture tests and same day hydrometeorological data to predict fib levels at all beaches the novel model leveraged the sensors to automate the management process by providing estimates to beach managers each weekday predictions were obtained from a random forest model and the predictions were published online for beach visitors in 2015 and 2016 the overall accuracy was 90 and 93 percent respectively and specificity true negative rate was 98 and 99 percent however the sensitivity true positive rate was only 7 and 11 9 percent for all chicago beaches beginning in 2015 chicago park district began to use limited qpcr testing of enterococci at 5 beaches data were collected but not incorporated into the predictive model during the summer of 2017 qpcr testing was expanded to all 20 beaches and culture based testing of e coli was paused 2 3 hybrid nowcast model whitman and nevers 2008 observed that fib levels at chicago beaches often correlated with nearby beaches on the same day where extreme highs and extreme lows were simultaneous for most beaches fig 2 shows the correlation of culture based e coli measurements between chicago beaches from 2006 through 2017 the branches denote the nearest neighbor for each pair of beaches a simple way to show similar beaches beaches were not uniformally correlated some beaches displayed strong clusters of correlation that exceed the correlation of readings within the same beach between days we identified clusters of beaches that had correlated fib levels a clustering algorithm j assigned beaches x i to a cluster k based on correlation between historical bacteria levels between 2006 and 2016 k j x 1 t x 2 t x n t we selected one beach x ˆ i t in each cluster to be the feature beach for predicting bacteria levels for the remaining m beaches in the cluster x i t thus each cluster k had the following membership k i x ˆ 1 t x 1 t x 2 t x m t to generate the predictions we formulated a model that limits predictions to each cluster x i k t f x ˆ i k t so the feature beach x ˆ i k t the i th beach in cluster k used data from time t to predict the remaining beaches x i k t in the same cluster in the same time period this model leverages observations from the same time t to predict fib levels at the other beaches on the same day the rapid results from qpcr testing of enterococci allows recreational beach managers to observe beach readings at selected beaches x ˆ i k t to predict culture based e coli levels at other beaches the factors and conditions which led to elevated levels are captured and preserved in the model to render predictions 2 4 identifying beach clusters we applied the above approach to chicago s beach data we used k means clustering algorithm to detect when beaches had similar movements first there was an initial random guess for which beaches belong in clusters the distance or error was then measured for all clusters then membership of clusters was slightly altered and we calculated whether the error had increased or decreased this process was repeated until the lowest measured error was obtained mathematically j x k y k i 1 k x i b k x i μ k 2 we chose to limit to 5 clusters k 5 because it aligned to the number of qpcr testing sites by chicago park district starting in 2015 k means was applied to beaches based on latitude longitude total e coli exceedances and length of the longest breakwater each of these variables was scaled and centered by calculating z scores prior to clustering some beaches were removed from the clustering because they were historical outliers for bacteria levels or had distinct physical features we removed beaches that have lengthy breakwaters since it has an impact on bacteria levels at those beaches we tested this hypothesis by measuring the distance of the southernmost part of the beach to the northeasternmost edge of the breakwater the correlation between the breakwater length and total bacteria exceedances between 2006 and 2017 was positive r 0 73 we removed 63rd street rainbow montrose and ohio which have long breakwaters or a similar feature likewise our earlier analytical modeling showed that beaches with a high frequency of high bacteria levels often confounded the model calumet which had high exceedances as well as a medium sized breakwater was also removed from the analytical model these 5 removed beaches comprised two of the clusters from the initial k means analysis the final list of beaches and their respective clusters are listed in table 1 and mapped in fig 1 within each cluster the beach with the most historical culture based e coli exceedances was selected to be the feature beach whose enterococci qpcr result would be input to the model by rapid testing the beaches with the most frequest exceedances we captured an added operational benefit of maximizing the number of correct advisories the remaining beaches were selected to be predicted by the model 2 5 predictors and covariates previous literature has focused on using a variety of covariates to predict e coli levels we created and tested an analytical model which relied on interbeach correlations and also used other variables cited in previous literature to predict fib in lake michigan the model resembled the model constructed in section 3 of the paper ackerman and weisberg 2003 morrison et al 2003 found that large rainstorms increased fib levels 2 5 days after the rain has ceased we collected data from the dark sky application programmer interface api to understand forecasted rainfall for a day of water measurement and also understand various historical measures of rainfall likewise the same data source was used to determine the amount of sunlight the lake was exposed to at the beaches whitman et al 2004 found that increased sunlight inactivated e coli at a chicago beach whereas cloudy days decreased e coli similar to precipitation dark sky data was used to measure forecasted cloud cover as well as historical measurements of cloud cover preceding water quality tests we included various measurements of wind since smith et al 1999 and olyphant and whitman 2004 found that wind is a reliable predictor of fib levels in particular beaches downwind from point pollution sources or where fib was active are more likely to experience elevated e coli levels we used the dark sky api to determine the wind direction and intensity each day as well has historical data preceeding a beach sample similarly wave and tidal patterns seem to influence observed fib levels le fevre and lewis 2003 found that e coli levels could be resuspended under tidal waves allowing e coli to be observed in locations only reached by waves or tidal levels in a multivariate model crowther et al 2001 showed that tidal levels affected observed fib levels unfortunately our team did not have access to suffucient historical data to determine tidal levels but we approximated their effect by using the lunar phase additionally we used the previous day s lake michigan water level and 3 day average water level as measured and obtained by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa at calumet harbor in chicago finally researchers have found the human and animal activity at the beaches can influence fib levels animal activity whether domesticated pets or wildlife may introduce fecal bacteria to the environment boehm et al 2003 reeves et al 2004 likewise human activity alongside rain and runoff can introduce bacteria from the beaches into the water while chicago park district does not have frequent surveys of beach visitors for each beach we used indicators for weekday and weekend as well as the julian date to approximate activity at each beach table 2 shows the covariates considered 2 6 building the predictive model a random forest regression model was trained with the predicted beach s name and 10 years of culture based e coli test results for each of the feature beaches variable importance for the random forest model was assessed by calculating the percentage increase in mean squared error mse as a result of permuting the values for each variable fig 3 the most important feature was the e coli level at leone beach in fact the importance of each beach s e coli level decreased as the beach location was further south this is likely due to the fact that more beaches on the north side 10 are being predicted than on the south side 5 and due to the north to south current of the lake the name of the beach being predicted had the lowest importance without this predictor the predicted e coli for a specific day would be the same for each beach indeed because of the correlation that exists between certain beaches it is not surprising that beach identity would rank last against the importance of e coli levels along the whole lakefront still permuting the beach name variable led to a 15 6 percent increase in the mse the random forest regression model predicted e coli levels in cfu 100 ml units these raw levels were transformed to a binary advisory decision due to left censoring at 1 cfu 100 ml and an abundance of low e coli readings a limit can be observed at the lower left portion of a plot of residuals and fitted values fig 4 as the number of trees in the random forest model grew model error decreased until around 400 trees no performance benefit was observed beyond 400 trees fig 5 2 7 validation the model was tuned and validated using leave one year out cross validation in which the validation set consisted of all the observations in one year and the training set consisted of all other observations the process was repeated until each year had been in the validation set the year 2016 was left out as a final validation set historically the chicago prior day model from 2015 through 2016 had a false positive rate of 1 8 percent for all beaches that is the model falsely predicted elevated bacteria levels 1 8 percent of all beach days over the course of the summer typically 30 beach days per season we chose to align the parameters of our model to this historical false positive rate as fig 6 shows we could have increased the number of times we correctly predicted elevated fib levels but it would come at a cost of also increasing the number unnecessary warnings to beach goers fig 6 shows the receiver operating characteristic roc which shows the trade off between increasing the number of days with true predictions versus days with falsely identified elevated levels by constraining the model to only have a 1 8 percent false positive rate the true positive rate is forecasted to be 22 percent a threshold was chosen to transform the model prediction to a binary outcome to keep the model s false positive rate fpr near 1 8 percent the threshold within each year that corresponded to a 1 8 percent was noted and the mean threshold was then used to generate predictions for the holdout validation set 3 results and discussion to correctly assess the accuracy of the model we needed to use out of sample predictions as can happen with machine learning it is possible that the accuracy of the model was caused by the analysts tuning the model to fit existing data and accompanying noise fitting existing data too well can lead to the model failing to accurately predict when encountering new data pilot analytical models were created using historical data from 2015 to 2016 using the modeling concept described in section 2 pilot models were live tested at chicago beaches in 2017 on newly collected data in summer 2017 the pilot analytical model went live with some limitations imposed by available data the model inputs were enterococci qpcr test results for calumet rainbow south shore 63rd street and montrose and the predicted beaches were the other 15 regularly tested beaches the model was trained using results from the qpcr pilot for 2015 and 2016 and predicted the culture based e coli levels for the predicted beach on the same day an application was developed and deployed which regularly checked chicago s public data portal for qpcr results for the feature beaches every day during the summer once all the qpcr results were posted the application automatically ran the model and uploaded the predictions on the public data portal within 5 min beginning on friday may 26 water samples were collected by the chicago park district and qpcr testing was completed by the university of illinois at chicago those results were then posted to the city of chicago data portal typically around noon city of chicago 2016b about 5 min later we posted the predictions based on our model to the data portal city of chicago 2016a the last predictions and samples were conducted on september 4th while qpcr data were available for all beaches we ignored any qpcr reading except for the 5 beaches used as model inputs both predictions and samples were collected each day during the week this process was different from prior years where samples were usually collected only during weekdays and non holidays except when levels had been elevated on the previous friday or it was suspected to be a busy weekend on the beaches to translate the predicted e coli level to an advisory decision beaches that were forecasted to exceed 381 cfu 100 ml were predicted to have a swim advisory due to fib even though this threshold exceeds environmental protection agency epa requirements that threshold was empircally shown to be the best correlate to actual exceedances using epa standards subsequent lab testing and swim advisories due to fib were issued only if fib exceeded epa standards over the summer of 2017 we compared predictions to the results from the actual qpcr enterococci test results city of chicago 2016c and calculated several standard measurements to evaluate the performance of the model we specifically compared the predictions at the 15 beaches where the hybrid modeling was used to formulate predictions not on all 20 beaches because some were not predicted but were inputs for predictions at other beaches 3 1 results table 3 and fig 7 show the hybrid analytical model had a sensitivity true positive rate of 11 2 percent for the predicted beaches compared to an average of 3 4 percent at the same beaches in 2015 and 2016 that is the hybrid model increased the true positive rate by 230 percent over the historical average additionally these beaches have typically not been predicted as well as the other beaches the same prior model that averaged 3 4 percent for the 15 predicted beaches averaged 9 5 percent for all 20 beaches the precision of the model the portion of predicted high fib that were accurate compared to all predicted fib beach days also grew from 17 to 27 percent a 59 percent increase however the false positive rate was slightly higher at 2 percent during 2017 compared to our 1 8 percent target area under curve auc is a measure that shows the trade off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for the model the auc for the hybrid model is 0 753 which is higher than the prior day model that was around 0 64 in 2015 and 2016 a higher auc does indicate the model has improved the ability to estimate beaches with elevated bacteria levels without raising a disproportionate number of false positives the matthews correlation coefficient mcc provides an approximation for the goodness of fit for predictors like other correlation coefficients it ranges between 1 perfect prediction of elevated fib levels to 1 complete disagreement unlike auc it accounts for all four classification outcomes true positives true negatives false positives and false negatives the mcc for the hybrid model was substantially higher at 0 142 compared to 0 052 and 0 036 respectively for 2016 and 2015 it is another indication in the relatively improved model performance compared to prior day modeling we also compared performance to a model that combines interbeach correlation with predictors for precipitation sunlight wind proxies for human density and tidal and lake levels discussed in section 2 6 the performance of the multivariate hybrid model was similar to the hybrid model without other predictors auc for the multivate hybrid model was 0 738 0 015 lower the mcc for the multivarite model was substantially lower for the multivariate model at 0 044 key metrics for sensitivity 6 percent and precision 12 percent were lower than the hybrid only model this indicated that our predictors did not provide improvements to the precision of the predictions and most of the predictive power is provided by the interbeach correlation accuracy of the hybrid nowcast model was in line with the previous performance of the chicago prior day nowcast model since most days do not have elevated e coli levels the increase in sensitivity true positive rate did not make a major impact on overall accuracy which remained around 93 percent 3 2 discussion attempts in prior literature to forecast fib levels in beaches have used essentially the same functional form nevers and whitman 2005 frick et al 2008 hou et al 2006 lab data on fib from the previous day are combined with hydrometeorological and other predictors to predict whether fib levels will exceed the suggested thresholds ackerman and weisberg 2003 whitman et al 2004 smith et al 1999 recent innovations such as hydrometeorological sensors shively et al 2016 have enabled novel ways to collect the predictors leading to improved accuracy and reduced latency likewise more sophisticated algorithms such as machine learning and genetic algorithms cyterski et al 2014 brooks et al 2016 have been used to improve performance by allowing for more complex interactions between predictors yet the concept of these models still predominately relies on prior day laboratory results which we ve dubbed the prior day nowcast model evidence suggests that the contributors to high fib levels do not persist from day to day morrison et al 2003 cheung et al 1991 brenniman et al 1981 which can explain why many attempts to predict fib levels in beaches have not sustained high levels of accuracy previous research has found that fib levels in chicago s beaches are highly correlated and rarely encounter consecutive days of elevated fib levels whitman and nevers 2008 at the same time qpcr testing has become more widely used but is still expensive bienkowski 2017 because qpcr testing provides immediate results we proposed the hybrid nowcast model to use limited qpcr data from selected beaches to predict fib levels in other beaches by exploiting correlations between beaches the hybrid nowcast model removes the dependency on day old fib information commonly used in other models this approach more closely resembles a missing data problem where we are attempting to fill in the missing values beaches without qpcr testing for beach networks that are highly correlated like chicago s hybrid nowcasting was able to increase model sensitivity 230 percent without increasing the rate of false positives when a beach was predicted to have an elevated level it was 59 2 percent less likely to have been a false positive type i error the increase in correct predictions however was not induced by simply raising more erroneous warnings type ii errors as those only increased two tenths of a percent in terms of impact on beachgoers the hybrid model resulted in 90 correct advisories while there were 71 incorrect advisories in 2016 the chicago prior day nowcast model issued 12 correct advisories while issuing 184 incorrect advisories likewise in 2015 the prior day model issued 14 correct advisories versus 184 incorrect advisories the difference in performance was likely due to the use of qpcr to obtain fib levels on the same day since chicago beaches rarely encounter consecutive days of elevated fib levels prior day readings do not accurately predict elevated levels on the next day the factors that cause fib levels to grow rarely persist between days as few beaches have consecutive days of beach warnings however elevated fib levels portend ideal conditions for fib in other beaches on the same day we explored the addition of other predictors and covariates but it did not increase the model performance over the model only using interbeach correlation information and predictive power provided by covariates have already been captured by the qpcr testing conducted at other beaches for instance while rainfall can approximate the conditions for fib growth the variation of fib levels at other beaches is a better predictor since it is reliant on actual beach conditions the temporal linkage between observations for ideal fib conditions and actual fib growth has been hard to demonstrate in a large ecosystem like lake michigan meanwhile the interbeach correlations seem to provide a better signal that ideal conditions already exist nothwithstanding we also realize our hydrometeorological data is based on third party sources instead of active sensors in the water which may be more accurate and stronger predictors chicago beaches do have hydrometeorological sensors in place but those data are only available for a couple of years our measurements for visitor density are very loose approximations based on available data but does not mirror the methodology used in studies that have shown the relationship between human activity and fib levels these could be improved in the future and may provide better capability for prediction although chicago was able to deploy qpcr testing at all 20 beaches the cost and complexity of qpcr equipment limits widescale deployment moreover we removed four beaches from this model because of physical characteristics such as long breakwaters that prevented them from being clustered with other beaches one beach was removed due to frequently high readings and we used 5 beaches to predict culture based e coli levels as a result 10 total beaches would need to undergo enterococci qpcr testing and 10 beaches would be able to forgo any testing of the 10 undergoing qpcr testing 5 would be tested to estimate fib levels for 10 other beaches and the other 5 would need qpcr testing since they have distinct geographies breakwaters or other unique physical characteristics the hybrid model used predictor beaches that were more prone to elevated fib levels than all other beaches in each cluster foster north avenue leone 31st and south shore moreover we removed calumet from the model since it frequently had elevated levels beach monitors could levarage a similar strategy of deploying qpcr testing to frequently contaminated beaches and relying on statistical models for the remaining beaches this will naturally improve model performance since beaches which comprise the mode number of issues will be accurately measured leading to more accurate beach warnings and limits expensive equipment needed for rapid testing while this paper showed a 230 percent increase in sensitivity the ability to predict elevated fib levels is still relatively low one method to improve sensitivity without increasing auc is increasing the rate of false positives this method certainly would be an inconvenience for beachgoers but also increase the chance of warning beachgoers of elevated fib however there are a lack of guidelines or studies on acceptable levels of false positives our target rate was determined based on the average false positive rate for prior years it may be worthwhile to incorrectly predict additional beach warnings if it deters exposure to fib especially for children or those with weak immune systems research on predicting elevated fib can be guided by further research on the economic impact of incorrectly providing warnings when none were warranted that analysis can help this strand of research determine a target for an appropriate level of false negatives 4 conclusions hybrid nowcast modeling preserves information from the current day instead of test data from the prior day the modeling technique allows for limited deployments of the costly qpcr testing equipment sensitivity of predicting elevated fib levels increased from 3 4 percent to 11 2 percent a 230 percent increase while reducing false positive rates by 59 2 percent and maintaining similar rate for false negatives declarations of interest none acknowledgements we are indebted to chicago park district staff especially cathy
