8050,study region a typical grassland medicago sativa plot and a typical forest land robinia pseudoacacia plot located in the semi arid loess plateau china study focus field observations and scenario simulation approaches were used to investigate the potential impact of future warming and drying climate on the whole water budget and to assess whether how and to what degree the highly recommended man driven tree to grass conversion could alleviate the adverse impact of such climate change on soil water new hydrological insights for the region differences of interception and transpiration between two plots resulted in their different soil water storage under the warming and drying future climate interception and transpiration in two plots would experience significant reductions especially transpiration and m sativa plot could maintain more water than r pseudoacacia plot when r pseudoacacia was replaced by m sativa although interception would dramatically increase the transpiration would significantly decrease which made the soil water storage experience an insignificant change climate change and tree to grass conversion mainly exerted their influences in months with larger precipitation and vegetation conversion would reduce monthly t et our study improves the understanding of the hydrological processes under climate change and vegetation conversion and also provides valuable guidelines for the management of water resources and the restoration of ecological environment in the semi arid loess plateau keywords climate change vegetation conversion water budget the loess plateau hydrus 1d model 1 introduction climate change cc and land use cover change lucc are two important divers in the field of changing environment both of them can significantly affect the regional hydrological processes and ultimately have a profound impact on the development utilization and management of water resources brümmer et al 2012 odongo et al 2019 pulido velazquez et al 2021 cc and lucc often occur concurrently however their effect mechanisms on the water cycling differ greatly which will definitely cause strong disturbances to the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of water resources brümmer et al 2012 cavalcante et al 2019 adane et al 2018 therefore differentiating the effects of cc and lucc on water budget is a practical issue needs to be addressed which is of great significance to develop adaptive measures for regional water resources management cavalcante et al 2019 wang et al 2018 cc mainly affects hydrological processes through changes of precipitation temperature and other meteorological factors cavalcante et al 2019 these effects were recognized as a critical environmental concern and have been widely studied using methods of statistical analysis and modellings at large scales jung et al 2010 odongo et al 2019 pulido velazquez et al 2021 however existing studies mainly focused their attention on one specific budget i e runoff or evapotranspiration owing to the difficulties of partitioning all components on large scales cavalcante et al 2019 li et al 2019a and as a result of which responses of the whole hydrological processes to cc have not yet been entirely understood in order to further elucidate these effects a lot of research was also conducted at plot scales in recent years kai schwärzel et al 2019 montaldo et al 2020 however results of these studies differed greatly for example some studies reported that the transpiration responded linearly with cc li et al 2020 while others demonstrated non linear or non clear response patterns ghimire et al 2014 grossiord et al 2017 a main reason for which is the heterogeneity of climate and land use conditions in different regions therefore it is necessary to carry out such studies in specific areas moreover these assessments often use observed or remote sensed data to partition water budget under current or historical climate conditions limited research has been done to assess their changes under potential cc in the future li et al 2020 wang et al 2018 however such research will provide basic information for the water resources management and land use planning brümmer et al 2012 li et al 2020 which further illustrates the necessity of systematic research on the whole hydrological processes under changing climate in addition to cc lucc may also alter hydrological processes to a certain extent adane et al 2018 cavalcante et al 2019 nosetto et al 2012 in fact lucc measures such as the introduction of exotic species kai schwärzel et al 2019 li et al 2020 and the conversion of local vegetation nosetto et al 2012 rodriguez et al 2020 have been taken in many areas to regulate hydrological processes however there is still no consistent conclusion on how vegetation changed water budgets to date for instance the increase of forests resulted in significant reduction of water yield in most regions feng et al 2016 trabucco et al 2008 while in other areas the opposite was true chen et al 2010 li et al 2018c moreover in what way vegetation caused such changes is also controversial in some cases introduced vegetation was reported to intercepted more precipitation and thus reduced surface runoff ma et al 2019 wu et al 2020 while in others they were considered to dry the soil through greater transpiration and thereby increased infiltration and reduced runoff liancourt et al 2012 trabucco et al 2008 argues above are caused by differences in climate characteristics vegetation species and soil properties cavalcante et al 2019 sun et al 2018 therefore clarifying effect mechanisms of different vegetation under specific climatic contexts and underlying conditions is still necessary besides existing studies mainly used field observations to assess the impact of vegetation on water budget under current or historical climatic conditions adane et al 2018 ferlan et al 2016 yet relatively little work has explored the issue of whether vegetation could be converted to deal with future cc however this type of research will provide important bases to mitigate adverse impacts of cc on vegetation ecosystems and should therefore be paid full attention to the loess plateau 640 103 km2 located in northwest china is well known for its serious soil erosion and fragile ecology feng et al 2016 in order to mitigate soil erosion and land degradation numerous vegetation restoration measures including grain to green project have been implemented since 1950s jia et al 2020 to further improve vegetation coverage and remediate ecological functions odongo et al 2019 planted grass and forests indeed significantly alleviated soil erosion however they simultaneously brought some negative impacts such as sharp drops of runoff available and the excessive consumption of soil water feng et al 2016 kai schwärzel et al 2019 in fact numerous studies conducted in water stressed ecosystems have demonstrated that the water consumption of tree species was generally greater than that of grass chen et al 2010 coble et al 2020 nosetto et al 2012 showing that the forest land is more likely to cause the reduction of soil water therefore converting forests to grass may a possible way to reduce the risk above in the loess plateau especially under the background that the region is experiencing the climatic drying and warming jin et al 2017 in fact grasslands have been considered to be more suitable than forest land to optimise the trade off between soil erosion controlling and water resources maintaining in many semi arid regions wu et al 2020 and are therefore highly recommended to replace the forests in many areas of the loess plateau huang et al 2019 jia et al 2020 however up to now few studies have been carried out in the loess plateau to reveal the effects of the man made conversion from forests to grass on the whole hydrological processes furthermore whether such conversions can help to resist the adverse effects of future cc on soil water storage is also unknown issues above are critical for the survival of planted vegetation and the planning of land use in the loess plateau and also requires further investigation in this study a two year field experiment was conducted in a typical planted grassland medicago sativa which was harvested and stored as feed for livestock after the growing season without any anthropogenic management and a planted forest land robinia pseudoacacia a major tree species for afforestation in the semi arid loess plateau to establish models for simulating their water budget and to analyse their responses to future cc and potential vegetation conversion the main objectives were to 1 identify different effect mechanisms of typical grass species and tree species on water budget 2 quantify the potential impact of future cc on the whole water budget and 3 investigate whether how and to what degree the conversion from tree to grass can alleviate the adverse impacts of future cc on soil water storage the results of this study will not only deepen our understanding of hydrological processes in grasslands and forests in the loess plateau but also provide valuable references and guidance for sustainable vegetation conservation and management and rational utilization of water resources in semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and field plots selection this study was conducted in a typical small scale basin 36 5 km2 namely nanxiaohegou basin 107 30 107 37 e and 35 41 35 44 n 1058 1450 m a s l located in qingyang city in the central loess plateau china fig 1 the basin features a warm temperate continental climate with mean daily temperature and relative humidity of 8 7 c and 66 3 respectively the average annual precipitation there is 538 0 mm 1970 2018 of which more than 65 0 occurred during jun sept as heavy storms li et al 2020 the basin has a single geology structure and the main soil type is silt loam soil with a depth of 50 200 m which is vulnerable to water erosion guo et al 2018 the current vegetation is comprised of afforestation robinia pseudoacacia platycladus orientalis and pinus tabuliformis shrubs hippophae rhamnoides and sophora viciifolia constructed grass medicago sativa pennisetum giganteum and celosia cristata and natural grass imperata cylindrica and artemisia gmelinii and the growing season for most vegetation is from mid apr to mid oct li et al 2020 shi et al 2020 the basin was selected as a representative basin of the gully region of the loess plateau by the yellow river conservancy commission china in 1951 because of its typicality in topography and vegetation the original vegetation in the basin is mainly natural grass since the year of 1954 the basin has experienced several large scale vegetation restoration including afforestation and the planting of introduced grass aiming to control serious soil and water loss after detailed field investigation a r pseudoacacia plot and a m sativa plot fig 1 were selected as the experimental plots since they are widely distributed in the semi arid loess plateau huang et al 2019 kai schwärzel et al 2019 m sativa is a kind of perennial legume herb which was introduced into the basin in late apr 2014 to increase grass production with the premise of soil conservation it was sown in drills with a row space of 30 cm and sowing density of 2 0 kg hm 2 as reported by the local farmers r pseudoacacia is kind of deciduous broad leaved tree which was introduced and planted with a density of about 600 plant hm 2 in mid 1990s to control soil erosion during the growing season no anthropogenic management measure was implemented in both plots these two plots were closed to each other and they had similar environmental conditions therefore they were appropriate for investigating the effects of cc and vegetation conversion on water budget more detailed information of the experimental plots is given in table 1 after plots selection a series of measurement and observations were conducted based on which hydrus 1d model was calibrated and validated and the output of all water budget was simulated based on pre set climate change scenarios the main flowchart was showed in fig 2 and the details are described as sections below 2 2 measurements and observations field experiments were conducted in two consecutive growing seasons apr 15th oct 15th 2015 and 2016 auger method 5 cm in diameter was used to collect root samples in each plot with a depth interval of 10 cm and a maximum depth of 200 cm afterwards fine roots with a diameter of less than 0 2 cm xi et al 2013 were screened out with electronic vernier calipers and carefully collected after cleaning and drying 24 h at 105 then the root distribution density was calculated using the weighing method accuracy 0 01 g and the results are shown in fig b1 supplementary material afterwards the soil profile was divided into three soil layers namely 0 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm based on root density distribution and soil properties and soil moisture contents were all determined or monitored at 20 70 and 150 cm aiming to denote the average condition of each layer mentioned above such assumption was turned out to be valid in section 3 2 soil water retention curves and the soil particle size distribution were measured via a centrifuge measuring system kokusan ltd h 1400p f japan and a laser sizer malvern instruments ltd master sizer 2000 uk respectively the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using the constant water head method guo et al 2018 while the bulk density the saturated soil moisture content and the field water capacity were determined with the cutting ring method yi et al 2013 after which the residual soil moisture content was calculated by rosetta model based on the results of bulk density and particle size distribution schaap et al 2001 soil moisture content was recorded by two time domain reflectometers with intelligent microelements aozuo ecology instrumentation ltd trime pico tdr china fig b2 supplementary material with a time interval of 5 7 days after it was calibrated by the oven drying method 105 24 h soil evaporation was monitored using three self made lysimeters 16 cm in diameter and 25 cm in height every 1 7 days leaf area index lai was obtained by a canopy analysis system aozuo ecology instrumentation ltd winscanopy 2006a china fig b2 supplementary material multiple readings of soil moisture content soil evaporation and lai were averaged to reflect the average condition of each plot and soil depth during the experimental stages hourly precipitation and meteorological data air temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation were recorded using two automatic meteorological stations aozuo ecology instrumentation ltd watch dog series 2000 china fig 1 and fig b2 supplementary material then obtained data were transferred into daily data following perera et al 2015 for latter analysis when setting up climate scenarios afterwards related historical daily precipitation and meteorological data was obtained from seven uniformly distributed precipitation stations in the basin and the xifeng national meteorological station within 8 km from each plot fig 1 respectively the photos of the experimental plots and the schematic diagram and layout of the instruments in the field experiment are shown in fig b2 supplementary material 2 3 model description calibration and validation 2 3 1 hydrus 1d model numerous mature models such as hydrus šimůnek et al 2013 aquacrop raes et al 2009 swap van dam et al 1997 dssat hoogenboom et al 2019 and saltmed ragab 2002 could be used to simulate water balance under vegetation conditions in this study we used hydrus model since its model structure is relatively simple and the parameters required are relatively easy to be obtained considering the main micro topography was terrace and the water flux was mainly concentrated in the vertical direction its 1d version šimůnek et al 2013 was utilized to simulate water movement in each plot the model uses richards equation coupled with a sink term to control soil water movement and the specific equation is as follows richards 1931 1 θ t z k h z h z cos δ s r z t where θ is the volumetric soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 t is simulation time day z and h are the vertical coordinate cm and pressure head cm respectively δ is the angle between the flow direction and z axis with a value of 0 k h z refers to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm day 1 and can be calculated by van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 s r z t is the sink term representing root water uptake namely transpiration cm3 cm 3 day 1 s r z t in eq 1 is calculated using feddes model feddes et al 1974 as follows 2 s r z t t p β z α h z where t p is the potential transpiration rate mm d 1 β z is the normalized root spatial distribution function and its detailed calculation process could be found in šimůnek et al 2013 α h z is the water stress response function feddes et al 1974 the model uses beer equation ritchie 1972 to partition t p and potential evaporation rate e p mm d 1 3 t p e t p 1 exp μ lai 4 e p e t p exp μ lai where lai is the measured leaf area index μ is the extinction coefficient and its initial value for r pseudoacacia was set as 0 540 according to white et al 2000 while for m sativa it was set as the default value namely 0 463 et p was the potential crop evapotranspiration mm which should be calculated by multiplying the vegetation coefficient k c and the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 mm allen et al 1998 as the k c of vegetation varies largely under different underlying conditions the et 0 calculated by penman monteith formula allen et al 1998 was directly used to replace et p and this method was also widely used in numerous related studies cheng et al 2013 luo and sophocleous 2010 yi and fan 2016 after obtaining t p β z and α h z actual transpiration rate tr cm d 1 can be derived as follows 5 tr t p 0 lr s r z t dz t p 0 lr β z α h z dz where lr is the maximum depth of root distribution cm with values of 130 and 150 cm for m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively fig b1 supplementary material actual evaporation rate er mm d 1 in hydrus 1d was originally simulated based on e p and hcrita limit šimůnek et al 2013 therefore it failed to obtain er under conditions of water stress therefore the evaporation module was modified following ma et al 2011 as follows 6 er e p θ 0 0 65 θ f e p θ 0 θ r 0 65 θ f θ r θ r θ 0 0 65 θ f 0 θ 0 θ r where θ 0 and θ f are surface soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 and surface field water capacity cm3 cm 3 respectively in the model the canopy interception i mm d 1 was calculated as follows šimůnek et al 2013 7 i a lai 1 1 1 bp a lai where a and b are empirical parameters of the interception module the initial value of a was set as the default value namely 0 25 mm d 1 for m sativa and r pseudoacacia respectively while the value of b is approximately equal to 1 exp μ lai šimůnek et al 2013 p represents the precipitation mm d 1 2 3 2 initial and boundary conditions in this study the soil layer of 0 200 cm was selected as the simulation domain considering the maximum depth of fine root distribution in two plots were all less than 200 cm fig b1 supplementary material the upper boundary was defined as the atmospheric boundary with surface runoff to allow interactions between the atmosphere and the soil while the bottom boundary was set as the free drainage boundary on account of the deep burial more than 50 m of groundwater in the loess plateau shi et al 2020 yi and fan 2016 initial conditions were defined with observed soil moisture content profiles on the day before simulation apr 14th of 2015 and 2016 and models were run with daily time steps 2 4 model calibration and validation 2 4 1 parameters sensitivity analysis to ensure the simulation reliability parameter uncertainty analysis needs to be conducted pathak et al 2012 up to date numerous methods including monte carlo bayes and sensitivity analysis could be used for parameter uncertainty analysis li et al 2018a the present study adopted the sensitivity analysis method based on the modified morris screening method morris 1991 to analyze the uncertainty of parameters because it is simple to implement and is widely used in related studies li et al 2018a 2020 the modified morris screening method uses the technique with varying independent variables and a fixed step size that is a specific parameter was changed at fixed steps 5 and up to 20 of the initial value meanwhile other parameters was kept unchanged then the model was executed to get the output of each simulation afterwards the sensitivity index of this parameter was calculated as follows 8 s i 1 n 1 y i 1 y i y 0 p i 1 p i n 1 where s is the sensitivity index n is number of simulations y 0 y i and y i 1 are output values of the 1st ith and i 1 th simulations respectively p i and p i 1 are the percent changes of the parameter after the ith and i 1 th simulations respectively s could be divided into four levels according to li et al 2018a and details are shown in table 2 2 4 2 model calibration and validation the experimental period was divided into two parts i e 2015 and 2016 and observations from these two sub periods were used for model calibration and validation respectively in this study all initial values of parameters were calibrated using manual debugging according to the order of sensitivity index from high to low and their effectiveness were assessed by the nash sutcliffe coefficient ens nash and sutcliffe 1970 9 ens 1 i 1 m o i m i 2 i 1 m o i o avg 2 where m i o i and o avg are simulated observed and average observed value respectively m is the number of observations ens is less than 1 0 and the closer it to 1 0 the more accurate the model is 2 5 climate change and vegetation conversion scenarios 2 5 1 climate change scenarios in this study years of 2013 2018 were selected as the base period for three reasons 1 these years included or were close to the experimental periods and were thus the ones that best reflect current conditions 2 these years contained all kinds of hydrological years fig b3 supplementary material which can greatly reduce uncertainties of statistical results caused by the climate anomalies in an individual year 3 meteorological data in these years were completely monitored with no missing data therefore the model was firstly driven by the observed basin averaged precipitation from seven precipitation stations and meteorological data from xifeng national meteorological station of 2013 2018 aiming to output the water budgets under current climate conditions to quantitatively assess the impact of future cc validated hydrus 1d model was likewise executed under newly established future climate scenarios numerous studies have demonstrated that the precipitation and temperature were two dominant climatic factors influencing the water budget in the loess plateau jin et al 2017 li et al 2020 therefore future climate scenarios in this study were set with reference to the prediction results of temperature and precipitation from related studies zhao et al 2013 2014 in these two papers the authors selected hadcm3 pattern from the hadley center uk since it has been reported to have a good capability in simulating climatic factors in china jiang et al 2017 then the statistical downscaling model version 4 2 were calibrated and validated to downscale the output of a2 scenario a relatively extreme scenario which is recommended by the local soil and water conservation management organization xifeng management supervision of soil and water conservation in the yellow river 2020 to evaluate the responses of local hydrological processes to future climate change jiang et al 2017 li et al 2018b 2020 and eventually obtained monthly mean variation of daily precipitation and temperature in the study area in three future period 2020s 2050s and 2080s fig b6 supplementary material as the grain to green project would continue to 2050s ge et al 2020 our future climate scenarios were set by combining the observed data from our own base period and their projected variations in 2050s for more detailed information about the selection of climate pattern the calibration and validation of the statistical downscaling model and the comparisons of climatic factors between base and future period the reader is referred to the text a1 a2 and figs b4 b7 supplementary materials 2 5 2 vegetation conversion scenarios to assess the impacts of man driven tree to grass conversion on water budget simulations were also conducted under soil conditions of r pseudoacacia plot soil properties were kept unchanged meanwhile vegetation parameters of r pseudoacacia were totally replaced by the corresponding parameters of m sativa such scenario setting method was widely used worldwide and achieved acceptable results in simulating water budget under different vegetation conditions wang et al 2018 tong et al 2020 based on the pre set scenarios different impacts of cc and vegetation conversion could be statistically analysed 3 results 3 1 parameters sensitivity analysis observations of the calibration period 2015 were utilised to run models and then the sensitivity analysis for 16 soil hydraulic and five vegetation parameters was conducted using the modified morris screen method during the calculation outputs of transpiration were taken as an example the calculated sensitivity indices of soil hydraulic and vegetation parameters are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively it could be seen that of the soil hydraulic parameters n 1 and n 2 were the most sensitive parameters for m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively and they all presented a high sensitivity θ s1 and n 2 were high sensitive parameters for r pseudoacacia plot but sensitive parameters for m sativa plot θ s2 θ f and all vegetation parameters were all sensitive indicating that these parameters would greatly influence the transpiration in two plots θ r2 α 1 α 2 and k s1 were moderate sensitive parameters while θ r1 θ r3 θ s3 α 3 n 3 k s2 and k s3 exhibited low sensitivity the comparison of the different soil layers showed that the sensitivities of soil hydraulic parameters except for θ r1 and n 1 tended to be lower with the increase of the soil depth which may mainly be caused by fewer water absorbing roots distributed in deeper layers based on the analysis results initial parameters were subsequently optimised by the manual debugging which greatly minimised the workload of the parameters optimisation 3 2 model validation optimised parameters were used to run the model based on the observations of the validation period 2016 and outputs of soil moisture content and soil evaporation were used to validate the reliability of the model observed simulated soil moisture content and soil evaporation and their corresponding ens during the calibration period were illustrated in fig 3 it could be seen from fig 3 that the simulations of hydrus 1d were in good agreement with the field observations with ens of soil moisture contents and soil evaporation all above 0 700 for m sativa plot and 0 750 for r pseudoacacia plot respectively considering the fact that the groundwater depth in the loess plateau is so large with a depth of 60 80 m that it cannot be used by vegetation the soil moisture originated from precipitation is the only source of water resources for vegetation growth yi and fan 2016 hence the consumption of soil moisture in studied plots was mainly caused by the combined consequences of transpiration and evaporation therefore when the model can effectively control the dynamics of soil moisture content and evaporation it can be considered that an effective simulation of transpiration would also be achieved analysis above showed that hydrus 1d models performed well in simulating water movement in both plots which increased the reliability that models with optimised parameters could be used to output the water budget under scenarios of cc and vegetation conversion the optimized parameters were presented in table 5 3 3 model application 3 3 1 water budget under current conditions validated models were firstly employed to simulate water budget under current scenarios fig 4 aiming to reveal and to compare different effect mechanisms of two vegetation types the growing season precipitation of the base period ranged between 371 3 and 584 2 mm and were relatively concentrated in mid jun to mid sept similar to the temporal distribution of precipitation larger interception and transpiration of two plots occurred when the precipitation is larger in addition comparison between two plots showed that the interception of m sativa was larger than that of r pseudoacacia with its cumulative value 864 0 mm about 1 6 times of that of r pseudoacacia 530 5 mm as for transpiration its daily values varied greatly 0 0 5 6 and 0 0 9 0 mm for m sativa and r pseudoacacia plot respectively and the cumulative value was obviously lower in m sativa plot 860 9 mm than in r pseudoacacia plot 1324 0 mm compared with transpiration daily evaporation was only 0 0 3 4 and 0 0 3 1 mm in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively which were relatively more stable influenced by concentrated precipitation during late growing seasons the soil water storage all increased at the end of growing seasons however the increase amount differed significantly between two plots soil water storage of m sativa plot was lower than that of r pseudoacacia plot at the beginning of all growing seasons but when the growing season ended its values became close to that of r pseudoacacia or even larger with regard to the specific values the soil water storage of m sativa plot increased by 62 0 179 0 mm while in r pseudoacacia plot it was 34 0 140 0 mm which was considerably lower to compare the relative percentage of each component the average growing season amount and their percentages relative to the precipitation were calculated table 6 transpiration was the main way of water loss in both plots which accounted for the 30 3 13 1 and 45 9 15 4 of the precipitation in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively the second largest component of water loss for m sativa plot was interception whose percentage is just slightly lower than that of transpiration however when it comes to the r pseudoacacia plot it was soil evaporation comparison of soil evaporation and soil water storage between two plots showed that the evaporation was very close to each other and the soil moisture in m sativa plot was more effectively replenished results above indicated that different vegetation had limited effects on evaporation which mainly affected soil water supply by changing interception and transpiration and that m sativa was better for maintaining soil water during growing seasons 3 3 2 effects of climate change and tree to grass conversion on water budget to assess the effects of cc and tree to grass conversion water budget was also simulated under related pre set scenarios section 2 5 and their variations relative to the base period were calculated fig 5 growing season precipitation significantly t tests the same below p 0 05 decreased by 58 7 mm under cc while changes of other components were not consistent average interception and evaporation of m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots all showed small decrease with their maximum reduction no more than 10 0 mm transpiration in two plots sharply dropped by 28 6 and 37 7 mm p 0 05 respectively implying that both two vegetation species would transpire fewer water to resist the water deficit in the future as decreases of interception and transpiration were lower than that of precipitation replenishment amounts of soil water storage in two plots declined by 24 6 and 19 7 mm p 0 05 respectively showing that future cc would indeed have negative impacts on soil water by comparing change magnitudes of each component it was found that future cc mainly altered transpiration and soil water storage but has limited impacts on interception and evaporation it is noteworthy that although the reduction of soil water supply in m sativa plot was a bit larger its absolute replenish amount of soil water storage 72 4 36 1 mm was still larger than that of r pseudoacacia plot 46 3 39 3 mm table 6 and fig 5 indicating that m sativa would still have the advantage of storing more soil water under future cc such results also highlighted necessities of the conversion from r pseudoacacia to m sativa to cope with future cc to evaluate how and to what degree the conversion from r pseudoacacia to m sativa could mitigate the impact of future cc validated models were also executed under vegetation conversion scenarios and changes of all components were also generated fig 5 when considering both cc and vegetation conversion average interception would significantly p 0 05 increase by 45 6 mm while the transpiration and evaporation were expected to decrease by 86 6 and 18 1 mm p 0 05 respectively and as a result of which the soil water storage increased by 0 6 mm p 0 05 instead results above indicated that although the vegetation conversion increased the ineffective water loss caused by interception it could still mitigate the negative impacts of cc on soil water storage and such effects were mainly attributed to the greater reduction of water loss by transpiration 4 discussion 4 1 different effect mechanisms of the grass and tree species on water budget numerous studies suggested intensified soil water stress is the main controlling factor for the sustainable development of arid or semi arid ecosystems jung et al 2010 odongo et al 2019 therefore it is important to clarify different effect mechanisms of diverse vegetation on soil moisture in reality effect mechanisms of different vegetation are not identical even varies wildly many scholars argued tree species generally have larger canopy interception and transpiration than grass species coble et al 2020 wang et al 2018 and this might cause rapid and excessive soil water loss and thus exacerbated soil desiccation jiao et al 2018 wu et al 2020 while others considered the canopy of some grass species could also lead to more water consumption especially when the planting density is higher chen et al 2010 liu et al 2010 previous studies conducted in the study area by our research group shen 2013 yan 2015 have confirmed that in the m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots distributed on the terrace yearly runoff coefficients were all less than 3 0 and the deep percolation of soil layer below 200 cm is less than 10 mm such results are highly consistent with our simulations which on one hand confirms the reliability of this study and on the other suggests the different soil water conditions are mainly caused by other components namely interception evaporation and transpiration our results showed there was little difference in evaporation between two studied plots therefore differences of their soil water characteristics are mainly attributed to distinct effects of their canopy interception and transpiration such conclusions are consistent with lots of prior studies conducted in many water limited regions coble et al 2020 gu et al 2018 wu et al 2020 in this study the canopy interception of m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots accounted for 29 6 5 3 and 18 4 2 6 of the precipitation respectively table 6 which fall well into the ranges reported in various research gribovszki et al 2019 jin et al 2017 ma et al 2019 shen 2013 the interception of m sativa was obviously larger than that of r pseudoacacia which was deviated from the conventional view that grass intercepted less water than forests coble et al 2020 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2018 by comparing characteristics of their canopy it is found that this result is mainly caused by two reasons firstly m sativa is a leguminous species with a large canopy water holding capacity reflected by the parameter a in table 5 li et al 2020 while the r pseudoacacia is a deciduous broad leaved tree species which always has a lower one li et al 2018b ma et al 2019 and therefore leads to a smaller canopy interception the second reason could be obtained by comparing the lai between two plots fig b8 supplementary material m sativa had a higher planting density which resulted in larger lai and therefore larger interception coble et al 2020 li et al 2019a by contrast although the canopy of r pseudoacacia is larger than that of m sativa its canopy is relatively thinner which increases the possibility of raindrops penetrating the canopy and thereby reduces the interception ma et al 2019 sun et al 2018 the canopy interception of m sativa was larger than that of r pseudoacacia which should have caused less soil water recharge in m sativa plot however contrary to the expected results the replenish amount of soil water in m sativa plot is larger than that of r pseudoacacia plot at the end of growing seasons fig 4 and table 6 a main reason was that the transpiration of grass species was generally lower than that of tree species coble et al 2020 kai schwärzel et al 2019 namely m sativa transpired less water than r pseudoacacia table 6 the situation was generally caused by differences of root systems and canopy characteristics among vegetation species gu et al 2018 li et al 2020 nosetto et al 2012 this conclusion was reinforced and further deepened in this study r pseudoacacia has a larger extinction coefficient u which would lead to larger potential transpiration and ultimately larger actual one ritchie 1972 white et al 2000 in addition r pseudoacacia also has a larger water potential span of root water uptake which would also result in higher transpiration li et al 2018b 2020 šimůnek et al 2013 by comparing the relationship between transpiration interception and soil water storage it can be summarized that although differences of soil water storage in two plots are dominated by interception and transpiration their effect mechanisms are completely different in r pseudoacacia plot larger transpiration consumed too much water which offset the positive effect of smaller canopy interception on soil water in comparison m sativa has relatively smaller transpiration which alleviated the negative effect of larger canopy interception on soil water to a certain extent 4 2 how did climate change and vegetation conversion affect temporal dynamics of water budget how did cc and vegetation alter temporal dynamics of hydrological components varied greatly in different regions in some cases effects of cc or vegetation did not show strong seasonality montaldo et al 2020 whilst others found these effects are mainly concentrated in seasons with larger precipitation or higher temperature ghimire et al 2014 liancourt et al 2012 rodriguez et al 2020 as temporal dynamics of water components are closely related to anthropogenic managements such effects should also be evaluated locally graham et al 2016 in this study average monthly water budget was also calculated fig 6 under current conditions average monthly interception and transpiration in two plots both showed a unimodal curve and reached their maximum in jul and aug respectively by contrast evaporation in above two plots showed less variability influenced by the concentrated precipitation at late growing seasons average soil water storage in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots increased by 73 0 179 0 and 26 0 140 0 mm respectively and maintained at a relatively high level in jul oct under cc average monthly interception and transpiration showed a decrease in almost every month except for the interception of sept decreases of interception were 0 1 4 6 and 0 0 2 5 mm in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively and were significant p 0 05 in may aug corresponding decreases of transpiration were 0 7 10 6 and 0 0 13 9 mm and significant p 0 05 changes could be detected in jun sept corresponding changes of average monthly evaporation were only 1 1 to 4 7 and 0 9 to 1 9 mm respectively in two plots above and could be trivial when compared with interception and transpiration soil water storage would experience a significant p 0 05 reduction after jun in both plots indicating that future cc mainly exerted its negative impacts on soil water storage at late growing seasons when combined with vegetation conversion fig 6b 1 b 4 an increase of interception and a decrease of transpiration could be observed especially in may oct p 0 05 comparably the conversion only brought subtle changes to soil evaporation vegetation conversion increased soil water storage by 0 2 18 5 mm making it not significantly changed p 0 05 relative to each month of the base period results above showed that the tree to grass conversion was indeed a practical way to alleviate the adverse impacts of future cc by comparing temporal dynamics of interception transpiration and precipitation it could be found that both cc and vegetation conversion played a more obvious role by greatly changing the interception and transpiration in months with larger precipitation and such results were also similar with those in other arid or semi arid ecosystems jiao et al 2018 qiu et al 2011 rodriguez et al 2020 4 3 how did climate change and vegetation conversion change water use strategies the ratio of t to et is generally used as an indicator to assess the water use strategies of different vegetation species graham et al 2016 gu et al 2018 and its relationships with precipitation have been extensively investigated in various water stressed ecosystems however results of such studies have been inconsistent some studies found positive response patterns han et al 2018 li et al 2020 while others reported negative or unclear relationships between them gu et al 2018 jiao et al 2018 li et al 2019b the most possible reason for which was that the climate characteristics and vegetation conditions of these research are of great heterogeneity therefore it is necessary to conduct such evaluations under specific underlying conditions in this study t et was closely related with the precipitation on monthly scales and their relationships could be expressed by three robust logarithmic equations fig 7 average monthly t et ranged between 0 14 and 0 45 and 0 37 0 57 in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively which showed high similarities with numerous studies conducted across the world gu et al 2018 li et al 2019b it was notable that t et of r pseudoacacia plot was considerably higher that of m sativa plot under the same precipitation fig 7 b indicating that tree species consumed water more effectively than grass species which were also in line with published results from biomes with similar climate characteristics brümmer et al 2012 odongo et al 2019 with the decrease of monthly precipitation t et ratios in two plots all showed a decreasing trend and the decreasing rate was a bit larger in m sativa plot indicating that the normal growth of m sativa is more susceptible to climatic drought liancourt et al 2012 raz yaseef et al 2015 which highlighted the necessity to apply appropriate management measures in m sativa plot to prevent grassland degradation during drought by contrast t et in r pseudoacacia plot would still maintain at a relatively high level under conditions of water stress suggesting that r pseudoacacia has more abilities to cope with drought or water deficit jia et al 2019 li et al 2018b when the r pseudoacacia was converted to m sativa fig 7 b t et would experience a reduction of 0 08 0 15 and such reduction increased with the growing precipitation implying that tree to grass conversion would lead to less efficient water use especially in months with sufficient precipitation this result is congruent with previous findings on the conversion from forest to grass elsewhere coble et al 2020 woodward et al 2014 in addition it could also be found that the t et under vegetation conversion was considerably larger than that of m sativa plot when lower precipitation occurred indicating that after m sativa was planted into r pseudoacacia plots its tolerance to drought may be improved li et al 2020 however their values were similar when the precipitation was larger showing that after the implementation of vegetation conversion there is still a need to further improve the water use efficiency of m sativa in months with larger precipitation 4 4 suggestions for water resources management and limitations of this study it is well known that when vegetation measures were implemented to regulate water movements clarifying diverse effect mechanism of different vegetation and their responses to changing environment is of great importance coble et al 2020 wang et al 2018 our study revealed that influences of studied vegetation species on water balance were mainly attributed to their differences of interception and transpiration m sativa had a relatively larger interception and lower transpiration as well as a lower water use efficiency under diverse climate scenarios therefore m sativa should be pruned reasonably during the growing season to reduce the ineffective water loss meanwhile mixed planting with other low water consumption crops e g vigna radiata and glycine max fan et al 2016 should be considered during months with large precipitation jun sept to further improve water use efficiency without significantly increasing the total water consumption for r pseudoacacia its transpiration was larger and accounted for the major part of the soil water consumption which would lead to more water loss from deep soils and thus aggravated the formation of soil desiccation in deeper layers jia et al 2020 2019 considering that the pruning and tending of tree species every year is extremely time consuming and laborious the conversion from r pseudoacacia to m sativa is of practical significance to prevent the excessive soil water loss especially in the context of climatic warming and drying through the reasonable implementation of the above measures the water use efficiency can be further improved in m sativa plot while the risk of deep soil desiccation could be reduced in r pseudoacacia plot therefore they are of important guiding significance for the refined management of regional water resources and sustainable development of local ecosystems in this study influences of cc on vegetation physiological characteristics e g leaf area index water holding capability of leaves and potential thresholds of root water absorption etc and soil properties were not taken into account meanwhile other factors which may also influence vegetation parameters such as salinity accumulation were not considered either these factors however may affect hydrological processes to a certain extent and should not be ignored in follow up studies moreover with the continuous deepening and development of relevant research advantages of climate patterns in cmip6 will gradually become prominent which should also be taken into consideration in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of simulation results and to further deepen the understanding of hydrological response mechanisms to vegetation types and their conversion under changing climate 5 conclusion in this study hydrus 1d models were established based on field experiments to simulate water budget in a typical grassland medicago sativa plot and a typical forest land robinia pseudoacacia plot validation results showed that nash sutcliffe coefficients were above 0 700 for m sativa plot and 0 750 for r pseudoacacia plot then validated models were executed under pre set scenarios to reveal the effect mechanisms of each vegetation species and to quantify the potential effects of climate change and tree to grass conversion on the whole water budget the results showed that the transpiration is the main way for soil water loss accounting for 30 3 13 1 and 45 9 15 4 of the growing season precipitation in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively differences of interception and transpiration between two plots were the important reason resulting in their different soil water storage m sativa with a higher interception and a lower transpiration and relatively stored more soil water climate warming and drying in the future had relatively limited impacts on the amount of interception and evaporation but it significantly p 0 05 decreased transpiration by 28 6 and 37 7 mm in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively under the future climate m sativa were still more suitable for soil water maintaining with a complete replacement of trees with grass in the future average growing season transpiration is expected to decrease by 86 6 mm p 0 05 while interception to increase by 45 6 mm p 0 05 tree to grass conversion is an effective method to resist the adverse impacts of future climate on soil water after it was implemented the soil water storage would increase by 0 6 mm p 0 05 relative to the base period instead climate change and tree to grass conversion mainly exerted their influences in months with larger precipitation average monthly t et in two plots both increased logarithmically p 0 05 with the monthly precipitation and was lower in m sativa plot than in r pseudoacacia plot vegetation conversion would lead to a reduction of t et particularly in months with larger precipitation field experiments and scenario simulation approaches were comprehensively applied in this study to deepen our comprehension on the effects of climate change on the whole hydrological components in typical grassland and forest land in the loess plateau and to clarify the potential mitigation effect of tree to grass conversion to resist adverse impacts of climate change our study could not only provide important guidance for vegetation to cope with future climate change in the loess plateau but also give valuable references for formulating measures of meticulous water resources management and ecological restorations in other semi arid ecosystems

8050,study region a typical grassland medicago sativa plot and a typical forest land robinia pseudoacacia plot located in the semi arid loess plateau china study focus field observations and scenario simulation approaches were used to investigate the potential impact of future warming and drying climate on the whole water budget and to assess whether how and to what degree the highly recommended man driven tree to grass conversion could alleviate the adverse impact of such climate change on soil water new hydrological insights for the region differences of interception and transpiration between two plots resulted in their different soil water storage under the warming and drying future climate interception and transpiration in two plots would experience significant reductions especially transpiration and m sativa plot could maintain more water than r pseudoacacia plot when r pseudoacacia was replaced by m sativa although interception would dramatically increase the transpiration would significantly decrease which made the soil water storage experience an insignificant change climate change and tree to grass conversion mainly exerted their influences in months with larger precipitation and vegetation conversion would reduce monthly t et our study improves the understanding of the hydrological processes under climate change and vegetation conversion and also provides valuable guidelines for the management of water resources and the restoration of ecological environment in the semi arid loess plateau keywords climate change vegetation conversion water budget the loess plateau hydrus 1d model 1 introduction climate change cc and land use cover change lucc are two important divers in the field of changing environment both of them can significantly affect the regional hydrological processes and ultimately have a profound impact on the development utilization and management of water resources brümmer et al 2012 odongo et al 2019 pulido velazquez et al 2021 cc and lucc often occur concurrently however their effect mechanisms on the water cycling differ greatly which will definitely cause strong disturbances to the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of water resources brümmer et al 2012 cavalcante et al 2019 adane et al 2018 therefore differentiating the effects of cc and lucc on water budget is a practical issue needs to be addressed which is of great significance to develop adaptive measures for regional water resources management cavalcante et al 2019 wang et al 2018 cc mainly affects hydrological processes through changes of precipitation temperature and other meteorological factors cavalcante et al 2019 these effects were recognized as a critical environmental concern and have been widely studied using methods of statistical analysis and modellings at large scales jung et al 2010 odongo et al 2019 pulido velazquez et al 2021 however existing studies mainly focused their attention on one specific budget i e runoff or evapotranspiration owing to the difficulties of partitioning all components on large scales cavalcante et al 2019 li et al 2019a and as a result of which responses of the whole hydrological processes to cc have not yet been entirely understood in order to further elucidate these effects a lot of research was also conducted at plot scales in recent years kai schwärzel et al 2019 montaldo et al 2020 however results of these studies differed greatly for example some studies reported that the transpiration responded linearly with cc li et al 2020 while others demonstrated non linear or non clear response patterns ghimire et al 2014 grossiord et al 2017 a main reason for which is the heterogeneity of climate and land use conditions in different regions therefore it is necessary to carry out such studies in specific areas moreover these assessments often use observed or remote sensed data to partition water budget under current or historical climate conditions limited research has been done to assess their changes under potential cc in the future li et al 2020 wang et al 2018 however such research will provide basic information for the water resources management and land use planning brümmer et al 2012 li et al 2020 which further illustrates the necessity of systematic research on the whole hydrological processes under changing climate in addition to cc lucc may also alter hydrological processes to a certain extent adane et al 2018 cavalcante et al 2019 nosetto et al 2012 in fact lucc measures such as the introduction of exotic species kai schwärzel et al 2019 li et al 2020 and the conversion of local vegetation nosetto et al 2012 rodriguez et al 2020 have been taken in many areas to regulate hydrological processes however there is still no consistent conclusion on how vegetation changed water budgets to date for instance the increase of forests resulted in significant reduction of water yield in most regions feng et al 2016 trabucco et al 2008 while in other areas the opposite was true chen et al 2010 li et al 2018c moreover in what way vegetation caused such changes is also controversial in some cases introduced vegetation was reported to intercepted more precipitation and thus reduced surface runoff ma et al 2019 wu et al 2020 while in others they were considered to dry the soil through greater transpiration and thereby increased infiltration and reduced runoff liancourt et al 2012 trabucco et al 2008 argues above are caused by differences in climate characteristics vegetation species and soil properties cavalcante et al 2019 sun et al 2018 therefore clarifying effect mechanisms of different vegetation under specific climatic contexts and underlying conditions is still necessary besides existing studies mainly used field observations to assess the impact of vegetation on water budget under current or historical climatic conditions adane et al 2018 ferlan et al 2016 yet relatively little work has explored the issue of whether vegetation could be converted to deal with future cc however this type of research will provide important bases to mitigate adverse impacts of cc on vegetation ecosystems and should therefore be paid full attention to the loess plateau 640 103 km2 located in northwest china is well known for its serious soil erosion and fragile ecology feng et al 2016 in order to mitigate soil erosion and land degradation numerous vegetation restoration measures including grain to green project have been implemented since 1950s jia et al 2020 to further improve vegetation coverage and remediate ecological functions odongo et al 2019 planted grass and forests indeed significantly alleviated soil erosion however they simultaneously brought some negative impacts such as sharp drops of runoff available and the excessive consumption of soil water feng et al 2016 kai schwärzel et al 2019 in fact numerous studies conducted in water stressed ecosystems have demonstrated that the water consumption of tree species was generally greater than that of grass chen et al 2010 coble et al 2020 nosetto et al 2012 showing that the forest land is more likely to cause the reduction of soil water therefore converting forests to grass may a possible way to reduce the risk above in the loess plateau especially under the background that the region is experiencing the climatic drying and warming jin et al 2017 in fact grasslands have been considered to be more suitable than forest land to optimise the trade off between soil erosion controlling and water resources maintaining in many semi arid regions wu et al 2020 and are therefore highly recommended to replace the forests in many areas of the loess plateau huang et al 2019 jia et al 2020 however up to now few studies have been carried out in the loess plateau to reveal the effects of the man made conversion from forests to grass on the whole hydrological processes furthermore whether such conversions can help to resist the adverse effects of future cc on soil water storage is also unknown issues above are critical for the survival of planted vegetation and the planning of land use in the loess plateau and also requires further investigation in this study a two year field experiment was conducted in a typical planted grassland medicago sativa which was harvested and stored as feed for livestock after the growing season without any anthropogenic management and a planted forest land robinia pseudoacacia a major tree species for afforestation in the semi arid loess plateau to establish models for simulating their water budget and to analyse their responses to future cc and potential vegetation conversion the main objectives were to 1 identify different effect mechanisms of typical grass species and tree species on water budget 2 quantify the potential impact of future cc on the whole water budget and 3 investigate whether how and to what degree the conversion from tree to grass can alleviate the adverse impacts of future cc on soil water storage the results of this study will not only deepen our understanding of hydrological processes in grasslands and forests in the loess plateau but also provide valuable references and guidance for sustainable vegetation conservation and management and rational utilization of water resources in semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and field plots selection this study was conducted in a typical small scale basin 36 5 km2 namely nanxiaohegou basin 107 30 107 37 e and 35 41 35 44 n 1058 1450 m a s l located in qingyang city in the central loess plateau china fig 1 the basin features a warm temperate continental climate with mean daily temperature and relative humidity of 8 7 c and 66 3 respectively the average annual precipitation there is 538 0 mm 1970 2018 of which more than 65 0 occurred during jun sept as heavy storms li et al 2020 the basin has a single geology structure and the main soil type is silt loam soil with a depth of 50 200 m which is vulnerable to water erosion guo et al 2018 the current vegetation is comprised of afforestation robinia pseudoacacia platycladus orientalis and pinus tabuliformis shrubs hippophae rhamnoides and sophora viciifolia constructed grass medicago sativa pennisetum giganteum and celosia cristata and natural grass imperata cylindrica and artemisia gmelinii and the growing season for most vegetation is from mid apr to mid oct li et al 2020 shi et al 2020 the basin was selected as a representative basin of the gully region of the loess plateau by the yellow river conservancy commission china in 1951 because of its typicality in topography and vegetation the original vegetation in the basin is mainly natural grass since the year of 1954 the basin has experienced several large scale vegetation restoration including afforestation and the planting of introduced grass aiming to control serious soil and water loss after detailed field investigation a r pseudoacacia plot and a m sativa plot fig 1 were selected as the experimental plots since they are widely distributed in the semi arid loess plateau huang et al 2019 kai schwärzel et al 2019 m sativa is a kind of perennial legume herb which was introduced into the basin in late apr 2014 to increase grass production with the premise of soil conservation it was sown in drills with a row space of 30 cm and sowing density of 2 0 kg hm 2 as reported by the local farmers r pseudoacacia is kind of deciduous broad leaved tree which was introduced and planted with a density of about 600 plant hm 2 in mid 1990s to control soil erosion during the growing season no anthropogenic management measure was implemented in both plots these two plots were closed to each other and they had similar environmental conditions therefore they were appropriate for investigating the effects of cc and vegetation conversion on water budget more detailed information of the experimental plots is given in table 1 after plots selection a series of measurement and observations were conducted based on which hydrus 1d model was calibrated and validated and the output of all water budget was simulated based on pre set climate change scenarios the main flowchart was showed in fig 2 and the details are described as sections below 2 2 measurements and observations field experiments were conducted in two consecutive growing seasons apr 15th oct 15th 2015 and 2016 auger method 5 cm in diameter was used to collect root samples in each plot with a depth interval of 10 cm and a maximum depth of 200 cm afterwards fine roots with a diameter of less than 0 2 cm xi et al 2013 were screened out with electronic vernier calipers and carefully collected after cleaning and drying 24 h at 105 then the root distribution density was calculated using the weighing method accuracy 0 01 g and the results are shown in fig b1 supplementary material afterwards the soil profile was divided into three soil layers namely 0 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm based on root density distribution and soil properties and soil moisture contents were all determined or monitored at 20 70 and 150 cm aiming to denote the average condition of each layer mentioned above such assumption was turned out to be valid in section 3 2 soil water retention curves and the soil particle size distribution were measured via a centrifuge measuring system kokusan ltd h 1400p f japan and a laser sizer malvern instruments ltd master sizer 2000 uk respectively the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using the constant water head method guo et al 2018 while the bulk density the saturated soil moisture content and the field water capacity were determined with the cutting ring method yi et al 2013 after which the residual soil moisture content was calculated by rosetta model based on the results of bulk density and particle size distribution schaap et al 2001 soil moisture content was recorded by two time domain reflectometers with intelligent microelements aozuo ecology instrumentation ltd trime pico tdr china fig b2 supplementary material with a time interval of 5 7 days after it was calibrated by the oven drying method 105 24 h soil evaporation was monitored using three self made lysimeters 16 cm in diameter and 25 cm in height every 1 7 days leaf area index lai was obtained by a canopy analysis system aozuo ecology instrumentation ltd winscanopy 2006a china fig b2 supplementary material multiple readings of soil moisture content soil evaporation and lai were averaged to reflect the average condition of each plot and soil depth during the experimental stages hourly precipitation and meteorological data air temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation were recorded using two automatic meteorological stations aozuo ecology instrumentation ltd watch dog series 2000 china fig 1 and fig b2 supplementary material then obtained data were transferred into daily data following perera et al 2015 for latter analysis when setting up climate scenarios afterwards related historical daily precipitation and meteorological data was obtained from seven uniformly distributed precipitation stations in the basin and the xifeng national meteorological station within 8 km from each plot fig 1 respectively the photos of the experimental plots and the schematic diagram and layout of the instruments in the field experiment are shown in fig b2 supplementary material 2 3 model description calibration and validation 2 3 1 hydrus 1d model numerous mature models such as hydrus šimůnek et al 2013 aquacrop raes et al 2009 swap van dam et al 1997 dssat hoogenboom et al 2019 and saltmed ragab 2002 could be used to simulate water balance under vegetation conditions in this study we used hydrus model since its model structure is relatively simple and the parameters required are relatively easy to be obtained considering the main micro topography was terrace and the water flux was mainly concentrated in the vertical direction its 1d version šimůnek et al 2013 was utilized to simulate water movement in each plot the model uses richards equation coupled with a sink term to control soil water movement and the specific equation is as follows richards 1931 1 θ t z k h z h z cos δ s r z t where θ is the volumetric soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 t is simulation time day z and h are the vertical coordinate cm and pressure head cm respectively δ is the angle between the flow direction and z axis with a value of 0 k h z refers to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm day 1 and can be calculated by van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 s r z t is the sink term representing root water uptake namely transpiration cm3 cm 3 day 1 s r z t in eq 1 is calculated using feddes model feddes et al 1974 as follows 2 s r z t t p β z α h z where t p is the potential transpiration rate mm d 1 β z is the normalized root spatial distribution function and its detailed calculation process could be found in šimůnek et al 2013 α h z is the water stress response function feddes et al 1974 the model uses beer equation ritchie 1972 to partition t p and potential evaporation rate e p mm d 1 3 t p e t p 1 exp μ lai 4 e p e t p exp μ lai where lai is the measured leaf area index μ is the extinction coefficient and its initial value for r pseudoacacia was set as 0 540 according to white et al 2000 while for m sativa it was set as the default value namely 0 463 et p was the potential crop evapotranspiration mm which should be calculated by multiplying the vegetation coefficient k c and the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 mm allen et al 1998 as the k c of vegetation varies largely under different underlying conditions the et 0 calculated by penman monteith formula allen et al 1998 was directly used to replace et p and this method was also widely used in numerous related studies cheng et al 2013 luo and sophocleous 2010 yi and fan 2016 after obtaining t p β z and α h z actual transpiration rate tr cm d 1 can be derived as follows 5 tr t p 0 lr s r z t dz t p 0 lr β z α h z dz where lr is the maximum depth of root distribution cm with values of 130 and 150 cm for m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively fig b1 supplementary material actual evaporation rate er mm d 1 in hydrus 1d was originally simulated based on e p and hcrita limit šimůnek et al 2013 therefore it failed to obtain er under conditions of water stress therefore the evaporation module was modified following ma et al 2011 as follows 6 er e p θ 0 0 65 θ f e p θ 0 θ r 0 65 θ f θ r θ r θ 0 0 65 θ f 0 θ 0 θ r where θ 0 and θ f are surface soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 and surface field water capacity cm3 cm 3 respectively in the model the canopy interception i mm d 1 was calculated as follows šimůnek et al 2013 7 i a lai 1 1 1 bp a lai where a and b are empirical parameters of the interception module the initial value of a was set as the default value namely 0 25 mm d 1 for m sativa and r pseudoacacia respectively while the value of b is approximately equal to 1 exp μ lai šimůnek et al 2013 p represents the precipitation mm d 1 2 3 2 initial and boundary conditions in this study the soil layer of 0 200 cm was selected as the simulation domain considering the maximum depth of fine root distribution in two plots were all less than 200 cm fig b1 supplementary material the upper boundary was defined as the atmospheric boundary with surface runoff to allow interactions between the atmosphere and the soil while the bottom boundary was set as the free drainage boundary on account of the deep burial more than 50 m of groundwater in the loess plateau shi et al 2020 yi and fan 2016 initial conditions were defined with observed soil moisture content profiles on the day before simulation apr 14th of 2015 and 2016 and models were run with daily time steps 2 4 model calibration and validation 2 4 1 parameters sensitivity analysis to ensure the simulation reliability parameter uncertainty analysis needs to be conducted pathak et al 2012 up to date numerous methods including monte carlo bayes and sensitivity analysis could be used for parameter uncertainty analysis li et al 2018a the present study adopted the sensitivity analysis method based on the modified morris screening method morris 1991 to analyze the uncertainty of parameters because it is simple to implement and is widely used in related studies li et al 2018a 2020 the modified morris screening method uses the technique with varying independent variables and a fixed step size that is a specific parameter was changed at fixed steps 5 and up to 20 of the initial value meanwhile other parameters was kept unchanged then the model was executed to get the output of each simulation afterwards the sensitivity index of this parameter was calculated as follows 8 s i 1 n 1 y i 1 y i y 0 p i 1 p i n 1 where s is the sensitivity index n is number of simulations y 0 y i and y i 1 are output values of the 1st ith and i 1 th simulations respectively p i and p i 1 are the percent changes of the parameter after the ith and i 1 th simulations respectively s could be divided into four levels according to li et al 2018a and details are shown in table 2 2 4 2 model calibration and validation the experimental period was divided into two parts i e 2015 and 2016 and observations from these two sub periods were used for model calibration and validation respectively in this study all initial values of parameters were calibrated using manual debugging according to the order of sensitivity index from high to low and their effectiveness were assessed by the nash sutcliffe coefficient ens nash and sutcliffe 1970 9 ens 1 i 1 m o i m i 2 i 1 m o i o avg 2 where m i o i and o avg are simulated observed and average observed value respectively m is the number of observations ens is less than 1 0 and the closer it to 1 0 the more accurate the model is 2 5 climate change and vegetation conversion scenarios 2 5 1 climate change scenarios in this study years of 2013 2018 were selected as the base period for three reasons 1 these years included or were close to the experimental periods and were thus the ones that best reflect current conditions 2 these years contained all kinds of hydrological years fig b3 supplementary material which can greatly reduce uncertainties of statistical results caused by the climate anomalies in an individual year 3 meteorological data in these years were completely monitored with no missing data therefore the model was firstly driven by the observed basin averaged precipitation from seven precipitation stations and meteorological data from xifeng national meteorological station of 2013 2018 aiming to output the water budgets under current climate conditions to quantitatively assess the impact of future cc validated hydrus 1d model was likewise executed under newly established future climate scenarios numerous studies have demonstrated that the precipitation and temperature were two dominant climatic factors influencing the water budget in the loess plateau jin et al 2017 li et al 2020 therefore future climate scenarios in this study were set with reference to the prediction results of temperature and precipitation from related studies zhao et al 2013 2014 in these two papers the authors selected hadcm3 pattern from the hadley center uk since it has been reported to have a good capability in simulating climatic factors in china jiang et al 2017 then the statistical downscaling model version 4 2 were calibrated and validated to downscale the output of a2 scenario a relatively extreme scenario which is recommended by the local soil and water conservation management organization xifeng management supervision of soil and water conservation in the yellow river 2020 to evaluate the responses of local hydrological processes to future climate change jiang et al 2017 li et al 2018b 2020 and eventually obtained monthly mean variation of daily precipitation and temperature in the study area in three future period 2020s 2050s and 2080s fig b6 supplementary material as the grain to green project would continue to 2050s ge et al 2020 our future climate scenarios were set by combining the observed data from our own base period and their projected variations in 2050s for more detailed information about the selection of climate pattern the calibration and validation of the statistical downscaling model and the comparisons of climatic factors between base and future period the reader is referred to the text a1 a2 and figs b4 b7 supplementary materials 2 5 2 vegetation conversion scenarios to assess the impacts of man driven tree to grass conversion on water budget simulations were also conducted under soil conditions of r pseudoacacia plot soil properties were kept unchanged meanwhile vegetation parameters of r pseudoacacia were totally replaced by the corresponding parameters of m sativa such scenario setting method was widely used worldwide and achieved acceptable results in simulating water budget under different vegetation conditions wang et al 2018 tong et al 2020 based on the pre set scenarios different impacts of cc and vegetation conversion could be statistically analysed 3 results 3 1 parameters sensitivity analysis observations of the calibration period 2015 were utilised to run models and then the sensitivity analysis for 16 soil hydraulic and five vegetation parameters was conducted using the modified morris screen method during the calculation outputs of transpiration were taken as an example the calculated sensitivity indices of soil hydraulic and vegetation parameters are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively it could be seen that of the soil hydraulic parameters n 1 and n 2 were the most sensitive parameters for m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively and they all presented a high sensitivity θ s1 and n 2 were high sensitive parameters for r pseudoacacia plot but sensitive parameters for m sativa plot θ s2 θ f and all vegetation parameters were all sensitive indicating that these parameters would greatly influence the transpiration in two plots θ r2 α 1 α 2 and k s1 were moderate sensitive parameters while θ r1 θ r3 θ s3 α 3 n 3 k s2 and k s3 exhibited low sensitivity the comparison of the different soil layers showed that the sensitivities of soil hydraulic parameters except for θ r1 and n 1 tended to be lower with the increase of the soil depth which may mainly be caused by fewer water absorbing roots distributed in deeper layers based on the analysis results initial parameters were subsequently optimised by the manual debugging which greatly minimised the workload of the parameters optimisation 3 2 model validation optimised parameters were used to run the model based on the observations of the validation period 2016 and outputs of soil moisture content and soil evaporation were used to validate the reliability of the model observed simulated soil moisture content and soil evaporation and their corresponding ens during the calibration period were illustrated in fig 3 it could be seen from fig 3 that the simulations of hydrus 1d were in good agreement with the field observations with ens of soil moisture contents and soil evaporation all above 0 700 for m sativa plot and 0 750 for r pseudoacacia plot respectively considering the fact that the groundwater depth in the loess plateau is so large with a depth of 60 80 m that it cannot be used by vegetation the soil moisture originated from precipitation is the only source of water resources for vegetation growth yi and fan 2016 hence the consumption of soil moisture in studied plots was mainly caused by the combined consequences of transpiration and evaporation therefore when the model can effectively control the dynamics of soil moisture content and evaporation it can be considered that an effective simulation of transpiration would also be achieved analysis above showed that hydrus 1d models performed well in simulating water movement in both plots which increased the reliability that models with optimised parameters could be used to output the water budget under scenarios of cc and vegetation conversion the optimized parameters were presented in table 5 3 3 model application 3 3 1 water budget under current conditions validated models were firstly employed to simulate water budget under current scenarios fig 4 aiming to reveal and to compare different effect mechanisms of two vegetation types the growing season precipitation of the base period ranged between 371 3 and 584 2 mm and were relatively concentrated in mid jun to mid sept similar to the temporal distribution of precipitation larger interception and transpiration of two plots occurred when the precipitation is larger in addition comparison between two plots showed that the interception of m sativa was larger than that of r pseudoacacia with its cumulative value 864 0 mm about 1 6 times of that of r pseudoacacia 530 5 mm as for transpiration its daily values varied greatly 0 0 5 6 and 0 0 9 0 mm for m sativa and r pseudoacacia plot respectively and the cumulative value was obviously lower in m sativa plot 860 9 mm than in r pseudoacacia plot 1324 0 mm compared with transpiration daily evaporation was only 0 0 3 4 and 0 0 3 1 mm in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively which were relatively more stable influenced by concentrated precipitation during late growing seasons the soil water storage all increased at the end of growing seasons however the increase amount differed significantly between two plots soil water storage of m sativa plot was lower than that of r pseudoacacia plot at the beginning of all growing seasons but when the growing season ended its values became close to that of r pseudoacacia or even larger with regard to the specific values the soil water storage of m sativa plot increased by 62 0 179 0 mm while in r pseudoacacia plot it was 34 0 140 0 mm which was considerably lower to compare the relative percentage of each component the average growing season amount and their percentages relative to the precipitation were calculated table 6 transpiration was the main way of water loss in both plots which accounted for the 30 3 13 1 and 45 9 15 4 of the precipitation in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively the second largest component of water loss for m sativa plot was interception whose percentage is just slightly lower than that of transpiration however when it comes to the r pseudoacacia plot it was soil evaporation comparison of soil evaporation and soil water storage between two plots showed that the evaporation was very close to each other and the soil moisture in m sativa plot was more effectively replenished results above indicated that different vegetation had limited effects on evaporation which mainly affected soil water supply by changing interception and transpiration and that m sativa was better for maintaining soil water during growing seasons 3 3 2 effects of climate change and tree to grass conversion on water budget to assess the effects of cc and tree to grass conversion water budget was also simulated under related pre set scenarios section 2 5 and their variations relative to the base period were calculated fig 5 growing season precipitation significantly t tests the same below p 0 05 decreased by 58 7 mm under cc while changes of other components were not consistent average interception and evaporation of m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots all showed small decrease with their maximum reduction no more than 10 0 mm transpiration in two plots sharply dropped by 28 6 and 37 7 mm p 0 05 respectively implying that both two vegetation species would transpire fewer water to resist the water deficit in the future as decreases of interception and transpiration were lower than that of precipitation replenishment amounts of soil water storage in two plots declined by 24 6 and 19 7 mm p 0 05 respectively showing that future cc would indeed have negative impacts on soil water by comparing change magnitudes of each component it was found that future cc mainly altered transpiration and soil water storage but has limited impacts on interception and evaporation it is noteworthy that although the reduction of soil water supply in m sativa plot was a bit larger its absolute replenish amount of soil water storage 72 4 36 1 mm was still larger than that of r pseudoacacia plot 46 3 39 3 mm table 6 and fig 5 indicating that m sativa would still have the advantage of storing more soil water under future cc such results also highlighted necessities of the conversion from r pseudoacacia to m sativa to cope with future cc to evaluate how and to what degree the conversion from r pseudoacacia to m sativa could mitigate the impact of future cc validated models were also executed under vegetation conversion scenarios and changes of all components were also generated fig 5 when considering both cc and vegetation conversion average interception would significantly p 0 05 increase by 45 6 mm while the transpiration and evaporation were expected to decrease by 86 6 and 18 1 mm p 0 05 respectively and as a result of which the soil water storage increased by 0 6 mm p 0 05 instead results above indicated that although the vegetation conversion increased the ineffective water loss caused by interception it could still mitigate the negative impacts of cc on soil water storage and such effects were mainly attributed to the greater reduction of water loss by transpiration 4 discussion 4 1 different effect mechanisms of the grass and tree species on water budget numerous studies suggested intensified soil water stress is the main controlling factor for the sustainable development of arid or semi arid ecosystems jung et al 2010 odongo et al 2019 therefore it is important to clarify different effect mechanisms of diverse vegetation on soil moisture in reality effect mechanisms of different vegetation are not identical even varies wildly many scholars argued tree species generally have larger canopy interception and transpiration than grass species coble et al 2020 wang et al 2018 and this might cause rapid and excessive soil water loss and thus exacerbated soil desiccation jiao et al 2018 wu et al 2020 while others considered the canopy of some grass species could also lead to more water consumption especially when the planting density is higher chen et al 2010 liu et al 2010 previous studies conducted in the study area by our research group shen 2013 yan 2015 have confirmed that in the m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots distributed on the terrace yearly runoff coefficients were all less than 3 0 and the deep percolation of soil layer below 200 cm is less than 10 mm such results are highly consistent with our simulations which on one hand confirms the reliability of this study and on the other suggests the different soil water conditions are mainly caused by other components namely interception evaporation and transpiration our results showed there was little difference in evaporation between two studied plots therefore differences of their soil water characteristics are mainly attributed to distinct effects of their canopy interception and transpiration such conclusions are consistent with lots of prior studies conducted in many water limited regions coble et al 2020 gu et al 2018 wu et al 2020 in this study the canopy interception of m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots accounted for 29 6 5 3 and 18 4 2 6 of the precipitation respectively table 6 which fall well into the ranges reported in various research gribovszki et al 2019 jin et al 2017 ma et al 2019 shen 2013 the interception of m sativa was obviously larger than that of r pseudoacacia which was deviated from the conventional view that grass intercepted less water than forests coble et al 2020 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2018 by comparing characteristics of their canopy it is found that this result is mainly caused by two reasons firstly m sativa is a leguminous species with a large canopy water holding capacity reflected by the parameter a in table 5 li et al 2020 while the r pseudoacacia is a deciduous broad leaved tree species which always has a lower one li et al 2018b ma et al 2019 and therefore leads to a smaller canopy interception the second reason could be obtained by comparing the lai between two plots fig b8 supplementary material m sativa had a higher planting density which resulted in larger lai and therefore larger interception coble et al 2020 li et al 2019a by contrast although the canopy of r pseudoacacia is larger than that of m sativa its canopy is relatively thinner which increases the possibility of raindrops penetrating the canopy and thereby reduces the interception ma et al 2019 sun et al 2018 the canopy interception of m sativa was larger than that of r pseudoacacia which should have caused less soil water recharge in m sativa plot however contrary to the expected results the replenish amount of soil water in m sativa plot is larger than that of r pseudoacacia plot at the end of growing seasons fig 4 and table 6 a main reason was that the transpiration of grass species was generally lower than that of tree species coble et al 2020 kai schwärzel et al 2019 namely m sativa transpired less water than r pseudoacacia table 6 the situation was generally caused by differences of root systems and canopy characteristics among vegetation species gu et al 2018 li et al 2020 nosetto et al 2012 this conclusion was reinforced and further deepened in this study r pseudoacacia has a larger extinction coefficient u which would lead to larger potential transpiration and ultimately larger actual one ritchie 1972 white et al 2000 in addition r pseudoacacia also has a larger water potential span of root water uptake which would also result in higher transpiration li et al 2018b 2020 šimůnek et al 2013 by comparing the relationship between transpiration interception and soil water storage it can be summarized that although differences of soil water storage in two plots are dominated by interception and transpiration their effect mechanisms are completely different in r pseudoacacia plot larger transpiration consumed too much water which offset the positive effect of smaller canopy interception on soil water in comparison m sativa has relatively smaller transpiration which alleviated the negative effect of larger canopy interception on soil water to a certain extent 4 2 how did climate change and vegetation conversion affect temporal dynamics of water budget how did cc and vegetation alter temporal dynamics of hydrological components varied greatly in different regions in some cases effects of cc or vegetation did not show strong seasonality montaldo et al 2020 whilst others found these effects are mainly concentrated in seasons with larger precipitation or higher temperature ghimire et al 2014 liancourt et al 2012 rodriguez et al 2020 as temporal dynamics of water components are closely related to anthropogenic managements such effects should also be evaluated locally graham et al 2016 in this study average monthly water budget was also calculated fig 6 under current conditions average monthly interception and transpiration in two plots both showed a unimodal curve and reached their maximum in jul and aug respectively by contrast evaporation in above two plots showed less variability influenced by the concentrated precipitation at late growing seasons average soil water storage in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots increased by 73 0 179 0 and 26 0 140 0 mm respectively and maintained at a relatively high level in jul oct under cc average monthly interception and transpiration showed a decrease in almost every month except for the interception of sept decreases of interception were 0 1 4 6 and 0 0 2 5 mm in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively and were significant p 0 05 in may aug corresponding decreases of transpiration were 0 7 10 6 and 0 0 13 9 mm and significant p 0 05 changes could be detected in jun sept corresponding changes of average monthly evaporation were only 1 1 to 4 7 and 0 9 to 1 9 mm respectively in two plots above and could be trivial when compared with interception and transpiration soil water storage would experience a significant p 0 05 reduction after jun in both plots indicating that future cc mainly exerted its negative impacts on soil water storage at late growing seasons when combined with vegetation conversion fig 6b 1 b 4 an increase of interception and a decrease of transpiration could be observed especially in may oct p 0 05 comparably the conversion only brought subtle changes to soil evaporation vegetation conversion increased soil water storage by 0 2 18 5 mm making it not significantly changed p 0 05 relative to each month of the base period results above showed that the tree to grass conversion was indeed a practical way to alleviate the adverse impacts of future cc by comparing temporal dynamics of interception transpiration and precipitation it could be found that both cc and vegetation conversion played a more obvious role by greatly changing the interception and transpiration in months with larger precipitation and such results were also similar with those in other arid or semi arid ecosystems jiao et al 2018 qiu et al 2011 rodriguez et al 2020 4 3 how did climate change and vegetation conversion change water use strategies the ratio of t to et is generally used as an indicator to assess the water use strategies of different vegetation species graham et al 2016 gu et al 2018 and its relationships with precipitation have been extensively investigated in various water stressed ecosystems however results of such studies have been inconsistent some studies found positive response patterns han et al 2018 li et al 2020 while others reported negative or unclear relationships between them gu et al 2018 jiao et al 2018 li et al 2019b the most possible reason for which was that the climate characteristics and vegetation conditions of these research are of great heterogeneity therefore it is necessary to conduct such evaluations under specific underlying conditions in this study t et was closely related with the precipitation on monthly scales and their relationships could be expressed by three robust logarithmic equations fig 7 average monthly t et ranged between 0 14 and 0 45 and 0 37 0 57 in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively which showed high similarities with numerous studies conducted across the world gu et al 2018 li et al 2019b it was notable that t et of r pseudoacacia plot was considerably higher that of m sativa plot under the same precipitation fig 7 b indicating that tree species consumed water more effectively than grass species which were also in line with published results from biomes with similar climate characteristics brümmer et al 2012 odongo et al 2019 with the decrease of monthly precipitation t et ratios in two plots all showed a decreasing trend and the decreasing rate was a bit larger in m sativa plot indicating that the normal growth of m sativa is more susceptible to climatic drought liancourt et al 2012 raz yaseef et al 2015 which highlighted the necessity to apply appropriate management measures in m sativa plot to prevent grassland degradation during drought by contrast t et in r pseudoacacia plot would still maintain at a relatively high level under conditions of water stress suggesting that r pseudoacacia has more abilities to cope with drought or water deficit jia et al 2019 li et al 2018b when the r pseudoacacia was converted to m sativa fig 7 b t et would experience a reduction of 0 08 0 15 and such reduction increased with the growing precipitation implying that tree to grass conversion would lead to less efficient water use especially in months with sufficient precipitation this result is congruent with previous findings on the conversion from forest to grass elsewhere coble et al 2020 woodward et al 2014 in addition it could also be found that the t et under vegetation conversion was considerably larger than that of m sativa plot when lower precipitation occurred indicating that after m sativa was planted into r pseudoacacia plots its tolerance to drought may be improved li et al 2020 however their values were similar when the precipitation was larger showing that after the implementation of vegetation conversion there is still a need to further improve the water use efficiency of m sativa in months with larger precipitation 4 4 suggestions for water resources management and limitations of this study it is well known that when vegetation measures were implemented to regulate water movements clarifying diverse effect mechanism of different vegetation and their responses to changing environment is of great importance coble et al 2020 wang et al 2018 our study revealed that influences of studied vegetation species on water balance were mainly attributed to their differences of interception and transpiration m sativa had a relatively larger interception and lower transpiration as well as a lower water use efficiency under diverse climate scenarios therefore m sativa should be pruned reasonably during the growing season to reduce the ineffective water loss meanwhile mixed planting with other low water consumption crops e g vigna radiata and glycine max fan et al 2016 should be considered during months with large precipitation jun sept to further improve water use efficiency without significantly increasing the total water consumption for r pseudoacacia its transpiration was larger and accounted for the major part of the soil water consumption which would lead to more water loss from deep soils and thus aggravated the formation of soil desiccation in deeper layers jia et al 2020 2019 considering that the pruning and tending of tree species every year is extremely time consuming and laborious the conversion from r pseudoacacia to m sativa is of practical significance to prevent the excessive soil water loss especially in the context of climatic warming and drying through the reasonable implementation of the above measures the water use efficiency can be further improved in m sativa plot while the risk of deep soil desiccation could be reduced in r pseudoacacia plot therefore they are of important guiding significance for the refined management of regional water resources and sustainable development of local ecosystems in this study influences of cc on vegetation physiological characteristics e g leaf area index water holding capability of leaves and potential thresholds of root water absorption etc and soil properties were not taken into account meanwhile other factors which may also influence vegetation parameters such as salinity accumulation were not considered either these factors however may affect hydrological processes to a certain extent and should not be ignored in follow up studies moreover with the continuous deepening and development of relevant research advantages of climate patterns in cmip6 will gradually become prominent which should also be taken into consideration in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of simulation results and to further deepen the understanding of hydrological response mechanisms to vegetation types and their conversion under changing climate 5 conclusion in this study hydrus 1d models were established based on field experiments to simulate water budget in a typical grassland medicago sativa plot and a typical forest land robinia pseudoacacia plot validation results showed that nash sutcliffe coefficients were above 0 700 for m sativa plot and 0 750 for r pseudoacacia plot then validated models were executed under pre set scenarios to reveal the effect mechanisms of each vegetation species and to quantify the potential effects of climate change and tree to grass conversion on the whole water budget the results showed that the transpiration is the main way for soil water loss accounting for 30 3 13 1 and 45 9 15 4 of the growing season precipitation in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively differences of interception and transpiration between two plots were the important reason resulting in their different soil water storage m sativa with a higher interception and a lower transpiration and relatively stored more soil water climate warming and drying in the future had relatively limited impacts on the amount of interception and evaporation but it significantly p 0 05 decreased transpiration by 28 6 and 37 7 mm in m sativa and r pseudoacacia plots respectively under the future climate m sativa were still more suitable for soil water maintaining with a complete replacement of trees with grass in the future average growing season transpiration is expected to decrease by 86 6 mm p 0 05 while interception to increase by 45 6 mm p 0 05 tree to grass conversion is an effective method to resist the adverse impacts of future climate on soil water after it was implemented the soil water storage would increase by 0 6 mm p 0 05 relative to the base period instead climate change and tree to grass conversion mainly exerted their influences in months with larger precipitation average monthly t et in two plots both increased logarithmically p 0 05 with the monthly precipitation and was lower in m sativa plot than in r pseudoacacia plot vegetation conversion would lead to a reduction of t et particularly in months with larger precipitation field experiments and scenario simulation approaches were comprehensively applied in this study to deepen our comprehension on the effects of climate change on the whole hydrological components in typical grassland and forest land in the loess plateau and to clarify the potential mitigation effect of tree to grass conversion to resist adverse impacts of climate change our study could not only provide important guidance for vegetation to cope with future climate change in the loess plateau but also give valuable references for formulating measures of meticulous water resources management and ecological restorations in other semi arid ecosystems

drought events in the lower reaches of the acf have increased awareness of this water resource s vulnerability to overuse gwppc 2017 jones et al 2017 water use within the basin varies with patterns of human population and land use the densely populated northern headwater region which includes atlanta ga depends almost exclusively on surface water for municipal supply and power generation in the southern part of the basin high agricultural water consumption for row crop irrigation is met through both surface and groundwater withdrawals from the carbonate upper floridan aquifer ufa fig 2 groundwater withdrawals account for 66 of the total freshwater use in the region and are expected to increase by approximately 450 000 m3 day by 2050 gwppc 2017 flatt 2018 the agricultural expansion was facilitated in the 1970s by the adoption of center pivot irrigation resulting in a rapid increase in water withdrawal within a decade pierce et al 1984 williams et al 2017 agriculture now contributes 74 9 billion annually to the state s agriculture economy flatt 2018 increased water demand has also brought a need to better understand regional hydrologic responses to storm events of different scales storm events in the dougherty plain display seasonality with high intensity short duration storms occurring during the summer months and long duration events occurring in the winter months the dougherty plain can be considered representative of the multitude of karst systems globally it is estimated 15 of the earth surface is classified as karstifiable rock goldscheider et al 2020 and supports 25 of global water demand kollarits et al 2006 management of karst aquifer systems is of global concern examples of karst systems include southwest china karst liu et al 2014 huang et al 2019 dinaric karst system in the mediterranean stevanović et al 2014 and northeast egypt abdeltawab 2013 these examples highlight the need for transboundary management and accurate understanding of influential hydrological processes influencing water budgets 1 2 physiographic hydrologic description of the study region surface groundwater exchanges dominate the complex hydrology of the dougherty plain due to its karstic stratigraphy hicks et al 1981 couch and mcdowell 2006 torak and painter 2006 jones and torak 2006 jones et al 2017 rugel 2019 barrie 2019 the dougherty plain has flat to gently rolling topography and an internally draining geologic framework containing various karst dissolution features i e sinkholes depressional wetlands fractures joints and lineaments the limestone underlying this landscape is highly fractured and characterized by many dissolution features contributing to hydraulic connection groundwater recharge rates on the dougherty plain vary due to the high permeability karst bedrock overlain by permeable alluvial deposits ichawaynochaway creek inc is a significant tributary west of the flint river and the lower half of its watershed overlies the dougherty plain significant changes in low flow conditions have been observed in the creek during pre and post irrigation periods without significant annual rainfall changes golladay et al 2007 substantial declines in growing season base flows have been observed since the 1970s these declines are due to increased et associated with warming temperatures and increased water use for irrigated agriculture ground and surface water connectivity is evident west of the flint river where the undifferentiated overburden is thin and stream stages closely follow ufa well indicated potentiometric surfaces gordon and peck 2010 water scarcity is exacerbated by periodic multiyear droughts hayashi and rosenberry 2002 golladay et al 2007 rugel et al 2012 singh et al 2017 previous studies along inc report complex heterogeneous hydrologic connectivity between surface and groundwaters the creek is incised into the ocala limestone the water bearing unit of the ufa and contains both gaining and losing reaches gordon and peck 2010 stream reaches oriented in nw or nnw bearings correlate with increased groundwater discharge and are aligned with preferred bedrock fracture orientations in the ocala limestone facilitating exchange with the underlying aquifer brook and allison 1986 rugel et al 2019 a detailed network of lineaments on the landscape scale detected by lidar imagery shows the density of preferential flow patterns for groundwater movement barrie 2019 stream reaches near karst dissolution features reflect the aquifer s chemical groundwater signatures rugel et al 2012 providing useful information on preferential groundwater flow effects on surface water systems we believe that flow through the porous rock matrix also affects surface groundwater interactions as lateral bidirectional exchanges commonly occur through the hyporheic zone boano et al 2014 the evident hydraulic links between groundwater and surface waters in the dougherty plain emphasize the need for surface and groundwater to be treated as a unified hydrologic system in water management planning winter et al 1998 woessner 2000 winter 2001 sophocleous 2002 rugel et al 2012 1 3 groundwater modeling challenges on the dougherty plain while hydrologic models often perform acceptably at regional scales model refinement at local levels is constrained by flow system process uncertainties groundwater interaction between wetlands and minor or un gaged streams in the dougherty plain region is estimated to account for more discharge than leakage to rivers but groundwater interaction within these systems is largely unknown jones et al 2017 spatially heterogeneous regional water movement in the dougherty plain stems from the unique fracture patterns and subsequent dissolution of soluble bedrock resulting in highly variable water and contaminant transport among hydrologic systems transmissivity is an influential driver of groundwater flow in modeling efforts and has been shown to vary from 0 75 to 8 6 105 m2 day kuniansky et al 2012 quantification of interactions between streams riparian zones and surficial aquifers at multiple locations driven by field experimentation would provide a basis for more effectively understanding and managing interactions between water use and surface water systems in the region improved data density in regions of frequent surface groundwater exchange would benefit modeling efforts by improved hydraulic conductivity calculations above the ufa and hydraulic flux calculations of influential hydrologic features such as channels and wetlands jones et al 2017 local hydraulic gradients are subject to frequent changes in magnitude and direction because of seasonal and environmental influences such as evapotranspiration human withdrawals and precipitation dynamic surface water discharges following storm events is a process that needs additional quantification in hydrologic modeling as uncertainty exists on the rate at which stream flow is added to bank storage during rising stages and subsequently returned during falling stages modeling surface groundwater exchanges becomes complex when considering the preferential flow arising from permeable karst bedrock stream reach orientations parallel to karst lineament orientation affect surface groundwater exchanges rugel et al 2016 on the other hand the effects on stream reaches perpendicular to aquifer matrix flow is undocumented 1 4 study objective and hypotheses this study aims to compare steady and dynamic exchanges between the inc the ufa and the vadose zone along a riparian fluvial terrace specific objectives include a calculation of steady and dynamic creek aquifer interactions by estimating channel gains and losses on a 15 5 km stream reach between two us geological survey stream gages with no tributaries b calculation of hydraulic parameters describing steady and dynamic streambank interactions and c explanation of observed surface groundwater interactions we hypothesize that steady and dynamic creek behavior resulting from storm events are the primary drivers of creek aquifer interactions as indicated by losses in creek water and corresponding gains in bank water at the initial onset of a storm event quick flow we further hypothesize that seasonal hydrologic influences on groundwater such as groundwater withdrawals and evapotranspiration indirectly affect creek aquifer interactions at the stream reach scale as indicated by seasonal channel storage changes finally a refined conceptual model suggests how steady and dynamic forces affect creek channel storage with regard to bank hydraulic gradients stream reach orientation and the matrix aquifer gradient under different environmental stresses observations and analysis at this site will contribute to improved future regional groundwater model development of the dougherty plain 2 methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted from july 2018 to july 2019 along ichawaynochaway creek inc a fifth order stream and major tributary to the flint river in southwest georgia usa the ufa in this region of the dougherty plain is semi confined shallow and productive torak and painter 2006 jones et al 2017 the last fifteen linear kilometers 24 km channel distance of the creek flows through the jones center at ichauway an 11 400 ha private reserve before joining the flint river figs 1 and 3 ichauway is noted for large tracts of mature second growth longleaf pine forest containing numerous aquatic and semi aquatic habitats including floodplains wetlands perennial and intermittent streams and ephemeral drains zero order channels the study site middle bluff east site mbe is an approximately 9 hectare riparian fluvial terrace at ichauway the local topography contains two sloping terraces approaching an incised inc reach the terraces are composed of well drained sandy soils of the bigbee series which are commonly found on floodplains overlying the ocala limestone within the southern coastal plain torak and painter 2006 fig 3 2 2 piezometer installation a transect of eight piezometers was installed perpendicular to the streambank in 1995 as part of a water quality monitoring initiative fig 3 table 1 summarizes piezometer locations at the site a cross section of the middle bluff transect was generated based on well construction stream bed and stream bank data fig 4 piezometers consist of laser perforated 51 mm 2 pvc with a bottom cap containing a drain hole boreholes were installed using a hand auger containing a 76 mm 3 diameter bucket attachment sand backfill was compacted around the entire perforated casing casing tops were placed at the ground surface because prescribed burns preclude above ground construction a surface flush 30 cm 12 diameter pvc pipe encircles each piezometer casing to support concrete caps that protect the wells during burns ground surface elevations of piezometers were verified using a differential elevation survey and compared with 1 m resolution lidar data collected annually by the national ecological observatory network https www neonscience org field sites jerc the elevation at each point representing a piezometer in the lidar raster was estimated by applying the raster to point command in arcgis the location was collected with a nomad gps and elevations were confirmed with differential level surveying riparian vegetation near the stream resulted in the lidar error of approximately one meter after cross examination of lidar data with differential leveling surveying soil samples were collected at multiple depths at two locations between the ground surface and the water table near wells mbw 3 and 8 samples were classified by particle size distribution munsell soil color and soil organic matter based on the loss on ignition protocol brantley and young 2010 sample characteristics were sufficiently similar to assume a homogeneous sandy medium 2 3 data collection interactions between the creek and aquifer were investigated using discharge data from two us geological survey stream gages usgs 02354800 near elmodel located approximately 2 2 km upstream of mbe and usgs 02355350 below newton approximately 13 2 km downstream table 1 fig 3 we obtained 15 min water level and discharge data from july 2018 to july 2019 no perennial surface water inflows occur between the two sites due to the absence of a staff gage inc surface elevation was estimated at mbe using a distance weighted approach between two us geological survey stream gages 1 so t d1 s1 t d2 s2 t d1 d2 where so is the distance weighted stage m d is the distance from the upstream and downstream gages m and s is the observed stage m at the respective gaging station varying with time integrity of the distance weighted method was confirmed by generating a satisfactory comparison to 1995 staff gage readings at mbe interactions between the creek and fluvial terrace were investigated by monitoring groundwater levels in six piezometers with odyssey capacitance dataloggers along the transect at 5 min and later 30 min intervals between july 2018 and july 2019 fig 3 dataloggers were inspected and data were downloaded approximately weekly concomitant depth to water measurements were collected for calibration of digital data datalogger suspension cable lengths were altered depending on the length of the capacitance cable and natural fluctuations in the water table to ensure water levels did not rise above the top or fall below the bottom of the datalogger cable datalogger batteries were checked before data were downloaded and replaced whenever battery voltage was less than 7 1 v potentiometric height and changes in the potentiometric surface of two nearby usgs wells aided understanding of seasonal creek aquifer interactions one usgs well 10h009 is located onsite at the jones center at ichauway and 6 5 miles down aquifer gradient of the study site 08e038 is located at the upstream end of nearby lake seminole a reservoir at the confluence of the chattahoochee and flint river approximately 60 down aquifer gradient kilometers of the study site 2 4 data analysis creek aquifer interactions were determined by calculating the cumulative difference in discharge between the upstream and downstream stream gages during the study period changes in channel volume between the gages can be attributed to groundwater influence since no surface water inputs are present between the gages differences between upstream and downstream discharges in inc provide quantitative gains and losses used to estimate surface water groundwater exchange the sandy soils of this karstic landscape minimize overland flows resulting in infiltration of precipitation into the aquifer or used by plants while there will be some direct precipitation on the creek this volume is inconsequential preprocessing consisted of converting datalogger counts to water surface elevation m and correction of data with manual readings to account for instrument elevation and top of casing changes the odyssey datalogger initially reports data in units of counts oc that are converted to water surface elevations wse m using 2 wse toc dtw ß oc where toc m is the top of piezometer casing dtw m is the depth to water measurement is the calibration offset found using measured top of casing elevations and measured depth to water distances and ß is the slope relating counts to depth 1 m 2000 counts multiple techniques were used to evaluate data quality time series plots of water surface elevations were used for visual interpretation of the entire dataset allowing for the identification of potential errors in the hydraulic gradient visual crossplots between measured water levels and sensor readings identified outliers spikes shifts offsets and gaps missing data in sensor outputs steady state creek aquifer interactions at mbe were characterized by the hydraulic gradient and groundwater flux the hydraulic gradient is commonly used as an indicator of flow direction by defining the slope of the water table at one instance in time the flux was determined by a variation of darcy s law q k b h x relating hydraulic conductivity k saturated layer thickness b and the hydraulic gradient h x where x is the distance perpendicular to the stream channel average hydraulic gradient for each month between every well in the piezometer transect was taken to compare creek reach gains changes in creek storage gains and the hydraulic gradient hydraulic conductivity was determined by analyzing particle distribution of soil samples using the soil water characteristics program included with spaw soil plant atmosphere water field pond hydrology software provided by the us department of agriculture saxton and willey 2005 the software considered particle size distribution soil organic matter and soil density to determine hydraulic conductivity saturated thickness in this study is classified as the sandy unconfined residuum at mbe and was calculated based on transmissivity estimates explained below and hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic gradient was calculated by changes in water level between piezometers and creek surface elevation estimates at mbe where positive values indicate a hydraulic gradient away from the creek advective flow through a porous medium can be explained by darcy s law and is common during periods between storms darcy s law is a first order differential function of aquifer transmissivity and the hydraulic gradient 3 q t dh dx where q is the two dimensional average lateral stream aquifer flux over the reach m3 day km t is the aquifer transmissivity m2 day and dh dx is the lateral hydraulic gradient m m determined by measuring the change in hydraulic head h m as a function of distance perpendicular to the stream x m in a homogeneous porous medium the transmissivity can be estimated using the hydraulic conductivity k m day using t k b where b m is the saturated thickness the potentiometric surface sheds insight into lateral and vertical movement as groundwater travels from high to low water head regions hydraulic gradients drive groundwater movement in porous media and are subject to reversal over time if subsurface water pressure changes environmental influences such as precipitation drought or water withdrawal explaining variation in groundwater recharge and discharge processes at one location can cause this change the spatial and temporal variability of local hydraulic gradients along the inc in the dougherty plain is unknown during steady flow all stream reach gains and losses can be ascribed to groundwater fluxes 4 qgw dqstream dx where qgw is the one dimensional lateral flux between the creek and the aquifer and dqstream dx is the change in discharge q m3 day per unit stream length x km eqs 1 and 2 can be combined to determine the local aquifer transmissivity 5 t qstream x h y where finite changes over distance are denoted using the delta symbol h the hydraulic head m and t the reach scale aquifer transmissivity transmissivity is referencing exchanges from the creek into the bank a saturated area the total determined flux must represent losses into one bank dynamic or transient conditions preclude the use of the darcian approach and introduce the need for a second order differential equation to explain dynamic subsurface responses 6 d 2h y2 h t where d t s m2 day is the hydraulic diffusivity equal to the aquifer transmissivity t m2 s divided by the storativity s dimensionless perturbations in steady bank flow are commonly caused by quick flow during storm events where transient impulses propagate through saturated media note that these impulses can move in the same or opposite direction from steady flow in that hydrodynamic perturbations are independent of steady flow direction depner and rasmussen 2016 the magnitude and direction of steady forces can change directions rapidly if the hydraulic impulse is substantial and can result in a loss of stream storage as water is transferred from the channel to the bank tollner 2002 differential and analytical equations account for dynamic inputs into a channel with lateral losses carslaw and jaeger 1959 p 396 grisak and pickens 1981 this is dependent on numerous factors such as the magnitude of the hydraulic gradient kinematic wave celerity and the presence of a fractured system rasmussen et al 2000 diffusivity values are estimated based on the arrival of the peak hydraulic response along the transect relative to the piezometer closest to the streambank mbw 1 to mbw 8 hydraulic diffusivity at mbe is estimated along the transect using unit response functions which provide the statistically averaged responses to hydraulic inputs dooge 1973 7 y t τ x t τ u τ where x t and y t are the time series of system inputs and outputs respectively and u τ is the impulse response or transfer function that accounts for how dynamic systems respond to changes in inputs as a function of lag time τ for our analysis we used creek stage m as the input time series x and the observed water surface elevation in piezometers m as the output time series y the impulse response function represents the time delayed effect of creek water levels on piezometer water levels that assumes linearity time independence and stationarity between inputs and outputs average cumulative response functions were determined along the transect at the arrival of quick flow from an upstream storm event response function parameters were estimated using ordinary least squares ols fitting routing methods are then fit to the ols function using the method of moments the impulse response function u for one dimensional flow is carslaw and jaeger 1959 eqn 3 3 8 8 u τ 1 4 π j 0 1 j exp vπ2k2 k where u τ represents the borehole water level response m per unit change in creek water level m as a function of lag time τ min between the input and the response k 2j 1 is a summation variable v dτ 4 l2 is the hydraulic peclet number dimensionless d is the aquifer hydraulic diffusivity m2 min and l is the horizontal distance between the piezometer and the creek m this analytic solution assumes a constant aquifer thickness that corresponds to the observed thickness of the higher conductivity sand layer above the underlying carbonate 3 results 3 1 steady creek aquifer interactions along creek reach approximately 150 million m3 of groundwater discharged into inc along the 15 5 km segment between the stream gages from july 2018 to july 2019 fig 5 under steady flow conditions channel storage increased along the 15 5 km segment as indicated by the greater discharge at the below newton stream gage a monthly summary of creek aquifer interactions suggests seasonal influence on creek groundwater relationships fig 6 reach gains were greatest when discharge was greatest particularly because of hurricane michael 10 cm precipitation in a single day and several other winter precipitation events 25 mm per day majority gains occurred in the winter as the cumulative difference between downstream and upstream gages increased creek channel storage decreased in the spring during march and april and downstream gains in discharge were small during may june and july 3 2 steady creek aquifer interactions at middle bluff east inc displayed steady and dynamic behavior during the study period affecting bank storage creek and piezometer water elevations during the annual study period outline surface groundwater interactions fig a2 groundwater movement through the unconsolidated sandy material was suggested by water elevations at mbe was generally towards the stream under stable flow conditions between storm events as shown by stream water surface elevations below piezometer heads however hydraulic gradients at the streambank indicated frequent directional changes during the rising and falling limb of storm hydrographs a dynamic behavior the average monthly hydraulic gradient at mbe summarizes creek bank interactions throughout the study period where well levels pointed above the streamflow line indicate a hydraulic gradient towards the stream fig a2 data gaps occurred from sudden battery failure in colder weather and equipment errors lithium ion batteries are not resilient to colder weather common odyssey problems were water infiltration and wire disconnections the odyssey logger contained a circuit board inside a plastic casing water had a tendency to infiltrate the casing if the loggers were not tightened properly resulting in lost data the logger collected data via capacitance using a cable connected to the circuit board at times the wires would disconnect and also result in a data gap 3 3 dynamic creek aquifer interactions at middle bluff east sudden losses in cumulative channel storage discharge occurred at the onset of storm events as stormflow traveled downstream figs 5 and 6 under steady conditions the downstream gage below newton had a higher discharge than the upstream gage but upstream discharge temporarily exceeded downstream discharge under dynamic conditions caused by consolidated stormflow entering the stream heavy rainfall from hurricane michael on october 10 2018 presented an opportunity to measure the effects of a single large storm event on channel and bank storage and better understand the influence of all storm events on creek bank interactions fig 7 the quick flow from hurricane michael was evident when the discharge of the upstream gage exceeded the downstream gage beginning october 12 approximately 4 8 million m3 was transferred from the creek channel storage to groundwater and bank storage at an approximate rate of 14 m3 s beginning october 16 steady behavior was restored as downstream gage discharge exceeded upstream discharge net channel gains occurred once more during the recession limb of the hydrograph as gains in channel volume occurred during the rising limb of the hydrograph gains in bank storage occurred as the hydraulic gradient favored lateral water flow into riparian soils dataloggers along the mbe transect captured this effect near the streambank bank storage gains increased with stream stage increases october 12 fig 7 the effects of hurricane michael were detected up to 120 m away from the channel as the hydraulic response propagated through riparian soils across the well transect the maximum response with the least delay was observed nearest the streambank in mbw 1 with the peak delay and attenuation increasing with distance near aquifer properties were successfully estimated throughout the duration of hurricane michael the dynamic event provided the opportunity to calculate constant material properties table 2 diffusivity and transmissivity increased outward from the channel along the transect from 9 to 420 m2 day and 3 150 m2 day respectively this can be explained as the saturated region increases with distance from the bank hydraulic diffusivities increased with distance and the best fit was achieved when celerity was neglected rasmussen et al 2002 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated as 2 85 m day due to the homogeneous bigbee series soil along the transect estimated thickness of the saturated aquifer at the creek increased from 1 to 50 m moving away from the creek 4 discussion 4 1 creek aquifer interactions seasonal variations in groundwater levels and hydraulic gradients near inc reflects the direct hydraulic connectivity between the two systems abundant winter precipitation resulted in record high regional groundwater levels in the ufa evident in nearby usgs well 08e038 which subsequently increased groundwater discharges to the creek successive winter storms were responsible for most of the total annual gains 150 million m3 as the aquifer potentiometric surface rose above the creek bed for most of the dormant season when water losses to evapotranspiration and groundwater withdrawals were low i e p et withdrawal steady declines in stream discharge in march and april 2019 correspond with increased spring water use i e p et withdrawal hook et al 2005 in conjunction with negligible summer increases in downstream discharge the declines in stream discharge reflects the direction and magnitude of stream aquifer flux as a function of regional water use flatt 2018 inc contributed to groundwater recharge during periods in the growing season when the aquifer potentiometric surface declined below the stream surface elevation this gradient was even maintained during short duration growing season storm events water use both et and human withdrawals plays a pivotal role in the flow of coupled stream aquifer systems in karst environments from the aquifer into surface water bodies aquifer recharge occurs during storm events with changes in stream stages affecting groundwater levels as displayed by the conceptual model outlining creek groundwater interactions during steady and dynamic creek flow scenarios fig 8 at the onset of a storm water moves into permeable stream banks as rapidly increasing discharge creates a hydraulic gradient favoring lateral water movement while some surface water contributes to aquifer recharge near the streambank more distant groundwater responses are likely due to hydraulic responses that move faster than and often in different directions than fluid flow williams et al 2002 the hyporheic zone is commonly modeled in two dimensions as it contributes to groundwater recharge through horizontal and vertical infiltration lautz and siegel 2006 the effects of horizontal infiltration in the sandy and karst systems of the dougherty plain are evident in that groundwater responses were detected 120 m from the creek after hurricane michael fig 7 a fifty fold increase in the saturated layer thickness along the 120 m transect table 2 further supports the effect of horizontal infiltration throughout this process groundwater provides natural flood storage capacity mitigating downstream effects of large storms such as hurricanes connectivity between the stream and groundwater is rapid as evident in the responses of streamside piezometers but also changes interannually bidirectional behavior bank storage is apparent as water moves into the floodplain at high creek stage and water returns to the creek at lower stages fig 5 a 2 a portion of water leaving the stream channel contributes to aquifer recharge fig 7 diminished losses of streamflow from a storm event coincided with winter gains in the aquifer a 4 6 m increase in the potentiometric surface from 12 2 to 7 6 m below land surface seen in nearby usgs well 10h009 showing aquifer recharge from quickflow is greater during summer than winter changes in the hydraulic head have been proven to affect streamflow numerically cardenas and wilson 2007 and experimentally fox et al 2014 aquifer recharge during storm events introduces a hydrodynamically influenced flux that is most sensitive when stream stage greatly exceeds groundwater elevations contrary to the general findings of previous research boano et al 2014 fox et al 2014 cardenas and wilson 2007 but the magnitude of this relationship would depend greatly upon the composition of stream bank soils and thus their transmissivity inconsistencies in stream bank soils and karst geologic framework creates variably sensitive regions considering groundwater interaction mosner 2002 the hydraulic parameters calculated in this study can be used as a singular location to improve future regional groundwater models as initial or known experimental repetition along inc would further constrain hydraulic parameters 4 2 factors influencing creek groundwater interactions the interactions between creek and groundwater hydrology are interdisciplinary in nature and can be better understood by considering regional geologic framework hydrogeologic behavior regional water budget and ecohydrological behavior hydrologic influences of the creek aquifer system s dynamic bank flow conditions are summarized in a conceptual model fig 10 rainfall is the major input to the storage system and groundwater withdrawals and plant water use are the major outputs of the system preferential and matrix aquifer movement influence surface water flow on an irrigated karstic landscape with preferential flows likely influencing aquifer discharge along stream reaches while stream reaches are generally oriented parallel to regional bedrock jointing rugel et al 2012 reach level variation in groundwater discharge may be due to the many center pivot irrigation systems that withdraw groundwater along preferential flowpaths williams et al 2017 interactions between conduits and matrix flow have been shown in the floridan aquifer elsewhere martin and dean 2001 the same behavior could exist between a heavily incised stream and a surficial aquifer aquifer flow with respect to reach orientation could exhibit a groundwater flow through regime as the channel interacts with the banks a flow through regime has been described in lakes and wetlands but could also occur as hyporheic flows within stream segments eamus et al 2006 turner and townley 2006 the transect at mbw is oriented parallel to primary or matrix groundwater flow direction as indicated by the potentiometric surface fig 9 potentially encouraging aquifer recharge downgradient of aquifer flow a 1 m resolution digital terrain model provided by neon lidar provides explanation to the observed stream aquifer interactions bank storage gains in the southwestern direction is indicated by a larger floodplain in the southwestern direction downstream of the aquifer gradient supporting the notion aquifer gradients influence recharge locations soil maps indicated high porosity sands downgradient of aquifer flow fig 9 troup bigbee lucy and esto norfolk soil series are commonly found on the coastal plain these series consist of well drained to somewhat excessively well drained unconsolidated sandy and loamy marine sediments wahee soils are found east and west of the middle bluff east site in flatter topography this series is classified as somewhat poorly drained due to their clayey and loamy texture usda 2005 lidar imagery also indicates a chokepoint upstream of the study site changes in channel morphological units from across a rocky shoal have been previously shown to influence stream aquifer exchanges harvey and bencala 1993 4 3 recommendations for future research future research concerning surface groundwater interaction in creeks and rivers of the dougherty plain should consider factors influencing surface groundwater interaction to form a predictive framework to characterize the complex terrain this could be achieved by comparing hydraulic parameters in the vicinity multiple streams in the dougherty plain similar studies on minor and ungaged streams knowingly connected to groundwater are recommended to understand better the hydraulic behavior of minor and ungaged streams in karst environments additional field data campaigns can provide the necessary information to create hydrogeology models of a higher resolution to better understand fluid transport in karstic environments an additional transect on the opposite bank at mbe and incremental discharge measurements using acoustic doppler current profilers in conjunction with usgs stream gages would indicate losing and gaining portions of the creek on a finer scale the opposite bank is the opposite direction to the aquifer flow direction which is believed to decrease bank aquifer interactions the increased resolution would further our understanding of stream aquifer fluxes and predictive factors of gaining and losing reaches in similar systems could be determined regional groundwater gradient and preferential flow are known to influence on gaining and losing stream banks but more research is needed 5 conclusions steady and dynamic interactions were characterized between ichawaynochaway creek inc a fluvial terrace mbe and the upper floridan aquifer ufa analysis of a 15 5 km stream reach with no surficial inputs between two us geological survey stream gages indicates seasonal groundwater recharge to the creek during fall and winter channel storage losses were detected in the spring and summer as water use increased due to evapotranspiration and groundwater withdrawals seasonal variation of stream aquifer interaction indicates the fragility of aquatic ecosystems on karstic landscapes spatial and temporal variability of bank storage in the phreatic zone indicate the complexity of stream aquifer interactions between a heavily incised stream interacting with a surficial karst aquifer dynamic behavior during the initial onset of a severe storm event suggests an additional process of aquifer recharge caused by the addition of creek water to bank storage caused by kinematic waves this research provides estimates of hydraulic properties i e hydraulic diffusivity transmissivity used to calibrate regional groundwater models hydraulic transmissivity diffusivity and the saturated aquifer s thickness increased with distance from the creek aquifer hydraulic diffusivity ranged from 9 to 420 m2 day transmissivity from 3 to 150 m2 day and saturated thickness from 1 to 50 m with values increasing with distance from the streambank increased resolution of regional water models can aid water budget estimations the effects of meteorological changes inform water resource managers and synthesize ecological and hydrologic theory results provide parameterization guidance for future modeling efforts within the apalachicola chattahoochee flint basin lower flint river basin dougherty plain and inc excessive groundwater withdrawals in a coupled creek aquifer system threaten water resources sustainability and the aquatic ecosystems dependent on enough clean water aquifer recharge during winter storm events and proper groundwater management is imperative to the summertime resilience of groundwater dependent baseflow in inc average base flow in inc has decreased since the implementation of center pivot irrigation due to the dependence of both agricultural and aquatic ecosystems on water from the ufa golladay et al 2007 local interactions between surface and groundwater interactions should be considered in future water resources management identification and conservation of hydraulically sensitive areas such as losing reaches and lineaments would increase groundwater dependent baseflow and improve aquatic ecosystem services findings from this study can inform water resources managers such as water planning districts and state governments in this and other karst basins refined knowledge and consideration of stream channel processes can elucidate the relationship between aquifer gradients and stream reach

apalachicola chattahoochee flint acf river basin supplies freshwater to three states alabama georgia and florida fig 1 for municipal and agricultural uses increased water demand coupled with extreme drought events in the lower reaches of the acf have increased awareness of this water resource s vulnerability to overuse gwppc 2017 jones et al 2017 water use within the basin varies with patterns of human population and land use the densely populated northern headwater region which includes atlanta ga depends almost exclusively on surface water for municipal supply and power generation in the southern part of the basin high agricultural water consumption for row crop irrigation is met through both surface and groundwater withdrawals from the carbonate upper floridan aquifer ufa fig 2 groundwater withdrawals account for 66 of the total freshwater use in the region and are expected to increase by approximately 450 000 m3 day by 2050 gwppc 2017 flatt 2018 the agricultural expansion was facilitated in the 1970s by the adoption of center pivot irrigation resulting in a rapid increase in water withdrawal within a decade pierce et al 1984 williams et al 2017 agriculture now contributes 74 9 billion annually to the state s agriculture economy flatt 2018 increased water demand has also brought a need to better understand regional hydrologic responses to storm events of different scales storm events in the dougherty plain display seasonality with high intensity short duration storms occurring during the summer months and long duration events occurring in the winter months the dougherty plain can be considered representative of the multitude of karst systems globally it is estimated 15 of the earth surface is classified as karstifiable rock goldscheider et al 2020 and supports 25 of global water demand kollarits et al 2006 management of karst aquifer systems is of global concern examples of karst systems include southwest china karst liu et al 2014 huang et al 2019 dinaric karst system in the mediterranean stevanović et al 2014 and northeast egypt abdeltawab 2013 these examples highlight the need for transboundary management and accurate understanding of influential hydrological processes influencing water budgets 1 2 physiographic hydrologic description of the study region surface groundwater exchanges dominate the complex hydrology of the dougherty plain due to its karstic stratigraphy hicks et al 1981 couch and mcdowell 2006 torak and painter 2006 jones and torak 2006 jones et al 2017 rugel 2019 barrie 2019 the dougherty plain has flat to gently rolling topography and an internally draining geologic framework containing various karst dissolution features i e sinkholes depressional wetlands fractures joints and lineaments the limestone underlying this landscape is highly fractured and characterized by many dissolution features contributing to hydraulic connection groundwater recharge rates on the dougherty plain vary due to the high permeability karst bedrock overlain by permeable alluvial deposits ichawaynochaway creek inc is a significant tributary west of the flint river and the lower half of its watershed overlies the dougherty plain significant changes in low flow conditions have been observed in the creek during pre and post irrigation periods without significant annual rainfall changes golladay et al 2007 substantial declines in growing season base flows have been observed since the 1970s these declines are due to increased et associated with warming temperatures and increased water use for irrigated agriculture ground and surface water connectivity is evident west of the flint river where the undifferentiated overburden is thin and stream stages closely follow ufa well indicated potentiometric surfaces gordon and peck 2010 water scarcity is exacerbated by periodic multiyear droughts hayashi and rosenberry 2002 golladay et al 2007 rugel et al 2012 singh et al 2017 previous studies along inc report complex heterogeneous hydrologic connectivity between surface and groundwaters the creek is incised into the ocala limestone the water bearing unit of the ufa and contains both gaining and losing reaches gordon and peck 2010 stream reaches oriented in nw or nnw bearings correlate with increased groundwater discharge and are aligned with preferred bedrock fracture orientations in the ocala limestone facilitating exchange with the underlying aquifer brook and allison 1986 rugel et al 2019 a detailed network of lineaments on the landscape scale detected by lidar imagery shows the density of preferential flow patterns for groundwater movement barrie 2019 stream reaches near karst dissolution features reflect the aquifer s chemical groundwater signatures rugel et al 2012 providing useful information on preferential groundwater flow effects on surface water systems we believe that flow through the porous rock matrix also affects surface groundwater interactions as lateral bidirectional exchanges commonly occur through the hyporheic zone boano et al 2014 the evident hydraulic links between groundwater and surface waters in the dougherty plain emphasize the need for surface and groundwater to be treated as a unified hydrologic system in water management planning winter et al 1998 woessner 2000 winter 2001 sophocleous 2002 rugel et al 2012 1 3 groundwater modeling challenges on the dougherty plain while hydrologic models often perform acceptably at regional scales model refinement at local levels is constrained by flow system process uncertainties groundwater interaction between wetlands and minor or un gaged streams in the dougherty plain region is estimated to account for more discharge than leakage to rivers but groundwater interaction within these systems is largely unknown jones et al 2017 spatially heterogeneous regional water movement in the dougherty plain stems from the unique fracture patterns and subsequent dissolution of soluble bedrock resulting in highly variable water and contaminant transport among hydrologic systems transmissivity is an influential driver of groundwater flow in modeling efforts and has been shown to vary from 0 75 to 8 6 105 m2 day kuniansky et al 2012 quantification of interactions between streams riparian zones and surficial aquifers at multiple locations driven by field experimentation would provide a basis for more effectively understanding and managing interactions between water use and surface water systems in the region improved data density in regions of frequent surface groundwater exchange would benefit modeling efforts by improved hydraulic conductivity calculations above the ufa and hydraulic flux calculations of influential hydrologic features such as channels and wetlands jones et al 2017 local hydraulic gradients are subject to frequent changes in magnitude and direction because of seasonal and environmental influences such as evapotranspiration human withdrawals and precipitation dynamic surface water discharges following storm events is a process that needs additional quantification in hydrologic modeling as uncertainty exists on the rate at which stream flow is added to bank storage during rising stages and subsequently returned during falling stages modeling surface groundwater exchanges becomes complex when considering the preferential flow arising from permeable karst bedrock stream reach orientations parallel to karst lineament orientation affect surface groundwater exchanges rugel et al 2016 on the other hand the effects on stream reaches perpendicular to aquifer matrix flow is undocumented 1 4 study objective and hypotheses this study aims to compare steady and dynamic exchanges between the inc the ufa and the vadose zone along a riparian fluvial terrace specific objectives include a calculation of steady and dynamic creek aquifer interactions by estimating channel gains and losses on a 15 5 km stream reach between two us geological survey stream gages with no tributaries b calculation of hydraulic parameters describing steady and dynamic streambank interactions and c explanation of observed surface groundwater interactions we hypothesize that steady and dynamic creek behavior resulting from storm events are the primary drivers of creek aquifer interactions as indicated by losses in creek water and corresponding gains in bank water at the initial onset of a storm event quick flow we further hypothesize that seasonal hydrologic influences on groundwater such as groundwater withdrawals and evapotranspiration indirectly affect creek aquifer interactions at the stream reach scale as indicated by seasonal channel storage changes finally a refined conceptual model suggests how steady and dynamic forces affect creek channel storage with regard to bank hydraulic gradients stream reach orientation and the matrix aquifer gradient under different environmental stresses observations and analysis at this site will contribute to improved future regional groundwater model development of the dougherty plain 2 methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted from july 2018 to july 2019 along ichawaynochaway creek inc a fifth order stream and major tributary to the flint river in southwest georgia usa the ufa in this region of the dougherty plain is semi confined shallow and productive torak and painter 2006 jones et al 2017 the last fifteen linear kilometers 24 km channel distance of the creek flows through the jones center at ichauway an 11 400 ha private reserve before joining the flint river figs 1 and 3 ichauway is noted for large tracts of mature second growth longleaf pine forest containing numerous aquatic and semi aquatic habitats including floodplains wetlands perennial and intermittent streams and ephemeral drains zero order channels the study site middle bluff east site mbe is an approximately 9 hectare riparian fluvial terrace at ichauway the local topography contains two sloping terraces approaching an incised inc reach the terraces are composed of well drained sandy soils of the bigbee series which are commonly found on floodplains overlying the ocala limestone within the southern coastal plain torak and painter 2006 fig 3 2 2 piezometer installation a transect of eight piezometers was installed perpendicular to the streambank in 1995 as part of a water quality monitoring initiative fig 3 table 1 summarizes piezometer locations at the site a cross section of the middle bluff transect was generated based on well construction stream bed and stream bank data fig 4 piezometers consist of laser perforated 51 mm 2 pvc with a bottom cap containing a drain hole boreholes were installed using a hand auger containing a 76 mm 3 diameter bucket attachment sand backfill was compacted around the entire perforated casing casing tops were placed at the ground surface because prescribed burns preclude above ground construction a surface flush 30 cm 12 diameter pvc pipe encircles each piezometer casing to support concrete caps that protect the wells during burns ground surface elevations of piezometers were verified using a differential elevation survey and compared with 1 m resolution lidar data collected annually by the national ecological observatory network https www neonscience org field sites jerc the elevation at each point representing a piezometer in the lidar raster was estimated by applying the raster to point command in arcgis the location was collected with a nomad gps and elevations were confirmed with differential level surveying riparian vegetation near the stream resulted in the lidar error of approximately one meter after cross examination of lidar data with differential leveling surveying soil samples were collected at multiple depths at two locations between the ground surface and the water table near wells mbw 3 and 8 samples were classified by particle size distribution munsell soil color and soil organic matter based on the loss on ignition protocol brantley and young 2010 sample characteristics were sufficiently similar to assume a homogeneous sandy medium 2 3 data collection interactions between the creek and aquifer were investigated using discharge data from two us geological survey stream gages usgs 02354800 near elmodel located approximately 2 2 km upstream of mbe and usgs 02355350 below newton approximately 13 2 km downstream table 1 fig 3 we obtained 15 min water level and discharge data from july 2018 to july 2019 no perennial surface water inflows occur between the two sites due to the absence of a staff gage inc surface elevation was estimated at mbe using a distance weighted approach between two us geological survey stream gages 1 so t d1 s1 t d2 s2 t d1 d2 where so is the distance weighted stage m d is the distance from the upstream and downstream gages m and s is the observed stage m at the respective gaging station varying with time integrity of the distance weighted method was confirmed by generating a satisfactory comparison to 1995 staff gage readings at mbe interactions between the creek and fluvial terrace were investigated by monitoring groundwater levels in six piezometers with odyssey capacitance dataloggers along the transect at 5 min and later 30 min intervals between july 2018 and july 2019 fig 3 dataloggers were inspected and data were downloaded approximately weekly concomitant depth to water measurements were collected for calibration of digital data datalogger suspension cable lengths were altered depending on the length of the capacitance cable and natural fluctuations in the water table to ensure water levels did not rise above the top or fall below the bottom of the datalogger cable datalogger batteries were checked before data were downloaded and replaced whenever battery voltage was less than 7 1 v potentiometric height and changes in the potentiometric surface of two nearby usgs wells aided understanding of seasonal creek aquifer interactions one usgs well 10h009 is located onsite at the jones center at ichauway and 6 5 miles down aquifer gradient of the study site 08e038 is located at the upstream end of nearby lake seminole a reservoir at the confluence of the chattahoochee and flint river approximately 60 down aquifer gradient kilometers of the study site 2 4 data analysis creek aquifer interactions were determined by calculating the cumulative difference in discharge between the upstream and downstream stream gages during the study period changes in channel volume between the gages can be attributed to groundwater influence since no surface water inputs are present between the gages differences between upstream and downstream discharges in inc provide quantitative gains and losses used to estimate surface water groundwater exchange the sandy soils of this karstic landscape minimize overland flows resulting in infiltration of precipitation into the aquifer or used by plants while there will be some direct precipitation on the creek this volume is inconsequential preprocessing consisted of converting datalogger counts to water surface elevation m and correction of data with manual readings to account for instrument elevation and top of casing changes the odyssey datalogger initially reports data in units of counts oc that are converted to water surface elevations wse m using 2 wse toc dtw ß oc where toc m is the top of piezometer casing dtw m is the depth to water measurement is the calibration offset found using measured top of casing elevations and measured depth to water distances and ß is the slope relating counts to depth 1 m 2000 counts multiple techniques were used to evaluate data quality time series plots of water surface elevations were used for visual interpretation of the entire dataset allowing for the identification of potential errors in the hydraulic gradient visual crossplots between measured water levels and sensor readings identified outliers spikes shifts offsets and gaps missing data in sensor outputs steady state creek aquifer interactions at mbe were characterized by the hydraulic gradient and groundwater flux the hydraulic gradient is commonly used as an indicator of flow direction by defining the slope of the water table at one instance in time the flux was determined by a variation of darcy s law q k b h x relating hydraulic conductivity k saturated layer thickness b and the hydraulic gradient h x where x is the distance perpendicular to the stream channel average hydraulic gradient for each month between every well in the piezometer transect was taken to compare creek reach gains changes in creek storage gains and the hydraulic gradient hydraulic conductivity was determined by analyzing particle distribution of soil samples using the soil water characteristics program included with spaw soil plant atmosphere water field pond hydrology software provided by the us department of agriculture saxton and willey 2005 the software considered particle size distribution soil organic matter and soil density to determine hydraulic conductivity saturated thickness in this study is classified as the sandy unconfined residuum at mbe and was calculated based on transmissivity estimates explained below and hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic gradient was calculated by changes in water level between piezometers and creek surface elevation estimates at mbe where positive values indicate a hydraulic gradient away from the creek advective flow through a porous medium can be explained by darcy s law and is common during periods between storms darcy s law is a first order differential function of aquifer transmissivity and the hydraulic gradient 3 q t dh dx where q is the two dimensional average lateral stream aquifer flux over the reach m3 day km t is the aquifer transmissivity m2 day and dh dx is the lateral hydraulic gradient m m determined by measuring the change in hydraulic head h m as a function of distance perpendicular to the stream x m in a homogeneous porous medium the transmissivity can be estimated using the hydraulic conductivity k m day using t k b where b m is the saturated thickness the potentiometric surface sheds insight into lateral and vertical movement as groundwater travels from high to low water head regions hydraulic gradients drive groundwater movement in porous media and are subject to reversal over time if subsurface water pressure changes environmental influences such as precipitation drought or water withdrawal explaining variation in groundwater recharge and discharge processes at one location can cause this change the spatial and temporal variability of local hydraulic gradients along the inc in the dougherty plain is unknown during steady flow all stream reach gains and losses can be ascribed to groundwater fluxes 4 qgw dqstream dx where qgw is the one dimensional lateral flux between the creek and the aquifer and dqstream dx is the change in discharge q m3 day per unit stream length x km eqs 1 and 2 can be combined to determine the local aquifer transmissivity 5 t qstream x h y where finite changes over distance are denoted using the delta symbol h the hydraulic head m and t the reach scale aquifer transmissivity transmissivity is referencing exchanges from the creek into the bank a saturated area the total determined flux must represent losses into one bank dynamic or transient conditions preclude the use of the darcian approach and introduce the need for a second order differential equation to explain dynamic subsurface responses 6 d 2h y2 h t where d t s m2 day is the hydraulic diffusivity equal to the aquifer transmissivity t m2 s divided by the storativity s dimensionless perturbations in steady bank flow are commonly caused by quick flow during storm events where transient impulses propagate through saturated media note that these impulses can move in the same or opposite direction from steady flow in that hydrodynamic perturbations are independent of steady flow direction depner and rasmussen 2016 the magnitude and direction of steady forces can change directions rapidly if the hydraulic impulse is substantial and can result in a loss of stream storage as water is transferred from the channel to the bank tollner 2002 differential and analytical equations account for dynamic inputs into a channel with lateral losses carslaw and jaeger 1959 p 396 grisak and pickens 1981 this is dependent on numerous factors such as the magnitude of the hydraulic gradient kinematic wave celerity and the presence of a fractured system rasmussen et al 2000 diffusivity values are estimated based on the arrival of the peak hydraulic response along the transect relative to the piezometer closest to the streambank mbw 1 to mbw 8 hydraulic diffusivity at mbe is estimated along the transect using unit response functions which provide the statistically averaged responses to hydraulic inputs dooge 1973 7 y t τ x t τ u τ where x t and y t are the time series of system inputs and outputs respectively and u τ is the impulse response or transfer function that accounts for how dynamic systems respond to changes in inputs as a function of lag time τ for our analysis we used creek stage m as the input time series x and the observed water surface elevation in piezometers m as the output time series y the impulse response function represents the time delayed effect of creek water levels on piezometer water levels that assumes linearity time independence and stationarity between inputs and outputs average cumulative response functions were determined along the transect at the arrival of quick flow from an upstream storm event response function parameters were estimated using ordinary least squares ols fitting routing methods are then fit to the ols function using the method of moments the impulse response function u for one dimensional flow is carslaw and jaeger 1959 eqn 3 3 8 8 u τ 1 4 π j 0 1 j exp vπ2k2 k where u τ represents the borehole water level response m per unit change in creek water level m as a function of lag time τ min between the input and the response k 2j 1 is a summation variable v dτ 4 l2 is the hydraulic peclet number dimensionless d is the aquifer hydraulic diffusivity m2 min and l is the horizontal distance between the piezometer and the creek m this analytic solution assumes a constant aquifer thickness that corresponds to the observed thickness of the higher conductivity sand layer above the underlying carbonate 3 results 3 1 steady creek aquifer interactions along creek reach approximately 150 million m3 of groundwater discharged into inc along the 15 5 km segment between the stream gages from july 2018 to july 2019 fig 5 under steady flow conditions channel storage increased along the 15 5 km segment as indicated by the greater discharge at the below newton stream gage a monthly summary of creek aquifer interactions suggests seasonal influence on creek groundwater relationships fig 6 reach gains were greatest when discharge was greatest particularly because of hurricane michael 10 cm precipitation in a single day and several other winter precipitation events 25 mm per day majority gains occurred in the winter as the cumulative difference between downstream and upstream gages increased creek channel storage decreased in the spring during march and april and downstream gains in discharge were small during may june and july 3 2 steady creek aquifer interactions at middle bluff east inc displayed steady and dynamic behavior during the study period affecting bank storage creek and piezometer water elevations during the annual study period outline surface groundwater interactions fig a2 groundwater movement through the unconsolidated sandy material was suggested by water elevations at mbe was generally towards the stream under stable flow conditions between storm events as shown by stream water surface elevations below piezometer heads however hydraulic gradients at the streambank indicated frequent directional changes during the rising and falling limb of storm hydrographs a dynamic behavior the average monthly hydraulic gradient at mbe summarizes creek bank interactions throughout the study period where well levels pointed above the streamflow line indicate a hydraulic gradient towards the stream fig a2 data gaps occurred from sudden battery failure in colder weather and equipment errors lithium ion batteries are not resilient to colder weather common odyssey problems were water infiltration and wire disconnections the odyssey logger contained a circuit board inside a plastic casing water had a tendency to infiltrate the casing if the loggers were not tightened properly resulting in lost data the logger collected data via capacitance using a cable connected to the circuit board at times the wires would disconnect and also result in a data gap 3 3 dynamic creek aquifer interactions at middle bluff east sudden losses in cumulative channel storage discharge occurred at the onset of storm events as stormflow traveled downstream figs 5 and 6 under steady conditions the downstream gage below newton had a higher discharge than the upstream gage but upstream discharge temporarily exceeded downstream discharge under dynamic conditions caused by consolidated stormflow entering the stream heavy rainfall from hurricane michael on october 10 2018 presented an opportunity to measure the effects of a single large storm event on channel and bank storage and better understand the influence of all storm events on creek bank interactions fig 7 the quick flow from hurricane michael was evident when the discharge of the upstream gage exceeded the downstream gage beginning october 12 approximately 4 8 million m3 was transferred from the creek channel storage to groundwater and bank storage at an approximate rate of 14 m3 s beginning october 16 steady behavior was restored as downstream gage discharge exceeded upstream discharge net channel gains occurred once more during the recession limb of the hydrograph as gains in channel volume occurred during the rising limb of the hydrograph gains in bank storage occurred as the hydraulic gradient favored lateral water flow into riparian soils dataloggers along the mbe transect captured this effect near the streambank bank storage gains increased with stream stage increases october 12 fig 7 the effects of hurricane michael were detected up to 120 m away from the channel as the hydraulic response propagated through riparian soils across the well transect the maximum response with the least delay was observed nearest the streambank in mbw 1 with the peak delay and attenuation increasing with distance near aquifer properties were successfully estimated throughout the duration of hurricane michael the dynamic event provided the opportunity to calculate constant material properties table 2 diffusivity and transmissivity increased outward from the channel along the transect from 9 to 420 m2 day and 3 150 m2 day respectively this can be explained as the saturated region increases with distance from the bank hydraulic diffusivities increased with distance and the best fit was achieved when celerity was neglected rasmussen et al 2002 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated as 2 85 m day due to the homogeneous bigbee series soil along the transect estimated thickness of the saturated aquifer at the creek increased from 1 to 50 m moving away from the creek 4 discussion 4 1 creek aquifer interactions seasonal variations in groundwater levels and hydraulic gradients near inc reflects the direct hydraulic connectivity between the two systems abundant winter precipitation resulted in record high regional groundwater levels in the ufa evident in nearby usgs well 08e038 which subsequently increased groundwater discharges to the creek successive winter storms were responsible for most of the total annual gains 150 million m3 as the aquifer potentiometric surface rose above the creek bed for most of the dormant season when water losses to evapotranspiration and groundwater withdrawals were low i e p et withdrawal steady declines in stream discharge in march and april 2019 correspond with increased spring water use i e p et withdrawal hook et al 2005 in conjunction with negligible summer increases in downstream discharge the declines in stream discharge reflects the direction and magnitude of stream aquifer flux as a function of regional water use flatt 2018 inc contributed to groundwater recharge during periods in the growing season when the aquifer potentiometric surface declined below the stream surface elevation this gradient was even maintained during short duration growing season storm events water use both et and human withdrawals plays a pivotal role in the flow of coupled stream aquifer systems in karst environments from the aquifer into surface water bodies aquifer recharge occurs during storm events with changes in stream stages affecting groundwater levels as displayed by the conceptual model outlining creek groundwater interactions during steady and dynamic creek flow scenarios fig 8 at the onset of a storm water moves into permeable stream banks as rapidly increasing discharge creates a hydraulic gradient favoring lateral water movement while some surface water contributes to aquifer recharge near the streambank more distant groundwater responses are likely due to hydraulic responses that move faster than and often in different directions than fluid flow williams et al 2002 the hyporheic zone is commonly modeled in two dimensions as it contributes to groundwater recharge through horizontal and vertical infiltration lautz and siegel 2006 the effects of horizontal infiltration in the sandy and karst systems of the dougherty plain are evident in that groundwater responses were detected 120 m from the creek after hurricane michael fig 7 a fifty fold increase in the saturated layer thickness along the 120 m transect table 2 further supports the effect of horizontal infiltration throughout this process groundwater provides natural flood storage capacity mitigating downstream effects of large storms such as hurricanes connectivity between the stream and groundwater is rapid as evident in the responses of streamside piezometers but also changes interannually bidirectional behavior bank storage is apparent as water moves into the floodplain at high creek stage and water returns to the creek at lower stages fig 5 a 2 a portion of water leaving the stream channel contributes to aquifer recharge fig 7 diminished losses of streamflow from a storm event coincided with winter gains in the aquifer a 4 6 m increase in the potentiometric surface from 12 2 to 7 6 m below land surface seen in nearby usgs well 10h009 showing aquifer recharge from quickflow is greater during summer than winter changes in the hydraulic head have been proven to affect streamflow numerically cardenas and wilson 2007 and experimentally fox et al 2014 aquifer recharge during storm events introduces a hydrodynamically influenced flux that is most sensitive when stream stage greatly exceeds groundwater elevations contrary to the general findings of previous research boano et al 2014 fox et al 2014 cardenas and wilson 2007 but the magnitude of this relationship would depend greatly upon the composition of stream bank soils and thus their transmissivity inconsistencies in stream bank soils and karst geologic framework creates variably sensitive regions considering groundwater interaction mosner 2002 the hydraulic parameters calculated in this study can be used as a singular location to improve future regional groundwater models as initial or known experimental repetition along inc would further constrain hydraulic parameters 4 2 factors influencing creek groundwater interactions the interactions between creek and groundwater hydrology are interdisciplinary in nature and can be better understood by considering regional geologic framework hydrogeologic behavior regional water budget and ecohydrological behavior hydrologic influences of the creek aquifer system s dynamic bank flow conditions are summarized in a conceptual model fig 10 rainfall is the major input to the storage system and groundwater withdrawals and plant water use are the major outputs of the system preferential and matrix aquifer movement influence surface water flow on an irrigated karstic landscape with preferential flows likely influencing aquifer discharge along stream reaches while stream reaches are generally oriented parallel to regional bedrock jointing rugel et al 2012 reach level variation in groundwater discharge may be due to the many center pivot irrigation systems that withdraw groundwater along preferential flowpaths williams et al 2017 interactions between conduits and matrix flow have been shown in the floridan aquifer elsewhere martin and dean 2001 the same behavior could exist between a heavily incised stream and a surficial aquifer aquifer flow with respect to reach orientation could exhibit a groundwater flow through regime as the channel interacts with the banks a flow through regime has been described in lakes and wetlands but could also occur as hyporheic flows within stream segments eamus et al 2006 turner and townley 2006 the transect at mbw is oriented parallel to primary or matrix groundwater flow direction as indicated by the potentiometric surface fig 9 potentially encouraging aquifer recharge downgradient of aquifer flow a 1 m resolution digital terrain model provided by neon lidar provides explanation to the observed stream aquifer interactions bank storage gains in the southwestern direction is indicated by a larger floodplain in the southwestern direction downstream of the aquifer gradient supporting the notion aquifer gradients influence recharge locations soil maps indicated high porosity sands downgradient of aquifer flow fig 9 troup bigbee lucy and esto norfolk soil series are commonly found on the coastal plain these series consist of well drained to somewhat excessively well drained unconsolidated sandy and loamy marine sediments wahee soils are found east and west of the middle bluff east site in flatter topography this series is classified as somewhat poorly drained due to their clayey and loamy texture usda 2005 lidar imagery also indicates a chokepoint upstream of the study site changes in channel morphological units from across a rocky shoal have been previously shown to influence stream aquifer exchanges harvey and bencala 1993 4 3 recommendations for future research future research concerning surface groundwater interaction in creeks and rivers of the dougherty plain should consider factors influencing surface groundwater interaction to form a predictive framework to characterize the complex terrain this could be achieved by comparing hydraulic parameters in the vicinity multiple streams in the dougherty plain similar studies on minor and ungaged streams knowingly connected to groundwater are recommended to understand better the hydraulic behavior of minor and ungaged streams in karst environments additional field data campaigns can provide the necessary information to create hydrogeology models of a higher resolution to better understand fluid transport in karstic environments an additional transect on the opposite bank at mbe and incremental discharge measurements using acoustic doppler current profilers in conjunction with usgs stream gages would indicate losing and gaining portions of the creek on a finer scale the opposite bank is the opposite direction to the aquifer flow direction which is believed to decrease bank aquifer interactions the increased resolution would further our understanding of stream aquifer fluxes and predictive factors of gaining and losing reaches in similar systems could be determined regional groundwater gradient and preferential flow are known to influence on gaining and losing stream banks but more research is needed 5 conclusions steady and dynamic interactions were characterized between ichawaynochaway creek inc a fluvial terrace mbe and the upper floridan aquifer ufa analysis of a 15 5 km stream reach with no surficial inputs between two us geological survey stream gages indicates seasonal groundwater recharge to the creek during fall and winter channel storage losses were detected in the spring and summer as water use increased due to evapotranspiration and groundwater withdrawals seasonal variation of stream aquifer interaction indicates the fragility of aquatic ecosystems on karstic landscapes spatial and temporal variability of bank storage in the phreatic zone indicate the complexity of stream aquifer interactions between a heavily incised stream interacting with a surficial karst aquifer dynamic behavior during the initial onset of a severe storm event suggests an additional process of aquifer recharge caused by the addition of creek water to bank storage caused by kinematic waves this research provides estimates of hydraulic properties i e hydraulic diffusivity transmissivity used to calibrate regional groundwater models hydraulic transmissivity diffusivity and the saturated aquifer s thickness increased with distance from the creek aquifer hydraulic diffusivity ranged from 9 to 420 m2 day transmissivity from 3 to 150 m2 day and saturated thickness from 1 to 50 m with values increasing with distance from the streambank increased resolution of regional water models can aid water budget estimations the effects of meteorological changes inform water resource managers and synthesize ecological and hydrologic theory results provide parameterization guidance for future modeling efforts within the apalachicola chattahoochee flint basin lower flint river basin dougherty plain and inc excessive groundwater withdrawals in a coupled creek aquifer system threaten water resources sustainability and the aquatic ecosystems dependent on enough clean water aquifer recharge during winter storm events and proper groundwater management is imperative to the summertime resilience of groundwater dependent baseflow in inc average base flow in inc has decreased since the implementation of center pivot irrigation due to the dependence of both agricultural and aquatic ecosystems on water from the ufa golladay et al 2007 local interactions between surface and groundwater interactions should be considered in future water resources management identification and conservation of hydraulically sensitive areas such as losing reaches and lineaments would increase groundwater dependent baseflow and improve aquatic ecosystem services findings from this study can inform water resources managers such as water planning districts and state governments in this and other karst basins refined knowledge and consideration of stream channel processes can elucidate the relationship between aquifer gradients and stream reach

water and increasing construction ensuring sustainable water resource utilization and maintaining its forming conditions and water quality are crucial thus exploring the formation process of mineral water and the relationship between surface water and mineral water is vital in the study area 2 2 data collection a total of 36 water samples were collected for hydrochemical and isotope analyses including 9 rainwater collected from wang 1997 and feng et al 2022 8 mineral water from local bureau of mineral water resources from 2016 to 2019 and 2 rainwater 8 surface water and 9 mineral water from field sampling in july and october 2020 fig 3 the mineral springs in the study area are distributed in the watersheds of the toudaobai erdaobai and sandaobai rivers mainly metasilicate mineral springs a few are compound mineral springs the flow direction of rivers and groundwater is from south to north due to the existence of changbai mountain therefore we collected mineral and surface water according to the flow direction and covered all types of springs in the study area 500 ml polyethylene bottles were used to collect water samples after field work the bottles were sealed stored at 4 and transported to the laboratory for test in the shortest time 2 3 analysis methods electrical conductivity ec and water temperature were measured using a handheld ec meter at the field sites the chemical composition and stable isotope 18o and d were measured by the public technology service center of northeast institute of geography and agroecology chinese academy of sciences the cations and so4 2 were measured using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer icp 7500 agilent technologies inc usa free co2 and other anions were measured by titration the metasilic acid was measured by silicon molybdenum yellow spectrophotometry the tritium was measured by ultra low background liquid scintillation spectrometer quantulus 1220 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were measured using a stable isotope mass spectrometer mat253 thermo finnigan inc usa the results were reported in per mil deviation relative to the vsmow standard 1 δ r s ample r vsmow r vsmow 1 1000 where r sample is the ratio of d h or 18o 16o in water samples and r vsmow is the ratio of d h or 18o 16o of vsmow standard on the basis of isotopic mass conservation end elements are divided to calculate the conversion ratio of different water bodies gu 2011 the calculation formula of the two end element method is as follows 2 f a δ mix δ b δ a δ b 3 f b 1 f a where f a is the proportion of water a f b is the proportion of water b δ mix is δd or δ18o of water mixed by a and b the concentration and variation of tritium in groundwater are closely related to its recharge sources the tritium content in natural rainwater is about 5 10tu in the 1960 s nuclear tests were concentrated resulting in a sharp increase in tritium concentration in atmospheric precipitation therefore according to whether tritium concentration is affected by nuclear explosion groundwater formation time can be divided into two age groups before and after nuclear test namely around 1960 bayari et al 2006 before 1960 tritium was basically depleted and the later tritium was relatively high which can be used to determine the formation age of groundwater the isotopic dating equation is 4 t t 0 693 ln n n 0 where t is isotopic age a n 0 is the initial tritium concentration of the sample n is the tritium concentration of the sample at t time tu t is the half life of tritium 12 43a 3 results 3 1 physical and hydrochemical characteristics 3 1 1 ec and temperature characteristics of the water samples ec is the overall reflection of the total dissolved ion content in water during water transport soluble rocks are continuously dissolved and ion exchange occurs in the surrounding rocks and soil to a certain extent it reflects the runoff path and retention time of water flow in the regional water cycle as can be seen from fig 4 the ec value of mineral water in july ranges from 84 to 1718 μs cm whereas that of surface water is 117 165 μs cm in october the ec value is 90 1680 μs cm and 120 190 μs cm respectively the ec of surface water has a slight fluctuation in different period in october it is higher than that in july this is because the river runoff becomes larger as there is more precipitation in summer which dilutes the ion concentration of the chemical components ec value of mineral water is smaller than that of river water due to the more intensive evaporation of surface water however two mineral springs have abnormally high ec values q 1 1 and q 2 4 the main reason is that the two springs are both compound mineral springs rich in co2 and the high hco3 content leads to an increase in the total dissolved ion content in the water thus the higher ec values the water temperature conforms to climate change characteristics in the study area surface water is warmer than mineral water and the temperature changed more due to hydrometeorological factors and less vegetation coverage 3 1 2 main hydrochemical characteristics the hydrochemical data of metasilicic acid mineral water collected from 2016 to 2019 are summarized the results are presented in table 1 and fig 5 ph range is 6 96 7 89 and the perennial average is 7 34 the total dissolved solid tds value is at a low salinity level ranging from 93 8 to 188 0 mg l with an average value of 131 80 mg l metasilicic acid concentration ranges from 49 6 to 59 13 mg l and the average value is up to 55 37 mg l each spring conforms to standard for metasilicic acid content in mineral water 25 mg l in the national standard for food safety drinking natural mineral water gb8537 2018 china there is a small difference in the cation content the average values of k na ca2 and mg2 are 2 83 8 26 6 77 and 4 53 mg l and the proportion of na k ca2 and mg2 is respectively 44 25 24 27 and 31 48 f concentration ranges from 0 38 to 1 77 mg l q 3 3 has the maximum f concentration which exceeds 1 mg l on the whole the mineral water is weakly alkaline and the content of each main component has a trend of overall decline but the concentration of metasilicic acid and the ratio of each ion content are basically stable the concentration range and correlation analysis of chemical components in mineral water are present in fig 6 and table 2 it can be seen that the variation degrees of ph and the characteristic component metasilicic acid are relatively stable tds changed most except for f other major components were significantly correlated with tds it means these ions have been continuously dissolved into groundwater and lead to tds increase hco3 is the main factor affecting tds h2sio3 is positively correlated with na mg2 and hco3 and the correlation coefficients are 0 902 0 820 and 0 730 respectively the h2sio3 dissolution is closely related to the above ions the hydrochemical data of mineral water and surface water collected in 2020 are summarized and presented in table 3 compared with previous years table 1 the hydrochemical content of metasilicic acid mineral spring in 2020 is basically the same and in a stable state in 2020 two compound mineral water were added for hydrochemistry analysis the contents of hydrochemical components in two compound mineral water q 1 1 and q 2 4 are significantly different from those in other metasilicic acid mineral springs compound mineral water is weak acid and the free co2 content is more than 300 mg l the existence of co2 directly leads to the increase of hco3 which also promotes the dissolution of more cations to balance hco3 this results in a significant increase in tds the average content of metasilicic acid in compound mineral water 82 37 mg l is significantly higher than that of metasilicic mineral water 53 39 mg l the ph range of surface water is 7 20 7 76 and the average value is 7 41 tds is at a low salinity level with a range of 98 0 182 0 mg l and an average of 123 57 mg l which is slightly lower than that of mineral water the variation range of metasilicic acid concentration is 23 89 52 38 mg l and the average value is 43 01 mg l it can be preliminarily determined that surface water is recharged by mineral springs except for b 1 all the other surface waters reached the standard of metasilicate acid content of 25 mg l the f concentration varies from 0 47 to 1 56 mg l with an average of 1 01 mg l which is slightly higher than that of mineral water the highest f concentration belongs to b 3 1 this may be due to the dissolution of f by water through the ashed dark brown forest soil cao et al 2010 he et al 2010 fig 7 shows the ratio in milligram equivalent of the main ion concentration content of mineral water and surface water in 2020 unlike that in mineral water na has the most obvious advantage among surface water cations with an average value of 17 08 mg l accounting for 51 5 the change rule of main cations is na ca2 mg2 k the dominant anion is hco3 which is the same as in mineral water with an average value of 71 52 mg l accounting for 75 7 the main anion cl also increased significantly compared with mineral water which is 9 79 mg l the average cl concentration in mineral water is 4 16 mg l in 2020 it accounts for 17 8 which is much higher than 6 9 in mineral water na k cl meq l is larger than 1 the study area is located in the nature reserve and it is less affected by human beings therefore the reason for the significant increase of na and cl concentrations in surface water may be the evaporation and dissolution of halite under the stronger fluidity of surface water and condition of rapid water cycle the weathering and dissolution degree of albite and silicate is higher resulting in the dissolution of more ions 3 1 3 hydrochemistry type and linkage among geochemical parameters the piper diagram was drawn using the aqqa software to analyze the hydrochemical types of surface water and mineral water as presented in fig 8 the anions in surface water and mineral water in different watersheds are relatively concentrated the piper diagram classifies the mineral into hco3 mg hco3 ca and hco3 na types with hco3 na as the dominant the hydrochemical type of surface water in the toudao river basin is hco3 ca other hydrochemical type of surface water is hco3 na most hydrochemical types of metasilicate spring water are consistent with surface water which is hco3 na type indicating that there is a hydraulic connection between surface water and mineral water the hydrochemical type of compound mineral water containing co2 is hco3 ca and hco3 mg respectively it is different from the water rock interaction mechanism of metasilicate mineral water and more ca2 or mg2 is dissolved in the formation process the formation mechanism of the two compound mineral water also has some differences 3 2 stable isotope the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic relationships of precipitation mineral water and surface water samples collected in 2020 are analyzed as presented in fig 9 and the statistical results are presented in table 4 deuterium excess d is a concept proposed by dansgaard dansgaard 1964 which describes the excess deuterium in global precipitation the calculation is as follows 5 d δ d 8 δ 18 o as can be seen from fig 9 a the rainwater isotope values in the study area deviated from the global meteoric water line gmwl the relationship between δd and δ18o remained linear but the slope and intercept became smaller the slope of local meteoric water line lmwl is 6 78 which is less than gmwl this indicates that the precipitation in the study area had gone through certain evaporation before it reached the surface and water vapor of the precipitation in study area comes from the sources with different ratios of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes rautio and korkka niemi 2015 yao et al 2018 from table 4 the isotopes of surface water are more enriched than those of springs in different months however the change trends of the two are different in july and october surface water is more enriched in july whereas mineral water is more enriched in october the d value reflects the degree of isotopic fractionation of water body dansgaard 1964 in october the d value of mineral and surface water is close to d excess 10 of global atmospheric precipitation but deviates from it in july indicating that there may be a certain degree of evaporative fractionation in july but this effect decreases in october from fig 9 b the observed values of the collected water samples fall near the precipitation line this indicates that the water supply originated from the atmosphere however the slope of mineral and surface water line is smaller than that of lmwl moreover most surface and mineral water samples are located on the left of lmwl indicating that there may be other recharge sources besides precipitation yang et al 2021 the water vapor produced by evaporation can be transported to the mountainous area and then condense into precipitation which has the characteristic of high d excess making the sample fall to the left side of lmwl froehlich et al 2008 kong and pang 2016 combining d value and slope of mineral and surface water line there is probably an evaporation effect and the evaporation of surface water is stronger in the formation process of mineral water precipitation first penetrates into saturated zone or aquifer through soil and unsaturated zone with evaporation the interaction between water and rock also leads to isotope enrichment fang et al 2017 and evaporation also occurs as the spring rises feng et al 2022 the multiple effects above make the mineral water line slope less than lmwl 3 3 tritium the analysis results of 3h and relationship between 3h and d in the study area is shown in table 5 and fig 10 the content of d and 3h in mineral water is erdaobai river basin lower reaches of sandaobai river upper and middle reaches of sandaobai river respectively the content of 3h is 0 6 10 6tu according to eq 4 the mineral water age is 26 32 77 83a the average age of mineral water is 44 15 years which indicates that mineral water is mainly supplied by the modern water the 3h content of q 1 1 spring in toudaobai river is the highest which is 10 6tu most spring 3h values are between 5 and 10tu it indicated those springs are closely related to atmospheric water exchange mainly participating in underground shallow circulation the 3h value of q 2 4 spring in erdaobai river basin is 0 5tu which is lower than the detection limit the possible reason is that it is recharged by deep groundwater in historical periods and participates in deep circulation yin and yin 2010 the difference of 3h content also shows that the recharge source of mineral water is different 4 discussion 4 1 stable isotopic indication 4 1 1 precipitation there are obvious differences between the two rainwater isotopes collected in july and october 2020 and the rainwater isotopes are more enriched in july the study area is located in northeast china the annual average temperature is low and is one of three major stable snow area in china wang et al 2020 seasonal variation of stable isotopes is particularly evident in cold region gibson et al 2005 in addition the temperature effect clark and fritz 1997 mainly occurs in the middle and high latitude continental interior regions kohn and welker 2005 yu et al 2008 isotopes are greatly influenced by temperature the temperature in summer is higher the δ18o also increases the winter wind gradually strengthened and the temperature decreased which makes the total amount of water vapor that produces precipitation continue to decrease welker 2000 this resulted in depletion of precipitation isotopes at lower temperatures october and enrichment at higher temperatures july in the study area in addition isotopes in precipitation are also controlled by wind speed and evaporation in the water source region feng et al 2022 the humidity of the atmosphere or near earth gas layer that the precipitation passes through is very low vaporizing precipitation when it reaches the ground pu et al 2017 it may exchange isotopes with rising water vapor in clouds resulting in isotopic composition changes the water vapor sources in the study area in summer are mainly local water vapor in the west and northwest directions and water vapor brought by monsoons from the pacific ocean li et al 2012 due to the generally high temperature and strong evaporation in the continent s interior in summer water from lakes and rivers therein flows into most of the local water vapor as a result of intense evaporation cui 1995 li et al 2012 heavy isotopes are enriched in lakes the δ18o of rainwater brought by terrestrial water vapor from the northwest and local re evaporating water vapor is relatively high li et al 2012 2019 in autumn water vapor sources are mainly polar arctic ocean moisture and atlantic ocean moisture transported by westerlies li et al 2012 influenced by monsoon climates the air mass from the ocean in the entire northeast region from may to october is characterized by high humidity weak evaporation and high precipitation thus during this period δ18o has a smaller fluctuation in conclusion the differences of precipitation isotopes in summer and autumn in the study area are mainly affected by temperature and water vapor sources 4 1 2 surface water and mineral water the isotope data of sampling points distributed along the downstream flow in the study area gently change indicating a single groundwater recharge source and meteoric precipitation is the main recharge source the effect of evaporation during the infiltration of precipitation gradually becomes prominent and the isotopes are gradually enriched the water samples mainly arrange in the southwest area of the central part in the study area the springs are densely distributed and low lying they were formed by the discharge of groundwater and the evaporation is intense in july and october there is no obvious difference between the isotopic compositions of the erdaobai and sandaobai rivers the supply conditions and evaporation intensity did not change much isotopes of the sandaobai river are close to the local meteoric water line lmwl indicating that the river is mainly recharged by atmospheric precipitation and is less affected by evaporation due to evaporation the erdaobai river slightly deviates from the lmwl but the slope and deuterium surplus d value are close to it the isotopes of the two rivers are enriched the d values gradually decrease along the flow direction and the differences of d have reduced humidity wind speed and sea surface temperature are essential factors influencing the regional variation of the d value these indicate that the rivers are in a continuous flow and that the water body has a certain variability the influence of evaporation during the flow process is different and unbalanced and the water cycle intensifies along the flow direction there is a significant difference between the isotopic enrichment degrees of toudaobai river and mineral water in summer the isotopes of the toudaobai river fall in the lower right of the lmwl and are far away from it the isotopes of the toudaobai river are the most enriched and the d value is negative this phenomenon typically occurs in arid regions gu et al 1998 lin et al 2020 however the study area has a subhumid climate rich in water vapor for this abnormal phenomenon climate factors can be ruled out instead it may be due to other supply source except atmospheric precipitation possibly by the snowmelt water of changbai mountain according to feng et al 2022 with the increase of temperature and evaporation the δ18o of snowmelt water becomes more and more enriched the largest δ18o value of snowmelt water is up to 11 96 the long recharge path and slow runoff process intensifying the interaction of water with the surrounding rocks moreover secondary evaporation may occur during recharge however the isotopes of the toudaobai river fall near the lmwl in autumn indicating an obvious change in the recharge source atmospheric precipitation recharge has a certain delay after the precipitation concentration period in july and august fig 2 the supply source changed from melting glaciers to precipitation leading to changes in the isotopic composition compared to july the mineral water isotopes of october are closer to the lmwl and the slope difference between mineral water line and lmwl also decreases indicating that the source of the mineral water in october is more simple and less affected by other factors according to fig 2 the precipitation in study area is concentrated in the july and august but the isotope composition of mineral water in october is closer to the lmwl which shows that atmospheric precipitation has a certain delay in the supply of water in study area 4 2 formation process of mineral water the concentration of each component na mg2 ca2 hco3 so4 2 free co2 and h2sio3 in compound mineral water is high table 3 all cations increase with the increase of hco3 but ca2 is the main cation in q 2 4 and mg2 is the main cation in q 1 1 fig 8 na in q 1 1 131 24 mg l is higher than that in q 2 4 45 33 mg l the metasilicate concentration in q 2 4 53 44 mg l is not very high these shows that the material source and formation process of the two compound mineral springs may be different gibbs diagrams can be utilized to quantitatively describe the sources of ions in water by reflecting the dominant processes of precipitation rock weathering or evaporation gibbs 1970 gibbs and modified gibbs diagrams amiri and berndtsson 2020 marandi and shand 2018 of the water samples in the study area are presented in fig 11 as can be seen from fig 11 most of the surface water and metasilicate mineral springs fall in the middle of the figure the ions mainly come from the weathering release of rocks the modified gibbs diagram shows that it is mainly controlled by weathering and dissolution of silicate rocks the water rock interaction can be better reflected by the ratio of ions bakari et al 2013 the relationship diagram of each component was drawn as shown in fig 12 mineral water points are all above the line of γ k na γcl 1 fig 12 a and blow the line of γ ca2 mg2 γ hco3 so4 2 1 it indicates that na and k in mineral water mainly come from salt rock dissolution and the main source of ca2 and mg2 is silicate dissolution and a small part comes from carbonate rocks the results are consistent with the corrected gibbs diagram fig 11 b fig 12 c can reflect dissolution of carbonate rocks mineral water points are blow the line of γ so4 2 cl γ hco3 1 which generally indicates that hco3 mainly comes from the dissolution of carbonate but according to the geological conditions of the study area the main minerals in the aquifer are albite anorthite potash feldspar olivine and pyroxene etc yan et al 2016 these minerals are the principal components of silicate rocks although these feldspar weathering processes are different they can react with co2 and water to form metasilicate and hco3 this explains the main source of matter in mineral water the main reaction processes are as follows potash feldspar 2 kal si 3 o 8 2 h 2 co 3 5 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 k 2 hco 3 4 h 2 sio 3 albite 2 na al si 3 o 8 2 h 2 co 3 5 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 na 2 hco 3 4 h 2 sio 3 anorthite ca al 2 si 2 o 8

the ion coefficient of γ na cl γ ca2 mg2 γ hco3 so4 2 the cation exchange can be reflected li et al 2013 fig 12 d each point is close to the line with the ratio of 1 indicating that different degrees of cation exchange have occurred the value of γ na γ na ca2 is greater than 0 5 γ na γ na ca2 of mineral water change from low to high and the tds changes little fig 12 e so under the background of rock dominance cation exchange also plays a role in increasing na and reducing ca2 during the cation exchange process 2 mmol l na is released due to 1 mmol l ca2 exchange and the mass of 1 mmol l ca2 40 mg l and 2 mmol l na 46 mg l is almost equal resulting in no significant change in tds value the ion exchange process is as follows ca2 na2 x 2na ca x where x is sites of cation exchange the tds of metasilicate mineral springs is low while the tds of compound mineral springs can reach 1000 mg l γ cl γ cl hco3 fig 12 e is close to 0 which shows different formation mechanism for different mineral springs the two compound mineral springs fall at the top of the gibbs diagram and are in different location combined with the modified gibbs diagram and fig 11 q 2 4 is mainly subjected to ion exchange the alternating adsorption of conventional cations in natural water constitutes the following sequence according to its exchange energy h fe3 al3 ba2 ca2 mn2 mg2 k na li this sequence shows that the alternating adsorption capacity of ca2 is greater than that of mg2 k and na therefore ca mg na alternating adsorption often occurs in water rock interaction the f content of q 2 4 is high whereas the cl content is also relatively high the reason is that in volcanic areas the release of cl and f is closely related to deep magmatic activities and degassing the positively correlated contents of both ions indicate that the source of the spring is related to the degassing of a deep magmatic sac lin et al 1999 due to the strong geological tectonic movement and volcanic activity in changbai mountain there are many deep and large faults around its main peak most of the groundwater in deep faults is supplied by surface water and deep hot groundwater co2 in groundwater mainly comes from released gases during magmatic activity and metamorphism the deep underground temperature is high the water rock interaction is intense and the groundwater circulation time is long a large amount of minerals in rocks are dissolved in groundwater leading to increases in the content of each component and an increase in groundwater salinity chen et al 2019 qiao et al 2016 combined with the content of 3h 0 5tu the age of this spring is relatively high so it can be proved that the ion source may be the underground deep water through a strong water cycle and water rock interaction thus the source of ions for these springs may be deep underground water that had undergone a strong water cycle and water rock interaction q 1 1 point falls on the evaporation control effect the spring has the highest value of metasilicate 107 83 mg l the cation concentration of q 1 1 is higher than that of q 2 4 according to its 3h content 10 6tu it is a relatively young water there is little possibility of participating in deep underground circulation combined with environment around it may participate in the underground shallow circulation the surface layer of q 1 1 is albic soil or shallow albic soil and the surface layer is covered with humus layer of about 20 cm thick and the content of humus in the soil is also high from the typical soil profile it can be seen that albic soil and shallow albic soil are acidic to slightly acidic ph is 5 0 5 5 and precipitation is acidic after soil leaching shen et al 2013 the ion source process may be that organic acids such as sio2 in the surface layer of the soil are partly leached down during the rapid leaching process of precipitation resulting in a large amount of co2 tian et al 2014 co2 is enriched in the middle and lower parts of the soil layer making the concentration of metasilicate and co2 in mineral water higher forming a compound mineral spring 4 3 the relationship between mineral and surface along with the hydrochemical characteristics of surface water and groundwater in the study area the characteristic components of mineral water metasilicic acid h2sio3 and the conventional ion cl are used as tracers similarly stable isotopes can also be used as tracers when the isotope values change the transformation relationship between different water bodies can also be revealed there is a large difference in the isotopic compositions between q 1 1 and b 1 in summer but in autumn the isotopic compositions of the two points are similar however the cl concentration of q 1 1 is 18 46 mg l and the concentration of h2sio3 is 111 74 mg l the corresponding concentrations for b 1 are 9 66 and 23 89 mg l respectively as with the actual situation q 1 1 is located at a high altitude and is rich in co2 therefore its hydraulic connection with surface water is weak in different period the main recharge source of mineral water and surface water significantly changes after concentrated precipitation the recharge sources of q 1 1 change from atmospheric precipitation and underground water to mainly atmospheric precipitation the tracing component contents of mineral water and surface water in the erdaobai river and sandaobai river watershed are presented in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 that the cl content of the surface water is greater than that of mineral water and its h2sio3 content is less than that of mineral water δ18o of surface water is slightly enriched along the flow direction the cl content of mineral and surface water exhibits the same trend and downstream isotopes are more enriched than the upstream ones in july the variation of h2sio3 in mineral water is small and exhibits an increasing trend but the concentration of h2sio3 in surface water decreases on the whole the isotopes and hydrochemistry show a uniform change trend according to eq 2 the recharge proportion of mineral water to surface water is about 61 and 69 in the two watersheds the isotopic compositions and changes in surface water in autumn are the same as those in summer although the isotopes of mineral water in october are obviously enriched compared with that in summer the variation trend along flow direction is opposite to that of surface water moreover there is also a certain difference in the hydrochemical change therefore the interaction between mineral and surface water is weak in this period from the above analysis it can be seen that the hydraulic connection between surface water and mineral water is weak in different periods in the toutaobai river watershed however there is an obvious interaction between mineral water and surface water in the erdaobai river and sandaobai river watersheds as presented in fig 14 with the change of precipitation the recharge sources of surface water and mineral water in each water body have changed after the concentrated precipitation from july to august the isotope of mineral water and surface water are closer to the composition of atmospheric precipitation in october which proves that the recharge source is mainly precipitation mineral water recharges surface water in summer and the recharge ratio is greater than 60 precipitation has a pronounced lag effect on the recharge of mineral water and surface water after the concentrated precipitation the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of surface water and mineral spring in all watersheds in autumn are obviously close to the lmwl and the main recharge sources are mainly precipitation therefore mineral water is one of the main factors influencing the amount of surface water resources in summer in mineral water resource development it is important to pay attention to changes in river flow to avoid damages to the balance of regional water resources 5 conclusions a combined application of hydrochemical indicators and stable environmental isotope characterization is performed to investigate the mineral water and surface water in the changbai mountain area 1 due to the impact of stable environment and less anthropogenic activities the fluctuation hydrochemistry in surface water and mineral water is relatively slight the main hydrochemical type of surface water is hco3 na and that of mineral water are hco3 na and hco3 mg the average cycle time of mineral water is about 44 years which provides sufficient time for formation 2 most ions mainly come from the weathering release of rocks mineral water chemistry is mainly controlled by dissolution precipitation of feldspar pyroxene and olivine the hydrolysis of primary silicate minerals may provide solutes for co2 and metasilicate compound mineral springs and metasilicate mineral spring show different formation mechanism the compound mineral spring with high f content is affected by deep underground circulation and volcanic activity and components of the younger compound mineral spring with co2 are mainly formed by soil leaching 3 slope of isotope line for rainwater is less than the gmwl due to the water vapor source and temperature effect affected by the water cycle and evaporation δ18o is gradually enriched along the flow direction in surface water surface water isotopes are more enriched than mineral water the recharge sources of mineral water and surface water in different watersheds change in each period and precipitation has a certain delayed effect on the replenishment of different water resources 4 in summer the toudaobai river receives glacier melts from changbai mountain in addition to atmospheric precipitation the erdaobai and sandaobai rivers receive a joint recharge of precipitation and mineral water and the recharge proportion of mineral water is greater than 60 considering that mineral water is the main form of groundwater and a critical factor for surface water amount in the study area attention should be paid to the changes of river flow and mineral water quality to maintain the balance of water resources and river ecological health credit authorship

8052,study region changbai mountain area china study focus the characteristics and process of water rock interactions of natural mineral water are revealed using hydrochemical and isotopic data new hydrological insights the results confirm rock weathering plays a leading role in the mechanism of chemical composition of mineral water which is controlled by lithology and tectonic environment within the region mineral water chemistry is mainly controlled by dissolution precipitation of feldspar pyroxene and olivine the hydrolysis of primary silicate minerals may provide solutes for co2 and metasilicate deep underground circulation and shallow soil leaching promotes the formation compound mineral water affected by temperature and water vapor sources slope of local meteoric water line is less than global meteoric water line compared with mineral water surface water is more affected by evaporation and stable isotopes of it is more enrich there is a certain delay in precipitation recharge according to isotope characteristics the average recharge ratio of mineral water to surface water is 60 which has a great impact on the amount of surface water resources these results can

interactions water stable isotope data availability the processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also forms part of an ongoing study 1 introduction as a valuable groundwater resource mineral water plays an important role in maintaining different ecosystems which can provide water flow for surface water environmental systems such as wetlands and river banks oslash et al 2011 in recent years with the change of lifestyle people pay more and more attention to the quality of drinking water and its impact on health petraccia et al 2006 interest in natural mineral water has increased worldwide the global bottled water sales and consumption are growing rapidly coniglio et al 2020 the mineral water industry has brought economic benefits that cannot be ignored natural springs are usually located in the contact area between the groundwater level and the external surface formed by the discontinuity of topography and hydrogeology and discharged from the aquifer alsaleh 2017 alsharhan and rizk 2020 fault activities and rocks affect the formation and distribution of mineral water water rock interactions along the flow path determine elements in mineral water johnson et al 2012a 2012b with the increasing development of mineral resources understanding the physical and chemical properties and exploring the hydrogeochemical process of natural mineral water are helpful to evaluate its natural and economic value which is of great significance to ensure the sustainable and efficient utilization of high quality mineral water resources and maintain the healthy development of the natural environment the changbai mountain basalt area is the third largest existing source of high quality natural mineral water in the world following the caucasus mountains and the alps yan et al 2016 mineral spring resources are mainly distributed in the jingyu fusong and antu counties song 1984 as one of the main forms of groundwater in the changbai mountain area mineral water significantly influences watershed water resources the mineral industry is also one of the important economic sources previous studies have systematically summarized the geological background and distribution characteristics of mineral springs in this area bian et al 2019 duan and qi 2014 gao et al 2016 yan et al 2015 2016 2017 zhang 2001 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2005 and also studied the health significance and resource carrying capacity of mineral water wang and zhang 2019 yin et al 2008 however existing studies of mineral water in changbai mountain have focused on the development and have not studied the hydrogeochemistry formation process of mineral water and the relationship between mineral water and surface water comprehensively isotopes and hydrochemistry indicators are effective solutions to multiple hydrological and hydrogeological problems clark and fritz 1997 xing chen 2021 the chemical components in groundwater and surface water are related to recharge runoff and discharge as well as occurrence conditions solutes in water synchronously exchange with changes in water quantity the chemical composition in natural water records the history of water formation and transport to a certain extent locsey et al 2012 vaughn and fountain 2005 stable chemical components are also reliable tracers which can qualitatively determine the transformation relationship between surface water and groundwater and reveal its cyclic evolution characteristics isotope as an excellent tracer has been widely used in hydrological cycle research by many scholars egbi 2019 wu et al 2020 changes in the concentration of stable isotopes d and 18o in different water bodies can be utilized to trace their formation and migration patterns and reveal the law of water circulation and mutual transformation processes of different water bodies in changing environments song et al 2002 unnikrishna et al 2002 the combination of the two technologies can help to obtain groundwater information such as its source recharge and the interaction with surface water guo et al 2015 liu and yamanaka 2012 payne et al 1978 zhang et al 2021 it also contributes to an in depth understanding of major ion sources and to a better understanding of groundwater geochemical evolution gil márquez 2019 musgrove et al 2010 shi et al 2021 xing chen 2021 considering the possible impacts of climate and other factors in different periods on mineral resources this paper selects the concentrated distribution area of basalt mineral resources in changbai mountain for sample collection according to the division of watersheds and river reaches and studies the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of hydrochemistry and isotope composition of different water bodies the main purposes are to as follows 1 analyze water supply and formation process of chemical components in different water bodies 2 study influencing factors of hydrochemistry

theoretical support for the protection and rational development and utilization of water resources in the study area and provide reference for the study of mineral resources in basalt mountainous areas 2 data and methods 2 1 study area antu county is located in yanbian prefecture jilin province at the northern foot of changbai mountain the location of the study area and the distribution of the main mineral springs are presented in fig 1 the study area has a temperate monsoon subhumid climate with long winters and short summers the average monthly climate change is presented in fig 2 the annual average temperature is 4 0 c and the annual average precipitation is 752 43 mm temperature and precipitation exhibit a uniform change trend the annual distribution of precipitation is uneven about 60 of precipitation is concentrated in july and august and a decreasing trend can be observed from south to north in space the annual average evaporation is 761 11 mm and evaporation reaches its maximum value in april the water system in this area is developed originating from changbai mountain and belonging to the songhua river system the river valleys are deep and narrow with steep riverbeds rapid water flow and rich water resources these are mainly the toudaobai erdaobai and sandaobai rivers the rivers are roughly parallel from west to east and flow into the erdao songjiang river the erdaobai river originates from tianchi of changbai mountain with a total length of 104 9 km a river slope of 6 8 and a total watershed area of 2933 km2 the terrain of the study area is high in the south and low in the north under the influence of multistage tectonics the geological structures in the area are complex the xinghua baitou mountain tianchi fault zone is mainly developed in this area yan et al 2016 furthermore the topography is composed mainly of an erosional volcanic lava mountain platform erosional tectonic mountain intermountain denudation basin and intermountain valley plain the main strata comprise the neozoic quaternary lower pleistocene system and the covered rocks are the lava rocks of the junjian mountain group βq1 na et al 2020 yan et al 2018 the groundwater type in the area is complete including clastic rock fracture pore water carbonate fissure cavern water basalt pore fissure water loose rock pore water and bedrock fissure water yan et al 2016 the basalt pore fissure water distribution is widespread and is closely related to the occurrence and formation of mineral springs with clastic rock fracture pore water at present 106 springs have been found in antu county 27 of which have been surveyed and evaluated the main distribution locations of the mineral springs are presented in fig 1 most of the mineral springs are located near rivers in the proved mineral water resources the main component is metasilicic acid and a few other springs are rare compound mineral springs enriched in co2 since 2013 antu county has engaged in the protection and management work of mineral water resources and introduced a large number of enterprises into production with an annual output of 601 000 m3 with the continuous development of mineral water and increasing construction ensuring sustainable water resource utilization and maintaining its forming conditions and water quality are crucial thus exploring the formation process of mineral water and the relationship between surface water and mineral water is vital in the study area 2 2 data collection a total of 36 water samples were collected for hydrochemical and isotope analyses including 9 rainwater collected from wang 1997 and feng et al 2022 8 mineral water from local bureau of mineral water resources from 2016 to 2019 and 2 rainwater 8 surface water and 9 mineral water from field sampling in july and october 2020 fig 3 the mineral springs in the study area are distributed in the watersheds of the toudaobai erdaobai and sandaobai rivers mainly metasilicate mineral springs a few are compound mineral springs the flow direction of rivers and groundwater is from south to north due to the existence of changbai mountain therefore we collected mineral and surface water according to the flow direction and covered all types of springs in the study area 500 ml polyethylene bottles were used to collect water samples after field work the bottles were sealed stored at 4 and transported to the laboratory for test in the shortest time 2 3 analysis methods electrical conductivity ec and water temperature were measured using a handheld ec meter at the field sites the chemical composition and stable isotope 18o and d were measured by the public technology service center of northeast institute of geography and agroecology chinese academy of sciences the cations and so4 2 were measured using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer icp 7500 agilent technologies inc usa free co2 and other anions were measured by titration the metasilic acid was measured by silicon molybdenum yellow spectrophotometry the tritium was measured by ultra low background liquid scintillation spectrometer quantulus 1220 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were measured using a stable isotope mass spectrometer mat253 thermo finnigan inc usa the results were reported in per mil deviation relative to the vsmow standard 1 δ r s ample r vsmow r vsmow 1 1000 where r sample is the ratio of d h or 18o 16o in water samples and r vsmow is the ratio of d h or 18o 16o of vsmow standard on the basis of isotopic mass conservation end elements are divided to calculate the conversion ratio of different water bodies gu 2011 the calculation formula of the two end element method is as follows 2 f a δ mix δ b δ a δ b 3 f b 1 f a where f a is the proportion of water a f b is the proportion of water b δ mix is δd or δ18o of water mixed by a and b the concentration and variation of tritium in groundwater are closely related to its recharge sources the tritium content in natural rainwater is about 5 10tu in the 1960 s nuclear tests were concentrated resulting in a sharp increase in tritium concentration in atmospheric precipitation therefore according to whether tritium concentration is affected by nuclear explosion groundwater formation time can be divided into two age groups before and after nuclear test namely around 1960 bayari et al 2006 before 1960 tritium was basically depleted and the later tritium was relatively high which can be used to determine the formation age of groundwater the isotopic dating equation is 4 t t 0 693 ln n n 0 where t is isotopic age a n 0 is the initial tritium concentration of the sample n is the tritium concentration of the sample at t time tu t is the half life of tritium 12 43a 3 results 3 1 physical and hydrochemical characteristics 3 1 1 ec and temperature characteristics of the water samples ec is the overall reflection of the total dissolved ion content in water during water transport soluble rocks are continuously dissolved and ion exchange occurs in the surrounding rocks and soil to a certain extent it reflects the runoff path and retention time of water flow in the regional water cycle as can be seen from fig 4 the ec value of mineral water in july ranges from 84 to 1718 μs cm whereas that of surface water is 117 165 μs cm in october the ec value is 90 1680 μs cm and 120 190 μs cm respectively the ec of surface water has a slight fluctuation in different period in october it is higher than that in july this is because the river runoff becomes larger as there is more precipitation in summer which dilutes the ion concentration of the chemical components ec value of mineral water is smaller than that of river water due to the more intensive evaporation of surface water however two mineral springs have abnormally high ec values q 1 1 and q 2 4 the main reason is that the two springs are both compound mineral springs rich in co2 and the high hco3 content leads to an increase in the total dissolved ion content in the water thus the higher ec values the water temperature conforms to climate change characteristics in the study area surface water is warmer than mineral water and the temperature changed more due to hydrometeorological factors and less vegetation coverage 3 1 2 main hydrochemical characteristics the hydrochemical data of metasilicic acid mineral water collected from 2016 to 2019 are summarized the results are presented in table 1 and fig 5 ph range is 6 96 7 89 and the perennial average is 7 34 the total dissolved solid tds value is at a low salinity level ranging from 93 8 to 188 0 mg l with an average value of 131 80 mg l metasilicic acid concentration ranges from 49 6 to 59 13 mg l and the average value is up to 55 37 mg l each spring conforms to standard for metasilicic acid content in mineral water 25 mg l in the national standard for food safety drinking natural mineral water gb8537 2018 china there is a small difference in the cation content the average values of k na ca2 and mg2 are 2 83 8 26 6 77 and 4 53 mg l and the proportion of na k ca2 and mg2 is respectively 44 25 24 27 and 31 48 f concentration ranges from 0 38 to 1 77 mg l q 3 3 has the maximum f concentration which exceeds 1 mg l on the whole the mineral water is weakly alkaline and the content of each main component has a trend of overall decline but the concentration of metasilicic acid and the ratio of each ion content are basically stable the concentration range and correlation analysis of chemical components in mineral water are present in fig 6 and table 2 it can be seen that the variation degrees of ph and the characteristic component metasilicic acid are relatively stable tds changed most except for f other major components were significantly correlated with tds it means these ions have been continuously dissolved into groundwater and lead to tds increase hco3 is the main factor affecting tds h2sio3 is positively correlated with na mg2 and hco3 and the correlation coefficients are 0 902 0 820 and 0 730 respectively the h2sio3 dissolution is closely related to the above ions the hydrochemical data of mineral water and surface water collected in 2020 are summarized and presented in table 3 compared with previous years table 1 the hydrochemical content of metasilicic acid mineral spring in 2020 is basically the same and in a stable state in 2020 two compound mineral water were added for hydrochemistry analysis the contents of hydrochemical components in two compound mineral water q 1 1 and q 2 4 are significantly different from those in other metasilicic acid mineral springs compound mineral water is weak acid and the free co2 content is more than 300 mg l the existence of co2 directly leads to the increase of hco3 which also promotes the dissolution of more cations to balance hco3 this results in a significant increase in tds the average content of metasilicic acid in compound mineral water 82 37 mg l is significantly higher than that of metasilicic mineral water 53 39 mg l the ph range of surface water is 7 20 7 76 and the average value is 7 41 tds is at a low salinity level with a range of 98 0 182 0 mg l and an average of 123 57 mg l which is slightly lower than that of mineral water the variation range of metasilicic acid concentration is 23 89 52 38 mg l and the average value is 43 01 mg l it can be preliminarily determined that surface water is recharged by mineral springs except for b 1 all the other surface waters reached the standard of metasilicate acid content of 25 mg l the f concentration varies from 0 47 to 1 56 mg l with an average of 1 01 mg l which is slightly higher than that of mineral water the highest f concentration belongs to b 3 1 this may be due to the dissolution of f by water through the ashed dark brown forest soil cao et al 2010 he et al 2010 fig 7 shows the ratio in milligram equivalent of the main ion concentration content of mineral water and surface water in 2020 unlike that in mineral water na has the most obvious advantage among surface water cations with an average value of 17 08 mg l accounting for 51 5 the change rule of main cations is na ca2 mg2 k the dominant anion is hco3 which is the same as in mineral water with an average value of 71 52 mg l accounting for 75 7 the main anion cl also increased significantly compared with mineral water which is 9 79 mg l the average cl concentration in mineral water is 4 16 mg l in 2020 it accounts for 17 8 which is much higher than 6 9 in mineral water na k cl meq l is larger than 1 the study area is located in the nature reserve and it is less affected by human beings therefore the reason for the significant increase of na and cl concentrations in surface water may be the evaporation and dissolution of halite under the stronger fluidity of surface water and condition of rapid water cycle the weathering and dissolution degree of albite and silicate is higher resulting in the dissolution of more ions 3 1 3 hydrochemistry type and linkage among geochemical parameters the piper diagram was drawn using the aqqa software to analyze the hydrochemical types of surface water and mineral water as presented in fig 8 the anions in surface water and mineral water in different watersheds are relatively concentrated the piper diagram classifies the mineral into hco3 mg hco3 ca and hco3 na types with hco3 na as the dominant the hydrochemical type of surface water in the toudao river basin is hco3 ca other hydrochemical type of surface water is hco3 na most hydrochemical types of metasilicate spring water are consistent with surface water which is hco3 na type indicating that there is a hydraulic connection between surface water and mineral water the hydrochemical type of compound mineral water containing co2 is hco3 ca and hco3 mg respectively it is different from the water rock interaction mechanism of metasilicate mineral water and more ca2 or mg2 is dissolved in the formation process the formation mechanism of the two compound mineral water also has some differences 3 2 stable isotope the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic relationships of precipitation mineral water and surface water samples collected in 2020 are analyzed as presented in fig 9 and the statistical results are presented in table 4 deuterium excess d is a concept proposed by dansgaard dansgaard 1964 which describes the excess deuterium in global precipitation the calculation is as follows 5 d δ d 8 δ 18 o as can be seen from fig 9 a the rainwater isotope values in the study area deviated from the global meteoric water line gmwl the relationship between δd and δ18o remained linear but the slope and intercept became smaller the slope of local meteoric water line lmwl is 6 78 which is less than gmwl this indicates that the precipitation in the study area had gone through certain evaporation before it reached the surface and water vapor of the precipitation in study area comes from the sources with different ratios of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes rautio and korkka niemi 2015 yao et al 2018 from table 4 the isotopes of surface water are more enriched than those of springs in different months however the change trends of the two are different in july and october surface water is more enriched in july whereas mineral water is more enriched in october the d value reflects the degree of isotopic fractionation of water body dansgaard 1964 in october the d value of mineral and surface water is close to d excess 10 of global atmospheric precipitation but deviates from it in july indicating that there may be a certain degree of evaporative fractionation in july but this effect decreases in october from fig 9 b the observed values of the collected water samples fall near the precipitation line this indicates that the water supply originated from the atmosphere however the slope of mineral and surface water line is smaller than that of lmwl moreover most surface and mineral water samples are located on the left of lmwl indicating that there may be other recharge sources besides precipitation yang et al 2021 the water vapor produced by evaporation can be transported to the mountainous area and then condense into precipitation which has the characteristic of high d excess making the sample fall to the left side of lmwl froehlich et al 2008 kong and pang 2016 combining d value and slope of mineral and surface water line there is probably an evaporation effect and the evaporation of surface water is stronger in the formation process of mineral water precipitation first penetrates into saturated zone or aquifer through soil and unsaturated zone with evaporation the interaction between water and rock also leads to isotope enrichment fang et al 2017 and evaporation also occurs as the spring rises feng et al 2022 the multiple effects above make the mineral water line slope less than lmwl 3 3 tritium the analysis results of 3h and relationship between 3h and d in the study area is shown in table 5 and fig 10 the content of d and 3h in mineral water is erdaobai river basin lower reaches of sandaobai river upper and middle reaches of sandaobai river respectively the content of 3h is 0 6 10 6tu according to eq 4 the mineral water age is 26 32 77 83a the average age of mineral water is 44 15 years which indicates that mineral water is mainly supplied by the modern water the 3h content of q 1 1 spring in toudaobai river is the highest which is 10 6tu most spring 3h values are between 5 and 10tu it indicated those springs are closely related to atmospheric water exchange mainly participating in underground shallow circulation the 3h value of q 2 4 spring in erdaobai river basin is 0 5tu which is lower than the detection limit the possible reason is that it is recharged by deep groundwater in historical periods and participates in deep circulation yin and yin 2010 the difference of 3h content also shows that the recharge source of mineral water is different 4 discussion 4 1 stable isotopic indication 4 1 1 precipitation there are obvious differences between the two rainwater isotopes collected in july and october 2020 and the rainwater isotopes are more enriched in july the study area is located in northeast china the annual average temperature is low and is one of three major stable snow area in china wang et al 2020 seasonal variation of stable isotopes is particularly evident in cold region gibson et al 2005 in addition the temperature effect clark and fritz 1997 mainly occurs in the middle and high latitude continental interior regions kohn and welker 2005 yu et al 2008 isotopes are greatly influenced by temperature the temperature in summer is higher the δ18o also increases the winter wind gradually strengthened and the temperature decreased which makes the total amount of water vapor that produces precipitation continue to decrease welker 2000 this resulted in depletion of precipitation isotopes at lower temperatures october and enrichment at higher temperatures july in the study area in addition isotopes in precipitation are also controlled by wind speed and evaporation in the water source region feng et al 2022 the humidity of the atmosphere or near earth gas layer that the precipitation passes through is very low vaporizing precipitation when it reaches the ground pu et al 2017 it may exchange isotopes with rising water vapor in clouds resulting in isotopic composition changes the water vapor sources in the study area in summer are mainly local water vapor in the west and northwest directions and water vapor brought by monsoons from the pacific ocean li et al 2012 due to the generally high temperature and strong evaporation in the continent s interior in summer water from lakes and rivers therein flows into most of the local water vapor as a result of intense evaporation cui 1995 li et al 2012 heavy isotopes are enriched in lakes the δ18o of rainwater brought by terrestrial water vapor from the northwest and local re evaporating water vapor is relatively high li et al 2012 2019 in autumn water vapor sources are mainly polar arctic ocean moisture and atlantic ocean moisture transported by westerlies li et al 2012 influenced by monsoon climates the air mass from the ocean in the entire northeast region from may to october is characterized by high humidity weak evaporation and high precipitation thus during this period δ18o has a smaller fluctuation in conclusion the differences of precipitation isotopes in summer and autumn in the study area are mainly affected by temperature and water vapor sources 4 1 2 surface water and mineral water the isotope data of sampling points distributed along the downstream flow in the study area gently change indicating a single groundwater recharge source and meteoric precipitation is the main recharge source the effect of evaporation during the infiltration of precipitation gradually becomes prominent and the isotopes are gradually enriched the water samples mainly arrange in the southwest area of the central part in the study area the springs are densely distributed and low lying they were formed by the discharge of groundwater and the evaporation is intense in july and october there is no obvious difference between the isotopic compositions of the erdaobai and sandaobai rivers the supply conditions and evaporation intensity did not change much isotopes of the sandaobai river are close to the local meteoric water line lmwl indicating that the river is mainly recharged by atmospheric precipitation and is less affected by evaporation due to evaporation the erdaobai river slightly deviates from the lmwl but the slope and deuterium surplus d value are close to it the isotopes of the two rivers are enriched the d values gradually decrease along the flow direction and the differences of d have reduced humidity wind speed and sea surface temperature are essential factors influencing the regional variation of the d value these indicate that the rivers are in a continuous flow and that the water body has a certain variability the influence of evaporation during the flow process is different and unbalanced and the water cycle intensifies along the flow direction there is a significant difference between the isotopic enrichment degrees of toudaobai river and mineral water in summer the isotopes of the toudaobai river fall in the lower right of the lmwl and are far away from it the isotopes of the toudaobai river are the most enriched and the d value is negative this phenomenon typically occurs in arid regions gu et al 1998 lin et al 2020 however the study area has a subhumid climate rich in water vapor for this abnormal phenomenon climate factors can be ruled out instead it may be due to other supply source except atmospheric precipitation possibly by the snowmelt water of changbai mountain according to feng et al 2022 with the increase of temperature and evaporation the δ18o of snowmelt water becomes more and more enriched the largest δ18o value of snowmelt water is up to 11 96 the long recharge path and slow runoff process intensifying the interaction of water with the surrounding rocks moreover secondary evaporation may occur during recharge however the isotopes of the toudaobai river fall near the lmwl in autumn indicating an obvious change in the recharge source atmospheric precipitation recharge has a certain delay after the precipitation concentration period in july and august fig 2 the supply source changed from melting glaciers to precipitation leading to changes in the isotopic composition compared to july the mineral water isotopes of october are closer to the lmwl and the slope difference between mineral water line and lmwl also decreases indicating that the source of the mineral water in october is more simple and less affected by other factors according to fig 2 the precipitation in study area is concentrated in the july and august but the isotope composition of mineral water in october is closer to the lmwl which shows that atmospheric precipitation has a certain delay in the supply of water in study area 4 2 formation process of mineral water the concentration of each component na mg2 ca2 hco3 so4 2 free co2 and h2sio3 in compound mineral water is high table 3 all cations increase with the increase of hco3 but ca2 is the main cation in q 2 4 and mg2 is the main cation in q 1 1 fig 8 na in q 1 1 131 24 mg l is higher than that in q 2 4 45 33 mg l the metasilicate concentration in q 2 4 53 44 mg l is not very high these shows that the material source and formation process of the two compound mineral springs may be different gibbs diagrams can be utilized to quantitatively describe the sources of ions in water by reflecting the dominant processes of precipitation rock weathering or evaporation gibbs 1970 gibbs and modified gibbs diagrams amiri and berndtsson 2020 marandi and shand 2018 of the water samples in the study area are presented in fig 11 as can be seen from fig 11 most of the surface water and metasilicate mineral springs fall in the middle of the figure the ions mainly come from the weathering release of rocks the modified gibbs diagram shows that it is mainly controlled by weathering and dissolution of silicate rocks the water rock interaction can be better reflected by the ratio of ions bakari et al 2013 the relationship diagram of each component was drawn as shown in fig 12 mineral water points are all above the line of γ k na γcl 1 fig 12 a and blow the line of γ ca2 mg2 γ hco3 so4 2 1 it indicates that na and k in mineral water mainly come from salt rock dissolution and the main source of ca2 and mg2 is silicate dissolution and a small part comes from carbonate rocks the results are consistent with the corrected gibbs diagram fig 11 b fig 12 c can reflect dissolution of carbonate rocks mineral water points are blow the line of γ so4 2 cl γ hco3 1 which generally indicates that hco3 mainly comes from the dissolution of carbonate but according to the geological conditions of the study area the main minerals in the aquifer are albite anorthite potash feldspar olivine and pyroxene etc yan et al 2016 these minerals are the principal components of silicate rocks although these feldspar weathering processes are different they can react with co2 and water to form metasilicate and hco3 this explains the main source of matter in mineral water the main reaction processes are as follows potash feldspar 2 kal si 3 o 8 2 h 2 co 3 5 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 k 2 hco 3 4 h 2 sio 3 albite 2 na al si 3 o 8 2 h 2 co 3 5 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 na 2 hco 3 4 h 2 sio 3 anorthite ca al 2 si 2 o 8

the ion coefficient of γ na cl γ ca2 mg2 γ hco3 so4 2 the cation exchange can be reflected li et al 2013 fig 12 d each point is close to the line with the ratio of 1 indicating that different degrees of cation exchange have occurred the value of γ na γ na ca2 is greater than 0 5 γ na γ na ca2 of mineral water change from low to high and the tds changes little fig 12 e so under the background of rock dominance cation exchange also plays a role in increasing na and reducing ca2 during the cation exchange process 2 mmol l na is released due to 1 mmol l ca2 exchange and the mass of 1 mmol l ca2 40 mg l and 2 mmol l na 46 mg l is almost equal resulting in no significant change in tds value the ion exchange process is as follows ca2 na2 x 2na ca x where x is sites of cation exchange the tds of metasilicate mineral springs is low while the tds of compound mineral springs can reach 1000 mg l γ cl γ cl hco3 fig 12 e is close to 0 which shows different formation mechanism for different mineral springs the two compound mineral springs fall at the top of the gibbs diagram and are in different location combined with the modified gibbs diagram and fig 11 q 2 4 is mainly subjected to ion exchange the alternating adsorption of conventional cations in natural water constitutes the following sequence according to its exchange energy h fe3 al3 ba2 ca2 mn2 mg2 k na li this sequence shows that the alternating adsorption capacity of ca2 is greater than that of mg2 k and na therefore ca mg na alternating adsorption often occurs in water rock interaction the f content of q 2 4 is high whereas the cl content is also relatively high the reason is that in volcanic areas the release of cl and f is closely related to deep magmatic activities and degassing the positively correlated contents of both ions indicate that the source of the spring is related to the degassing of a deep magmatic sac lin et al 1999 due to the strong geological tectonic movement and volcanic activity in changbai mountain there are many deep and large faults around its main peak most of the groundwater in deep faults is supplied by surface water and deep hot groundwater co2 in groundwater mainly comes from released gases during magmatic activity and metamorphism the deep underground temperature is high the water rock interaction is intense and the groundwater circulation time is long a large amount of minerals in rocks are dissolved in groundwater leading to increases in the content of each component and an increase in groundwater salinity chen et al 2019 qiao et al 2016 combined with the content of 3h 0 5tu the age of this spring is relatively high so it can be proved that the ion source may be the underground deep water through a strong water cycle and water rock interaction thus the source of ions for these springs may be deep underground water that had undergone a strong water cycle and water rock interaction q 1 1 point falls on the evaporation control effect the spring has the highest value of metasilicate 107 83 mg l the cation concentration of q 1 1 is higher than that of q 2 4 according to its 3h content 10 6tu it is a relatively young water there is little possibility of participating in deep underground circulation combined with environment around it may participate in the underground shallow circulation the surface layer of q 1 1 is albic soil or shallow albic soil and the surface layer is covered with humus layer of about 20 cm thick and the content of humus in the soil is also high from the typical soil profile it can be seen that albic soil and shallow albic soil are acidic to slightly acidic ph is 5 0 5 5 and precipitation is acidic after soil leaching shen et al 2013 the ion source process may be that organic acids such as sio2 in the surface layer of the soil are partly leached down during the rapid leaching process of precipitation resulting in a large amount of co2 tian et al 2014 co2 is enriched in the middle and lower parts of the soil layer making the concentration of metasilicate and co2 in mineral water higher forming a compound mineral spring 4 3 the relationship between mineral and surface along with the hydrochemical characteristics of surface water and groundwater in the study area the characteristic components of mineral water metasilicic acid h2sio3 and the conventional ion cl are used as tracers similarly stable isotopes can also be used as tracers when the isotope values change the transformation relationship between different water bodies can also be revealed there is a large difference in the isotopic compositions between q 1 1 and b 1 in summer but in autumn the isotopic compositions of the two points are similar however the cl concentration of q 1 1 is 18 46 mg l and the concentration of h2sio3 is 111 74 mg l the corresponding concentrations for b 1 are 9 66 and 23 89 mg l respectively as with the actual situation q 1 1 is located at a high altitude and is rich in co2 therefore its hydraulic connection with surface water is weak in different period the main recharge source of mineral water and surface water significantly changes after concentrated precipitation the recharge sources of q 1 1 change from atmospheric precipitation and underground water to mainly atmospheric precipitation the tracing component contents of mineral water and surface water in the erdaobai river and sandaobai river watershed are presented in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 that the cl content of the surface water is greater than that of mineral water and its h2sio3 content is less than that of mineral water δ18o of surface water is slightly enriched along the flow direction the cl content of mineral and surface water exhibits the same trend and downstream isotopes are more enriched than the upstream ones in july the variation of h2sio3 in mineral water is small and exhibits an increasing trend but the concentration of h2sio3 in surface water decreases on the whole the isotopes and hydrochemistry show a uniform change trend according to eq 2 the recharge proportion of mineral water to surface water is about 61 and 69 in the two watersheds the isotopic compositions and changes in surface water in autumn are the same as those in summer although the isotopes of mineral water in october are obviously enriched compared with that in summer the variation trend along flow direction is opposite to that of surface water moreover there is also a certain difference in the hydrochemical change therefore the interaction between mineral and surface water is weak in this period from the above analysis it can be seen that the hydraulic connection between surface water and mineral water is weak in different periods in the toutaobai river watershed however there is an obvious interaction between mineral water and surface water in the erdaobai river and sandaobai river watersheds as presented in fig 14 with the change of precipitation the recharge sources of surface water and mineral water in each water body have changed after the concentrated precipitation from july to august the isotope of mineral water and surface water are closer to the composition of atmospheric precipitation in october which proves that the recharge source is mainly precipitation mineral water recharges surface water in summer and the recharge ratio is greater than 60 precipitation has a pronounced lag effect on the recharge of mineral water and surface water after the concentrated precipitation the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of surface water and mineral spring in all watersheds in autumn are obviously close to the lmwl and the main recharge sources are mainly precipitation therefore mineral water is one of the main factors influencing the amount of surface water resources in summer in mineral water resource development it is important to pay attention to changes in river flow to avoid damages to the balance of regional water resources 5 conclusions a combined application of hydrochemical indicators and stable environmental isotope characterization is performed to investigate the mineral water and surface water in the changbai mountain area 1 due to the impact of stable environment and less anthropogenic activities the fluctuation hydrochemistry in surface water and mineral water is relatively slight the main hydrochemical type of surface water is hco3 na and that of mineral water are hco3 na and hco3 mg the average cycle time of mineral water is about 44 years which provides sufficient time for formation 2 most ions mainly come from the weathering release of rocks mineral water chemistry is mainly controlled by dissolution precipitation of feldspar pyroxene and olivine the hydrolysis of primary silicate minerals may provide solutes for co2 and metasilicate compound mineral springs and metasilicate mineral spring show different formation mechanism the compound mineral spring with high f content is affected by deep underground circulation and volcanic activity and components of the younger compound mineral spring with co2 are mainly formed by soil leaching 3 slope of isotope line for rainwater is less than the gmwl due to the water vapor source and temperature effect affected by the water cycle and evaporation δ18o is gradually enriched along the flow direction in surface water surface water isotopes are more enriched than mineral water the recharge sources of mineral water and surface water in different watersheds change in each period and precipitation has a certain delayed effect on the replenishment of different water resources 4 in summer the toudaobai river receives glacier melts from changbai mountain in addition to atmospheric precipitation the erdaobai and sandaobai rivers receive a joint recharge of precipitation and mineral water and the recharge proportion of mineral water is greater than 60 considering that mineral water is the main form of groundwater and a critical factor for surface water amount in the study area attention should be paid to the changes of river flow and mineral water quality to maintain the balance of water resources and river ecological health credit authorship

8053,study region two areas in minnesota usa buffalo aquifer in clay county and jordan aquifer in olmsted county there are concerns about the long term sustainability of groundwater resources in the two aquifers study focus aquifer storage and recovery is an important tool for water resources management in various geographic and socio economic contexts however practical guidelines regarding the assessment of injection capacity remain limited in this study we present a quantitative methodology which is based on the theis solution the methodology allows an efficient estimation of well based injection capacity and generation of an aquifer scale injection capacity map we present a detailed workflow for applying the methodology and demonstrate its application to the two study areas the tool developed in this study can be easily applied to other areas new hydrological insights for the region the two study areas show significant spatial variability in injection capacity in the buffalo aquifer the variability is mainly controlled by transmissivity whereas in the jordan aquifer it is mainly controlled by maximum allowable hydraulic head change assuming an injection duration of one month and considering the 90 percentile value of the injection capacity at each site we found that two and four wells are required to inject the volume of water equivalent to one month of domestic water requirements for the cities of moorhead and rochester respectively graphical abstract ga1 keywords aquifer storage and recovery injection capacity mapping water security minnesota 1 introduction

grönwall and danert 2020 and more than 38 of the globally irrigated areas rely on groundwater siebert et al 2010 in many agrarian regions of the world groundwater has been instrumental in accelerating economic and social development contributing to food security and poverty alleviation gleeson et al 2010 roy and shah 2002 the dependence on groundwater will continue to increase to meet the needs of increasing world population maintain food security and sustain economic and social development despite its critical importance groundwater resources in many parts of the world are insufficiently managed and are experiencing unsustainable exploitation famiglietti 2014 famiglietti and rodell 2013 rodell et al 2009 additionally many regions are affected by climate change which further complicates the management of groundwater due to its uncertain impacts on water resources collins et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 wu et al 2020 in the midst of these challenges various water management practices have been proposed and employed across the globe to increase the sustainability of water resources kim et al 2017 onderka et al 2020 rockström and falkenmark 2015 however many of these efforts are focused on the construction of dams and reservoirs for increasing surface water storage which requires large financial costs cause significant water losses by evaporation and have significant sociological and ecological impacts alazard et al 2015 craig et al 2005 mailhot et al 2018 mumba and thompson 2005 among alternative water management practices managed aquifer recharge mar which involves the purposeful recharge of water to aquifers has gained increased interest globally dillon et al 2019 mar is the umbrella term for several techniques such as aquifer storage and recovery asr pond infiltration bank filtration and rainwater harvesting dillon 2005 in the asr method water is injected into an aquifer through well s at the time of availability and recovered from the same well s when there is an increase in water demand pyne 2005 asr has various advantages such as reduction in evaporation losses land requirements and costs as compared to traditional surface storage structures bouwer 2002 khan et al 2008 maliva et al 2006 asr is highly adaptable and applicable because water can be secured at target locations by constructing and managing wells and many successful asr implementations have been reported across the world bloetscher et al 2014 dillon et al 2019 kang et al 2019 stefan and ansems 2018 zuurbier et al 2014 for successful implementation of an asr project one needs to assess the suitability of potential asr sites a site suitability study should address both the injection capacity which is the maximum volume of water that can be injected and recovery efficiency which is the recovery percentage of the injected water of these two aspects the estimation of injection capacity should be the first step because the ability to inject a sufficient volume of water is required a priori to ensure a sufficient recoverable volume this step is the focus of this paper the most common practice for site suitability assessment has been the development of site suitability index maps using multicriteria decision analysis mcda brown et al 2005 russo et al 2015 smith et al 2017 mcda involves evaluating and combining various surface subsurface and operational parameters a rank is assigned to each parameter value based on a qualitative assessment and a weight is given to each parameter both the ranking and weighting of the parameters are subjective and thus there can be large variations in final results sallwey et al 2019 as a result the index maps produced with this type of approach are only qualitative and their reliability can be variable despite the critical importance only a few studies investigated the injection capacity of potential asr sites based on a quantitative assessment dudding et al 2006 gibson et al 2018 hodgkin 2004 neumann 2012 to our knowledge there has been only one peer reviewed article on this topic gibson et al 2018 however the work by gibson et al 2018 does not allow continuous aquifer scale mapping of injection capacity and confined and unconfined aquifers are not distinguished in their methodology further we currently lack a systematic workflow for estimating well based injection capacity and have a limited understanding of how various hydrogeological and operational parameters affect injection capacity this study bridges these knowledge gaps by providing and applying a comprehensive workflow that efficiently produces continuous aquifer scale injection capacity map the main objectives of this study are 1 to propose a quantitative methodology that enables the aquifer scale mapping of well based injection capacity for both confined and unconfined aquifers 2 to present the estimation procedure of input parameters that are required for injection capacity calculation 3 to demonstrate the methodology by applying it two aquifers in minnesota usa and producing aquifer scale injection capacity maps we also discuss the estimated injection capacity values with regard to the water demand of the studied area in section 2 we present the methodology for estimating well based injection capacity and comprehensively discuss the estimation procedure of five key input parameters in section 3 we introduce the two study areas and discuss their physical settings and hydrogeology in section 4 we present the results of the methodology applied to these areas we then analyze the significance of estimated injection capacity values in terms of domestic water requirements and discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology finally we provide conclusions in section 5 2 methodology for aquifer scale mapping of well based injection capacity 2 1 overview in this study we define injection capacity as the maximum volume of water that can be injected into an aquifer using a well pumped at a constant rate for given operational parameters i e injection duration and well radius under the constraint of a maximum allowable hydraulic head change to estimate injection capacity we need to determine the optimal injection rate that maximizes the injection capacity of a well over an injection duration we start with the theis 1935 solution which is valid for homogeneous and non leaky confined aquifers of infinite extent constant rate injection fully penetrating well negligible skin layer and negligible wellbore storage under these simplifying assumptions of theis 1935 the hydraulic head change at a point in space and time is given as 1 h r t q 4 π t e 1 r 2 s 4 tt where e 1 is the exponential integral function also known as well function defined by 2 e 1 u u e x x dx where u r 2 s 4 tt all the variables used in this study are defined in table 1 at any time during the injection process h is larger at the well than at any other point in the aquifer therefore it is at the injection well that the maximum allowable hydraulic head change h max will first be reached we discuss the estimation procedure for h max in section 2 2 1 the h increases with increasing q and t and the optimal injection rate q max that maximizes injection capacity will be the one for which h h max at the injection well is reached at the end of the injection period i e t t inj orange line in fig 1 any other values of q either q q max or q q max will lead to the non optimal value of the injection capacity q q max will lead to the underutilization and q q max will lead to problems like well overflow and the fracturing of a confining unit this statement for h max at t t inj can be expressed as the following equation 3 h max q max 4 π t e 1 r w 2 s 4 t t inj solving for q max gives 4 q max 4 π t h max e 1 r w 2 s 4 t t inj the injection capacity v max is then given by 5 v max q max t inj 4 π t h max t inj e 1 r w 2 s 4 t t inj the above equation is the basis of the quantitative methodology that enables the aquifer scale mapping of well based injection capacity 2 2 key parameters for injection capacity calculation the equation for an injection capacity of a well eq 5 has five input parameters h max t t inj s and r w in this section we present the estimation procedure for these parameters the estimation procedure varies between unconfined and confined aquifers fig 2a and fig 2b and a workflow chart fig 2c shows various factors that control the five input parameters and how they are combined to determine injection capacity 2 2 1 maximum allowable hydraulic head change maximum allowable hydraulic head change h max is the permissible hydraulic head increase at an injection well such that the head increase does not cause undesirable effects such as ground surface flooding flowing artesian wells or fracturing of confining units the estimation procedure for h max is different between unconfined and confined aquifers fig 2a and fig 2b flooding is a major risk for unconfined aquifers and fracturing of a confining layer is a major risk for confined aquifers in the following we discuss h max calculations for unconfined and confined aquifers separately in unconfined aquifers the major risk associated with injection is waterlogging or flooding near an injection well h max for injection in unconfined aquifers is the difference between the ground surface elevation gse and the initial before the start of injection operation hydraulic head h 0 after factoring in a safety limit sl h max for an unconfined aquifer can be expressed as 6 h max gse sl h 0 the criteria for selecting the value of sl should be specific to the site context for injection wells located in an open field or farmland one should mostly be concerned about the depth equivalent to the soil root zone so that the increase in groundwater level does not cause harm to plants for an open agricultural area with few settlements we propose an sl value of 2 5 m below ground surface which in most cases will exclude the soil root zone fan et al 2016 schenk and jackson 2002 if the injection wells are located near settlements or urbanized locations the value of sl should be selected more conservatively and in accordance with the depth of basements and building foundations which is normally deeper than the soil root zone for this scenario one may use 5 m for sl dudding et al 2006 hodgkin 2004 note that most areas except those very close to an injection well will have headspace significantly larger than sl because hydraulic head decreases rapidly from an injection well in confined aquifers h max is essentially constrained by the fracture pressure of the upper confining layer thus the injection pressure of a well should always be lower than the amount of pressure that the upper confining layer can withstand without generating fractures for aquifer storage purposes the fracture pressure head h fp can be estimated using the thickness and bulk material density of each layer present above an aquifer szulczewski et al 2012 zoback 2007 another important point to consider before calculating h fp is the stress regime in the area szulczewski et al 2012 the calculation procedure varies depending on the stress regime which governs the orientation of least principal stress both study sites have the least principal stress oriented in the horizontal direction levandowski et al 2018 when the least principal stress is oriented in the horizontal direction the expression for the fracture pressure head can be obtained as 7 h fp i 1 n v i 1 v i ρ o i ρ w d i h p i h p i p o ρ w g where n is the number of overlying layers with different bulk density values by incorporating safety factor sf in the calculation we obtain the allowable pressure head h ap above the aquifer top elevation as 8 h ap h fp 1 sf for example if we use a 15 safety factor h ap in the injection well is at 85 of h fp finally the expression for allowable hydraulic head h max in a confined aquifer can be obtained by summing h ap and aquifer top elevation ate 9 h max ate h ap with h max and h 0 h max for a confined aquifer can then be obtained as 10 h max h max h 0 2 2 2 transmissivity transmissivity t is a key hydrogeologic parameter that controls the injection capacity and t estimates can often be obtained from aquifer pumping and specific capacity tests for injection capacity estimations t should ideally be estimated from aquifer pumping tests with a duration equivalent to the target injection duration at target locations however performing such long term tests is expensive and uncommon thus specific capacity test ahmed and de marsily 1987 bradbury and rothschild 1985 richard et al 2016 along with aquifer pumping test are used to estimate t in this study we use the method proposed by bradbury and rothschild 1985 to estimate t from specific capacity tests we use t values obtained from aquifer pumping tests for locations where both pumping and specific capacity test data are available because a long duration test provides a more representative t value compared to a typical specific capacity test richard et al 2016 for the buffalo aquifer we used aquifer pumping test data from 4 locations schoenberg 1998 and specific capacity test data from 76 locations fig 3a for the jordan aquifer we used aquifer pumping test data from 15 locations and specific capacity test data from 593 locations fig 3b to generate a t map one may want to directly interpolate the punctual t values using for example a geostatistical method however t depends both on hydraulic conductivity k and saturated thickness and at the regional scale these two parameters may follow different spatial patterns resulting from different processes hence to generate a t map we first generate a k map geostatistical interpolation of the punctual k values and then we multiply it by a saturated thickness map the saturated thickness is taken equal to the aquifer thickness where the aquifer is confined and to the saturated portion of the aquifer thickness where the aquifer is unconfined from the t map thus obtained we perform a spatial averaging of t over a distance equal to the radius of investigation of the injection operation for each point of the aquifer this averaging process allows the use of relevant effective t values for given operating conditions desbarats 1992 showed that in the case of radial flow to a well a good estimate of the effective t is obtained using a weighted geometric average where the weight is taken equal to the inverse of the squared distance from the well the details of this procedure are given in appendix a the radius of investigation is taken as the distance from the well at which the build up at the end of injection is equal to 1 of the build up at the well bresciani et al 2020 2 2 3 injection duration injection duration refers to the time over which water will be injected for the purpose of asr this will depend on the well efficiency the volume of available water for injection and local asr needs if we assume an ideal condition of continuous well operation without operational failure the maximum t inj becomes a function of source water availability potential sources of available water for injection include surface water reservoir pond lake river etc adjacent aquifers treated wastewater or storm water when the source is rainfall stored in a reservoir lake or pond t inj depends on precipitation as well as surface storage potential when river water is the source t inj may depend on the time during which discharge exceeds the environmental and other agricultural needs thus t inj will be highly variable depending on the site context and objectives 2 2 4 storativity storativity s is another key aquifer parameter that is required for injection capacity estimation unlike transmissivity t storativity cannot be obtained from specific capacity tests furthermore hydraulic head data from observation wells are required for a reliable estimation of storativity because an additional head loss at a pumping well makes it difficult to accurately estimate storativity butler 1990 fetter 2001 thus storativity values are typically much fewer than transmissivity values luckily s generally has a much smaller impact on injection capacity than t shandilya et al 2022 hence the spatial variability of s within a same aquifer formation is not likely to significantly impact the results consequently we opt for simply using the arithmetic mean of four and two s values of confined and unconfined portion respectively of buffalo aquifer this approximation is in accordance with the study by neuman 1982 that showed that s values tend to be normally distributed in an aquifer and that an arithmetic average can be used for practical purposes 2 2 5 well radius well radius refers to the radius of wellbore pipe generally well radius r w is on the order of tens of centimeters and varies depending on the application and site context r w for an injection capacity estimation can be determined based on the radius of operational wells and their respective use in the nearby areas our recent study showed that well radius has little influence on the injection capacity value compared to other parameters shandilya et al 2022 therefore we use a constant value of r w in this study 2 3 mapping procedure in this section we briefly discuss how to compile the database of the parameters and how we combine them to calculate the aquifer scale injection capacity we use the raster maps for spatially variable parameters such as d ate k aquifer thickness etc and constant values for the remaining parameters ν i ρ w etc then we use the raster calculator tool in arcgis to calculate h fp h ap and h max for producing aquifer scale map of h 0 we use the kriging interpolator in arcgis finally raster subtraction of h max and h 0 gives h max similarly we use the kriging interpolator for producing spatial map of k for transmissivity estimation and averaging process we use combination of raster calculator and a geostatistical analyst tool for the rest three parameters t inj s and r w of eq 5 we use constant values details in section 4 3 the injection capacity is calculated with a python script due to the exponential integral function in eq 5 which is not available in the raster calculator tool of arcgis in python this function is available in the scipy package jones et al 2001 after running the python script we obtain a raster file of aquifer scale injection capacity we then process the raster file in arcgis for visual presentation 3 study area description in this section we introduce two study areas where the proposed methodology was applied to produce aquifer scale injection capacity maps we discuss the geographic locations physiography of the study areas and potential needs for asr further we describe the hydrogeologic setting of the target aquifers such as aquifer extent thickness material properties composition and grain size conditions of confinement and genesis 3 1 buffalo aquifer clay county clay county which lies in northwestern minnesota fig 4 is largely an agriculture dominated area with small towns the buffalo aquifer fig 4a has been the most heavily utilized aquifer in this county berg 2018 in addition to withdrawals for rural domestic use and irrigation purposes the aquifer was extensively used by the city of moorhead the largest city in northwest minnesota for municipal water supply berg 2018 until shortages necessitated a switch to using more red river water the current heavy usage and projected population growth in clay county have raised concerns about the long term sustainability of the aquifer and mar may be a potential solution to ensure the sustainability of the buffalo aquifer especially during years of low water flow in the red river the buffalo aquifer is an elongate narrow north south trending aquifer that extends along much of the western part of clay county and south into neighboring wilkin county our study focused on the aquifer within clay county between the red river to the west and a branch of the buffalo river to the east fig 4 the buffalo aquifer is a partially confined sand and gravel aquifer of glacial origin with a well known extent fig b 1 appendix b and the total area of the aquifer in clay county is nearly 100 km2 it ranges in thickness from a few meters at the outer edges to about 60 meters locally along the north south centerline appendix b we used the maps and geographic information system gis coverages in bauer 2014 to provide the geologic characteristics of the buffalo aquifer necessary for the estimation of the injection capacity overall the aquifer is a heterogeneous mixture of material ranging in size from clay to gravel schoenberg 1998 wolf 1981 the aquifer is generally finer grained along its east and west margins than along its north south axis it grades from silty fine to medium grained sand near the axis to very fine grained sand silt and clay along the margins wolf 1981 the coarsest material locally including gravel is generally in the deepest parts of the aquifer along the axis the recharge to the buffalo aquifer may be largely from wilkin county to the south through a large unconfined area wolf 1981 that represents the proglacial fan the aquifer is also locally recharged in clay county through an unconfined portion of the buffalo aquifer and via leakage through the overlying confining unit wolf 1981 for more information on the physiography of clay county and aquifer genesis and its interlayered zonation we refer to jennings et al 2021 where a detailed explanation is provided 3 2 jordan aquifer olmsted count olmsted county is in southeastern minnesota fig 4 it has a gently undulating topography in uplands and is steeper along streams most of the land is used for agriculture with the exception of the city of rochester fig 4b the largest city in the county which houses a large medical campus the mayo clinic the county obtains 100 of its water from groundwater and rochester is the county s largest consumer of water by a large margin the jordan aquifer is the primary source although many wells are also constructed to extract water from other bedrock units delin 1991 runkel 1996 rochester is rapidly growing compared to other metropolitan areas in the midwest and is in fact one of the fastest growing cities in the region because of this rapid growth and the exclusive dependence on groundwater it is important to study the potential of asr in this region for ensuring the long term sustainability of its aquifers especially the heavily used jordan aquifer the jordan aquifer and other bedrock hydrogeological units in olmsted county extend across much of southeastern minnesota runkel et al 2003 steenberg et al 2020 the deeper bedrock geological units in the study area were deposited in early paleozoic time in a shallow sea the bedrock layers most important to this study are the fine to coarse grained jordan sandstone and the overlying prairie du chien group fig b 2 appendix b the prairie du chien group includes two formations the oneota dolomite and the overlying shakopee formation fig b 2 appendix b both consisting largely of dolostone the shakopee and the upper part of oneota dolomite are classified as an aquifer in the region the lower approximately two thirds of the oneota dolomite is an aquitard confining the underlying jordan aquifer we used the maps and related gis coverages in steenberg et al 2020 to provide the geologic characteristics of the jordan aquifer necessary for our injection capacity estimation in olmsted county the jordan aquifer is regarded as having more or less homogeneous hydraulic properties balaban 1988 delin 1991 however substantial variation in municipal well productivity has been recognized and was attributed by runkel 1996 to varying thickness of the coarse clastic sandstone in the aquifer areas where the aquifer has a relatively thick section of coarse clastic sandstone were shown to be more productive than areas where such strata are thinner for detailed information on the jordan aquifer in olmsted county we refer to jennings et al 2021 4 results and discussion in this section we apply the proposed methodology to produce aquifer scale h max section 4 1 and t section 4 2 maps for both study sites we then discuss the other three parameters t inj s and r w in section 4 3 and combine them with h max and t maps to produce injection capacity maps in section 4 4 we discuss the relative importance of the input parameters in determining the obtained injection capacity maps and explain what caused high or low injection capacity regions we then estimate the required number of wells to inject the volume of water equal to one month of domestic water demand finally we discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology in section 4 5 4 1 maximum allowable hydraulic head change in this subsection we present the results of h max maps for both sites all the supplementary information related to the generation of h max is given in appendix c h max map of confined portion of buffalo aquifer fig 5a shows that values are high in the northern portion and along the west and east margins because of larger h fp fig c 1 appendix c the larger overburden thickness and lower groundwater elevation fig c 2 appendix c leads to a large headspace for injection low h max values are mostly from the confined unconfined transition zone areas of the aquifer where h max values are comparatively lower due to the low values of h fp in the southern portion h max is comparatively low even though h max is high because the groundwater elevation is relatively high overall h max is small 2 5 m in the majority of the confined portion the mean value of h max are 4 22 m and the coefficient of variation standard deviation over mean is 0 4 table 2 for h max calculation of the unconfined portion of buffalo aquifer we use 2 5 m as a safety limit to avoid saturating the soil root zone overall h max is small fig 5b indicating that the groundwater elevation is close to the land surface we confirm that the groundwater elevation is in general close to the land surface by plotting the depth to static groundwater map fig c 3 appendix c in the southern part of the unconfined aquifer h max is small because the groundwater elevation is close to the land surface in the middle part h max is also marginal and may not be considered an ideal location for injection in the north part moderate values of h max are obtained where 2 3 m of headspace can be used for injection due to the greater depth to the groundwater table 3 5 m the mean h max value is 1 0 m and the standard deviation is 1 03 m table 2 for the jordan aquifer in olmsted county h max is also calculated at 85 of h fp and we only present key results and refer to appendix c fig c 4 and fig c 5 for detailed information the obtained h max map shows that more than 75 m of head change is allowed in about half of the county the mean value of h max is 77 8 m and the coefficient of variation is 0 38 table 2 the regions corresponding to h max 75 m mostly match those where overburden thickness is large 150 m fig 6a and fig 6b most of the remainder of the county has h max between 25 75 m regions with h max 25 m are in the vicinity of river channels throughout olmsted county a close correlation exists between the overburden thickness and h max maps fig 6 this implies that the variability in h max is largely controlled by the overburden thickness and the variability of groundwater level is relatively small 4 2 transmissivity here we present and discuss transmissivity t maps of both sites note that because the buffalo aquifer has unconfined as well as confined portions we used the two different criteria for estimating t as outlined in section 2 2 2 the t map shows a high variability across the aquifer fig 7 the coefficient of variation of t for the confined portion is 2 08 table 2 indicating that the standard deviation is more than twice the mean t in the northern portion of the aquifer the variability in t is comparatively larger in both confined and unconfined aquifers due to larger variability in both k fig d 1 appendix d and thickness fig d 2 appendix d in the southern portion variability is comparatively smaller smaller variation in aquifer thickness and saturated thickness may be one of the possible reasons however the lower variability in t in the southern portion is also likely due to the low data density of k lower values 100 m2 d are mostly from the west and east margins whereas higher values 3000 m2 d are mostly along the north south axis the unconfined parts of the aquifer mostly show moderate to high t values because the saturated thickness is relatively large and aquifer materials are coarse grained the t map fig 8 of the jordan aquifer in olmsted county is mainly controlled by the variation in k of the aquifer more detailed information regarding k and aquifer thickness maps can be found in appendix d in the majority of olmsted county the jordan aquifer thickness is approximately 30 m 100 feet fig d 3 appendix d thus the aquifer thickness contributes little to the t variability t varies approximately by one order of magnitude with the coefficient of variation of 0 13 table 2 which is significantly smaller than the buffalo aquifer in the majority of the county the t values are between 60 and 150 m2 d 4 3 injection duration storativity and well radius in this subsection we discuss the other three input parameters t inj s and r w for this study we select one month of t inj for both sites the reason behind selecting this injection duration for both areas is that source water will be available for injection in both sites at least for one month for the buffalo aquifer we treated the s values of confined and unconfined portions separately the arithmetic average of s values from four locations of the confined portion of the buffalo aquifer is 0 003 whereas the unconfined portion has the arithmetic average of 0 17 from two locations for olmsted county we use the model calibrated s value of 1 10 4 from christianson 2018 wells used for specific capacity tests in both areas have r w in the range of 5 50 cm for asr study purposes r w in the range of 10 20 cm is reported from australia and usa dudding et al 2006 gibson et al 2018 we use a constant r w value of 15 cm for both study areas 4 4 injection capacity we produced injection capacity maps fig 9 using the five input parameters presented in the previous subsections the estimated injection capacity values vary over a wide range in the buffalo aquifer fig 9a the variation in the injection capacity is due to the variability in both t and h max values across the aquifer the h max values vary significantly across the aquifer ranging from negligible up to 13 m the overall injection capacity map is largely dominated by the t map because the variability of t values are larger compared to h max values we observe negligible injection capacity values in the southernmost and westernmost portions of the aquifer the h max values are negligible due to the shallow groundwater depths in the southernmost portion and t values are very small along the westernmost portion higher injection capacity is present mostly in the central region of the northern area where t is large and h max is in the mid range the area with the highest injection capacity value is where t is highest there is also significant spatial variability in the injection capacity for the jordan aquifer in olmsted county fig 9b a comparison with the h max map fig 6b shows that the estimated injection capacity values across most of olmsted county are controlled by the h max which is controlled by the overburden thickness fig 6a this is because the variability of h max is much larger than the t variability at this site areas near the zumbro river in the north the whitewater river in the east and the root river in the south show lower injection capacity the lower h max in these areas cause the lower injection capacity in the south and southwest parts of the county injection capacity is higher these are the regions where the aquifer has higher h max and mid range t overall we observe large areas of the county having mid range injection capacity values whereas lower injection capacity is only from localized areas in the north and east the injection capacity of the two study areas show different characteristics first the injection capacity of the buffalo aquifer has a larger variability as compared to the jordan aquifer table 2 both t and h max vary widely in the buffalo aquifer but t is relatively homogeneous in the jordan aquifer the 99 th percentile value of injection capacity is significantly higher in both confined and unconfined portions of the buffalo aquifer than in the jordan aquifer whereas the 90 th percentile value of injection capacity in the confined portion of the buffalo aquifer is lower than in the jordan aquifer this indicates that some local areas in the buffalo aquifer have very high injection capacity which is due to high t a comparison of the median injection capacity values between the two study sites shows that the median value of the buffalo aquifer is an order of magnitude smaller even though the maximum injection capacity value of the buffalo aquifer is significantly higher than that of the jordan aquifer this is due to the large overburden thickness in the jordan aquifer and significant variability in both t and h max in the buffalo aquifer in the confined portion of the buffalo aquifer the median value is close to 2 9 of the 99 th percentile value which indicates that most of the area has injection capacity values significantly smaller than the 99 th percentile value we now discuss the relevance of the estimated injection capacity values for serving the moorhead and rochester populations to determine whether the estimated injection capacity values are sufficient to meet the domestic water use of these cities we conduct a simple calculation based on the total population of the respective cities per capita domestic water use total domestic water use for one month and 90 th percentile value of injection capacity table 3 in table 3 we present the calculations with the 90 th percentile value of injection capacity at both sites and the calculations indicate that two wells and four wells are needed to inject the amount of water equivalent to one month of domestic water needs for the cities of moorhead and rochester respectively if we target areas with higher injection capacity values fewer wells may be required note that we did not consider well interference between injection wells closely spaced wells may result in reduced injection capacity due to well interference and thus more wells may be required to store the target volume another aspect to consider is the risk of causing flowing well conditions near an injection well where the hydraulic head is higher than the ground level for confined aquifers h max may cause flowing well conditions in the wells that are close to the injection well to avoid any risk of flowing well conditions h max could be set to the ground level however this may be too conservative choice and may lead to a significant reduction in injection capacity instead injection wells could be located at a sufficient distance from existing wells to avoid this potential problem to check the required distance we produced a hydraulic head profile at a point in the buffalo aquifer with 99 th percentile value of injection capacity a plot of the head profile at the end of the injection displays a sharp decline in the hydraulic head as the distance increases from the injection well fig 10 the plot indicates that any well located more than a few meters away from the injection well will not experience flowing well conditions 4 5 advantages and limitations of the proposed method the methodology proposed in this study has significant advantages over qualitative asr site suitability estimation methods most importantly it enables a quantitative physically based estimation of injection capacity at aquifer scale this is the first study that proposes a continuous aquifer scale mapping methodology for both unconfined and confined aquifers the produced injection capacity map enables one not only to select the optimal injection well locations but also to estimate the actual amount of water that could be injected in one month this is another important advantage over studies such as dudding et al 2006 where only categorization of the aquifer as zones of a low medium or high injection potential is done while being physically based the methodology remains simple thus enabling efficient first order estimation of injection capacity additionally in case of change in any parameter value e g different injection duration one can easily reevaluate the injection capacity and efficiently produce an updated aquifer scale injection capacity map however high quality and high spatial density of key parameters such as transmissivity overburden thickness and groundwater elevation are important for an accurate estimation of injection capacity therefore the methodology is best suited for areas where good background information is available the method is based on the theis solution so the proposed method inherits the assumptions of the theis solution mentioned in section 2 1 heterogeneity in aquifer properties may cause noticeable differences in the injection capacity however the averaging process outlined in section 2 2 2 should largely alleviate this issue the applicability of an equation established for a confined aquifer to an unconfined aquifer depends on the ratio of change in saturated thickness to initial saturated thickness bear 1979 therefore as long as h max is small relative to the initial saturated thickness of an unconfined aquifer this methodology can be safely applied to an unconfined aquifer otherwise non negligible errors may be introduced if inter aquifer leakage partial penetration or boundary effects are significant one may need to extend the methodology by using drawdown solutions that consider these effects the development of a skin layer may cause a significant reduction in injection capacity with the aging of wells but well redevelopment measures applied at regular intervals can minimize this effect barrash et al 2006 houben 2015 thus it is not an intrinsic aquifer property and so one may not consider it when evaluating potential sites wellbore storage is only significant for large diameter wells with short pumping times papadopulos and cooper 1967 and thus it only needs to be considered when the injection duration is very short 5 conclusions in this study we developed a new gis based methodology that produces injection capacity maps and demonstrated it by using minnesota s extensive hydrogeologic database for the necessary parameters we successfully produced injection capacity maps for two aquifers in minnesota the buffalo aquifer in clay county and the jordan aquifer in olmsted county the results reveal that the selected study areas have large spatial variabilities in the injection capacity this demonstrates the relevance of producing such maps to guide the siting of injection locations the buffalo aquifer shows higher variability in the injection capacity than the jordan aquifer which is mainly caused by its larger variability in t in contrast the injection capacity of the jordan aquifer is governed by the variability of h max these two case studies show that the variability of injection capacity can be governed by both t and h max which are part of the hydrogeologic setting of a site the importance of t and h max for injection capacity estimation emphasizes the need for high quality k aquifer thickness overburden thickness and groundwater elevation maps the mapping methodology is based on the theis solution which relies on various assumptions thus when applying the methodology one should be aware of the potential limitations as discussed in section 4 5 for example to minimize the effect of aquifer heterogeneity k values should ideally be estimated from aquifer pumping tests with a duration close to the target injection duration or one could perform an averaging procedure as discussed in section 2 2 2 considering that no aquitard is perfectly impermeable an important extension of the proposed methodology would be to account for leakage through a confining unit the produced injection capacity maps suggest that the volume of water equivalent to the domestic water use for one month can be injected in both study areas using two and four wells respectively with an injection duration of one month locally higher injection capacities may be found in which case the number of required wells could be reduced although more detailed studies are needed to confirm these findings our study suggests that the hydrogeologic conditions of the buffalo aquifer and the jordan aquifers are suitable for the development of asr projects for domestic use this study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed methodology that enables a first order quantification of well based injection capacity by combining with a socio economic evaluation

8053,study region two areas in minnesota usa buffalo aquifer in clay county and jordan aquifer in olmsted county there are concerns about the long term sustainability of groundwater resources in the two aquifers study focus aquifer storage and recovery is an important tool for water resources management in various geographic and socio economic contexts however practical guidelines regarding the assessment of injection capacity remain limited in this study we present a quantitative methodology which is based on the theis solution the methodology allows an efficient estimation of well based injection capacity and generation of an aquifer scale injection capacity map we present a detailed workflow for applying the methodology and demonstrate its application to the two study areas the tool developed in this study can be easily applied to other areas new hydrological insights for the region the two study areas show significant spatial variability in injection capacity in the buffalo aquifer the variability is mainly controlled by transmissivity whereas in the jordan aquifer it is mainly controlled by maximum allowable hydraulic head change assuming an injection duration of one month and considering the 90 percentile value of the injection capacity at each site we found that two and four wells are required to inject the volume of water equivalent to one month of domestic water requirements for the cities of moorhead and rochester respectively graphical abstract ga1 keywords aquifer storage and recovery injection capacity mapping water security minnesota 1 introduction

complicates the management of groundwater due to its uncertain impacts on water resources collins et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 wu et al 2020 in the midst of these challenges various water management practices have been proposed and employed across the globe to increase the sustainability of water resources kim et al 2017 onderka et al 2020 rockström and falkenmark 2015 however many of these efforts are focused on the construction of dams and reservoirs for increasing surface water storage which requires large financial costs cause significant water losses by evaporation and have significant sociological and ecological impacts alazard et al 2015 craig et al 2005 mailhot et al 2018 mumba and thompson 2005 among alternative water management practices managed aquifer recharge mar which involves the purposeful recharge of water to aquifers has gained increased interest globally dillon et al 2019 mar is the umbrella term for several techniques such as aquifer storage and recovery asr pond infiltration bank filtration and rainwater harvesting dillon 2005 in the asr method water is injected into an aquifer through well s at the time of availability and recovered from the same well s when there is an increase in water demand pyne 2005 asr has various advantages such as reduction in evaporation losses land requirements and costs as compared to traditional surface storage structures bouwer 2002 khan et al 2008 maliva et al 2006 asr is highly adaptable and applicable because water can be secured at target locations by constructing and managing wells and many successful asr implementations have been reported across the world bloetscher et al 2014 dillon et al 2019 kang et al 2019 stefan and ansems 2018 zuurbier et al 2014 for successful implementation of an asr project one needs to assess the suitability of potential asr sites a site suitability study should address both the injection capacity which is the maximum volume of water that can be injected and recovery efficiency which is the recovery percentage of the injected water of these two aspects the estimation of injection capacity should be the first step because the ability to inject a sufficient volume of water is required a priori to ensure a sufficient recoverable volume this step is the focus of this paper the most common practice for site suitability assessment has been the development of site suitability index maps using multicriteria decision analysis mcda brown et al 2005 russo et al 2015 smith et al 2017 mcda involves evaluating and combining various surface subsurface and operational parameters a rank is assigned to each parameter value based on a qualitative assessment and a weight is given to each parameter both the ranking and weighting of the parameters are subjective and thus there can be large variations in final results sallwey et al 2019 as a result the index maps produced with this type of approach are only qualitative and their reliability can be variable despite the critical importance only a few studies investigated the injection capacity of potential asr sites based on a quantitative assessment dudding et al 2006 gibson et al 2018 hodgkin 2004 neumann 2012 to our knowledge there has been only one peer reviewed article on this topic gibson et al 2018 however the work by gibson et al 2018 does not allow continuous aquifer scale mapping of injection capacity and confined and unconfined aquifers are not distinguished in their methodology further we currently lack a systematic workflow for estimating well based injection capacity and have a limited understanding of how various hydrogeological and operational parameters affect injection capacity this study bridges these knowledge gaps by providing and applying a comprehensive workflow that efficiently produces continuous aquifer scale injection capacity map the main objectives of this study are 1 to propose a quantitative methodology that enables the aquifer scale mapping of well based injection capacity for both confined and unconfined aquifers 2 to present the estimation procedure of input parameters that are required for injection capacity calculation 3 to demonstrate the methodology by applying it two aquifers in minnesota usa and producing aquifer scale injection capacity maps we also discuss the estimated injection capacity values with regard to the water demand of the studied area in section 2 we present the methodology for estimating well based injection capacity and comprehensively discuss the estimation procedure of five key input parameters in section 3 we introduce the two study areas and discuss their physical settings and hydrogeology in section 4 we present the results of the methodology applied to these areas we then analyze the significance of estimated injection capacity values in terms of domestic water requirements and discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology finally we provide conclusions in section 5 2 methodology for aquifer scale mapping of well based injection capacity 2 1 overview in this study we define injection capacity as the maximum volume of water that can be injected into an aquifer using a well pumped at a constant rate for given operational parameters i e injection duration and well radius under the constraint of a maximum allowable hydraulic head change to estimate injection capacity we need to determine the optimal injection rate that maximizes the injection capacity of a well over an injection duration we start with the theis 1935 solution which is valid for homogeneous and non leaky confined aquifers of infinite extent constant rate injection fully penetrating well negligible skin layer and negligible wellbore storage under these simplifying assumptions of theis 1935 the hydraulic head change at a point in space and time is given as 1 h r t q 4 π t e 1 r 2 s 4 tt where e 1 is the exponential integral function also known as well function defined by 2 e 1 u u e x x dx where u r 2 s 4 tt all the variables used in this study are defined in table 1 at any time during the injection process h is larger at the well than at any other point in the aquifer therefore it is at the injection well that the maximum allowable hydraulic head change h max will first be reached we discuss the estimation procedure for h max in section 2 2 1 the h increases with increasing q and t and the optimal injection rate q max that maximizes injection capacity will be the one for which h h max at the injection well is reached at the end of the injection period i e t t inj orange line in fig 1 any other values of q either q q max or q q max will lead to the non optimal value of the injection capacity q q max will lead to the underutilization and q q max will lead to problems like well overflow and the fracturing of a confining unit this statement for h max at t t inj can be expressed as the following equation 3 h max q max 4 π t e 1 r w 2 s 4 t t inj solving for q max gives 4 q max 4 π t h max e 1 r w 2 s 4 t t inj the injection capacity v max is then given by 5 v max q max t inj 4 π t h max t inj e 1 r w 2 s 4 t t inj the above equation is the basis of the quantitative methodology that enables the aquifer scale mapping of well based injection capacity 2 2 key parameters for injection capacity calculation the equation for an injection capacity of a well eq 5 has five input parameters h max t t inj s and r w in this section we present the estimation procedure for these parameters the estimation procedure varies between unconfined and confined aquifers fig 2a and fig 2b and a workflow chart fig 2c shows various factors that control the five input parameters and how they are combined to determine injection capacity 2 2 1 maximum allowable hydraulic head change maximum allowable hydraulic head change h max is the permissible hydraulic head increase at an injection well such that the head increase does not cause undesirable effects such as ground surface flooding flowing artesian wells or fracturing of confining units the estimation procedure for h max is different between unconfined and confined aquifers fig 2a and fig 2b flooding is a major risk for unconfined aquifers and fracturing of a confining layer is a major risk for confined aquifers in the following we discuss h max calculations for unconfined and confined aquifers separately in unconfined aquifers the major risk associated with injection is waterlogging or flooding near an injection well h max for injection in unconfined aquifers is the difference between the ground surface elevation gse and the initial before the start of injection operation hydraulic head h 0 after factoring in a safety limit sl h max for an unconfined aquifer can be expressed as 6 h max gse sl h 0 the criteria for selecting the value of sl should be specific to the site context for injection wells located in an open field or farmland one should mostly be concerned about the depth equivalent to the soil root zone so that the increase in groundwater level does not cause harm to plants for an open agricultural area with few settlements we propose an sl value of 2 5 m below ground surface which in most cases will exclude the soil root zone fan et al 2016 schenk and jackson 2002 if the injection wells are located near settlements or urbanized locations the value of sl should be selected more conservatively and in accordance with the depth of basements and building foundations which is normally deeper than the soil root zone for this scenario one may use 5 m for sl dudding et al 2006 hodgkin 2004 note that most areas except those very close to an injection well will have headspace significantly larger than sl because hydraulic head decreases rapidly from an injection well in confined aquifers h max is essentially constrained by the fracture pressure of the upper confining layer thus the injection pressure of a well should always be lower than the amount of pressure that the upper confining layer can withstand without generating fractures for aquifer storage purposes the fracture pressure head h fp can be estimated using the thickness and bulk material density of each layer present above an aquifer szulczewski et al 2012 zoback 2007 another important point to consider before calculating h fp is the stress regime in the area szulczewski et al 2012 the calculation procedure varies depending on the stress regime which governs the orientation of least principal stress both study sites have the least principal stress oriented in the horizontal direction levandowski et al 2018 when the least principal stress is oriented in the horizontal direction the expression for the fracture pressure head can be obtained as 7 h fp i 1 n v i 1 v i ρ o i ρ w d i h p i h p i p o ρ w g where n is the number of overlying layers with different bulk density values by incorporating safety factor sf in the calculation we obtain the allowable pressure head h ap above the aquifer top elevation as 8 h ap h fp 1 sf for example if we use a 15 safety factor h ap in the injection well is at 85 of h fp finally the expression for allowable hydraulic head h max in a confined aquifer can be obtained by summing h ap and aquifer top elevation ate 9 h max ate h ap with h max and h 0 h max for a confined aquifer can then be obtained as 10 h max h max h 0 2 2 2 transmissivity transmissivity t is a key hydrogeologic parameter that controls the injection capacity and t estimates can often be obtained from aquifer pumping and specific capacity tests for injection capacity estimations t should ideally be estimated from aquifer pumping tests with a duration equivalent to the target injection duration at target locations however performing such long term tests is expensive and uncommon thus specific capacity test ahmed and de marsily 1987 bradbury and rothschild 1985 richard et al 2016 along with aquifer pumping test are used to estimate t in this study we use the method proposed by bradbury and rothschild 1985 to estimate t from specific capacity tests we use t values obtained from aquifer pumping tests for locations where both pumping and specific capacity test data are available because a long duration test provides a more representative t value compared to a typical specific capacity test richard et al 2016 for the buffalo aquifer we used aquifer pumping test data from 4 locations schoenberg 1998 and specific capacity test data from 76 locations fig 3a for the jordan aquifer we used aquifer pumping test data from 15 locations and specific capacity test data from 593 locations fig 3b to generate a t map one may want to directly interpolate the punctual t values using for example a geostatistical method however t depends both on hydraulic conductivity k and saturated thickness and at the regional scale these two parameters may follow different spatial patterns resulting from different processes hence to generate a t map we first generate a k map geostatistical interpolation of the punctual k values and then we multiply it by a saturated thickness map the saturated thickness is taken equal to the aquifer thickness where the aquifer is confined and to the saturated portion of the aquifer thickness where the aquifer is unconfined from the t map thus obtained we perform a spatial averaging of t over a distance equal to the radius of investigation of the injection operation for each point of the aquifer this averaging process allows the use of relevant effective t values for given operating conditions desbarats 1992 showed that in the case of radial flow to a well a good estimate of the effective t is obtained using a weighted geometric average where the weight is taken equal to the inverse of the squared distance from the well the details of this procedure are given in appendix a the radius of investigation is taken as the distance from the well at which the build up at the end of injection is equal to 1 of the build up at the well bresciani et al 2020 2 2 3 injection duration injection duration refers to the time over which water will be injected for the purpose of asr this will depend on the well efficiency the volume of available water for injection and local asr needs if we assume an ideal condition of continuous well operation without operational failure the maximum t inj becomes a function of source water availability potential sources of available water for injection include surface water reservoir pond lake river etc adjacent aquifers treated wastewater or storm water when the source is rainfall stored in a reservoir lake or pond t inj depends on precipitation as well as surface storage potential when river water is the source t inj may depend on the time during which discharge exceeds the environmental and other agricultural needs thus t inj will be highly variable depending on the site context and objectives 2 2 4 storativity storativity s is another key aquifer parameter that is required for injection capacity estimation unlike transmissivity t storativity cannot be obtained from specific capacity tests furthermore hydraulic head data from observation wells are required for a reliable estimation of storativity because an additional head loss at a pumping well makes it difficult to accurately estimate storativity butler 1990 fetter 2001 thus storativity values are typically much fewer than transmissivity values luckily s generally has a much smaller impact on injection capacity than t shandilya et al 2022 hence the spatial variability of s within a same aquifer formation is not likely to significantly impact the results consequently we opt for simply using the arithmetic mean of four and two s values of confined and unconfined portion respectively of buffalo aquifer this approximation is in accordance with the study by neuman 1982 that showed that s values tend to be normally distributed in an aquifer and that an arithmetic average can be used for practical purposes 2 2 5 well radius well radius refers to the radius of wellbore pipe generally well radius r w is on the order of tens of centimeters and varies depending on the application and site context r w for an injection capacity estimation can be determined based on the radius of operational wells and their respective use in the nearby areas our recent study showed that well radius has little influence on the injection capacity value compared to other parameters shandilya et al 2022 therefore we use a constant value of r w in this study 2 3 mapping procedure in this section we briefly discuss how to compile the database of the parameters and how we combine them to calculate the aquifer scale injection capacity we use the raster maps for spatially variable parameters such as d ate k aquifer thickness etc and constant values for the remaining parameters ν i ρ w etc then we use the raster calculator tool in arcgis to calculate h fp h ap and h max for producing aquifer scale map of h 0 we use the kriging interpolator in arcgis finally raster subtraction of h max and h 0 gives h max similarly we use the kriging interpolator for producing spatial map of k for transmissivity estimation and averaging process we use combination of raster calculator and a geostatistical analyst tool for the rest three parameters t inj s and r w of eq 5 we use constant values details in section 4 3 the injection capacity is calculated with a python script due to the exponential integral function in eq 5 which is not available in the raster calculator tool of arcgis in python this function is available in the scipy package jones et al 2001 after running the python script we obtain a raster file of aquifer scale injection capacity we then process the raster file in arcgis for visual presentation 3 study area description in this section we introduce two study areas where the proposed methodology was applied to produce aquifer scale injection capacity maps we discuss the geographic locations physiography of the study areas and potential needs for asr further we describe the hydrogeologic setting of the target aquifers such as aquifer extent thickness material properties composition and grain size conditions of confinement and genesis 3 1 buffalo aquifer clay county clay county which lies in northwestern minnesota fig 4 is largely an agriculture dominated area with small towns the buffalo aquifer fig 4a has been the most heavily utilized aquifer in this county berg 2018 in addition to withdrawals for rural domestic use and irrigation purposes the aquifer was extensively used by the city of moorhead the largest city in northwest minnesota for municipal water supply berg 2018 until shortages necessitated a switch to using more red river water the current heavy usage and projected population growth in clay county have raised concerns about the long term sustainability of the aquifer and mar may be a potential solution to ensure the sustainability of the buffalo aquifer especially during years of low water flow in the red river the buffalo aquifer is an elongate narrow north south trending aquifer that extends along much of the western part of clay county and south into neighboring wilkin county our study focused on the aquifer within clay county between the red river to the west and a branch of the buffalo river to the east fig 4 the buffalo aquifer is a partially confined sand and gravel aquifer of glacial origin with a well known extent fig b 1 appendix b and the total area of the aquifer in clay county is nearly 100 km2 it ranges in thickness from a few meters at the outer edges to about 60 meters locally along the north south centerline appendix b we used the maps and geographic information system gis coverages in bauer 2014 to provide the geologic characteristics of the buffalo aquifer necessary for the estimation of the injection capacity overall the aquifer is a heterogeneous mixture of material ranging in size from clay to gravel schoenberg 1998 wolf 1981 the aquifer is generally finer grained along its east and west margins than along its north south axis it grades from silty fine to medium grained sand near the axis to very fine grained sand silt and clay along the margins wolf 1981 the coarsest material locally including gravel is generally in the deepest parts of the aquifer along the axis the recharge to the buffalo aquifer may be largely from wilkin county to the south through a large unconfined area wolf 1981 that represents the proglacial fan the aquifer is also locally recharged in clay county through an unconfined portion of the buffalo aquifer and via leakage through the overlying confining unit wolf 1981 for more information on the physiography of clay county and aquifer genesis and its interlayered zonation we refer to jennings et al 2021 where a detailed explanation is provided 3 2 jordan aquifer olmsted count olmsted county is in southeastern minnesota fig 4 it has a gently undulating topography in uplands and is steeper along streams most of the land is used for agriculture with the exception of the city of rochester fig 4b the largest city in the county which houses a large medical campus the mayo clinic the county obtains 100 of its water from groundwater and rochester is the county s largest consumer of water by a large margin the jordan aquifer is the primary source although many wells are also constructed to extract water from other bedrock units delin 1991 runkel 1996 rochester is rapidly growing compared to other metropolitan areas in the midwest and is in fact one of the fastest growing cities in the region because of this rapid growth and the exclusive dependence on groundwater it is important to study the potential of asr in this region for ensuring the long term sustainability of its aquifers especially the heavily used jordan aquifer the jordan aquifer and other bedrock hydrogeological units in olmsted county extend across much of southeastern minnesota runkel et al 2003 steenberg et al 2020 the deeper bedrock geological units in the study area were deposited in early paleozoic time in a shallow sea the bedrock layers most important to this study are the fine to coarse grained jordan sandstone and the overlying prairie du chien group fig b 2 appendix b the prairie du chien group includes two formations the oneota dolomite and the overlying shakopee formation fig b 2 appendix b both consisting largely of dolostone the shakopee and the upper part of oneota dolomite are classified as an aquifer in the region the lower approximately two thirds of the oneota dolomite is an aquitard confining the underlying jordan aquifer we used the maps and related gis coverages in steenberg et al 2020 to provide the geologic characteristics of the jordan aquifer necessary for our injection capacity estimation in olmsted county the jordan aquifer is regarded as having more or less homogeneous hydraulic properties balaban 1988 delin 1991 however substantial variation in municipal well productivity has been recognized and was attributed by runkel 1996 to varying thickness of the coarse clastic sandstone in the aquifer areas where the aquifer has a relatively thick section of coarse clastic sandstone were shown to be more productive than areas where such strata are thinner for detailed information on the jordan aquifer in olmsted county we refer to jennings et al 2021 4 results and discussion in this section we apply the proposed methodology to produce aquifer scale h max section 4 1 and t section 4 2 maps for both study sites we then discuss the other three parameters t inj s and r w in section 4 3 and combine them with h max and t maps to produce injection capacity maps in section 4 4 we discuss the relative importance of the input parameters in determining the obtained injection capacity maps and explain what caused high or low injection capacity regions we then estimate the required number of wells to inject the volume of water equal to one month of domestic water demand finally we discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology in section 4 5 4 1 maximum allowable hydraulic head change in this subsection we present the results of h max maps for both sites all the supplementary information related to the generation of h max is given in appendix c h max map of confined portion of buffalo aquifer fig 5a shows that values are high in the northern portion and along the west and east margins because of larger h fp fig c 1 appendix c the larger overburden thickness and lower groundwater elevation fig c 2 appendix c leads to a large headspace for injection low h max values are mostly from the confined unconfined transition zone areas of the aquifer where h max values are comparatively lower due to the low values of h fp in the southern portion h max is comparatively low even though h max is high because the groundwater elevation is relatively high overall h max is small 2 5 m in the majority of the confined portion the mean value of h max are 4 22 m and the coefficient of variation standard deviation over mean is 0 4 table 2 for h max calculation of the unconfined portion of buffalo aquifer we use 2 5 m as a safety limit to avoid saturating the soil root zone overall h max is small fig 5b indicating that the groundwater elevation is close to the land surface we confirm that the groundwater elevation is in general close to the land surface by plotting the depth to static groundwater map fig c 3 appendix c in the southern part of the unconfined aquifer h max is small because the groundwater elevation is close to the land surface in the middle part h max is also marginal and may not be considered an ideal location for injection in the north part moderate values of h max are obtained where 2 3 m of headspace can be used for injection due to the greater depth to the groundwater table 3 5 m the mean h max value is 1 0 m and the standard deviation is 1 03 m table 2 for the jordan aquifer in olmsted county h max is also calculated at 85 of h fp and we only present key results and refer to appendix c fig c 4 and fig c 5 for detailed information the obtained h max map shows that more than 75 m of head change is allowed in about half of the county the mean value of h max is 77 8 m and the coefficient of variation is 0 38 table 2 the regions corresponding to h max 75 m mostly match those where overburden thickness is large 150 m fig 6a and fig 6b most of the remainder of the county has h max between 25 75 m regions with h max 25 m are in the vicinity of river channels throughout olmsted county a close correlation exists between the overburden thickness and h max maps fig 6 this implies that the variability in h max is largely controlled by the overburden thickness and the variability of groundwater level is relatively small 4 2 transmissivity here we present and discuss transmissivity t maps of both sites note that because the buffalo aquifer has unconfined as well as confined portions we used the two different criteria for estimating t as outlined in section 2 2 2 the t map shows a high variability across the aquifer fig 7 the coefficient of variation of t for the confined portion is 2 08 table 2 indicating that the standard deviation is more than twice the mean t in the northern portion of the aquifer the variability in t is comparatively larger in both confined and unconfined aquifers due to larger variability in both k fig d 1 appendix d and thickness fig d 2 appendix d in the southern portion variability is comparatively smaller smaller variation in aquifer thickness and saturated thickness may be one of the possible reasons however the lower variability in t in the southern portion is also likely due to the low data density of k lower values 100 m2 d are mostly from the west and east margins whereas higher values 3000 m2 d are mostly along the north south axis the unconfined parts of the aquifer mostly show moderate to high t values because the saturated thickness is relatively large and aquifer materials are coarse grained the t map fig 8 of the jordan aquifer in olmsted county is mainly controlled by the variation in k of the aquifer more detailed information regarding k and aquifer thickness maps can be found in appendix d in the majority of olmsted county the jordan aquifer thickness is approximately 30 m 100 feet fig d 3 appendix d thus the aquifer thickness contributes little to the t variability t varies approximately by one order of magnitude with the coefficient of variation of 0 13 table 2 which is significantly smaller than the buffalo aquifer in the majority of the county the t values are between 60 and 150 m2 d 4 3 injection duration storativity and well radius in this subsection we discuss the other three input parameters t inj s and r w for this study we select one month of t inj for both sites the reason behind selecting this injection duration for both areas is that source water will be available for injection in both sites at least for one month for the buffalo aquifer we treated the s values of confined and unconfined portions separately the arithmetic average of s values from four locations of the confined portion of the buffalo aquifer is 0 003 whereas the unconfined portion has the arithmetic average of 0 17 from two locations for olmsted county we use the model calibrated s value of 1 10 4 from christianson 2018 wells used for specific capacity tests in both areas have r w in the range of 5 50 cm for asr study purposes r w in the range of 10 20 cm is reported from australia and usa dudding et al 2006 gibson et al 2018 we use a constant r w value of 15 cm for both study areas 4 4 injection capacity we produced injection capacity maps fig 9 using the five input parameters presented in the previous subsections the estimated injection capacity values vary over a wide range in the buffalo aquifer fig 9a the variation in the injection capacity is due to the variability in both t and h max values across the aquifer the h max values vary significantly across the aquifer ranging from negligible up to 13 m the overall injection capacity map is largely dominated by the t map because the variability of t values are larger compared to h max values we observe negligible injection capacity values in the southernmost and westernmost portions of the aquifer the h max values are negligible due to the shallow groundwater depths in the southernmost portion and t values are very small along the westernmost portion higher injection capacity is present mostly in the central region of the northern area where t is large and h max is in the mid range the area with the highest injection capacity value is where t is highest there is also significant spatial variability in the injection capacity for the jordan aquifer in olmsted county fig 9b a comparison with the h max map fig 6b shows that the estimated injection capacity values across most of olmsted county are controlled by the h max which is controlled by the overburden thickness fig 6a this is because the variability of h max is much larger than the t variability at this site areas near the zumbro river in the north the whitewater river in the east and the root river in the south show lower injection capacity the lower h max in these areas cause the lower injection capacity in the south and southwest parts of the county injection capacity is higher these are the regions where the aquifer has higher h max and mid range t overall we observe large areas of the county having mid range injection capacity values whereas lower injection capacity is only from localized areas in the north and east the injection capacity of the two study areas show different characteristics first the injection capacity of the buffalo aquifer has a larger variability as compared to the jordan aquifer table 2 both t and h max vary widely in the buffalo aquifer but t is relatively homogeneous in the jordan aquifer the 99 th percentile value of injection capacity is significantly higher in both confined and unconfined portions of the buffalo aquifer than in the jordan aquifer whereas the 90 th percentile value of injection capacity in the confined portion of the buffalo aquifer is lower than in the jordan aquifer this indicates that some local areas in the buffalo aquifer have very high injection capacity which is due to high t a comparison of the median injection capacity values between the two study sites shows that the median value of the buffalo aquifer is an order of magnitude smaller even though the maximum injection capacity value of the buffalo aquifer is significantly higher than that of the jordan aquifer this is due to the large overburden thickness in the jordan aquifer and significant variability in both t and h max in the buffalo aquifer in the confined portion of the buffalo aquifer the median value is close to 2 9 of the 99 th percentile value which indicates that most of the area has injection capacity values significantly smaller than the 99 th percentile value we now discuss the relevance of the estimated injection capacity values for serving the moorhead and rochester populations to determine whether the estimated injection capacity values are sufficient to meet the domestic water use of these cities we conduct a simple calculation based on the total population of the respective cities per capita domestic water use total domestic water use for one month and 90 th percentile value of injection capacity table 3 in table 3 we present the calculations with the 90 th percentile value of injection capacity at both sites and the calculations indicate that two wells and four wells are needed to inject the amount of water equivalent to one month of domestic water needs for the cities of moorhead and rochester respectively if we target areas with higher injection capacity values fewer wells may be required note that we did not consider well interference between injection wells closely spaced wells may result in reduced injection capacity due to well interference and thus more wells may be required to store the target volume another aspect to consider is the risk of causing flowing well conditions near an injection well where the hydraulic head is higher than the ground level for confined aquifers h max may cause flowing well conditions in the wells that are close to the injection well to avoid any risk of flowing well conditions h max could be set to the ground level however this may be too conservative choice and may lead to a significant reduction in injection capacity instead injection wells could be located at a sufficient distance from existing wells to avoid this potential problem to check the required distance we produced a hydraulic head profile at a point in the buffalo aquifer with 99 th percentile value of injection capacity a plot of the head profile at the end of the injection displays a sharp decline in the hydraulic head as the distance increases from the injection well fig 10 the plot indicates that any well located more than a few meters away from the injection well will not experience flowing well conditions 4 5 advantages and limitations of the proposed method the methodology proposed in this study has significant advantages over qualitative asr site suitability estimation methods most importantly it enables a quantitative physically based estimation of injection capacity at aquifer scale this is the first study that proposes a continuous aquifer scale mapping methodology for both unconfined and confined aquifers the produced injection capacity map enables one not only to select the optimal injection well locations but also to estimate the actual amount of water that could be injected in one month this is another important advantage over studies such as dudding et al 2006 where only categorization of the aquifer as zones of a low medium or high injection potential is done while being physically based the methodology remains simple thus enabling efficient first order estimation of injection capacity additionally in case of change in any parameter value e g different injection duration one can easily reevaluate the injection capacity and efficiently produce an updated aquifer scale injection capacity map however high quality and high spatial density of key parameters such as transmissivity overburden thickness and groundwater elevation are important for an accurate estimation of injection capacity therefore the methodology is best suited for areas where good background information is available the method is based on the theis solution so the proposed method inherits the assumptions of the theis solution mentioned in section 2 1 heterogeneity in aquifer properties may cause noticeable differences in the injection capacity however the averaging process outlined in section 2 2 2 should largely alleviate this issue the applicability of an equation established for a confined aquifer to an unconfined aquifer depends on the ratio of change in saturated thickness to initial saturated thickness bear 1979 therefore as long as h max is small relative to the initial saturated thickness of an unconfined aquifer this methodology can be safely applied to an unconfined aquifer otherwise non negligible errors may be introduced if inter aquifer leakage partial penetration or boundary effects are significant one may need to extend the methodology by using drawdown solutions that consider these effects the development of a skin layer may cause a significant reduction in injection capacity with the aging of wells but well redevelopment measures applied at regular intervals can minimize this effect barrash et al 2006 houben 2015 thus it is not an intrinsic aquifer property and so one may not consider it when evaluating potential sites wellbore storage is only significant for large diameter wells with short pumping times papadopulos and cooper 1967 and thus it only needs to be considered when the injection duration is very short 5 conclusions in this study we developed a new gis based methodology that produces injection capacity maps and demonstrated it by using minnesota s extensive hydrogeologic database for the necessary parameters we successfully produced injection capacity maps for two aquifers in minnesota the buffalo aquifer in clay county and the jordan aquifer in olmsted county the results reveal that the selected study areas have large spatial variabilities in the injection capacity this demonstrates the relevance of producing such maps to guide the siting of injection locations the buffalo aquifer shows higher variability in the injection capacity than the jordan aquifer which is mainly caused by its larger variability in t in contrast the injection capacity of the jordan aquifer is governed by the variability of h max these two case studies show that the variability of injection capacity can be governed by both t and h max which are part of the hydrogeologic setting of a site the importance of t and h max for injection capacity estimation emphasizes the need for high quality k aquifer thickness overburden thickness and groundwater elevation maps the mapping methodology is based on the theis solution which relies on various assumptions thus when applying the methodology one should be aware of the potential limitations as discussed in section 4 5 for example to minimize the effect of aquifer heterogeneity k values should ideally be estimated from aquifer pumping tests with a duration close to the target injection duration or one could perform an averaging procedure as discussed in section 2 2 2 considering that no aquitard is perfectly impermeable an important extension of the proposed methodology would be to account for leakage through a confining unit the produced injection capacity maps suggest that the volume of water equivalent to the domestic water use for one month can be injected in both study areas using two and four wells respectively with an injection duration of one month locally higher injection capacities may be found in which case the number of required wells could be reduced although more detailed studies are needed to confirm these findings our study suggests that the hydrogeologic conditions of the buffalo aquifer and the jordan aquifers are suitable for the development of asr projects for domestic use this study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed methodology that enables a first order quantification of well based injection capacity by combining with a socio economic evaluation

study focuses on interpretation of hydrochemistry from 50 lakes thought to be acid sensitive and so monitored by the regional aquatic monitoring program ramp over the last two decades this study uses basic statistics principal component analysis lithological evidence co2 saturation estimates mineral equilibria and δ13cdic measurements to describe and assess controls on ph and to investigate causal factors of observed ph increase in the lakes new hydrological insights for the region our assessment provides evidence of two main geochemical processes that control ph increase namely carbonate dissolution and organic matter uptake the latter a particularly important component of alkalinity in low ph lakes lakes in all subregions show strong evidence of dissolution of marine carbonates of undetermined source and lake water appears to be trending from co2 super saturation towards atmospheric co2 equilibrium this supports the hypothesis of carbonate input due to permafrost thaw via surface or groundwater pathways but also reveals likely influence from co2 dissolution mechanisms related to climatic influence on ice cover duration keywords lake chemistry major ions carboxylic acid ph acidification tds isotopes 1 introduction lakes are a key element of the wetland rich land mosaic in northeastern alberta serving to regulate water chemistry influence the timing of wetland runoff generation to local tributaries and rivers gibson et al 2015 as well as to influence climate at the regional scale through exchange of heat and water with the atmosphere krinner 2003 while lake and ecosystem acidification has been widely observed for industrialized areas of eastern canada and the united states environment canada 2005 acidification has only recently become a concern in western canada particularly within alberta and saskatchewan due to major developments within the energy sector including bitumen mining insitu extraction and upgrading hazewinkel et al 2008 scott et al 2010 jeffries et al 2010 acidification takes place when deposition of strong acid precursors primarily oxides of sulfur s and nitrogen n in wet and dry forms exceed the base cation supply to the ecosystem scott et al 2010 for lakes the base cation supply is typically controlled by the chemistry of watershed runoff henriksen et al 1992 but undoubtedly may also be influenced by water rock interactions and chemical equilibria occurring in soils or within the receiving water body e g jin et al 2010 the regional aquatics monitoring program ramp an industry funded monitoring program initiated in 1997 and operated by alberta environment and parks has maintained a lake water chemistry sampling network across the alberta oil sands region aosr since 1998 annual lake sampling has been carried out in late summer for 50 lakes 40 of which are located within 200 km of the center of oil sands operations near fort mcmurray fig 1 the lakes span six representative subregions of northeastern alberta including the stony mountains west fort mcmurray birch mountains muskeg mountains caribou mountains and precambrian shield gibson et al 2010a b while initial assessments based on only a few years of water chemistry data had predicted eventual acidification in many lakes i e ph decreases due to widespread exceedance of the critical loads of acidity estimates e g bennett et al 2008 longer term sampling over almost 2 decades has since revealed an unexpectedly monotonic increase in the ph in 46 of the 50 lakes see gibson 2019 gibson et al 2019a 2020 gibson et al 2016 also identified a subset of ramp lakes with higher water yields and with tritium levels at intermediate values between 1960s and 2016 attributed to thawing of permafrost and higher runoff mostly from bog dominated peat plateaus a conceptual model proposed by gibson et al 2020 postulated that permafrost thaw within the watersheds which has caused bog and fen collapse may actively be altering runoff processes contributing to increased mobilization of inorganic carbon base cations and other constituents supplying lakes essentially this can be viewed as a reversal albeit temporary of the expected long term acidification trend that was predicted due to regional increases in acidifying emissions importantly gibson et al 2020 suggested that runoff increases and associated chemical mobilization are likely to be temporary if they are linked to the permafrost thaw cycle which has been demonstrated to initially produce increases and then decreases in runoff amounts depending on permafrost extent as was recently demonstrated for lake rich regions of tibet and coastal northern canada wan et al 2019 2020 the temporal effect of other factors such as the co2 atmospheric concentration needs further study in the region similar changes in chemical transport of dissolved inorganic carbon base cations and other constituents i e allochthonous sources has been widely observed for these and other watershed systems undergoing permafrost degradation e g roberts et al 2017 there are many additional investigations that have provided insight into ph regulation and alteration in boreal lakes including study of forest management practices e g prepas et al 2001 gibson et al 2002b devito et al 2005 smerdon et al 2005 surface groundwater interaction schmidt et al 2010 birks et al 2019 and runoff mapping gibson et al 2019a in addition to the aforementioned acidification research processes influential in controlling ph are briefly reviewed including autochthonous within lake processes such as dissolved inorganic carbon dic speciation whereby co2 uptake produces a shift to greater proportions of hco3 wolfe 2001 evasion and photosynthetic regulation of respired co2 to the atmosphere wolfe 2001 which may be enhanced by increases in ice free duration kling et al 1992 decomposition oxidation of organic matter leading to dic production mattson and likens 1992 and organic matter reduction or methanogenesis reduction leading to dic production mattson and likens 1992 clayer et al 2018 allochthonous external processes controlling ph include catchment weathering and leaching of carbonate rich soils followed by transport of dic by surface or groundwater discharge to lakes or due to enhanced doc loads followed by in lake mineralization hanson et al 2011 allochthonous changes may occur due to increases in ph within peatlands flowing into the lakes a scenario that might be expected to occur in the case of bog or fen collapse due to permafrost thawing e g gibson 2019 in presence of an external source of alkalinity anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions associated with global climate warming are also potentially important controls on carbonate solubility in lakes co2 ch4 and sox and nox emissions within the aosr have been measured or estimated as reported by liggio et al 2016 2017 and 2019 and the associated impacts on vegetation and aquatic environment have been evaluated by jung and chang 2012 aherne and posch 2013 and brook et al 2019 an evaluation of areal atmospheric base cation deposition to aquatic ecosystems in alberta and saskatchewan from fugitive emissions showed exceedances to critical loads that might represent potential acidifying effects makar et al 2018 however makar et al 2018 also showed that loadings decreased rapidly within the aosr and that the acid neutralization capacity was likely insufficient to neutralize the s and n deposition within watersheds from such evaluations which don t appear to account for the observed ph increases we suggest that base cation buffering may not be the only important ph regulation mechanism for ramp lakes cook et al 2017 hypothesized that the base cation budget is dominated by groundwater and watershed inputs and that carbonate dissolution exerts a first order control over lake sediment geochemical composition mainly though groundwater influence groundwater recharge surface water groundwater interaction and permafrost thaw are expected to leave geochemical and isotopic fingerprints on lake water similar to that noted for area rivers jasechko et al 2012 gibson et al 2013 birks et al 2018 2019 and may play a direct or indirect role in controlling the ph of runoff and or lake water while major ion signatures are explored here in some detail for the ramp lakes an expanded array of solute isotopic tracers that may provide additional insight into the role of groundwater in the lake budgets remains a potential avenue to explore in future investigations from a study of hardwater boreal lakes finlay et al 2015 suggested that spring and summer ph increases were likely attributable to climate warming process that reduce ice cover or increase the permafrost thaw thus reducing the amount of co2 stored under ice and increasing the chemical uptake of co2 in a similar way we sought to test the relative importance of the many proposed geochemical mechanisms our initial hypothesis was that carbonate dissolution within the lakes and possibly within the entire watershed areas enhanced groundwater and surface water inputs of water with high mineral content and co2 dissolution triggered by permafrost thaw and influenced by reduced lake ice cover were the most influential processes whereas factors such as s and n emissions were considered to be secondary lajewski et al 2003 this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of major ion water chemistry measurements made during 1999 2015 for the 50 ramp lakes including graphs basic statistics and principal components analysis pca to support the discussion of important geochemical mechanisms and patterns among the various subgroups we also utilize mineral and co2 solubility calculations based on the geochemical program phreeqc to evaluate and discuss evidence of the relative importance of various lake ph regulation mechanisms and importantly to constrain possible causes of the observed region wide ph increases finally we endeavor to identify implications of such processes for regional sustainability of lakes and address challenges for monitoring oil sands development impacts in a landscape experiencing pronounced and ongoing climatic changes 2 methods 2 1 site locations the ramp lakes situated in the boreal region of alberta are comprised of several regional upland plateaus and lowland plains subregions the lakes situated within 200 km radius of fort mcmurray include ten lakes in the stony mountains sm eleven lakes in the birch mountains bm eight lakes west of the city of fort mcmurray wf and eleven lakes in the northeast ne muskeg mountains fig 1 lakes situated outside of the 200 km radius include five precambrian shield lakes to the west of lake athabasca s and five lakes in the caribou mountains cm the lakes range from small 3 4 ha to large 4400 ha with depths ranging from 1 to 30 m watersheds vary in size from 57 ha to 16 555 ha with percentage lake area ranging from 1 to 30 gibson et al 2015 2019a 2020 we note that the smallest and largest lakes in the ramp network are both less than 10 of the area of the smallest and largest lakes studied by finlay et al 2015 which is relevant for the discussion later on the ramp lakes are situated predominantly in headwater catchments across a range of latitude morphometry and wetland rich landscapes gibson et al 2010a b the headwater locations were preferentially selected to evaluate atmospheric deposition associated with acidifying and neutralizing emissions and particulates the lakes in the stony and birch mountains are situated on peat plateaus underlain by weathered shales of the cretaceous colorado group that form a shallow low permeability barrier to vertical groundwater movement shield lakes are situated in areas underlain by crystalline precambrian shield bedrock covered by a shallow discontinuous mantle of glacial till in all other subregions ne sm wf bm cm fig 1 subregions lakes are underlain by quaternary tills sandstones siltstones shales and carbonates of cretaceous to devonian age the lowland lakes typically have higher permeability than the peat plateaus which likely implies greater potential for groundwater interaction buried quaternary tertiary channels are a common feature of the aosr and as with stream channels are locally influential as sources and or sinks of water for some area lakes gibson et al 2019b evaporation in alberta lakes has also been investigated as part of water budget studies by gibson et al 2002a 2019a 2020 annual evaporation losses from lakes range from site to site and year to year between 18 and 50 of annual inflow with minimum values between 4 and 36 and maximum values between 26 and 66 lakes with low evaporation inflow tend to remain relatively low despite interannual variability whereas lakes with high evaporation inflow tend to remain high although they tend to show somewhat higher interannual variability the lakes west of fort mcmurray wf subregion were estimated to have the highest evaporation losses gibson et al 2019a 2020 one consideration we explore later on is that high evaporation rates may potentially contribute to increasing trends in chemical solutes trends alkalinity carbonate mineral saturation and increased lake ph values 2 2 water sampling due to the high dilution and high sensitivity to strong acids and acid precursors such as organic matter cook et al 2017 it is expected that the ramp lakes receive a significant percentage of their input from surface water snowmelt precipitation from rainfall and dust deposition based on previous assessments using radon 222 the groundwater contribution to the lakes is estimated to range from about 1 20 of annual inputs see schmidt et al 2010 although it has not been measured in all ramp lakes lake water chemistry was sampled annually for electrical conductivity ec ph total dissolved solids tds dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc major minor trace ions stable isotopes 18o and 2h stable water isotope results have been described in gibson et al 2019a 2020 tritium was also collected on a few occasions as described in gibson et al 2016 and 13cdic was collected on one occasion in 2011 as described here for the first time all samples were water column samples from the euphotic zone collected by float plane or helicopter from the lake center collection dates ranged across the months of july august september and october from 1999 to 2015 with 89 of samples collected between august and september clearly after dilution from snowpack melt had already occurred the sampling methods and lab procedures have been described in cook et al 2017 birks et al 2018 2019 and gibson et al 2020 and are consistent with approaches used previously in the region 2 3 aqueous ion balance error and ions compensation ion balance errors ibe were evaluated to identify acceptance criterion the ibe estimates are unbalanced in favor of the cations in the majority of water samples which is frequent in very low salinity waters tds range from 5 3 mg l 1 to 128 mg l 1 and mean of 31 1 mg l 1 in order to improve the ibe results total and ionized carboxylic acids concentration estimates c t and a respectively were applied to the ion balances oliver et al 1983 whitfield et al 2010 to estimate a the following relationship was applied 1 a k c t k h where k c t and h are the mass action quotient of the fulvic and humic acids organic fulvic and humic acids concentration and hydrogen ions respectively for the c t estimate doc concentration in mg l 1 was factored by 10 µeq mg 1 to each sample these estimates allowed us to achieve a charge balance of 25 as an acceptance criterion oliver et al 1983 whitfield et al 2010 after adding a to the sum of anions the majority of samples 80 of the 778 samples passed this criterion which confirmed that the imbalance was mainly due to the ionized component of the dissolved organic matter dom concentration in the lakes 2 4 speciation and statistical software saturation indices were determined using the equilibrium mass transfer model phreeqc 3 5 0 parkhurst and appelo 1999 spearman correlation analysis and principal components analysis were conducted with sigmaplot for windows14 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph trends in general ph log h is found to increase with alkalinity in a sigmoidal shape flattening at about ph 8 0 once alkalinity concentrations reached about 800 µeq l 1 fig 2 a table 1 alkalinity and the ions that contribute to the alkalinity as represented in the equation below 2 alkalinity hco3 co3 2 oh h na k mg2 ca2 nh4 mn2 fe2 cl so4 2 no3 organic a are increasing temporally directly with organic a and dissolved calcium as illustrated in fig 2 a fig 3 and table 1 time series ph data for lakes color coded by subregion are illustrated in fig 2 b and overall depict increasing ph in all subregions and most individual lakes while field atmospheric and in situ lake co2 measurements were not a component of this investigation apparent pco2 and field ph values were compared to ph produced in the speciation model at atmospheric pco2 equilibrium most lakes show an apparent disequilibrium effect between atmospheric pco2 and the measured ph similar temporally we note continuous slight increments in dissolved chemistry and ph which are evident across the region during the 15 years of sampling fig 2 b to that which has been noted for dilute lakes bisogni and arroyo 1991 and which is frequently associated with seasonally ice covered lakes wolfe 2001 the results indicate that most lakes are supersaturated in pco2 relative to the atmosphere and the observed field ph is up to one unit lower than the ph at atmospheric equilibrium suggesting that the ramp lakes are active sources of co2 while based primarily on geochemical modeling and on a single euphotic zone sample for each lake in late summer this appears to be consistent from year to year and across the entire lake network suggesting that co2 evasion is likely a systematic ongoing process respiration of co2 and accumulation under lake ice between november and april would contribute to a reduction in ph and the dissolution of carbonates and subsequent release to the atmosphere in spring summer combined with higher temperatures and co2 uptake by phytoplankton and periphyton and or removal of co2 by photosynthesis lajewski et al 2003 this may promote carbonate precipitation and ph lake increase as observed in previous studies cole and caraco 1998 finlay et al 2015 for example pco2 values under ice were found to exceed open water values by 3 14 times for alaskan lakes kling et al 1992 wolfe 2001 high co2 evasion takes place during the lake turnover period that possibly goes unrecorded if sampling is conducted in the summer season overall without seasonal observations or under ice measurements it is difficult to conclude whether the co2 evasion process is close to steady state interannually or whether there are long term climate driven changes in ice cover that have exerted an overall upward influence on ph tendency while unconfirmed climate driven changes in ice cover appear to be at least part of the explanation of the observed ph effect a more detailed field based investigation including winter sampling under ice would be particularly informative to test this assertion and so is identified as a potentially important target for future investigations 3 2 lake water chemistry composition based on major ion compositions the ramp lakes were classified as ca mg hco3 a and ca mg na hco3 a water types fig 4 table 1 the ionized carboxylic acid contribution a from humic and fulvic substances to the overall ionic balance appears to be of importance for all lakes with the highest mean values of 278 and 193 µeq l 1 for the wf and ne lakes respectively near to the oil sands development areas and decreasing in importance with the distance from the oil sands projects towards the bm cm s and sm lakes with mean concentrations of 164 162 147 and 86 µeq l 1 respectively in addition minor concentrations of dissolved so4 and dissolved na were found to be present predominantly in the wf bm and ne lakes examination of the physico chemical characteristics of the lakes reveals that lake water color is an important indicator across the six subregions the cm lakes showed the highest mean color value of the six subregions with 210 mg l 1 pt fig 3 high water color is also typically associated with low turbidity with lowest values also observed for the cm lakes at 2 18 mg l 1 the contrast between these two parameters is indicative of watersheds dominated by ombrotrophic peatlands bogs and extensive permafrost which account for 65 88 of watershed land cover for the cm lakes gibson et al 2015 2020 the high natural color water is reflective of acidity generated by organic matter dissolution oliver et al 1983 lakes most susceptible to acidification show low alkalinity low chlorophyll and low color eilers et al 1983 principal component analysis pca a multivariate statistical technique was applied to evaluate the relationships between ph and physico chemical constituents pca biplots for each sub region fig 5 illustrate loadings for variables vectors as well as scores for individual lakes points proximity in the biplots is an indicator of similarity between lakes as well as an indicator of the importance of driving variables the first principal axis pc1 was found to account for between 38 and 49 of variability in the sub region datasets driven mainly by positive shifts in ph dic alkalinity and base cations ca and mg whereas the second principal axis pc2 found to account for between 13 and 20 of variability in the sub region datasets was driven by variables positively correlated with residence time such as color turbidity tss carboxylic acid and some nutrients the alignment of variables such as dic alkalinity and base cations with ph strongly suggests that carbonate dissolution may accompany ph increases in the lakes we note slightly different orientation of loadings vectors for shield lakes s attributed to fundamentally different weathering mechanisms in this sub region although the overall alignment of ph with carbonate dissolution indicators remains similar to other sub regions within the boreal plains for wf bm and cm sub regions chloride cl follows variations driven mainly by pc2 such as color turbidity total carboxylic acid ct whereas for ne sm and s cl aligns closely with ph and the carbonate dissolution drivers along pc1 generally cl is assumed to behave conservatively along hydrologic flowpaths although halite dissolution both active and glaciogenic are known to be significant sources of cl via springs and seeps emerging along the lower athabasca river its tributaries and to some extent lakes and wetlands e g saline lake saline fen given that colorado shale is present throughout the western subregions wf bm and cm we suggest that halite influences would be reduced in these areas compared to sources related to weathering of till or shale for ne sm and s sub regions where the colorado group is absent we suggest that cl related to such halite dissolution sources may be more important and is possibly may be linked to or concurrent with carbonate dissolution or carbonate weathering as lakes in sub region s are situated within crystalline bedrock terrain the likelihood is that carbonate and cl sources are also tracing near surface inputs to the lakes the carbonate dissolution hypothesis cook et al 2017 is further discussed and evaluated later on using results from saturation index calculations and stable isotope results 3 3 residence time and tds gibson et al 2020 reported residence time estimates for each lake in the ramp dataset using bathymetry and isotope based inflows 2002 2017 ordered from lowest to highest mean residence times by sub region were found to be ne 0 84 0 46 years wf 1 06 0 35 years sm 1 14 0 53 years bm 2 06 3 32 cm 2 41 1 02 and s 3 02 2 75 residence times for the entire dataset were found to be positively correlated with ph r 2 0 335 p 0 0177 δ 13 c dic r 2 0 392 p 0 005 and cl r 2 0 291 p 0 0406 and negatively correlated with color r 0 62 p 0 001 aluminum r 2 0 535 p 0 001 doc r 2 0 468 p 0 001 turbidity r 2 0 4 p 0 004 chlorophyll a r 2 0 344 p 0 0148 and most nutrients residence time was found to be poorly correlated with tds and most major ions except as noted the ne and wf lakes were found to contain the highest mean tds concentrations of 41 38 mg l 1 and 39 56 mg l 1 respectively and the highest mean total carbonate alkalinity tca values of 785 and 751 µeq l 1 respectively and showed a wider spread in ph values ranging from 5 99 to 8 12 for ne and 5 56 8 3 for wf the sm lakes were found to have the lowest mean ph value of 6 09 the lowest mean tds value of 11 8 mg l 1 and lowest mean tca value of 199 mg l 1 table 1 overall widely varying lake residence times produce a broad distribution of geochemical responses including in some cases significant differences in ionic dominances as noted by shapley et al 2005 further work needs to be conducted on the lakes to identify the influence of the residence time on the controls aligned mainly with pc2 see fig 5 although these are not thought to be the primary drivers of ph increases observed in the lakes 3 4 co2 alkalinity and ph in sweden long term changes in ph related to land use changes including forest fires have been studied and were attributed mainly to release of base cations and alkalinity previously trapped in the watershed soils remberg et al 1993 korsman and segerstrom 1998 such processes were also postulated to occur in a similar way for systems undergoing significant impacts from climate change lajewski et al 2003 reported historical nitric acid triggered carbonate weathering in the finger lakes new york at times of high summer surface water temperatures they concluded that efficient photosynthetic removal of co2 in surface water led to supersaturation with respect to calcite and resulted in increased alkalinity and ph values during summer houle et al 2010 in a study of lake chemistry of 47 temperate and boreal catchments in north america and europe between 1989 and 2005 found that climate related annual temperature increases were more strongly correlated with ph and alkalinity of the lake than with reduction in s deposition which were decreasing steadily in most areas due to emissions reductions the role of s and n from fugitive dust emissions on ph control via dissolution of carbonates was considered as a secondary process to increased summer surface water temperature picoplankton concentrations and or removal of co2 by photosynthesis lajewski et al 2003 and other processes such as co2 degassing and carbonate dissolution in lakes it is possible that s and n acidifying emissions dissolved in the rainfall and snowmelt play a role in carbonate dissolution within aquifers in recharge zones however these would be secondary to the main role that the dissolved co2 in the rainfall might play additional efforts are required to understand the role of the dust and the acidification precursors on carbonate dissolution in the recharge zones of aosr in alberta table 1 provides a statistical summary of the general chemistry which includes apparent pco2 and measurements of dic these parameters are in agreement with the ph data which allows us to infer that most of dic exists in the form of bicarbonate rather than as co2 within the lakes however a preliminary comparison of apparent dissolved co2 concentration ppm in the lakes relative to the measured dry atmospheric concentration mean 394 ppm for the aosr liggio et al 2019 provides first evidence that most lakes are co2 supersaturated with most lakes showing supersaturations up to six times that of atmospheric co2 fig 6 left these results indicate that most lakes fall below the theoretical equilibrium line therefore constitute a net source of co2 to the atmosphere cole and prairie 2009 during the open water period from may june to october fig 6 right however all lakes subregions seem to be trending towards atmospheric equilibrium suggesting that the atmospheric and dissolved co2 are buffered by the acid neutralization capacity of the alkalinity several lakes in the ne wf and bm subregions fall above the theoretical equilibrium line whereas lakes from the cm subregion fall clearly below the line lakes that fall above the theoretical equilibrium line are hardwater lakes with ph above 8 0 co2 sources to the lake are expected to include photosynthesis plant respiration in deep lakes and terrestrial watershed inputs in lakes with short hydrologic residence times groundwater is sometimes the cause of high dissolved co2 concentrations cole and prairie 2009 other processes that might generate abundant co2 such as permafrost thaw gibson et al 2019 also need to be considered precipitation driven run off augmented by permafrost thaw sources gibson et al 2019 might be one of the key mechanisms to explain the high co2 relative saturation in some lakes however high dissolved co2 content would lead to lake acidification and the trends observed point towards a general acid neutralization effect in all lakes of the region thus understanding the processes triggering the generation of alkalinity is very important to explain the increasing ph trends 3 5 ionized carboxylic acid a bicarbonates and ph the larger contribution of doc relative to the dic indicates that dissolved organic matter present in the form of weak organic acids are also an important component of the alkalinity and the ion balance herzeg and hesslein 1984 and contribute to the total alkalinity thereby buffering the lakes at low values of ph fig 7 while most lakes fall below the softwater hardwater lower boundary defined by ph 8 0 fig 7 finlay et al 2015 the majority of lakes in the cm sm wf ne and bm sub regions show a to hco3 ratios of 1 1 which generally produces waters with ph below 7 5 these lakes show a hco3 content of less than 400 µeq l 1 less numerous are a second group of lakes in bm wf ne and cm sub regions characterized by a to hco3 ratios of 1 2 which are found to have ph ranging up to 8 0 including hco3 concentrations up to 1000 µeq l 1 the third group very limited in number shows a to hco3 ratios of 1 5 present only in lakes ne 9 ne10 and ne11 wf7 and wf8 these can be considered hardwater lakes with ph values ranging between 8 0 and 8 5 the hco3 concentrations in the hardwater lakes attain concentrations up to 2000 µeq l 1 although a few lakes of the bm group seem to achieve a ph higher than 8 0 the hco3 concentrations only attain concentrations up to 1000 µeq l 1 finally a fourth group is represented by s lakes from the canadian shield region figs 5 and 7 having a to hco3 ratios that follow an unclear non incremental trend ph values in this group are less than 8 0 and the hco3 content is lower than 600 µeq l 1 as observed in fig 7 and described above most lakes sub groups are characterized by ph increasing continuously with respect to the total carbonate alkalinity which indicates that in highly dilute lakes the ph increases are driven by the dissolution of carbonates that are interacting with the co2 that interaction promotes the increase in hco3 also ionized carboxylic acid a sourced from dissolved organic matter contributes to the increased alkalinity but in lower proportion 3 6 sources of dissolved carbonate mineral and mineral equilibrium sediment core studies in the region were conducted by hazewinkel et al 2008 curtis et al 2010 kurek et al 2013 and laird et al 2013 to evaluate acidifications effects mainly through diatom inferred ph changes in boreal lakes to ne of alberta and one study to the ne of saskatchewan these investigations showed no evidence of widespread lake acidification trends associated with oil sands development hazewinkel et al 2008 curtis et al 2010 mushet et al 2017 cook et al 2017 lake sediment cores fisher et al 2009 within the 200 km radius of the aosr show recurrent stratigraphy comprising organic material and peat at the top with centimeter scale alternation of gyttja glacial sands silts and organic clays as well as marls up to 600 mm in thickness marl deposits predominate in areas comprising outwash sands and gravels and are primarily generated by moraine deposits fisher et al 2009 typical of the aosr gibson et al 2019a b postulated that carbonate dissolution in surface water was likely enhanced in surface water runoff by the permafrost thaw effect we evaluated carbonate mineral saturation states in the ramp lakes with the program phreeqc table 2 the calcite saturation index si illustrated in fig 8 left panel is driven by the alkalinity production reaching calcite saturation in lakes ne9 ne10 ne11 wf4 wf5 wf7 wf8 bm2 bm10 cm1 and s4 which were also found to be close to saturation with respect aragonite and dolomite for the same lakes enriched δ 13 c dic values reaching as high as 3 4 vpdb are considered to be indicative of carbonate dissolution while there is lithological evidence of occurrence of carbonates marls in lakes cores fisher et al 2009 that supports the hypothesis of calcite dissolution there is no direct geochemical evidence from the ramp watersheds to support the hypothesis of terrestrial or authigenic sources of carbonates or that these are year round processes however detailed wetland terrain mapping of the ramp lake watersheds does provide evidence of widespread bog and fen collapse features particularly in watersheds of the ne bm and cm sub regions although sampling of watershed runoff and permafrost has been limited to isotope sampling at a few sites gibson et al 2015 the relationship between high water yields and permafrost thaw features in ramp watersheds has been firmly established gibson et al 2019a and differences between tritium content in ramp lakes suggests different water sources are flowing to thaw lakes gibson et al 2016 while conducted outside ramp watersheds a recent inventory of various non permafrost wetland types in the region including bogs poor fens and rich fens established high potential for storage of dic doc and nutrients especially nh4 in thick low permeability peat deposits which extend to 11 m depth in some areas gibson et al 2021 mobilization of such stores by bog or fen collapse may be an important part of the ph story although further watershed based studies will likely be required to confirm this from arctic regions with degrading permafrost there is mounting evidence that biogeochemical processing of thawed permafrost substrates will amplify dic production in lakes zolkos and tank 2020 we suspect that similar processes are likely occurring in the ramp lakes located within a region near the southern limit of permafrost which has been classified as being vulnerable to water resources impacts related to permafrost thaw spence et al 2020 the softwater lakes are distributed regionally with higher dissolved organic matter and lower alkalinity content seem to show more depleted δ13cdic values in some cases approaching 24 vpdb fig 8 table 2 noted differences in mineral equilibria between lakes may be substantially explained by differences in the relationship between local geochemical and hydrologic inputs whereby lakes fed predominantly by shallow flowpaths through peat tend to be more dilute and show alkalinity dominated by organic acids whereas lakes fed predominantly by groundwater or lakes containing marl deposits tend to be carbonate buffered while such processes likely contribute to the observed ph shifts the permafrost thaw process and its linkage to co2 regulation is inferred but cannot be confirmed from data available from this study we note that input of dissolved carbonate material increases concentrations of hco3 and co3 2 whereas input of dissolved organic matter increases the ionized carboxylic acids given the ph of the lakes physico chemical controls established from pca relationships and variation in saturation indices the most important component to understand ph changes is hco3 and in addition for low ph lakes the ionized carboxylic acids which serve to neutralize the hydroxides and hydrogen ions entering the lakes although increases in ph values have been observed in most lakes fig 7 shows that in the aosr the presence of hardwater lakes with ph values higher than 8 0 finlay et al 2015 is limited to a few ne9 ne10 ne11 bm10 wf7 wf8 these lakes show atmospheric pco2 in equilibrium with alkalinity fig 8 enriched δ13cdic values and may possibly be precipitating authigenic carbonates these parameters support the hypothesis that the hardwater lakes are fed by groundwater discharge whereas the softwater lakes with low ph values supersaturated atmospheric pco2 values low alkalinity concentrations and more depleted δ13cdic values fig 8 are characteristic of regional recharge conditions and are likely reliant mainly on surface water all year monitoring will be required at least in selected ramp lakes to test this hypothesis and to firmly establish the importance of co2 evasion on the ph increase 4 conclusions the present study analyzed 15 years of physico chemical and ion data for 50 ramp lakes which are mostly highly dilute waters charge balances were improved and made useful for analysis by incorporating both ionized and total carboxylic acid contents of the waters and by using these estimates to predict the effect of organic matter dissolution on the alkalinity pca analysis land cover assessments indirect lithological evidence apparent pco2 estimates mineral equilibria and δ13cdic measurements have provided new insights into the significant role of carbonate dissolution and organic matter dissolution on geochemistry and ph regulation in the lakes modeled co2 concentrations for the lakes commonly exceeded atmospheric co2 estimates suggesting that lakes at low ph were co2 emitters whereas for lakes with ph greater than 8 5 the co2 is transformed into hco3 and co3 for these lakes pco2 declines below atmospheric values and we predict leads to hardwater sequestration of atmospheric co2 finlay et al 2015 it was apparent that all lakes in the region appeared to be trending towards atmospheric equilibrium at the time of sampling although seasonality of this process remains to be characterized the carboxylic acid contents and organic matter reflected in the high natural water color are relatively important to the total alkalinity budget in the watersheds particularly when the ph values are lower than 7 0 although the incremental concentrations of bicarbonates and carboxylic acids are present in most lakes only few lakes show an a to hco3 ratio of 1 5 with ph between 8 0 and 8 5 and hco3 concentrations approaching 2000 µeq l 1 these lakes seem to be in equilibrium with calcite aragonite and dolomite and display the most enriched values in δ13cdic between 3 0 and 3 5 vpdb these lakes also tend to be dominated by carbonate sources low ph low alkalinity lakes were found to be doc rich were dominated by organic matter dissolution processes and showed low δ13cdic between 24 0 and 18 0 vpdb these results support the assertion that carbonate dissolution as the main mechanism controlling the ph increase in the lakes in the context of long term acidification potential this should be viewed conservatively as a mechanism that may serve to temporarily pause the acidification process in a similar way to permafrost thaw despite the fact that the role of atmospheric co2 in the dissolution of carbonates in the watershed headwaters remains pending for further investigation the resumption of acidification is not certain in the short term the majority of the ramp lakes in the boreal alberta region are considered small therefore the decreasing permafrost melting process has significantly more impact on the net co2 relative saturation budget making more difficult to attain rapid theoretical equilibrium than in large alkaline lakes as those reported by finlay et al 2015 from the central canadian region thus as lakes eventually equilibrate to modified climatic conditions and as oil sands development proceeds across the region the acidification process may be inevitable in the long term while informative pca mineral equilibria pco2 and δ13cdic relationships would benefit from year round observations and sampling at least for selected lakes spanning the overall range of geochemical variability noted across the region in this study there is also a need to extend hydrologic and geochemical observations to characterize watershed sources especially via surface runoff sampling and installation and sampling wells in representative terrain units including collapse scars formed due to permafrost thawing such field based investigations are recommended to improve understanding of the role of allochthonous sources including shallow groundwater within peat within mineral soils and bedrock formation waters if applicable more field based information to assess ice cover duration and its role in modulating carbonate dissolution co2 evasion ph control would also serve to better understand the observed changes and sustainability of the current trajectory of water quality and quantity changes in the lakes and how they are expected to affect the regional land mosaic and regional hydrology in general surface lake sediments collection would be one strategy to assess the decomposition of organic matter and its effects on calcite saturation in the lakes finally a basic review of current parameters monitored within the water chemistry program is warranted if we now acknowledge that acidifying emissions may not be the only

study focuses on interpretation of hydrochemistry from 50 lakes thought to be acid sensitive and so monitored by the regional aquatic monitoring program ramp over the last two decades this study uses basic statistics principal component analysis lithological evidence co2 saturation estimates mineral equilibria and δ13cdic measurements to describe and assess controls on ph and to investigate causal factors of observed ph increase in the lakes new hydrological insights for the region our assessment provides evidence of two main geochemical processes that control ph increase namely carbonate dissolution and organic matter uptake the latter a particularly important component of alkalinity in low ph lakes lakes in all subregions show strong evidence of dissolution of marine carbonates of undetermined source and lake water appears to be trending from co2 super saturation towards atmospheric co2 equilibrium this supports the hypothesis of carbonate input due to permafrost thaw via surface or groundwater pathways but also reveals likely influence from co2 dissolution mechanisms related to climatic influence on ice cover duration keywords lake chemistry major ions carboxylic acid

generation to local tributaries and rivers gibson et al 2015 as well as to influence climate at the regional scale through exchange of heat and water with the atmosphere krinner 2003 while lake and ecosystem acidification has been widely observed for industrialized areas of eastern canada and the united states environment canada 2005 acidification has only recently become a concern in western canada particularly within alberta and saskatchewan due to major developments within the energy sector including bitumen mining insitu extraction and upgrading hazewinkel et al 2008 scott et al 2010 jeffries et al 2010 acidification takes place when deposition of strong acid precursors primarily oxides of sulfur s and nitrogen n in wet and dry forms exceed the base cation supply to the ecosystem scott et al 2010 for lakes the base cation supply is typically controlled by the chemistry of watershed runoff henriksen et al 1992 but undoubtedly may also be influenced by water rock interactions and chemical equilibria occurring in soils or within the receiving water body e g jin et al 2010 the regional aquatics monitoring program ramp an industry funded monitoring program initiated in 1997 and operated by alberta environment and parks has maintained a lake water chemistry sampling network across the alberta oil sands region aosr since 1998 annual lake sampling has been carried out in late summer for 50 lakes 40 of which are located within 200 km of the center of oil sands operations near fort mcmurray fig 1 the lakes span six representative subregions of northeastern alberta including the stony mountains west fort mcmurray birch mountains muskeg mountains caribou mountains and precambrian shield gibson et al 2010a b while initial assessments based on only a few years of water chemistry data had predicted eventual acidification in many lakes i e ph decreases due to widespread exceedance of the critical loads of acidity estimates e g bennett et al 2008 longer term sampling over almost 2 decades has since revealed an unexpectedly monotonic increase in the ph in 46 of the 50 lakes see gibson 2019 gibson et al 2019a 2020 gibson et al 2016 also identified a subset of ramp lakes with higher water yields and with tritium levels at intermediate values between 1960s and 2016 attributed to thawing of permafrost and higher runoff mostly from bog dominated peat plateaus a conceptual model proposed by gibson et al 2020 postulated that permafrost thaw within the watersheds which has caused bog and fen collapse may actively be altering runoff processes contributing to increased mobilization of inorganic carbon base cations and other constituents supplying lakes essentially this can be viewed as a reversal albeit temporary of the expected long term acidification trend that was predicted due to regional increases in acidifying emissions importantly gibson et al 2020 suggested that runoff increases and associated chemical mobilization are likely to be temporary if they are linked to the permafrost thaw cycle which has been demonstrated to initially produce increases and then decreases in runoff amounts depending on permafrost extent as was recently demonstrated for lake rich regions of tibet and coastal northern canada wan et al 2019 2020 the temporal effect of other factors such as the co2 atmospheric concentration needs further study in the region similar changes in chemical transport of dissolved inorganic carbon base cations and other constituents i e allochthonous sources has been widely observed for these and other watershed systems undergoing permafrost degradation e g roberts et al 2017 there are many additional investigations that have provided insight into ph regulation and alteration in boreal lakes including study of forest management practices e g prepas et al 2001 gibson et al 2002b devito et al 2005 smerdon et al 2005 surface groundwater interaction schmidt et al 2010 birks et al 2019 and runoff mapping gibson et al 2019a in addition to the aforementioned acidification research processes influential in controlling ph are briefly reviewed including autochthonous within lake processes such as dissolved inorganic carbon dic speciation whereby co2 uptake produces a shift to greater proportions of hco3 wolfe 2001 evasion and photosynthetic regulation of respired co2 to the atmosphere wolfe 2001 which may be enhanced by increases in ice free duration kling et al 1992 decomposition oxidation of organic matter leading to dic production mattson and likens 1992 and organic matter reduction or methanogenesis reduction leading to dic production mattson and likens 1992 clayer et al 2018 allochthonous external processes controlling ph include catchment weathering and leaching of carbonate rich soils followed by transport of dic by surface or groundwater discharge to lakes or due to enhanced doc loads followed by in lake mineralization hanson et al 2011 allochthonous changes may occur due to increases in ph within peatlands flowing into the lakes a scenario that might be expected to occur in the case of bog or fen collapse due to permafrost thawing e g gibson 2019 in presence of an external source of alkalinity anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions associated with global climate warming are also potentially important controls on carbonate solubility in lakes co2 ch4 and sox and nox emissions within the aosr have been measured or estimated as reported by liggio et al 2016 2017 and 2019 and the associated impacts on vegetation and aquatic environment have been evaluated by jung and chang 2012 aherne and posch 2013 and brook et al 2019 an evaluation of areal atmospheric base cation deposition to aquatic ecosystems in alberta and saskatchewan from fugitive emissions showed exceedances to critical loads that might represent potential acidifying effects makar et al 2018 however makar et al 2018 also showed that loadings decreased rapidly within the aosr and that the acid neutralization capacity was likely insufficient to neutralize the s and n deposition within watersheds from such evaluations which don t appear to account for the observed ph increases we suggest that base cation buffering may not be the only important ph regulation mechanism for ramp lakes cook et al 2017 hypothesized that the base cation budget is dominated by groundwater and watershed inputs and that carbonate dissolution exerts a first order control over lake sediment geochemical composition mainly though groundwater influence groundwater recharge surface water groundwater interaction and permafrost thaw are expected to leave geochemical and isotopic fingerprints on lake water similar to that noted for area rivers jasechko et al 2012 gibson et al 2013 birks et al 2018 2019 and may play a direct or indirect role in controlling the ph of runoff and or lake water while major ion signatures are explored here in some detail for the ramp lakes an expanded array of solute isotopic tracers that may provide additional insight into the role of groundwater in the lake budgets remains a potential avenue to explore in future investigations from a study of hardwater boreal lakes finlay et al 2015 suggested that spring and summer ph increases were likely attributable to climate warming process that reduce ice cover or increase the permafrost thaw thus reducing the amount of co2 stored under ice and increasing the chemical uptake of co2 in a similar way we sought to test the relative importance of the many proposed geochemical mechanisms our initial hypothesis was that carbonate dissolution within the lakes and possibly within the entire watershed areas enhanced groundwater and surface water inputs of water with high mineral content and co2 dissolution triggered by permafrost thaw and influenced by reduced lake ice cover were the most influential processes whereas factors such as s and n emissions were considered to be secondary lajewski et al 2003 this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of major ion water chemistry measurements made during 1999 2015 for the 50 ramp lakes including graphs basic statistics and principal components analysis pca to support the discussion of important geochemical mechanisms and patterns among the various subgroups we also utilize mineral and co2 solubility calculations based on the geochemical program phreeqc to evaluate and discuss evidence of the relative importance of various lake ph regulation mechanisms and importantly to constrain possible causes of the observed region wide ph increases finally we endeavor to identify implications of such processes for regional sustainability of lakes and address challenges for monitoring oil sands development impacts in a landscape experiencing pronounced and ongoing climatic changes 2 methods 2 1 site locations the ramp lakes situated in the boreal region of alberta are comprised of several regional upland plateaus and lowland plains subregions the lakes situated within 200 km radius of fort mcmurray include ten lakes in the stony mountains sm eleven lakes in the birch mountains bm eight lakes west of the city of fort mcmurray wf and eleven lakes in the northeast ne muskeg mountains fig 1 lakes situated outside of the 200 km radius include five precambrian shield lakes to the west of lake athabasca s and five lakes in the caribou mountains cm the lakes range from small 3 4 ha to large 4400 ha with depths ranging from 1 to 30 m watersheds vary in size from 57 ha to 16 555 ha with percentage lake area ranging from 1 to 30 gibson et al 2015 2019a 2020 we note that the smallest and largest lakes in the ramp network are both less than 10 of the area of the smallest and largest lakes studied by finlay et al 2015 which is relevant for the discussion later on the ramp lakes are situated predominantly in headwater catchments across a range of latitude morphometry and wetland rich landscapes gibson et al 2010a b the headwater locations were preferentially selected to evaluate atmospheric deposition associated with acidifying and neutralizing emissions and particulates the lakes in the stony and birch mountains are situated on peat plateaus underlain by weathered shales of the cretaceous colorado group that form a shallow low permeability barrier to vertical groundwater movement shield lakes are situated in areas underlain by crystalline precambrian shield bedrock covered by a shallow discontinuous mantle of glacial till in all other subregions ne sm wf bm cm fig 1 subregions lakes are underlain by quaternary tills sandstones siltstones shales and carbonates of cretaceous to devonian age the lowland lakes typically have higher permeability than the peat plateaus which likely implies greater potential for groundwater interaction buried quaternary tertiary channels are a common feature of the aosr and as with stream channels are locally influential as sources and or sinks of water for some area lakes gibson et al 2019b evaporation in alberta lakes has also been investigated as part of water budget studies by gibson et al 2002a 2019a 2020 annual evaporation losses from lakes range from site to site and year to year between 18 and 50 of annual inflow with minimum values between 4 and 36 and maximum values between 26 and 66 lakes with low evaporation inflow tend to remain relatively low despite interannual variability whereas lakes with high evaporation inflow tend to remain high although they tend to show somewhat higher interannual variability the lakes west of fort mcmurray wf subregion were estimated to have the highest evaporation losses gibson et al 2019a 2020 one consideration we explore later on is that high evaporation rates may potentially contribute to increasing trends in chemical solutes trends alkalinity carbonate mineral saturation and increased lake ph values 2 2 water sampling due to the high dilution and high sensitivity to strong acids and acid precursors such as organic matter cook et al 2017 it is expected that the ramp lakes receive a significant percentage of their input from surface water snowmelt precipitation from rainfall and dust deposition based on previous assessments using radon 222 the groundwater contribution to the lakes is estimated to range from about 1 20 of annual inputs see schmidt et al 2010 although it has not been measured in all ramp lakes lake water chemistry was sampled annually for electrical conductivity ec ph total dissolved solids tds dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc major minor trace ions stable isotopes 18o and 2h stable water isotope results have been described in gibson et al 2019a 2020 tritium was also collected on a few occasions as described in gibson et al

lake center collection dates ranged across the months of july august september and october from 1999 to 2015 with 89 of samples collected between august and september clearly after dilution from snowpack melt had already occurred the sampling methods and lab procedures have been described in cook et al 2017 birks et al 2018 2019 and gibson et al 2020 and are consistent with approaches used previously in the region 2 3 aqueous ion balance error and ions compensation ion balance errors ibe were evaluated to identify acceptance criterion the ibe estimates are unbalanced in favor of the cations in the majority of water samples which is frequent in very low salinity waters tds range from 5 3 mg l 1 to 128 mg l 1 and mean of 31 1 mg l 1 in order to improve the ibe results total and ionized carboxylic acids concentration estimates c t and a respectively were applied to the ion balances oliver et al 1983 whitfield et al 2010 to estimate a the following relationship was applied 1 a k c t k h where k c t and h are the mass action quotient of the fulvic and humic acids organic fulvic and humic acids concentration and hydrogen ions respectively for the c t estimate doc concentration in mg l 1 was factored by 10 µeq mg 1 to each sample these estimates allowed us to achieve a charge balance of 25 as an acceptance criterion oliver et al 1983 whitfield et al 2010 after adding a to the sum of anions the majority of samples 80 of the 778 samples passed this criterion which confirmed that the imbalance was mainly due to the ionized component of the dissolved organic matter dom concentration in the lakes 2 4 speciation and statistical software saturation indices were determined using the equilibrium mass transfer model phreeqc 3 5 0 parkhurst and appelo 1999

represented in the equation below 2 alkalinity hco3 co3 2 oh h na k mg2 ca2 nh4 mn2 fe2 cl so4 2 no3 organic a are increasing temporally directly with organic a and dissolved calcium as illustrated in fig 2 a fig 3 and table 1 time series ph data for lakes color coded by subregion are illustrated in fig 2 b and overall depict increasing ph in all subregions and most individual lakes while field atmospheric and in situ lake co2 measurements were not a component of this investigation apparent pco2 and field ph values were compared to ph produced in the speciation model at atmospheric pco2 equilibrium most lakes show an apparent disequilibrium effect between atmospheric pco2 and the measured ph similar temporally we note continuous slight increments in dissolved chemistry and ph which are evident across the region during the 15 years of sampling fig 2 b to that which has been noted for dilute lakes bisogni and arroyo 1991 and which is frequently associated with seasonally ice covered lakes wolfe 2001 the results indicate that most lakes are supersaturated in pco2 relative to the atmosphere and the observed field ph is up to one unit lower than the ph at atmospheric equilibrium suggesting that the ramp lakes are active sources of co2 while based primarily on geochemical modeling and on a single euphotic zone sample for each lake in late summer this appears to be consistent from year to year and across the entire lake network suggesting that co2 evasion is likely a systematic ongoing process respiration of co2 and accumulation under lake ice between november and april would contribute to a reduction in ph and the dissolution of carbonates and subsequent release to the atmosphere in spring summer combined with higher temperatures and co2 uptake by phytoplankton and periphyton and or removal of co2 by photosynthesis lajewski et al 2003 this may promote carbonate precipitation and ph lake increase as observed in previous studies cole and caraco 1998 finlay et al 2015 for example pco2 values under ice were found to exceed open water values by 3 14 times for alaskan lakes kling et al 1992 wolfe 2001 high co2 evasion takes place during the lake turnover period that possibly goes unrecorded if sampling is conducted in the summer season overall without seasonal observations or under ice measurements it is difficult to conclude whether the co2 evasion process is close to steady state interannually or whether there are long term climate driven changes in ice cover that have exerted an overall upward influence on ph tendency while unconfirmed climate driven changes in ice cover appear to be at least part of the explanation of the observed ph effect a more detailed field based investigation including winter sampling under ice would be particularly informative to test this assertion and so is identified as a potentially important target for future investigations 3 2 lake water chemistry composition based on major ion compositions the ramp lakes were classified as ca mg hco3 a and ca mg na hco3 a water types fig 4 table 1 the ionized carboxylic acid contribution a from humic and fulvic substances to the overall ionic balance appears to be of importance for all lakes with the highest mean values of 278 and 193 µeq l 1 for the wf and ne lakes respectively near to the oil sands development areas and decreasing in importance with the distance from the oil sands projects towards the bm cm s and sm lakes with mean concentrations of 164 162 147 and 86 µeq l 1 respectively in addition minor concentrations of dissolved so4 and dissolved na were found to be present predominantly in the wf bm and ne lakes examination of the physico chemical characteristics of the lakes reveals that lake water color is an important indicator across the six subregions the cm lakes showed the highest mean color value of the six subregions with 210 mg l 1 pt fig 3 high water color is also typically associated with low turbidity with lowest values also observed for the cm lakes at 2 18 mg l 1 the contrast between these two parameters is indicative of watersheds dominated by ombrotrophic peatlands bogs and extensive permafrost which account for 65 88 of watershed land cover for the cm lakes gibson et al 2015 2020 the high natural color water is reflective of acidity generated by organic matter dissolution oliver et al 1983 lakes most susceptible to acidification show low alkalinity low chlorophyll and low color eilers et al 1983 principal component analysis pca a multivariate statistical technique was applied to evaluate the relationships between ph and physico chemical constituents pca biplots for each sub region fig 5 illustrate loadings for variables vectors as well as scores for individual lakes points proximity in the biplots is an indicator of similarity between lakes as well as an indicator of the importance of driving variables the first principal axis pc1 was found to account for between 38 and 49 of variability in the sub region datasets driven mainly by positive shifts in ph dic alkalinity and base cations ca and mg whereas the second principal axis pc2 found to account for between 13 and 20 of variability in the sub region datasets was driven by variables positively correlated with residence time such as color turbidity tss carboxylic acid and some nutrients the alignment of variables such as dic alkalinity and base cations with ph strongly suggests that carbonate dissolution may accompany ph increases in the lakes we note slightly different orientation of loadings vectors for shield lakes s attributed to fundamentally different weathering mechanisms in this sub region although the overall alignment of ph with carbonate dissolution indicators remains similar to other sub regions within the boreal plains for wf bm and cm sub regions chloride cl follows variations driven mainly by pc2 such as color turbidity total carboxylic acid ct whereas for ne sm and s cl aligns closely with ph and the carbonate dissolution drivers along pc1 generally cl is assumed to behave conservatively along hydrologic flowpaths although halite dissolution both active and glaciogenic are known to be significant sources of cl via springs and seeps emerging along the lower athabasca river its tributaries and to some extent lakes and wetlands e g saline lake saline fen given that colorado shale is present throughout the western subregions wf bm and cm we suggest that halite influences would be reduced in these areas compared to sources related to weathering of till or shale for ne sm and s sub regions where the colorado group is absent we suggest that cl related to such halite dissolution sources may be more important and is possibly may be linked to or concurrent with carbonate dissolution or carbonate weathering as lakes in sub region s are situated within crystalline bedrock terrain the likelihood is that carbonate and cl sources are also tracing near surface inputs to the lakes the carbonate dissolution hypothesis cook et al 2017 is further discussed and evaluated later on using results from saturation index calculations and stable isotope results 3 3 residence time and tds gibson et al 2020 reported residence time estimates for each lake in the ramp dataset using bathymetry and isotope based inflows 2002 2017 ordered from lowest to highest mean residence times by sub region were found to be ne 0 84 0 46 years wf 1 06 0 35 years sm 1 14 0 53 years bm 2 06 3 32 cm 2 41 1 02 and s 3 02 2 75 residence times for the entire dataset were found to be positively correlated with ph r 2 0 335 p 0 0177 δ 13 c dic r 2 0 392 p 0 005 and cl r 2 0 291 p 0 0406 and negatively correlated with color r 0 62 p 0 001 aluminum r 2 0 535 p 0 001 doc r 2 0 468 p 0 001 turbidity r 2 0 4 p 0 004 chlorophyll a r 2 0 344 p 0 0148 and most nutrients residence time was found to be poorly correlated with tds and most major ions except as noted the ne and wf lakes were found to contain the highest mean tds concentrations of 41 38 mg l 1 and 39 56 mg l 1 respectively and the highest mean total carbonate alkalinity tca values of 785 and 751 µeq l 1 respectively and showed a wider spread in ph values ranging from 5 99 to 8 12 for ne and 5 56 8 3 for wf the sm lakes were found to have the lowest mean ph value of 6 09 the lowest mean tds value of 11 8 mg l 1 and lowest mean tca value of 199 mg l 1 table 1 overall widely varying lake residence times produce a broad distribution of geochemical responses including in some cases significant differences in ionic dominances as noted by shapley et al 2005 further work needs to be conducted on the lakes to identify the influence of the residence time on the controls aligned mainly with pc2 see fig 5 although these are not thought to be the primary drivers of ph increases observed in the lakes 3 4 co2 alkalinity and ph in sweden long term changes in ph related to land use changes including forest fires have been studied and were attributed mainly to release of base cations and alkalinity previously trapped in the watershed soils remberg et al 1993 korsman and segerstrom 1998 such processes were also postulated to occur in a similar way for systems undergoing significant impacts from climate change lajewski et al 2003 reported historical nitric acid triggered carbonate weathering in the finger lakes new york at times of high summer surface water temperatures they concluded that efficient photosynthetic removal of co2 in surface water led to supersaturation with respect to calcite and resulted in increased alkalinity and ph values during summer houle et al 2010 in a study of lake chemistry of 47 temperate and boreal catchments in north america and europe between 1989 and 2005 found that climate related annual temperature increases were more strongly correlated with ph and alkalinity of the lake than with reduction in s deposition which were decreasing steadily in most areas due to emissions reductions the role of s and n from fugitive dust emissions on ph control via dissolution of carbonates was considered as a secondary process to increased summer surface water temperature picoplankton concentrations and or removal of co2 by photosynthesis lajewski et al 2003 and other processes such as co2 degassing and carbonate dissolution in lakes it is possible that s and n acidifying emissions dissolved in the rainfall and snowmelt play a role in carbonate dissolution within aquifers in recharge zones however these would be secondary to the main role that the dissolved co2 in the rainfall might play additional efforts are required to understand the role of the dust and the acidification precursors on carbonate dissolution in the recharge zones of aosr in alberta table 1 provides a statistical summary of the general chemistry which includes apparent pco2 and measurements of dic these parameters are in agreement with the ph data which allows us to infer that most of dic exists in the form of bicarbonate rather than as co2 within the lakes however a preliminary comparison of apparent dissolved co2 concentration ppm in the lakes relative to the measured dry atmospheric concentration mean 394 ppm for the aosr liggio et al 2019 provides first evidence that most lakes are co2 supersaturated with most lakes showing supersaturations up to six times that of atmospheric co2 fig 6 left these results indicate that most lakes fall below the theoretical equilibrium line therefore constitute a net source of co2 to the atmosphere cole and prairie 2009 during the open water period from may june to october fig 6 right however all lakes subregions seem to be trending towards atmospheric equilibrium suggesting that the atmospheric and dissolved co2 are buffered by the acid neutralization capacity of the alkalinity several lakes in the ne wf and bm subregions fall above the theoretical equilibrium line whereas lakes from the cm subregion fall clearly below the line lakes that fall above the theoretical equilibrium line are hardwater lakes with ph above 8 0 co2 sources to the lake are expected to include photosynthesis plant respiration in deep lakes and terrestrial watershed inputs in lakes with short hydrologic residence times groundwater is sometimes the cause of high dissolved co2 concentrations cole and prairie 2009 other processes that might generate abundant co2 such as permafrost thaw gibson et al 2019 also need to be considered precipitation driven run off augmented by permafrost thaw sources gibson et al 2019 might be one of the key mechanisms to explain the high co2 relative saturation in some lakes however high dissolved co2 content would lead to lake acidification and the trends observed point towards a general acid neutralization effect in all lakes of the region thus understanding the processes triggering the generation of alkalinity is very important to explain the increasing ph trends 3 5 ionized carboxylic acid a bicarbonates and ph the larger contribution of doc relative to the dic indicates that dissolved organic matter present in the form of weak organic acids are also an important component of the alkalinity and the ion balance herzeg and hesslein 1984 and contribute to the total alkalinity thereby buffering the lakes at low values of ph fig 7 while most lakes fall below the softwater hardwater lower boundary defined by ph 8 0 fig 7 finlay et al 2015 the majority of lakes in the cm sm wf ne and bm sub regions show a to hco3 ratios of 1 1 which generally produces waters with ph below 7 5 these lakes show a hco3 content of less than 400 µeq l 1 less numerous are a second group of lakes in bm wf ne and cm sub regions characterized by a to hco3 ratios of 1 2 which are found to have ph ranging up to 8 0 including hco3 concentrations up to 1000 µeq l 1 the third group very limited in number shows a to hco3 ratios of 1 5 present only in lakes ne 9 ne10 and ne11 wf7 and wf8 these can be considered hardwater lakes with ph values ranging between 8 0 and 8 5 the hco3 concentrations in the hardwater lakes attain concentrations up to 2000 µeq l 1 although a few lakes of the bm group seem to achieve a ph higher than 8 0 the hco3 concentrations only attain concentrations up to 1000 µeq l 1 finally a fourth group is represented by s lakes from the canadian shield region figs 5 and 7 having a to hco3 ratios that follow an unclear non incremental trend ph values in this group are less than 8 0 and the hco3 content is lower than 600 µeq l 1 as observed in fig 7 and described above most lakes sub groups are characterized by ph increasing continuously with respect to the total carbonate alkalinity which indicates that in highly dilute lakes the ph increases are driven by the dissolution of carbonates that are interacting with the co2 that interaction promotes the increase in hco3 also ionized carboxylic acid a sourced from dissolved organic matter contributes to the increased alkalinity but in lower proportion 3 6 sources of dissolved carbonate mineral and mineral equilibrium sediment core studies in the region were conducted by hazewinkel et al 2008 curtis et al 2010 kurek et al 2013 and laird et al 2013 to evaluate acidifications effects mainly through diatom inferred ph changes in boreal lakes to ne of alberta and one study to the ne of saskatchewan these investigations showed no evidence of widespread lake acidification trends associated with oil sands development hazewinkel et al 2008 curtis et al 2010 mushet et al 2017 cook et al 2017 lake sediment cores fisher et al 2009 within the 200 km radius of the aosr show recurrent stratigraphy comprising organic material and peat at the top with centimeter scale alternation of gyttja glacial sands silts and organic clays as well as marls up to 600 mm in thickness marl deposits predominate in areas comprising outwash sands and gravels and are primarily generated by moraine deposits fisher et al 2009 typical of the aosr gibson et al 2019a b postulated that carbonate dissolution in surface water was likely enhanced in surface water runoff by the permafrost thaw effect we evaluated carbonate mineral saturation states in the ramp lakes with the program phreeqc table 2 the calcite saturation index si illustrated in fig 8 left panel is driven by the alkalinity production reaching calcite saturation in lakes ne9 ne10 ne11 wf4 wf5 wf7 wf8 bm2 bm10 cm1 and s4 which were also found to be close to saturation with respect aragonite and dolomite for the same lakes enriched δ 13 c dic values reaching as high as 3 4 vpdb are considered to be indicative of carbonate dissolution while there is lithological evidence of occurrence of carbonates marls in lakes cores fisher et al 2009 that supports the hypothesis of calcite dissolution there is no direct geochemical evidence from the ramp watersheds to support the hypothesis of terrestrial or authigenic sources of carbonates or that these are year round processes however detailed wetland terrain mapping of the ramp lake watersheds does provide evidence of widespread bog and fen collapse features particularly in watersheds of the ne bm and cm sub regions although sampling of watershed runoff and permafrost has been limited to isotope sampling at a few sites gibson et al 2015 the relationship between high water yields and permafrost thaw features in ramp watersheds has been firmly established gibson et al 2019a and differences between tritium content in ramp lakes suggests different water sources are flowing to thaw lakes gibson et al 2016 while conducted outside ramp watersheds a recent inventory of various non permafrost wetland types in the region including bogs poor fens and rich fens established high potential for storage of dic doc and nutrients especially nh4 in thick low permeability peat deposits which extend to 11 m depth in some areas gibson et al 2021 mobilization of such stores by bog or fen collapse may be an important part of the ph story although further watershed based studies will likely be required to confirm this from arctic regions with degrading permafrost there is mounting evidence that biogeochemical processing of thawed permafrost substrates will amplify dic production in lakes zolkos and tank 2020 we suspect that similar processes are likely occurring in the ramp lakes located within a region near the southern limit of permafrost which has been classified as being vulnerable to water resources impacts related to permafrost thaw spence et al 2020 the softwater lakes are distributed regionally with higher dissolved organic matter and lower alkalinity content seem to show more depleted δ13cdic values in some cases approaching 24 vpdb fig 8 table 2 noted differences in mineral equilibria between lakes may be substantially explained by differences in the relationship between local geochemical and hydrologic inputs whereby lakes fed predominantly by shallow flowpaths through peat tend to be more dilute and show alkalinity dominated by organic acids whereas lakes fed predominantly by groundwater or lakes containing marl deposits tend to be carbonate buffered while such processes likely contribute to the observed ph shifts the permafrost thaw process and its linkage to co2 regulation is inferred but cannot be confirmed from data available from this study we note that input of dissolved carbonate material increases concentrations of hco3 and co3 2 whereas input of dissolved organic matter increases the ionized carboxylic acids given the ph of the lakes physico chemical controls established from pca relationships and variation in saturation indices the most important component to understand ph changes is hco3 and in addition for low ph lakes the ionized carboxylic acids which serve to neutralize the hydroxides and hydrogen ions entering the lakes although increases in ph values have been observed in most lakes fig 7 shows that in the aosr the presence of hardwater lakes with ph values higher than 8 0 finlay et al 2015 is limited to a few ne9 ne10 ne11 bm10 wf7 wf8 these lakes show atmospheric pco2 in equilibrium with alkalinity fig 8 enriched δ13cdic values and may possibly be precipitating authigenic carbonates these parameters support the hypothesis that the hardwater lakes are fed by groundwater discharge whereas the softwater lakes with low ph values supersaturated atmospheric pco2 values low alkalinity concentrations and more depleted δ13cdic values fig 8 are characteristic of regional recharge conditions and are likely reliant mainly on surface water all year monitoring will be required at least in selected ramp lakes to test this hypothesis and to firmly establish the importance of co2 evasion on the ph increase 4 conclusions the present study analyzed 15 years of physico chemical and ion data for 50 ramp lakes which are mostly highly dilute waters charge balances were improved and made useful for analysis by incorporating both ionized and total carboxylic acid contents of the waters and by using these estimates to predict the effect of organic matter dissolution on the alkalinity pca analysis land cover assessments indirect lithological evidence apparent pco2 estimates mineral equilibria and δ13cdic measurements have provided new insights into the significant role of carbonate dissolution and organic matter dissolution on geochemistry and ph regulation in the lakes modeled co2 concentrations for the lakes commonly exceeded atmospheric co2 estimates suggesting that lakes at low ph were co2 emitters whereas for lakes with ph greater than 8 5 the co2 is transformed into hco3 and co3 for these lakes pco2 declines below atmospheric values and we predict leads to hardwater sequestration of atmospheric co2 finlay et al 2015 it was apparent that all lakes in the region appeared to be trending towards atmospheric equilibrium at the time of sampling although seasonality of this process remains to be characterized the carboxylic acid contents and organic matter reflected in the high natural water color are relatively important to the total alkalinity budget in the watersheds particularly when the ph values are lower than 7 0 although the incremental concentrations of bicarbonates and carboxylic acids are present in most lakes only few lakes show an a to hco3 ratio of 1 5 with ph between 8 0 and 8 5 and hco3 concentrations approaching 2000 µeq l 1 these lakes seem to be in equilibrium with calcite aragonite and dolomite and display the most enriched values in δ13cdic between 3 0 and 3 5 vpdb these lakes also tend to be dominated by carbonate sources low ph low alkalinity lakes were found to be doc rich were dominated by organic matter dissolution processes and showed low δ13cdic between 24 0 and 18 0 vpdb these results support the assertion that carbonate dissolution as the main mechanism controlling the ph increase in the lakes in the context of long term acidification potential this should be viewed conservatively as a mechanism that may serve to temporarily pause the acidification process in a similar way to permafrost thaw despite the fact that the role of atmospheric co2 in the dissolution of carbonates in the watershed headwaters remains pending for further investigation the resumption of acidification is not certain in the short term the majority of the ramp lakes in the boreal alberta region are considered small therefore the decreasing permafrost melting process has significantly more impact on the net co2 relative saturation budget making more difficult to attain rapid theoretical equilibrium than in large alkaline lakes as those reported by finlay et al 2015 from the central canadian region thus as lakes eventually equilibrate to modified climatic conditions and as oil sands development proceeds across the region the acidification process may be inevitable in the long term while informative pca mineral equilibria pco2 and δ13cdic relationships would benefit from year round observations and sampling at least for selected lakes spanning the overall range of geochemical variability noted across the region in this study there is also a need to extend hydrologic and geochemical observations to characterize watershed sources especially via surface runoff sampling and installation and sampling wells in representative terrain units including collapse scars formed due to permafrost thawing such field based investigations are recommended to improve understanding of the role of allochthonous sources including shallow groundwater within peat within mineral soils and bedrock formation waters if applicable more field based information to assess ice cover duration and its role in modulating carbonate dissolution co2 evasion ph control would also serve to better understand the observed changes and sustainability of the current trajectory of water quality and quantity changes in the lakes and how they are expected to affect the regional land mosaic and regional hydrology in general surface lake sediments collection would be one strategy to assess the decomposition of organic matter and its effects on calcite saturation in the lakes finally a basic review of current parameters monitored within the water chemistry program is warranted if we now acknowledge that acidifying emissions may not be the only factor impacting the lake chemistry and ecosystem health declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
