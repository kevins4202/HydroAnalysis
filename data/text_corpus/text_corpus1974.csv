9870,salinity is one of the most widespread abiotic stresses affecting crop growth and productivity particularly when soil and irrigation water are salty field experiments were performed in an arid mediterranean climate to investigate agronomic responses of twenty one diverse barley genotypes to naturally occurring salinity three saline fields 7 72 ds m were irrigated with well water of three incremental salinity levels low 5 25 ds m intermediate 8 35 ds m and high 11 12 ds m the results revealed considerable genotypic variability at the three salinity levels and significant genotype by salinity interaction that could be traced to specific yield components increasing salinity level decreased performance of all agronomic traits but with different patterns with yield components determined earlier being more affected than traits determined later days to heading exhibited a strong and negative relationship with grain yield across all salinity levels while 1000 grain weight demonstrated the highest association with grain yield followed by number of grains per spike plant height and harvest index consistently at the three salinity levels the genotypes were classified based on their yield indices at the three salinity levels into six groups varying from highly salt tolerant group a to highly salt sensitive genotypes group f genotype by salinity interaction was studied based on rankings of performance across salinity levels close examination of yield component trends across levels allowed the identification of genotypes with different behaviors indicating the presence of variation in potentially different mechanisms of response to salinity this diversity of responses could be used in breeding to improve tolerance over the whole crop cycle from plant establishment and tillering to grain filling keywords salinity levels agronomic traits principal component analysis cluster analysis genotypic ranking ammi analysis 1 introduction barley is one of the main cereal crops worldwide it ranks fourth in terms of cereal acreage and total production after wheat maize and rice faostat 2021 its main uses are as feed for livestock and poultry and as the raw product for malt production newman and newman 2006 although its consumption as food traditional in several countries is increasing given its considerable health benefits as the high content in dietary fiber wood et al 1989 oscarsson et al 1996 salinity is one of the most widespread abiotic stresses that devastatingly impact soil fertility and productivity of field crops allel et al 2019 moustafa et al 2021a large agricultural areas in africa are located in arid and semi arid regions in which the quality of water is frequently salty and therefore the crops grown in these regions are affected by salinity shahid et al 2018 egypt is one of the countries that suffers from severe salinity problems nearly 35 of the cultivated lands in egypt are salinized kotb et al 2000 the causes for this are combinations of low precipitation poor drainage high evaporation and irrigation using saline water kotb et al 2000 moreover recent climate shifts are characterized by temperature increase and rainfall reduction this situation has the potential to increase soil salinity even further due to a decrease of salt leaching and an increase of evapotranspiration chen and mueller 2018 attia et al 2021 in these regions agricultural production will likely decrease unless measures are taken to ensure maintenance at least or even increase crop productivity this is an urgent need given the rising food demand due to population growth chhogyel and kumar 2018 under salinity stress the plants suffer from water stress due to physiological drought ion toxicity resulting from excessive salt uptake and difficulties in nutrient uptake and translocation to different plant parts mansour et al 2020 these processes lead to disorder in plant cells cellular functions photosynthesis and respiration silveira et al 2003 marschner 2011 desoky et al 2021 salinity can be mitigated by soil reclamation but it is a very expensive process on the other hand tolerant genotypes with a reduced yield penalty can be grown as a practical and inexpensive solution barley is considered as a moderately salt tolerant crop indeed its genotypes possess different potential to produce adequate yield under salinity stress in this respect wide genetic variation has been demonstrated by various researchers in published studies royo et al 2000 munns et al 2006 bchini et al 2010 hammami et al 2016 jamshidi and javanmard 2018 allel et al 2019 moustafa et al 2021b therefore it is possible to survey barley germplasm and explore the genotypic responses under different salinity levels this has been attempted using a variety of experimental set ups often considering the evaluation of salinity tolerance during the seedling stage bağci et al 2003 gao et al 2013 angessa et al 2017 mustafa et al 2019 nevertheless in order to have a real impact salt tolerance must be confirmed at yielding stage allel et al 2019 additionally the trials should be conducted under real field conditions yamaguchi and blumwald 2005 el hendawy et al 2017 mansour et al 2020 the use of gradients of environmental conditions assists in the evaluation of response functions of crops and genotypes igartua et al 1995 peñuelas et al 1997 which may have different shapes and show different slopes the response at a particular level of stress may not be indicative of the suitability of the genotypes tested at the range of conditions occurring naturally the study of genotypes under a range of real field conditions along with the use of salty water assists in detecting suitable genotypes that could be cultivated under salty conditions as well as parental genotypes that could be integrated in breeding programs igartua et al 1995 el hendawy et al 2017 salt tolerance is a complex trait several avoidance and tolerance strategies have been found as mechanisms to reduce salt uptake accumulation of salt in vacuoles discrimination of ions as potassium sodium chlorine and sulfate during uptake and translocation spychalla and desborough 1990 silveira et al 2003 hanin et al 2016 agronomically salinity tolerance can be defined as the capacity of genotypes to complete their growth cycle and produce acceptable grain yield under salinity stress ellis et al 2002 the model of munns and tester 2008 describing shoot growth responses as a combination of two different phases is widely accepted in this framework plants respond rapidly to increasing the external osmotic pressure and in a slower manner to the accumulation of salt mainly na in leaves this framework was later expanded specifically for wheat and barley harris et al 2010 to accommodate two intermediate levels of response reduced capture of resources and reduction in the efficacy in the use of resources the objectives of the present study were 1 to investigate the genotypic variation of a collection of twenty one barley genotypes under three salinity levels in naturally saline fields irrigated with salty water up to yielding stage 2 to assess the impact of different salinity levels on agronomic traits and to determine the relationship between grain yield and its components under different salinity levels and 3 to identify tolerant barley genotypes suitable to be grown under diverse salinity levels and to be used as parents for a barley breeding program for developing salt tolerant cultivars 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and agricultural practices two field experiments were performed at ras sudr experimental station desert research center southwest sinai egypt 29 37 n 42 41 e in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 growing seasons the experimental site is described as arid with very low precipitation about 50 mm annually the monthly temperature and cumulative precipitation of two seasons as well as long term averages of 35 years are shown in table s1 in this region as in most new reclaimed soils in egypt fresh surface water is unavailable therefore irrigation depends commonly on well water with some degree of salinity the irrigated water in present study was obtained from different three wells with three salinity levels low 5 25 ds m intermediate 8 35 ds m and high 11 12 ds m the furrow irrigation was applied following the standard practice of this region and it was terminated two weeks before harvest with a total of approximately 400 mm applied in each growing season the soil is a sandy loam throughout the profile 81 53 sand 9 77 silt and 8 70 clay the soil is also affected by salinity with an average electrical conductivity of the soil water extract 1 1 of 7 72 ds m table s2 sowing in both seasons occurred in the fourth week of november which is the optimal period of barley sowing in the area the phosphorus dose was added before sowing at a rate of 30 kg p ha as superphosphate 15 5 p2o5 and potassium was applied at a rate of 90 kg k ha as potassium sulfate 48 k2o nitrogen fertilizer was added at a rate of 143 kg n ha as ammonium sulfate 21 n in five splits at 10 day intervals after sowing weed control was applied as recommended for barley cultivation in the region using post emergence herbicides granstar 75 df tribenuron methyl sulfonylurea 750 g kg for broad leaf weed and axial xl pinoxaden and cloquintocet mexyl for grass weed control there was no relevant pest or disease pressure in the two seasons 2 2 plant material and experimental design twenty one barley genotypes hordeum vulgare l including seventeen six rowed and four two rowed from different origins egypt spain uk and international center icarda were used in this study table 1 the experimental design was a split plot in which salinity levels determined by the three different wells were located in the main plots and the genotypes were randomly distributed in sub plots in three replications each plot consisted of six rows 3 m long with a 20 cm spacing between rows sowing density was set at 400 seeds m2 2 3 traits the traits measured were days until awn tipping z49 plant height number of spikes m2 number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight grain yield and biological yield total aboveground dry matter days to awn tipping or days to heading to use a more common expression represented the number of days between sowing and the date when approximately 2 cm of awns were visible on 50 of stems the plant height cm was recorded as the distance from the soil surface to the top of the spike the number of spikes in 0 5 m2 was counted at maturity the number of grains per spike was obtained from ten randomly collected spikes at each plot the four central rows of each plot were hand harvested to measure grain yield and biological yield total aboveground dry matter based on the harvested area the grain and biological yields were converted to kilograms per hectare 1000 grain weight was measured as the weight of 1000 grains sampled from the harvest of four central rows 2 4 statistical analysis boxplots were constructed for the overall results at the three salinity levels using biovinci version 1 1 5 bioturing inc san diego california usa the yield index of gavuzzi et al 1997 was utilized to differentiate salt tolerant from salt sensitive genotypes it is based on the quantitative measure of yield responses to salinity stress under three levels and was calculated as yield index yi y s ȳ s where ys is the grain yield of each genotype at each salinity level and ȳs is the average grain yield of all genotypes at each salinity level hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using yield index according to the ward method ward jr 1963 to identify groups of barley genotypes with different responses to salinity moreover principal component analysis was applied on the averages of the traits measured at each salinity level to determine patterns of relationships among grain yield and the other agronomic traits analyses of variance were run according to the split plot design considering genotype year and salinity level as fixed factors the additive main effect and multiplicative interaction ammi model gauch 2006 was performed to assess patterns of genotypic stability for grain yield across salinity levels during two years the cluster and principal component analyses were performed using r statistical software library factoextra kassambara and mundt 2017 and ammi was performed using r statistical software library agricolae de mendiburu 2009 3 results 3 1 mean performance and genotypic ranking salinity levels displayed significant difference for all traits recorded as well as there was a diversity of genotypic responses across salinity levels table 2 genotype by salinity level interaction however was significant for all traits suggesting shifts in genotypic responses across salinity levels genotype by year interactions were low and mostly non significant as the three way interaction between year salinity and genotype therefore the results were consistent across years traits averages across salinity levels were significantly different among all three levels and traits except for days to heading and harvest index which were only significantly affected at the highest salinity level figs 1 2 the increase of salinity noticeably and significantly reduced the magnitude of all traits figs 1 2 and s1 s3 it should be noted that even the low salinity level could be considered as rather high compared to non saline soils and irrigation water the growth cycle of plants was shortened by salinity it was three days earlier at the intermediate level compared to the low one and a further four days earlier at the highest salinity level fig 1a likewise plant height was depressed under salinity by 6 9 cm at the intermediate level and 14 5 cm at the highest level compared to the lowest one fig 1b similarly grain yield and its components were significantly reduced in response to increasing salinity level the reductions due to increased salinity were linear for days to heading plant height number of spikes m2 number of grains spike and grain and biological yields on the contrary a bilinear response was noticed for 1000 grain weight with a less steep slope at the first salinity increment and steeper between the intermediate and the high salinity level moreover harvest index was not affected at the intermediate level and decreased only slightly though significantly at the highest level the genotypes were ranked based on their performance at the three salinity levels figs 3 and 4 representation of rankings facilitates the visualization of differences in genotypic responses better than the relative responses of the genotypes to the average of each salinity level fig s4 the comparison of rankings allowed differentiating relative patterns of response among the genotypes and identifying whether salinity affected similarly or differently to each yield component trait attending to grain yield several patterns of response for different genotypes across salinity levels were evident g4 and g14 were the most tolerant genotypes and displayed the highest ranks of grain yield fig 3a for some genotypes their ranks improved with salinity as g18 g19 improved in a sustained manner from low to high salinity whereas others g10 g1 g9 and g11 improved only in the highest salinity level on the contrary the ranks of g8 g5 and g12 decreased severely with increasing salinity level from the lowest to the highest level while the ranks of g17 and g16 decreased only in the highest salinity level these trends were also visible for each yield component as well as for biological yield fig 3b and harvest index fig 3c the genotypes followed similar trends for both biological yield and harvest index than for grain yield whereas for yield components the rankings of number of spikes m2 seemed unrelated to grain yield fig 4a otherwise the rankings of number of grains spike are related to grain yield fig 4b the genotypes varied comparatively less for 1000 grain weight fig 4c confirming the relatively low gei detected in the analysis of variance fig 4c there were clearly two groups of genotypes one with higher tgw from g15 to g19 and the other one with lower values from g6 to g20 across all three salinity levels with no crossover among them 3 2 yield index and cluster analysis yield index was calculated for evaluated barley genotypes at the three salinity levels table 3 g4 and g14 consistently were among the top 5 yielding genotypes at all three salinity levels on the other hand g6 and g21 were consistently among the bottom 5 across all three levels for other genotypes the responses were more variable they have been summarized in a dendrogram following a cluster analysis of yield indices the genotypes were classified to 6 groups a b c d e and f with 1 2 3 8 5 and 2 genotypes respectively fig 5 which can be divided as most salt tolerant group a to least salt tolerant group f 3 3 ammi and principal components biplot further classification of the specific genotypic responses was studied through an ammi analysis of grain yield the first two principal components explained almost gei effect 69 4 and 30 5 respectively the genotypes that were located close to origin were more stable across the three salinity levels fig 6 the results revealed that g1 intermediate salt tolerant g4 salt tolerant g15 intermediate salt sensitive g20 salt sensitive and g21 highly salt sensitive exhibited the least variable values whereas genotypes g8 salt sensitive g7 intermediate salt sensitive g5 intermediate salt sensitive g16 intermediate salt tolerant g14 highly salt tolerant g17 salt tolerant g6 highly salt sensitive and g11 intermediate salt sensitive showed the largest fluctuations across environments moreover the environments representing the three salinity levels were consistently located in different parts of the graph the first axis was caused by the contrast of genotypic responses between the low e1 e2 and the high e5 e6 salinity levels whereas the contrast between the intermediate site e3 e4 and the rest was responsible for the second axis furthermore principal components pcs were calculated for estimating the association between agronomic traits and the genotypic response toward these traits at each salinity level the first two pcs pc1 and pc2 were employed to construct pc biplots fig 7 as they summarized most of the variance at the three salinity levels 81 58 75 48 and 69 40 respectively acute angles among trait vectors indicate positive correlations angles between 90 and 180 indicate from no to negative correlation among traits the agronomic traits at the three salinity levels could be divided into three groups fig 7a c in the first group days to heading presented a strong and consistent negative correlation with grain yield across all salinity levels indicating that earlier genotypes performed always better days to heading also display a negative association with by but not as strong at an intermediate position the vector of number of spikes m2 was located its relationship with grain yield was is close to 0 at the low and intermediate levels fig 7a and b and slightly positive at the high level fig 7c this yield component was strongly affected by salinity fig 1c but seems less related to grain yield the last group included the remaining traits biological yield 1000 grain weight number of grains spike plant height and harvest index their vectors formed a bundle around the one of grain yield with which all had positive correlations at all three levels 1000 grain weight had the highest correlation with grain yield followed by plant height number of grains spike and harvest index at the highest salinity level 1000 grain weight number of grains spike and grain yield were closer to each other than at the other levels and the same can be stated for plant height and biological yield furthermore correlations for each trait between different salinity levels were calculated and presented in table 4 it was noted that the correlation was higher between low and intermediate levels as well as between intermediate and high levels but it was lower between the lowest and highest levels 4 discussion salinity either present in the soil or irrigation water has destructive impacts on crop growth and production when salinity is present only in the soil it is sometimes possible to devise irrigation strategies to eliminate the salt from the root area however large agricultural areas are located in arid and semi arid regions where the irrigation water can be salty shahid et al 2018 long term use of salty water in irrigation aggravates substantially soil alkalization and salinization wei et al 2019 besides using salty water destructively impacts the available soil nitrogen denitrification and nitrification irshad et al 2005 these constraints cause a considerable decline in soil fertility and productivity of field crops subsequently in cases like ours in which both the soil and the irrigation water are salty the strategy to cope with this condition must include developing genetically tolerant materials numerous investigations have explored the influence of different salinity levels on the growth and productivity of barley genotypes in pot experiments patterson et al 2009 zeng et al 2013 izadi et al 2014 allel et al 2018 boussora et al 2019 ebrahim et al 2020 despite their interest pot experiments with salinity as a treatment are difficult to control particularly if the soil is used as the growth medium poorter et al 2012 therefore it is important to expose barley genotypes to realistic field conditions and assess their response in salt affected soil and or using salty water for irrigation munns and james 2003 yamaguchi and blumwald 2005 there are many studies evaluated salinity tolerance of barley genotypes in early stages as germination and seedling however the correlation between tolerance at seedling and adult stages found is usually poor in barley norlyn and epstein 1982 tavakkoli et al 2012 therefore to have a practical use for breeding programs it is essential to investigate salt tolerance of barley genotypes at yielding stage allel et al 2019 this type of study contributes to identifying adaptive and salt tolerant genotypes that could be cultivated under salinity conditions as well as parental genotypes that can be used in breeding programs for further developing salt tolerant cultivars particularly if different salinity tolerance features are identified in the present study twenty one barley genotypes including well adapted genotypes and exotic cultivars were evaluated under three salinity levels low intermediate and high in relative terms in saline fields and irrigated by salty water unfortunately there was no adjacent field that could be used as a non saline control three salinity levels are not enough to construct full response curves but provide enough amplitude of stress incidence to identify differential response dynamics between the genotypes we found considerable genotypic variability at the three salinity levels and significant genotype by salinity interaction that can be traced to the specific yield components involved in each case likewise bağci et al 2003 bchini et al 2010 hammami et al 2016 jamshidi and javanmard 2018 and allel et al 2019 reported highly significant differences between salinity treatments and barley genotypes in agronomic traits moreover we found that all agronomic traits decreased with increasing salinity but following different patterns figs 1 2 and s1 s3 some traits were more sensitive and affected by salinity than others overall reduction in number of spikes m2 followed a much steeper pattern than reductions of number of grains per spike and 1000 grain weight with increasing salinity this last trait was severely affected only at the highest salinity this fact and the slight reduction of harvest index also observed at high salinity indicate that there was a problem in grain filling specifically at the high salinity level this could have been caused by either reduced photosynthesis reduced re translocation of assimilates from leaves and stem to grains or both the sensitivity of these component traits actually reflects the amount of time elapsed since the period in which they were determined in the plant cycle earlier for number of spikes m2 and successively less for number of grains per spike and 1000 grain weight slafer 2003 the same could be stated for the large decrease observed for biological yield which is a function of the entire plant cycle and the much smaller change observed for harvest index which is a function of the last stages of the plant cycle moreover harvest index was not affected at the intermediate salinity which indicates that the sum of photosynthesis and re translocation of assimilates was good at this level which probably started to be impaired only at the high salinity level the obtained results are in consonance with those disclosed by el hendawy et al 2005 asgari et al 2011 ayed slama et al 2018 as they demonstrated that salinity has severe effects on grain yield number of spike m2 number of grain spike and 1000 grain weight more than on other traits of wheat or barley besides detailed field and controlled conditions studies in barley and wheat also found an increase of harvest index in intermediate saline conditions katerji et al 2009 harris et al 2010 before going down slightly at higher levels in the last study the authors claimed that yield was strongly associated with grain number and shoot dry matter production much less with grain size and harvest index combining the frameworks of the dynamics of yield component determination slafer 2003 and occurrence of osmotic and toxic stresses during exposure to saline conditions munns and tester 2008 it is expected that earlier determined yield components may be more affected by osmotic stress and later determined components are more affected by toxic stress if present it is sensible to think that responses to osmotic and toxic stresses could be under the control of different sets of genes and thus it would be possible to find genotypes that are differentially responsive to both stresses of the variables recorded in this study it is expected that osmotic stress affected the most number of spikes m2 and the biological yield then number of grains spike which is determined during the late reproductive stage and around anthesis could be affected by both osmotic and toxic stresses finally 1000 grain weight and harvest index are influenced by both osmotic and toxic stresses at the genotypic level although the genotype factor was prevalent in the analysis of variance for grain yield the genotypes exhibited relevant rank changes according to their agronomic performance at the three salinity levels genotypes g4 g14 exhibited the highest ranks of grain yield as well as good ranks of biological yield and harvest index at all salinity levels this was due to a better maintenance of number of spikes across salinity levels improved rankings with salinity increasing as well as having a high number of grains spike and maintaining relatively good 1000 grain weight and harvest index although they did not stand out in these last two traits at high salinity genotypes g1 and g10 on the other hand saw their ranks of grain yield biological yield and harvest index improved with increasing salinity indicating relatively good tolerance overall this improvement was due to improving their number of spikes m2 number of grains spike and grain filling on the contrary increasing salinity decreased severely grain yield of g16 and g17 they yielded well at the lowest salinity level but had steep reductions of grain yield as salinity increased the reduction was due to decreasing number of spikes m2 number of grains spike and 1000 grain yield which indicates that they had bad grain filling with increasing of salinity level among the 2 rowed cultivars there were striking differences between european genotypes g18 and g19 and egyptian ones g5 and g6 the european ones had intermediate performances at low salinity and improved relatively at high salinity levels due to better maintenance of biological yield and number of spikes m2 one of the egyptian genotypes g6 performed poorly overall whereas g5 descended from one of the best 5 at the lowest salinity level to one of the worst 17 at high salinity this difference in tolerance occurred despite the egyptian genotypes being approximately 10 days earlier than the europeans which goes against the overall association between yield and earliness this results suggests that european 2 rowed cultivars are potential sources to improve salinity tolerance for short cycle egyptian conditions on the other hand the two european 6 rowed cultivars g20 and g21 were clearly the least salt tolerant of all the results reveal the potential of using tolerant genotypes g4 g14 g1 and g10 under high salinity levels as commercial cultivars or high yielding salt tolerant parents in barley breeding programs in particular g4 and g14 show a relative reduction of harvest index and 1000 grain weight at the highest salinity compared to g1 and g10 the genotypes g1 and g10 exhibited good tolerance across all traits and levels they are not as good in absolute terms at the lowest salinity level because their biological yields are intermediate in a breeding program they could be a donor of salt tolerance for g4 and g14 provided good biomass production and tillering are also monitored g15 on the other hand seems a cultivar strongly affected by osmotic stress with sharp decreases of biological yield and number of spikes but rather tolerant for number of grains spike and one of the best for harvest index and 1000 grain weight at high salinity level it could carry specific mechanisms and genes to cope with the building up of toxic stress in the last part of the growth cycle therefore it could be an option as a parent of a breeding program to combine with g4 or g14 which have the opposite dynamics of components response to salinity on the other hand some genotypes g5 g8 g12 g16 and g17 had good performance under low salinity levels but not at high salinity level due to the effect of one or more yield components it is likely that the mechanisms that they have to resist osmotic stress at low and intermediate levels are surpassed at the highest level additionally the ammi analysis indicated remarkable repeatability of results across years and salinity levels with almost no indication of year by environment interaction it also showed that the salt tolerant genotypes g1 and g4 were located close to the origin indicating that they were stable genotypes across the three salinity levels therefore the identified salt tolerant genotypes could be recommended for growing under the entire range of salinity conditions as tested in this experiment indeed using multiple parameters as genotypic ranking cluster analysis and ammi analysis provide useful information and increase the accuracy for identifying salt tolerant genotypes this assists in classifying the evaluated genotypes according to their salt tolerance even under different salinity levels multiple agronomic parameters for tolerance classification was applied previously by zeng et al 2002 el hendawy et al 2005 bchini et al 2010 ben khaled et al 2012 and hammami et al 2016 for assessing salt tolerance genotypes in different crops as barley rice and wheat the first two principal components were applied to construct three informative biplots based on averages of genotypes at each salinity level strong positive correlations were detected between 1000 grain weight and grain yield as well as plant height harvest index and number of grains spike while number of spikes m2 exhibited a slight positive association with grain yield this reveals that under salinity conditions 1000 grain weight and number of grains spike could be used as a good indicator for grain yield but number of spikes m2 is less important for this purpose likewise bchini et al 2010 akbarpour et al 2015 and allel et al 2019 demonstrated a positive relationship between 1000 grain weight number of grains spike and grain yield under salinity conditions besides we found a significant association between grain yield and plant height at the three salinity levels similar findings were disclosed by saade et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 wiegmann et al 2019 curiously this result revealed that plant height exhibited a positive association with grain yield under salinity conditions which is an advantage for breeding under these conditions this is good news for plant breeders as plant height usually considered a surrogate of aerial biomass is far easier to determine at the scale needed in plant breeding trials we can only speculate with the reasons for this finding plant height is contributed to a remarkable extent by the length of the peduncle and the spike which is determined late in the growth cycle same as 1000 grain weight therefore salt responses at the late stages of the plant cycle could affect these two variables similarly something that is supported by the closeness of their vectors in the principal component analyses otherwise there was a strong negative association of grain yield with days to heading at all salinity levels at the same time salinity produced a decrease in time to flowering apparently the strategy of escape i e to complete the cycle as soon as possible contributes to good agronomic performance under saline conditions similarly thalji and shalaldeh 2007 saade et al 2016 and wiegmann et al 2019 demonstrated a negative correlation between grain yield and days to heading under salinity conditions the pc biplot is an effective statistical analysis to visualize the interrelationship among evaluated genotypes and traits desoky et al 2020 mansour et al 2021 kamara et al 2021 the first principal component pc1 ordered the genotypes very similar to grain yield at the three salinity levels moreover 1000 grain weight number of grains spike and plant height had large loadings on pc1 and low ones on pc2 while number of spikes m2 and biological yield had large loading on pc2 at the three levels and harvest index at the high salinity level it could be speculated that pc1 could be more related to osmotic stress and pc2 could be more related to toxic stress furthermore g4 and g14 performed well in that respect while g13 g20 and g21 performed badly besides the positions of g16 with a large positive score doing well in early determined components number of spikes m2 and biological yield and bad in late determined ones otherwise g15 had an opposite behavior with tolerance expressed only in the late determined components the correlation between traits across different salinity levels indicated a high correlation between low and intermediate levels as well as between intermediate and high levels but slight between low and high levels from a breeding point of view these results indicate the possibility of evaluating genotypes under low salinity to be grown under low or intermediate levels also it would be possible to evaluate genotypes under intermediate salinity to be grown under intermediate and high salinity conditions however it is not recommended to evaluate genotypes under low level or no salinity at all to be grown under high salinity conditions 5 conclusion considerable genotypic variability was detected across the three salinity levels as well as significant genotype by salinity interaction which implies shifting in genotypic responses across salinity levels genotypes g4 g14 g1 and g10 displayed high and stable salt tolerance and are recommended to grown commercially in saline areas and as parental genotypes in barley breeding programs for further developing salt tolerant cultivars looking into the dynamics of yield components responses over three salinity levels allowed the identification of genotypes displaying tolerance based on potentially different mechanisms certain genotypes as g15 were strongly affected by osmotic stress with sharp decreases of biological yield and number of spikes but remarkable tolerance later determined components like number of grains spike and 1000 grain weight at high salinity conversely genotypes g5 g8 g12 g16 and g17 had good performance under low salinity levels but not at high salinity level due to the effect of one or more yield components these two responses are complementary could be the result of different tolerance mechanisms and could be combined through breeding to achieve a high level of tolerance across the entire growth cycle and salinity levels employing multiple analyses such as genotypic ranking yield index cluster analysis and ammi increased the accuracy of classifying the genotypes according to their salt tolerance under different salinity levels our study offers another relevant finding for breeding for salt tolerance strong positive associations were detected between 1000 grain weight and grain yield as well as plant height harvest index and number of grains spike accordingly these traits could be used as a good and easy indicator for grain yield under salinity conditions but number of spikes m2 is less important for this purpose it is not recommended to evaluate genotypes under low or no salinity levels to be grown under high salinity conditions as a high correlation was detected between low and intermediate levels while slight between low and high levels declaration of competing interest the authors declare

al 2021a large agricultural areas in africa are located in arid and semi arid regions in which the quality of water is frequently salty and therefore the crops grown in these regions are affected by salinity shahid et al 2018 egypt is one of the countries that suffers from severe salinity problems nearly 35 of the cultivated lands in egypt are salinized kotb et al 2000 the causes for this are combinations of low precipitation poor drainage high evaporation and irrigation using saline water kotb et al 2000 moreover recent climate shifts are characterized by temperature increase and rainfall reduction this situation has the potential to increase soil salinity even further due to a decrease of salt leaching and an increase of evapotranspiration chen and mueller 2018 attia et al 2021 in these regions agricultural production will likely decrease unless measures are taken to ensure maintenance at least or even increase crop productivity this is an urgent need given the rising food demand due to population growth chhogyel and kumar 2018 under salinity stress the plants suffer from water stress due to physiological drought ion toxicity resulting from excessive salt uptake and difficulties in nutrient uptake and translocation to different plant parts mansour et al 2020 these processes lead to disorder in plant cells cellular functions photosynthesis and respiration silveira et al 2003 marschner 2011 desoky et al 2021 salinity can be mitigated by soil reclamation but it is a very expensive process on the other hand tolerant genotypes with a reduced yield penalty can be grown as a practical and inexpensive solution barley is considered as a moderately salt tolerant crop indeed its genotypes possess different potential to produce adequate yield under salinity stress in this respect wide genetic variation has been demonstrated by various researchers in published studies royo et al 2000 munns et al 2006 bchini et al 2010 hammami et al 2016 jamshidi and javanmard 2018 allel et al 2019 moustafa et al 2021b therefore it is possible to survey barley germplasm and explore the genotypic responses under different salinity levels this has been attempted using a variety of experimental set ups often considering the evaluation of salinity tolerance during the seedling stage bağci et al 2003 gao et al 2013 angessa et al 2017 mustafa et al 2019 nevertheless in order to have a real impact salt tolerance must be confirmed at yielding stage allel et al 2019 additionally the trials should be conducted under real field conditions yamaguchi and blumwald 2005 el hendawy et al 2017 mansour et al 2020 the use of gradients of environmental conditions assists in the evaluation of response functions of crops and genotypes igartua et al 1995 peñuelas et al 1997 which may have different shapes and show different slopes the response at a particular level of stress may not be indicative of the suitability of the genotypes tested at the range of conditions occurring naturally the study of genotypes under a range of real field conditions along with the use of salty water assists in detecting suitable genotypes that could be cultivated under salty conditions as well as parental genotypes that could be integrated in breeding programs igartua et al 1995 el hendawy et al 2017 salt tolerance is a complex trait several avoidance and tolerance strategies have been found as mechanisms to reduce salt uptake accumulation of salt in vacuoles discrimination of ions as potassium sodium chlorine and sulfate during uptake and translocation spychalla and desborough 1990 silveira et al 2003 hanin et al 2016 agronomically salinity tolerance can be defined as the capacity of genotypes to complete their growth cycle and produce acceptable grain yield under salinity stress ellis et al 2002 the model of munns and tester 2008 describing shoot growth responses as a combination of two different phases is widely accepted in this framework plants respond rapidly to increasing the external osmotic pressure and in a slower manner to the accumulation of salt mainly na in leaves this framework was later expanded specifically for wheat and barley harris et al 2010 to accommodate two intermediate levels of response reduced capture of resources and reduction in the efficacy in the use of resources the objectives of the present study were 1 to investigate the genotypic variation of a collection of twenty one barley genotypes under three salinity levels in naturally saline fields irrigated with salty water up to yielding stage 2 to assess the impact of different salinity levels on agronomic traits and to determine the relationship between grain yield and its components under different salinity levels and 3 to identify tolerant barley genotypes suitable to be grown under diverse salinity levels and to be used as parents for a barley breeding program for developing salt tolerant cultivars 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and agricultural practices two field experiments were performed at ras sudr experimental station desert research center southwest sinai egypt 29 37 n 42 41 e in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 growing seasons the experimental site is described as arid with very low precipitation about 50 mm annually the monthly temperature and cumulative precipitation of two seasons as well as long term averages of 35 years are shown in table s1 in this region as in most new reclaimed soils in egypt fresh surface water is unavailable therefore irrigation depends commonly on well water with some degree of salinity the irrigated water in present study was obtained from different three wells with three salinity levels low 5 25 ds m intermediate 8 35 ds m and high 11 12 ds m the furrow irrigation was applied following the standard practice of this region and it was terminated two weeks before harvest with a total of approximately 400 mm applied in each growing season the soil is a sandy loam throughout the profile 81 53 sand 9 77 silt and 8 70 clay the soil is also affected by salinity with an average electrical conductivity of the soil water extract 1 1 of 7 72 ds m table s2 sowing in both seasons occurred in the fourth week of november which is the optimal period of barley sowing in the area the phosphorus dose was added before sowing at a rate of 30 kg p ha as superphosphate 15 5 p2o5 and potassium was applied at a rate of 90 kg k ha as potassium sulfate 48 k2o nitrogen fertilizer was added at a rate of 143 kg n ha as ammonium sulfate 21 n in five splits at 10 day intervals after sowing weed control was applied as recommended for barley cultivation in the region using post emergence herbicides granstar 75 df tribenuron methyl sulfonylurea 750 g kg for broad leaf weed and axial xl pinoxaden and cloquintocet mexyl for grass weed control there was no relevant pest or disease pressure in the two seasons 2 2 plant material and experimental design twenty one barley genotypes hordeum vulgare l including seventeen six rowed and four two rowed from different origins egypt spain uk and international center icarda were used in this study table 1 the experimental design was a split plot in which salinity levels determined by the three different wells were located in the main plots and the genotypes were randomly distributed in sub plots in three replications each plot consisted of six rows 3 m long with a 20 cm spacing between rows sowing density was set at 400 seeds m2 2 3 traits the traits measured were days until awn tipping z49 plant height number of spikes m2 number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight grain yield and biological yield total aboveground dry matter days to awn tipping or days to heading to use a more common expression represented the number of days between sowing and the date when approximately 2 cm of awns were visible on 50 of stems the plant height cm was recorded as the distance from the soil surface to the top of the spike the number of spikes in 0 5 m2 was counted at maturity the number of grains per spike was obtained from ten randomly collected spikes at each plot the four central rows of each plot were hand harvested to measure grain yield and biological yield total aboveground dry matter based on the harvested area the grain and biological yields were converted to kilograms per hectare 1000 grain weight was measured as the weight of 1000 grains sampled from the harvest of four central rows 2 4 statistical analysis boxplots were constructed for the overall results at the three salinity levels using biovinci version 1 1 5 bioturing inc san diego california usa the yield index of gavuzzi et al 1997 was utilized to differentiate salt tolerant from salt sensitive genotypes it is based on the quantitative measure of yield responses to salinity stress under three levels and was calculated as yield index yi y s ȳ s where ys is the grain yield of each genotype at each salinity level and ȳs is the average grain yield of all genotypes at each salinity level hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using yield index according to the ward method ward jr 1963 to identify groups of barley genotypes with different responses to salinity moreover principal component analysis was applied on the averages of the traits measured at each salinity level to determine patterns of relationships among grain yield and the other agronomic traits analyses of variance were run according to the split plot design considering genotype year and salinity level as fixed factors the additive main effect and multiplicative interaction ammi model gauch 2006 was performed to assess patterns of genotypic stability for grain yield across salinity levels during two years the cluster and principal component analyses were performed using r statistical software library factoextra kassambara and mundt 2017 and ammi was performed using r statistical software library agricolae de mendiburu 2009 3 results 3 1 mean performance and genotypic ranking salinity levels displayed significant difference for all traits recorded as well as there was a diversity of genotypic responses across salinity levels table 2 genotype by salinity level interaction however was significant for all traits suggesting shifts in genotypic responses across salinity levels genotype by year interactions were low and mostly non significant as the three way interaction between year salinity and genotype therefore the results were consistent across years traits averages across salinity levels were significantly different among all three levels and traits except for days to heading and harvest index which were only significantly affected at the highest salinity level figs 1 2 the increase of salinity noticeably and significantly reduced the magnitude of all traits figs 1 2 and s1 s3 it should be noted that even the low salinity level could be considered as rather high compared to non saline soils and irrigation water the growth cycle of plants was shortened by salinity it was three days earlier at the intermediate level compared to the low one and a further four days earlier at the highest salinity level fig 1a likewise plant height was depressed under salinity by 6 9 cm at the intermediate level and 14 5 cm at the highest level compared to the lowest one fig 1b similarly grain yield and its components were significantly reduced in response to increasing salinity level the reductions due to increased salinity were linear for days to heading plant height number of spikes m2 number of grains spike and grain and biological yields on the contrary a bilinear response was noticed for 1000 grain weight with a less steep slope at the first salinity increment and steeper between the intermediate and the high salinity level moreover harvest index was not affected at the intermediate level and decreased only slightly though significantly at the highest level the genotypes were ranked based on their performance at the three salinity levels figs 3 and 4 representation of rankings facilitates the visualization of differences in genotypic responses better than the relative responses of the genotypes to the average of each salinity level fig s4 the comparison of rankings allowed differentiating relative patterns of response among the genotypes and identifying whether salinity affected similarly or differently to each yield component trait attending to grain yield several patterns of response for different genotypes across salinity levels were evident g4 and g14 were the most tolerant genotypes and displayed the highest ranks of grain yield fig 3a for some genotypes their ranks improved with salinity as g18 g19 improved in a sustained manner from low to high salinity whereas others g10 g1 g9 and g11 improved only in the highest salinity level on the contrary the ranks of g8 g5 and g12 decreased severely with increasing salinity level from the lowest to the highest level while the ranks of g17 and g16 decreased only in the highest salinity level these trends were also visible for each yield component as well as for biological yield fig 3b and harvest index fig 3c the genotypes followed similar trends for both biological yield and harvest index than for grain yield whereas for yield components the rankings of number of spikes m2 seemed unrelated to grain yield fig 4a otherwise the rankings of number of grains spike are related to grain yield fig 4b the genotypes varied comparatively less for 1000 grain weight fig 4c confirming the relatively low gei detected in the analysis of variance fig 4c there were clearly two groups of genotypes one with higher tgw from g15 to g19 and the other one with lower values from g6 to g20 across all three salinity levels with no crossover among them 3 2 yield index and cluster analysis yield index was calculated for evaluated barley genotypes at the three salinity levels table 3 g4 and g14 consistently were among the top 5 yielding genotypes at all three salinity levels on the other hand g6 and g21 were consistently among the bottom 5 across all three levels for other genotypes the responses were more variable they have been summarized in a dendrogram following a cluster analysis of yield indices the genotypes were classified to 6 groups a b c d e and f with 1 2 3 8 5 and 2 genotypes respectively fig 5 which can be divided as most salt tolerant group a to least salt tolerant group f 3 3 ammi and principal components biplot further classification of the specific genotypic responses was studied through an ammi analysis of grain yield the first two principal components explained almost gei effect 69 4 and 30 5 respectively the genotypes that were located close to origin were more stable across the three salinity levels fig 6 the results revealed that g1 intermediate salt tolerant g4 salt tolerant g15 intermediate salt sensitive g20 salt sensitive and g21 highly salt sensitive exhibited the least variable values whereas genotypes g8 salt sensitive g7 intermediate salt sensitive g5 intermediate salt sensitive g16 intermediate salt tolerant g14 highly salt tolerant g17 salt tolerant g6 highly salt sensitive and g11 intermediate salt sensitive showed the largest fluctuations across environments moreover the environments representing the three salinity levels were consistently located in different parts of the graph the first axis was caused by the contrast of genotypic responses between the low e1 e2 and the high e5 e6 salinity levels whereas the contrast between the intermediate site e3 e4 and the rest was responsible for the second axis furthermore principal components pcs were calculated for estimating the association between agronomic traits and the genotypic response toward these traits at each salinity level the first two pcs pc1 and pc2 were employed to construct pc biplots fig 7 as they summarized most of the variance at the three salinity levels 81 58 75 48 and 69 40 respectively acute angles among trait vectors indicate positive correlations angles between 90 and 180 indicate from no to negative correlation among traits the agronomic traits at the three salinity levels could be divided into three groups fig 7a c in the first group days to heading presented a strong and consistent negative correlation with grain yield across all salinity levels indicating that earlier genotypes performed always better days to heading also display a negative association with by but not as strong at an intermediate position the vector of number of spikes m2 was located its relationship with grain yield was is close to 0 at the low and intermediate levels fig 7a and b and slightly positive at the high level fig 7c this yield component was strongly affected by salinity fig 1c but seems less related to grain yield the last group included the remaining traits biological yield 1000 grain weight number of grains spike plant height and harvest index their vectors formed a bundle around the one of grain yield with which all had positive correlations at all three levels 1000 grain weight had the highest correlation with grain yield followed by plant height number of grains spike and harvest index at the highest salinity level 1000 grain weight number of grains spike and grain yield were closer to each other than at the other levels and the same can be stated for plant height and biological yield furthermore correlations for each trait between different salinity levels were calculated and presented in table 4 it was noted that the correlation was higher between low and intermediate levels as well as between intermediate and high levels but it was lower between the lowest and highest levels 4 discussion salinity either present in the soil or irrigation water has destructive impacts on crop growth and production when salinity is present only in the soil it is sometimes possible to devise irrigation strategies to eliminate the salt from the root area however large agricultural areas are located in arid and semi arid regions where the irrigation water can be salty shahid et al 2018 long term use of salty water in irrigation aggravates substantially soil alkalization and salinization wei et al 2019 besides using salty water destructively impacts the available soil nitrogen denitrification and nitrification irshad et al 2005 these constraints cause a considerable decline in soil fertility and productivity of field crops subsequently in cases like ours in which both the soil and the irrigation water are salty the strategy to cope with this condition must include developing genetically tolerant materials numerous investigations have explored the influence of different salinity levels on the growth and productivity of barley genotypes in pot experiments patterson et al 2009 zeng et al 2013 izadi et al 2014 allel et al 2018 boussora et al 2019 ebrahim et al 2020 despite their interest pot experiments with salinity as a treatment are difficult to control particularly if the soil is used as the growth medium poorter et al 2012 therefore it is important to expose barley genotypes to realistic field conditions and assess their response in salt affected soil and or using salty water for irrigation munns and james 2003 yamaguchi and blumwald 2005 there are many studies evaluated salinity tolerance of barley genotypes in early stages as germination and seedling however the correlation between tolerance at seedling and adult stages found is usually poor in barley norlyn and epstein 1982 tavakkoli et al 2012 therefore to have a practical use for breeding programs it is essential to investigate salt tolerance of barley genotypes at yielding stage allel et al 2019 this type of study contributes to identifying adaptive and salt tolerant genotypes that could be cultivated under salinity conditions as well as parental genotypes that can be used in breeding programs for further developing salt tolerant cultivars particularly if different salinity tolerance features are identified in the present study twenty one barley genotypes including well adapted genotypes and exotic cultivars were evaluated under three salinity levels low intermediate and high in relative terms in saline fields and irrigated by salty water unfortunately there was no adjacent field that could be used as a non saline control three salinity levels are not enough to construct full response curves but provide enough amplitude of stress incidence to identify differential response dynamics between the genotypes we found considerable genotypic variability at the three salinity levels and significant genotype by salinity interaction that can be traced to the specific yield components involved in each case likewise bağci et al 2003 bchini et al 2010 hammami et al 2016 jamshidi and javanmard 2018 and allel et al 2019 reported highly significant differences between salinity treatments and barley genotypes in agronomic traits moreover we found that all agronomic traits decreased with increasing salinity but following different patterns figs 1 2 and s1 s3 some traits were more sensitive and affected by salinity than others overall reduction in number of spikes m2 followed a much steeper pattern than reductions of number of grains per spike and 1000 grain weight with increasing salinity this last trait was severely affected only at the highest salinity this fact and the slight reduction of harvest index also observed at high salinity indicate that there was a problem in grain filling specifically at the high salinity level this could have been caused by either reduced photosynthesis reduced re translocation of assimilates from leaves and stem to grains or both the sensitivity of these component traits actually reflects the amount of time elapsed since the period in which they were determined in the plant cycle earlier for number of spikes m2 and successively less for number of grains per spike and 1000 grain weight slafer 2003 the same could be stated for the large decrease observed for biological yield which is a function of the entire plant cycle and the much smaller change observed for harvest index which is a function of the last stages of the plant cycle moreover harvest index was not affected at the intermediate salinity which indicates that the sum of photosynthesis and re translocation of assimilates was good at this level which probably started to be impaired only at the high salinity level the obtained results are in consonance with those disclosed by el hendawy et al 2005 asgari et al 2011 ayed slama et al 2018 as they demonstrated that salinity has severe effects on grain yield number of spike m2 number of grain spike and 1000 grain weight more than on other traits of wheat or barley besides detailed field and controlled conditions studies in barley and wheat also found an increase of harvest index in intermediate saline conditions katerji et al 2009 harris et al 2010 before going down slightly at higher levels in the last study the authors claimed that yield was strongly associated with grain number and shoot dry matter production much less with grain size and harvest index combining the frameworks of the dynamics of yield component determination slafer 2003 and occurrence of osmotic and toxic stresses during exposure to saline conditions munns and tester 2008 it is expected that earlier determined yield components may be more affected by osmotic stress and later determined components are more affected by toxic stress if present it is sensible to think that responses to osmotic and toxic stresses could be under the control of different sets of genes and thus it would be possible to find genotypes that are differentially responsive to both stresses of the variables recorded in this study it is expected that osmotic stress affected the most number of spikes m2 and the biological yield then number of grains spike which is determined during the late reproductive stage and around anthesis could be affected by both osmotic and toxic stresses finally 1000 grain weight and harvest index are influenced by both osmotic and toxic stresses at the genotypic level although the genotype factor was prevalent in the analysis of variance for grain yield the genotypes exhibited relevant rank changes according to their agronomic performance at the three salinity levels genotypes g4 g14 exhibited the highest ranks of grain yield as well as good ranks of biological yield and harvest index at all salinity levels this was due to a better maintenance of number of spikes across salinity levels improved rankings with salinity increasing as well as having a high number of grains spike and maintaining relatively good 1000 grain weight and harvest index although they did not stand out in these last two traits at high salinity genotypes g1 and g10 on the other hand saw their ranks of grain yield biological yield and harvest index improved with increasing salinity indicating relatively good tolerance overall this improvement was due to improving their number of spikes m2 number of grains spike and grain filling on the contrary increasing salinity decreased severely grain yield of g16 and g17 they yielded well at the lowest salinity level but had steep reductions of grain yield as salinity increased the reduction was due to decreasing number of spikes m2 number of grains spike and 1000 grain yield which indicates that they had bad grain filling with increasing of salinity level among the 2 rowed cultivars there were striking differences between european genotypes g18 and g19 and egyptian ones g5 and g6 the european ones had intermediate performances at low salinity and improved relatively at high salinity levels due to better maintenance of biological yield and number of spikes m2 one of the egyptian genotypes g6 performed poorly overall whereas g5 descended from one of the best 5 at the lowest salinity level to one of the worst 17 at high salinity this difference in tolerance occurred despite the egyptian genotypes being approximately 10 days earlier than the europeans which goes against the overall association between yield and earliness this results suggests that european 2 rowed cultivars are potential sources to improve salinity tolerance for short cycle egyptian conditions on the other hand the two european 6 rowed cultivars g20 and g21 were clearly the least salt tolerant of all the results reveal the potential of using tolerant genotypes g4 g14 g1 and g10 under high salinity levels as commercial cultivars or high yielding salt tolerant parents in barley breeding programs in particular g4 and g14 show a relative reduction of harvest index and 1000 grain weight at the highest salinity compared to g1 and g10 the genotypes g1 and g10 exhibited good tolerance across all traits and levels they are not as good in absolute terms at the lowest salinity level because their biological yields are intermediate in a breeding program they could be a donor of salt tolerance for g4 and g14 provided good biomass production and tillering are also monitored g15 on the other hand seems a cultivar strongly affected by osmotic stress with sharp decreases of biological yield and number of spikes but rather tolerant for number of grains spike and one of the best for harvest index and 1000 grain weight at high salinity level it could carry specific mechanisms and genes to cope with the building up of toxic stress in the last part of the growth cycle therefore it could be an option as a parent of a breeding program to combine with g4 or g14 which have the opposite dynamics of components response to salinity on the other hand some genotypes g5 g8 g12 g16 and g17 had good performance under low salinity levels but not at high salinity level due to the effect of one or more yield components it is likely that the mechanisms that they have to resist osmotic stress at low and intermediate levels are surpassed at the highest level additionally the ammi analysis indicated remarkable repeatability of results across years and salinity levels with almost no indication of year by environment interaction it also showed that the salt tolerant genotypes g1 and g4 were located close to the origin indicating that they were stable genotypes across the three salinity levels therefore the identified salt tolerant genotypes could be recommended for growing under the entire range of salinity conditions as tested in this experiment indeed using multiple parameters as genotypic ranking cluster analysis and ammi analysis provide useful information and increase the accuracy for identifying salt tolerant genotypes this assists in classifying the evaluated genotypes according to their salt tolerance even under different salinity levels multiple agronomic parameters for tolerance classification was applied previously by zeng et al 2002 el hendawy et al 2005 bchini et al 2010 ben khaled et al 2012 and hammami et al 2016 for assessing salt tolerance genotypes in different crops as barley rice and wheat the first two principal components were applied to construct three informative biplots based on averages of genotypes at each salinity level strong positive correlations were detected between 1000 grain weight and grain yield as well as plant height harvest index and number of grains spike while number of spikes m2 exhibited a slight positive association with grain yield this reveals that under salinity conditions 1000 grain weight and number of grains spike could be used as a good indicator for grain yield but number of spikes m2 is less important for this purpose likewise bchini et al 2010 akbarpour et al 2015 and allel et al 2019 demonstrated a positive relationship between 1000 grain weight number of grains spike and grain yield under salinity conditions besides we found a significant association between grain yield and plant height at the three salinity levels similar findings were disclosed by saade et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 wiegmann et al 2019 curiously this result revealed that plant height exhibited a positive association with grain yield under salinity conditions which is an advantage for breeding under these conditions this is good news for plant breeders as plant height usually considered a surrogate of aerial biomass is far easier to determine at the scale needed in plant breeding trials we can only speculate with the reasons for this finding plant height is contributed to a remarkable extent by the length of the peduncle and the spike which is determined late in the growth cycle same as 1000 grain weight therefore salt responses at the late stages of the plant cycle could affect these two variables similarly something that is supported by the closeness of their vectors in the principal component analyses otherwise there was a strong negative association of grain yield with days to heading at all salinity levels at the same time salinity produced a decrease in time to flowering apparently the strategy of escape i e to complete the cycle as soon as possible contributes to good agronomic performance under saline conditions similarly thalji and shalaldeh 2007 saade et al 2016 and wiegmann et al 2019 demonstrated a negative correlation between grain yield and days to heading under salinity conditions the pc biplot is an effective statistical analysis to visualize the interrelationship among evaluated genotypes and traits desoky et al 2020 mansour et al 2021 kamara et al 2021 the first principal component pc1 ordered the genotypes very similar to grain yield at the three salinity levels moreover 1000 grain weight number of grains spike and plant height had large loadings on pc1 and low ones on pc2 while number of spikes m2 and biological yield had large loading on pc2 at the three levels and harvest index at the high salinity level it could be speculated that pc1 could be more related to osmotic stress and pc2 could be more related to toxic stress furthermore g4 and g14 performed well in that respect while g13 g20 and g21 performed badly besides the positions of g16 with a large positive score doing well in early determined components number of spikes m2 and biological yield and bad in late determined ones otherwise g15 had an opposite behavior with tolerance expressed only in the late determined components the correlation between traits across different salinity levels indicated a high correlation between low and intermediate levels as well as between intermediate and high levels but slight between low and high levels from a breeding point of view these results indicate the possibility of evaluating genotypes under low salinity to be grown under low or intermediate levels also it would be possible to evaluate genotypes under intermediate salinity to be grown under intermediate and high salinity conditions however it is not recommended to evaluate genotypes under low level or no salinity at all to be grown under high salinity conditions 5 conclusion considerable genotypic variability was detected across the three salinity levels as well as significant genotype by salinity interaction which implies shifting in genotypic responses across salinity levels genotypes g4 g14 g1 and g10 displayed high and stable salt tolerance and are recommended to grown commercially in saline areas and as parental genotypes in barley breeding programs for further developing salt tolerant cultivars looking into the dynamics of yield components responses over three salinity levels allowed the identification of genotypes displaying tolerance based on potentially different mechanisms certain genotypes as g15 were strongly affected by osmotic stress with sharp decreases of biological yield and number of spikes but remarkable tolerance later determined components like number of grains spike and 1000 grain weight at high salinity conversely genotypes g5 g8 g12 g16 and g17 had good performance under low salinity levels but not at high salinity level due to the effect of one or more yield components these two responses are complementary could be the result of different tolerance mechanisms and could be combined through breeding to achieve a high level of tolerance across the entire growth cycle and salinity levels employing multiple analyses such as genotypic ranking yield index cluster analysis and ammi increased the accuracy of classifying the genotypes according to their salt tolerance under different salinity levels our study offers another relevant finding for breeding for salt tolerance strong positive associations were detected between 1000 grain weight and grain yield as well as plant height harvest index and number of grains spike accordingly these traits could be used as a good and easy indicator for grain yield under salinity conditions but number of spikes m2 is less important for this purpose it is not recommended to evaluate genotypes under low or no salinity levels to be grown under high salinity conditions as a high correlation was detected between low and intermediate levels while slight between low and high levels declaration of competing interest the authors declare

rdi consisted of 70 et c during water stress sensitive growth stages shoot growth flowering bud initiation and 35 et c during water stress tolerant growth stages pit hardening oil accumulation environmental conditions and volumetric soil water content of the 70 cm rootzone were monitored a k c of 0 37 was derived for the irrigated period from daily water balance computations excluding rain days no significant effects of the two irrigation treatments were found on morphology physiology fruit yield and oil quality midday stem water potential reached 4 mpa in september as a result of increasing fruit load leaf conductance ranged between 65 and 228 mmol m 2s 1 with highest values obtained under high soil water conditions and a vapour pressure deficit of 3 6kpa yields were

regulated deficit irrigation compared to fully irrigated trees their regulated deficit irrigation treatment provided 20 et c during pit hardening and 40 et c during oil accumulation consequently changes in tree morphology may occur as drought adaptation mechanisms or result from the overlap of different plant growth processes such as the decreased shoot elongation observed during flowering and fruit growth irrigation requirements of olive orchards can be evaluated using plant physiology alcaras et al 2016 moriana et al 2012 tognetti et al 2009 moriana et al 2003 showed that 18 year old rainfed picual olive trees grown in spain with a tree spacing of 6 6 m and average annual rainfall of 600 mm were able to sustain growth until reaching a stem water potential of 8 mpa alcaras et al 2016 showed that 10 year old manzanilla fina olives grown in argentina with an annual rainfall of 100 mm and irrigation to fulfil 33 and 66 et c were able to maintain stem water potentials of 1 8 mpa when readily available water was above 50 a curvilinear relation between assimilation and leaf conductance was found for several varieties grown under different conditions with assimilation reaching a plateau at leaf conductance of approximately 180 200 mmol m 2 s 1 ahumada orellana et al 2019 fernández et al 2008 and a stem water potential of 2 mpa ahumada orellana et al 2019 the above authors showed that plant physiological measurements may be used to explain changes in assimilation or plant growth as a result of water stress variable responses to water stress in terms of olive oil quality and particularly the phenolic content have been reported in the scientific literature in italy gucci et al 2019 measured a total phenol content of 789 and 958 mg kg 1 oil in fully and 48 et c irrigated trees respectively the opposite response was observed in tunisia with total phenols of arbequina olive oil reaching approximately 270 mg kg 1 oil at 100 et c while remaining at 190 mg kg 1 oil when 50 et c was applied dabbou et al 2010 tovar et al 2002 studied 100 year old arbequina olive trees in spain and showed that applying 25 et c during pit hardening which is the most evaporative and water demanding growth stage in olive trees had a positive influence on olive oil quality and on water consumption compared to full irrigation further research is needed to understand how deficit irrigation practices could affect olive oil phenol content in areas with different climatic conditions harvest dates could have an additional effect on total phenol content koroneiki olive trees the cultivar of the current work are usually harvested between the end of november and december in mediterranean countries during that period optimal maturity of the olive fruits is observed with total phenol content ranging between 200 and 500 mg kg 1 oil psarras et al 2011 stefanoudaki et al 2009 while oil content may reach 46 51 of dry weight in irrigated trees and 42 43 of dry weight in rainfed trees stefanoudaki et al 2009 anastasopoulos et al 2011 found a maximum total phenol content of 480 mg kg 1oil in early december for organically grown koroneiki trees in greece they observed a total phenol content of 224 mg kg 1 oil for the early harvest on 21 november and 298 mg kg 1 oil on 7 of january between the three harvests no irrigation or rainfall occurred and other quality parameters of the olive oil peroxide value oil acidity and k did not change anastasopoulos et al 2011 thus optimising the harvest periods based on continuous fruit observations could result in enhanced olive oil quality contradictory results on tree physiological status vegetative and reproductive growth fruit and oil yield have been reported in different studies that examined water stress effects in olive trees variation may be partly attributed to differences in environmental conditions agronomic management tree varieties and canopy characteristics in this respect the main goal of this study is to improve the understanding of the effects of deficit irrigation on physiology morphology yield and oil quality of koroneiki olive trees the specific objectives of this study are i to derive crop coefficients k c for low density olive orchards under water limited conditions ii to evaluate the effect of two deficit irrigation treatments on shoot and fruit growth fruit set stem water potential and leaf conductance and iii to analyse the effects of two deficit irrigation treatments and three harvest dates on olive fruit ripening oil yield and quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the research was conducted in a commercial organic olive farm cv koroneiki located in the district of nicosia cyprus the orchard was planted in 2002 with a tree spacing of 6 6 m approximately 1 kg of organic fertiliser with 9 0 n 0 9 p 1 7 k that was derived from feather meal and chicken manure dix italpolina s p a verona italy was applied to each tree by top dressing in february 2019 trees were pruned in late may 2019 weeds were cut 4 5 times during the year and left to dry on the surface mechanical analysis showed that the soil texture is loam with 41 5 sand 36 5 silt and 22 0 clay three composite samples were collected for soil chemical analysis in may 2019 after fruit set each composite sample was taken from below the tree canopy at a depth of 20 cm from four randomly selected trees in the field soil analysis performed at the cyprus department of agriculture showed on average 111 mg no3 kg 1 soil 59 mg available p kg 1 soil 1090 mg exchangeable k kg 1 soil and 1 7 organic carbon content soil ph was 9 1 iso 2005 and ec was 0 96dsm 1 1 1 iso 1995 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design the experiment started on 01 march 2019 with the onset of shoot growth and ended on 29 february 2020 two deficit irrigation treatments were applied in the field i a sustained deficit irrigation sdi providing 70 et c throughout the irrigated period and ii a regulated deficit irrigation rdi providing 70 et c during drought sensitive stages and 35 et c during drought tolerant stages irrigation scheduling based on sensitivity of plant growth stages was adapted from fernández 2017 maximum rate of pit hardening was identified from a slowdown in fruit volume growth as described by rapoport et al 2013 this was observed on 25 june 2019 after the initial fast increase in fruit volume the 35 et c irrigation application started on 09 july 2019 the irrigation for the rdi trees was returned to 70 et c on 20 august 2019 from 17 september 2019 35 et c was again applied until the beginning of the rainfed period in november a completely randomised design was used with five replicate plots per treatment the experimental design is shown in fig 1 2 3 irrigation supply in march 2019 water metres were installed on the middle irrigation lines of all ten plots while valves were placed on all treatment irrigation lines drip irrigation was facilitated with one spaghetti tube per tree fitted with a small t pipe with two outlets average water flow rate per tube was 110 l h 1 ranging from 99 to 124 l h 1 irrigation amounts for the forthcoming week were based on the average et o of the previous week similar to fernández and moreno 2000 crop evapotranspiration was computed using a k c of 0 40 based on volumetric soil water content and et o observations in the same orchard during 2016 and 2017 siakou et al 2019 before irrigation volumetric soil water content data were checked to ensure that following irrigation field capacity of the 70 cm rootzone would not be exceeded an average wetted area of 5 3 m2 1 3 m radius was assumed based on visual field observations of the wetted surface area after drip irrigation supplementary material a 2 4 meteorological data and volumetric soil water content monitoring a meteorological sensor model ws500 lufft fellbach germany and a tipping bucked rain gauge model 15189 lambrecht gottingen germany were installed in the olive field in may 2016 the meteorological sensors were connected to a datalogger with modem netdl500 ott hydromet kempten germany the datalogger records precipitation every 5 min whereas average temperature relative humidity and wind speed were recorded at 10 min intervals the data were used for the calculation of reference evapotranspiration et o with the penman monteith equation vapour pressure deficit vpd and the maximum crop coefficient k c max according to allen et al 1998 vapour pressure deficits during physiology measurements were calculated from the average temperature and relative humidity values for the 10 00 13 00 measurement period for each treatment two soil water content monitoring stations were installed in two randomly selected replicate plots as indicated in fig 1 see supplementary material b for more information in each plot soil water content sensors model 5tm decagon devices pullman washington usa and smt100 truebner neustadt germany were installed approximately 0 9 m north of the trunk the sensors were installed below three neighbouring trees along the middle irrigation line at 10 20 40 and 60 cm depths two more sensors were installed in the open area halfway between the monitored trees at 20 cm depth loggers recorded volumetric soil water content vswc and soil temperature values hourly missing soil water content data in the sdi treatment only were filled using relative changes in daily soil water content of the other trees in the same treatment missing daily rainfall data were filled with manual raingauge observations 2 5 water balance computations daily and seasonal water balance components were calculated for the 70 cm rootzone the seasonal water balances considered the irrigated period 07 may 2019 30 november 2019 and two rainfed periods 01 march 2019 06 may 2019 and 01 december 2019 28 february 2020 soil water content of the rootzone was calculated assuming that sensors located at 10 and 20 cm depths represent a soil layer thickness of 15 cm and sensors located at 40 and 60 cm depths represent a soil layer thickness of 20 cm field capacity fc was defined from the soil water content observations when hourly soil water content changes δvswc mm at night reached zero following heavy rainfall or irrigation events that saturated the rootzone wilting point wp was defined from the vswc observations at the three deeper depths when δvswc during the day approached zero to estimate crop coefficients and possible drainage losses vswc observations were assumed to represent the rootzone average cross sectional area wetted by irrigation wa m2 of the canopy area of the trees ca m2 during the irrigated period and the field area fa m2 during the rainfed periods canopy cover areas for all 182 trees in the field were determined with arcgis arcgis pro v 2 5 1 esri denver co usa from images 22 267 22 016 pixels 96 dpi horizontal and vertical resolution acquired with an unmanned aerial vehicle inspire 2 with a zenmuse x4s camera dji shenzhen china on 17 december 2019 the description of the image acquirement and processing can be found in supplementary material c daily δvswc of the monitored trees rootzone was computed from 00 00 of the current day to 00 00 of the following day the daily water balances were computed with eq 1 for the irrigated period and with eq 2 for the rainfed periods as follows 1 et a c k s k cc et o p i fa ca vswc wa ca dr wa wa ca e 2 et a k s k c et o p vswc dr e where et a c is the actual daily evapotranspiration over the ca during the irrigated period mm et a is the actual daily evapotranspiration over the fa during the rainfed period mm k s is the crop stress coefficient k cc is the crop coefficient over the ca et o is the reference evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is the irrigation mm over the fa dr wa is drainage over the wa mm and dr is the drainage over the fa calculated when the vswc of the rootzone exceeds fc and e is the error mm during the irrigated period the wa fraction wa ca was computed on each irrigation day for irrigation days where the vswc exceeded fc the wa fraction was derived from the δvswc on the first day after the irrigation day at which vswc remained below fc for the k s calculation the readily available water and soil water stress threshold were calculated at 65 of the total available water allen et al 1998 the k cc values for irrigation days k cc wet dry days during the irrigated period k cc ir and dry days during the spring and winter rainfed periods k c rf were derived by minimising the sum of the daily errors e over the respective periods using days without soil water stress only k s 1 the k cc estimation excluded days with an increase in soil water content δvswc 0 which sometimes occurred on days after rainfall for precipitation days the k c max was used as described by allen et al 1998 3 k c max 1 2 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 where u 2 is the average daily wind speed m s 1 at 2 m height rh min is the daily minimum relative humidity and h is the tree height 2 5 m the derived k cc values for the irrigated period k cc wet k cc ir were multiplied by the canopy cover fraction to estimate the k c at field level 4 k c k cc ca fa the effect of the changing wa on the et a c and the derived k cc values is determined as follows 5 vswc end vswc ini vswc wa ca where vswc end and vswc ini are the observed soil water contents mm of the 70 cm rootzone at the end and the beginning of the irrigated period respectively and indicates the summation over the days of the irrigated period assuming that the observed vswc end and vswc ini of the tree rootzone at the beginning and end of the irrigated period represent the soil water content of the field the et a over the fa for the irrigated period can be estimated as follows 6 et a p i vswc end vswc ini dr wa wa fa where all variables are as defined above and computed over the irrigated period if et a c from eq 1 is multiplied by ca fa to scale the et a over the field the rain and δvswc outside the canopy area are not considered thus the field area et a would be underestimated however considering that we are not irrigating the area outside the canopy area eq 1 and eq 4 give the k c as required for irrigation scheduling during the irrigated period 2 6 plant measurements an overview of the plant parameters measured during 2019 20 season is presented in table 1 a more detailed description of each measurement is given below 2 6 1 phenological and morphological observations phenological and morphological observations were made on three selected trees per treatment replicate five replicate plots per treatment as described in fig 1 shoot growth measurements began in early march 2019 weekly shoot elongation was measured for four shoots located in the four azimuthal directions of the trees at 1 5 2 0 m from ground surface olive tree flowering observations began in april observations were made at the four azimuthal directions of each tree every 3 days after the opening of the first flowers in the field a simplified phenological scoring scale with five apparent scoring levels was developed after the ten levels proposed by oteros et al 2013 the macroscopical scoring levels are 1 only swelled buds are observed 2 open flowers are less than the swelled buds 3 open flowers are more than the swelled buds 50 of the canopy full flowering 4 flowers appear a brown pistil and petals are falling 5 first olive fruits observed end of flowering fruit set olive tree flowering was recorded on the day that at least 50 of the flowers were open oteros et al 2013 during flowering four 15 cm flowering shoots in the four azimuthal directions located around 1 5 2 0 m from the ground were labelled flowers inflorescence and fruit numbers were noted at flowering and fruit set fruits and inflorescence numbers were noted weekly until harvest fruit set was defined as the number of fruits per shoot at each plot divided by the number of flowers counted on the same shoots at flowering fruit growth was defined by measuring longitudinal and equatorial diameters of 10 olive fruits per tree fruits were randomly selected at 1 5 2 0 m from the ground and measured with a digital calliper weekly ellipsoid fruit volume v cm3 was calculated from olive fruit length l cm and width w cm rapoport et al 2013 7 v 4 3 π l 2 w 2 2 2 6 2 physiological measurements abaxial leaf conductance gs was measured with a steady state leaf porometer sc 1 degacon usa single leaf measurements at 30 s duration were made weekly on the day before irrigation using standard practices decagon 2019 every second week leaf conductance was additionally measured 2 days after irrigation measurements took around 45 60 min within the time window of 10 00 13 00 when maximum leaf conductance is normally observed bacelar et al 2007 two fully sunlit leaves on the eastside of the tree at 1 5 2 0 m from the ground surface were selected for three trees per treatment replicate in total 30 leaves per treatment were measured stem water potentials ψs were measured with a pressure chamber 1505d pms usa on the same days that leaf conductance was measured before irrigation one leaf was selected and measured from all six trees with soil water content sensors in the two replicate plots per treatment and from two randomly selected trees from each of the other three replicate plots per treatment two days after irrigation again one leaf from all trees with soil water content sensors was selected for measurement and from one randomly selected tree from each of the other three replicate plots per treatment in total 12 and 9 trees per treatment were measured before and after irrigation respectively a leaf close to the tree trunk was selected and covered for 2 h allowing leaf water potential to equilibrate with stem water potential tognetti et al 2005 stem water potential measurements took around 30 50 min within the time window of 12 00 14 00 2 7 yield olive fruit characteristics and oil extraction procedure fruit samples for olive oil quality determinations were harvested on 16 17 october 2019 03 december 2019 and 13 january 2020 healthy olive fruits were selected from around the tree canopy around 4 kg of olives per plot 500 g per tree were collected during the first harvest and 1 6 kg 200 g per tree during the second and third harvests the sample was harvested from eight trees that included the three monitored trees and other representative trees from the middle and border irrigation lines this way the effect of a lighter olive crop load on the monitored trees was reduced trees at the beginning or end of the irrigation lines were excluded from the harvesting total yields were obtained from the final harvest during 15 22 january 2020 trees were harvested with a mechanical vibration machine and mechanical harvesting brushes total fruit weight harvested from three trees per replicate plot was determined with a digital scale in the field in total 15 trees were harvested for the sdi treatment and 13 trees for the rdi treatment the two missing rdi trees b9 in plot rdi2 and b15 in rdi3 were harvested by the farmer at the end of october olive fruit yields on the first and second harvesting dates were estimated from the ratios of the 100 olive fruit weight samples of the earlier yield versus that of the final harvesting fresh fruit weight fruit longitudinal and equatorial diameters and maturity indices for each replicate plot were determined in the lab following the standards of the international olive council iooc 2011 from the total harvested fruit samples per plot 100 randomly selected olives were weighted on a high precision scale to obtain the fresh weight of the olives olive fruit maturity index assessment virgin olive oil extraction and oil content determination were performed at the olive technology laboratory of the agricultural research institute of cyprus the olive fruit maturity index was determined using 100 olives per replicate plot according to the method developed by uceda and frias 1975 based on the assessment of skin and pulp colour on a scale ranging from 0 deep green skin 100 to 7 100 purple flesh and black skin the maturity index mi is defined as follows 8 m i n 0 0 n 1 1 n 2 2 n 3 3 n 4 4 n 5 5 n 6 6 100 where n indicates the number of olives at each maturity stage n0 n6 iooc 2011 olive fruit crushing and paste production followed the procedure described by emmanouilidou et al 2020 briefly whole olive fruits were crushed using a hammer mill operating at 3000 rpm with a 4 5 mm mesh size sieve at the exit abencor system mc2 ingeniería y sistemas s l seville spain oil content was determined by exhaustive chemical extraction of the olive paste previously desiccated at 105 c to constant weight ek 610i and tokyo japan using a soxhlet apparatus and calculating the weight loss of the olive paste after the evaporation of all petroleum ether present in the thimble results were expressed as dw for virgin olive oil extraction homogeneous olive paste was malaxated at 25 c for 30 min and then centrifuged for 1 min at 3500 rpm without water addition abencor systemy mc2 ingeniería y sistemas s l seville spain olive oil was collected and filtered with qualitative filter paper filterlab 1320 filtros anoia s a barcelona spain bottled in amber glass bottles without headspace and stored at 20 c until analysis water productivity wp kg oil m 3 water of the orchard was computed as the total olive oil produced divided by the total irrigation water applied to each of the deficit irrigation treatments fernández et al 2020 a second wp indicator was calculated as the ratio of the olive oil yield to the sum of daily precipitation and irrigation excluding drainage from 1 march to harvest 2 8 olive oil quality olive oil quality analysis included measurement of components related to olive oil quality category as listed in table 2 organoleptic determinations as described in the european regulation 2568 91 eec 2019 were excluded from this research quality related physicochemical indices free acidity peroxide value uv absorption

specific uv extinction coefficients k232 and k270 and δκ were calculated from absorption values of 1 oil solution in cyclohexane at 232 and 270 nm respectively using a jasco v 630 uv vis spectrophotometer jasco corp tokyo japan additional information regarding the olive oil quality analyses can be found in supplementary material d quantitative profiling of the phenolic compounds in the olive oil was performed using 1h nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy following a well established protocol diamantakos et al 2015 karkoula et al 2012 details of the experimental procedure are described in supplementary material e total phenols were composed of total hydroxytyrosols oleuropein aglycon oleacein oleomissional and oleuropindial and total tyrosols ligstroide aglycon oleocanthal oleokoronal and ligstrondial elenolide is a non phenolic compound that could be involved in the biosynthesis of elenolic acid oleuropein and lingstroside rigakou et al 2019 2 9 statistical analysis all plant variables namely fruit and shoot growth fruit set stem water potential and leaf conductance were statistically analysed for irrigation treatment differences on each measurement date mean values of the measured variables in each replicate plot were calculated to avoid pseudo replication schwarz 2012 data were tested for normality using the shapiro wilk test which can be used with sample sizes below 30 and were assumed to be normally distributed with a 95 confidence interval mean values of measurements were tested for significant differences between irrigation treatments with an independent samples t test two factor anova was used to test the effect of the irrigation treatment and harvest date on the olive oil quality parameters tukey s hsd post hoc test was used to define significant differences between the three harvest days in each treatment statistical significance is reported at α 0 05 all plant measurement data for each irrigation treatment are reported as means and standard errors of the five replicate plots volumetric soil water content at different time points are presented in the results as means and standard errors of six trees from two replicate plots per treatment statistical analysis was done with spss statistical software ibm corp usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological data monthly climatic data for the 2019 20 crop season are shown in table 3 precipitation totalled 428 mm from march 2019 to february 2020 and was preceded by 261 mm in january and february 2019 the absolute maximum temperature in may reached 40 c with maximum vpd reaching 4 2kpa for two consecutive days crop evapotranspiration may have been underestimated due to the low wind speeds observed in the orchard as suggested by allen et al 1998 the average wind speed was 0 4 m s 1 for the crop season the low wind speeds may be due to the location of the meteorological station at 2 m height in between the trees of the monitored field and due to the large olive and cypress trees planted around the perimeter of the field area computation of et o with all daily wind speeds below 0 5 m s 1 replaced by 0 5 m s 1 gave 1119 mm which is very close to the 1078 mm computed with the observed wind speed data monthly difference ranged from 0 5 to 11 4 mm thus the original meteorological observations were used to compute et o 3 2 irrigation monitoring and water balance components the field capacity of the rootzone for the twelve trees with soil water content sensors ranged between 36 and 38 estimated 48 h after two heavy rainfall events 16 june 2019 and 08 january 2020 shown in supplementary material f fig f 1 wilting point as estimated from the soil water content observations in early december was 19 fig 2 the ca as obtained from the image analysis averaged 0 38 for the six sdi trees and 0 32 for the six rdi trees ca of the field was 0 32 during the rainfed period average soil water content of the 70 cm rootzone of the sdi trees and that of the sensors at 20 cm depth in the open area between the trees representing the 0 30 cm soil layer showed a very similar pattern as shown in fig 2 these observations are in line with the assumption that the δvswc of the ca equals the δvswc of the fa during the rainfed period as used in the water balance calculations water balance components and k c estimates for non stressed days without rainfall over the field are shown in table 4 twenty four irrigation events were applied to fulfil 69 et c in sdi and 46 et c in rdi an extreme rainfall event of 72 mm occurred in mid june which resulted in an average increase for both treatments of 14 mm soil water content and 16 mm drainage over the ca in october 66 mm of rainfall resulted in an increase of about 13 mm soil water content and 31 mm drainage over the ca for both irrigation treatments during the irrigated period the et a c computed from the daily water balances was 665 mm in sdi eq 1 and 577 mm in rdi the effect of the wa area estimations eq 5 was 12 mm in sdi and 22 mm in rdi indicating the validity of the wa approach the wa fraction over the field ranged between 5 and 22 in sdi and 1 21 in rdi the larger difference between et a c and et a c wb in rdi compared to sdi could be explained by the smaller wetted areas estimated in rdi the wa fractions fall in line with the 5 20 range of wetted surface areas reported in similar studies testi et al 2006 villalobos et al 2000 although the wa fractions in the current study would be expected to be somewhat larger considering that these were calculated as the average wetted area over the rootzone the k c for the irrigated period which includes irrigation days but excludes rain days was 0 37 in sdi table 4 and 0 25 in rdi the derived k c in sdi was close to the k c of 0 40 used for the irrigation scheduling the difference in k c values between sdi and rdi could indicate lower evaporation losses in the rdi treatment however these k c ir values are also affected by the number of non stressed days over which they are computed see table 4 more water stress days were observed in sdi than in rdi when both treatments received 70 et c due to high soil water content at 40 and 60 cm depths in rdi at the beginning of the irrigated period while the opposite was found when rdi received 35 et c see supplementary material g the average k c max for the rainfed period computed with eq 3 was 1 15 the k cc wet derived with a 6 mm error in sdi and a 2 mm error in rdi was 1 08 for sdi and 1 04 for rdi kc 0 41 and 0 34 respectively the difference between k c max and k cc wet is likely due to the larger wetted surface area under rainfall compared to irrigation leading to higher evaporation losses villalobos et al 2000 reported that high k c in winter may result from enhanced soil evaporation due to rainfall for picual trees grown in spain with 6 6 m planting distances these authors combined eddy covariance observations with empirically derived canopy conductance and a soil evaporation model to calculate the energy balance of the field and suggested a drop in k c during summer due to low soil evaporation from the area wetted by emitters villalobos et al 2000 the average k c was 0 32 during the initial fruit growth stage 21 may 2019 30 june 2019 when average ψs after irrigation was 1 8 mpa in sdi during the period of maximum rate of pit hardening the average kc was 0 39 01 july 2019 01 september 2019 and the average ψs was 2 3 mpa after irrigation in sdi similar values of k c 0 40 0 43 were reported in august for arbequina and picual cultivars grown in spain martinez cob and faci 2010 villalobos et al 2000 and nocellara del belice cultivars grown in italy cammalleri et al 2013 using eddy covariance measurements water balance errors on stress days summed to 66 mm in sdi and 36 mm in rdi these errors suggest that the computed k s overestimated the et a of olives under water stress conditions errors on rain days summed to 88 mm in sdi and 47 mm in rdi indicating that the k c max underestimated the et a errors were found on days with low rainfall which would not have reached the soil water content sensor at 10 cm depth and on days with high rainfall events which may have been caused by preferential wetting and evaporation caused by ponding no surface runoff losses from the field were observed high rainfall frequency has been reported to increase et c and k c fereres et al 2011 testi et al 2006 modelled transpiration interception and soil evaporation from wet and dry soil areas and found that soil evaporation may reach 35 of the annual evapotranspiration for a mature olive orchard 300 trees ha 1 in cordoba as evaluated with a 26 canopy cover arbequina olive orchard in spain 3 3 plant measurements 3 3 1 flowering and plant morphology fast elongation of shoots was observed from early march to mid april with most of the labelled shoots forming inflorescences or stopping their growth between 16 april 2019 and 27 may 2019 palese et al 2010 also found that shoot growth was enhanced in spring and restricted during fruit set fruit development and pit hardening cessation of shoot growth is not broadly discussed in literature but the effect of crop load on the number of newly formed shoots has been reported by castillo llanque and rapoport 2011 these authors found that bearing trees formed 10 30 new shoots compared to non bearing trees that formed 63 74 new shoots in rainfed 20 year old hojiblanca trees grown in spain full bloom occurred on 11 may 2019 inflorescence flower and fruit numbers are shown in table 5 after flowering and before the application of deficit irrigation fruit set was similar and there were no statistically significant differences between the plots of the two treatments fruit set dropped by approximately 30 in both treatments 10 days after initial fruit set remaining around 2 until harvest no significant fruit drop was observed during the summer period in contrast grattan et al 2006 observed 4 3 fruit set under 71 et c and 2 8 under 40 et c for 2 year old arbequina olive trees grown in california corell et al 2020 also reported that fruit drop of manzanillo olive trees irrigated around a ψs threshold of 3 mpa was substantially higher than fruit drop of trees irrigated around a ψs of 1 8 mpa the fruit growth pattern along the season is presented in fig 3 no significant differences were found between irrigation treatments on any of the dates there were two fast periods of increase the initial period until mid june and after the beginning of rainfall in mid october between these two periods from mid june until mid october fruit growth was slower this pattern is commonly reported in conditions of water stress corell et al 2020 gucci et al 2019 several authors suggested that fruit volume is not affected when ψs remains above 2 mpa girón et al 2015 martín palomo et al 2020 3 3 2 plant physiology soil and environment related responses leaf conductance measurements are shown in fig 4 during shoot growth and flowering and until the initial fruit growth stages gs remained near or below 100 mmol m 2s 1 minimum gs of the season was 65 mmol m 2s 1 in sdi vswc 26 and 67 mmol m 2s 1 in rdi vswc 30 observed on 24 june 2019 at the same time vpd was 2 5kpa which is 0 4kpa lower than the average midday vpd for june on 11 july 2019 gs reached 228 and 205 mmol m 2s 1 in sdi and rdi treatments respectively 2 days after irrigation these were the maximum gs values measured in the year although vpd was 3 6kpa similar to the average midday vpd for july the variability observed in gs measurements could not be explained by the soil water content or by the vpd as shown in supplementary material g overall gs ranged between 65 and 228 mmol m 2s 1 in both treatments during the irrigated period and remained within 74 226 mmol m 2s 1 during the rainfed period the maximum gs measured in this study is lower than what was found by moriana et al 2007 these authors reported that a gs of fully irrigated and rainfed 50 year old cornicabra trees grown in spain could reach a maximum of 400 and 300 mmol m 2s 1 respectively in mid summer they also measured a gs around 500 mmol m 2s 1 in fully irrigated and rainfed trees in october moriana et al 2007 although olive trees are well known for their anisohydric behaviour e g diaz espejo et al 2012 tognetti et al 2009 gs response to evaporative demand and soil water deficits was not very clear in the current study stem water potential measurements and soil water content during the season are shown in fig 5 during shoot growth and flowering stem water potentials remained within 1 to 2 mpa in both treatments as a result of low water stress in contrast ψs remained below 2 mpa in july even at high soil water levels a period coinciding with the maximum rate of pit hardening significantly different ψs 3 1 mpa in sdi and 3 5 mpa in rdi were observed after irrigation on 19 september 2019 while gs and soil water content were similar in the two treatments however the computed wetted area fraction of rdi was smaller wa ca 0 046 than that of sdi wa ca 0 078 on 23 september 2019 a minimum ψs of 4 0 mpa was reached in sdi and 3 8 mpa in rdi while on 07 october 2019 ψs was 3 7 mpa in sdi and 4 0 mpa in rdi slow recovery of ψs was observed during the oil accumulation stage in october reaching 3 3 mpa on 14 october 2019 the recovery in ψs occurred before rainfall onset with vpd remaining around 3kpa trees recovered with stem water potentials reaching up to 2 mpa on 21 october 2019 after two heavy rainfall events of 19 and 46 mm 17 and 20 october 2019 this pattern suggests moderate water stress conditions during summer and partial recovery in autumn several authors reported a fast recovery in ψs of trees receiving more severe water stress compared to the current study after the occurrence of rainfall in fall ahumada orellana et al 2017 moriana et al 2003 corell et al 2020 noted that the combination of the water stress level and duration are more important for defining tree water status than the water stress level itself 3 4 yield olive fruit characteristics and oil quality fruit yield obtained during 15 22 january 2020 was on average 9135 977 and 9327 1066 kg ha 1 with an average yield per tree of 33 and 34 kg for sdi and rdi respectively the yield of the sdi treatment was 14 higher than the estimated yield in mid october and 2 6 lower than the estimated yield in early december as shown in table 6 in the rdi treatment the yield was 20 higher than the estimated yield in mid october and 3 3 lower than the estimated yield in early december two factor anova showed no significant interactions between irrigation treatments and harvest dates for most olive and oil quality variables p 0 05 as shown in table 6 significant treatment and harvest date interaction were found for fruit moisture oil content and oil acidity values see table 7 no significant differences were found between irrigation treatments therefore the means of the two irrigation treatments on each harvest date are presented in table 6 the anova analysis showed a statistically significant effect of the harvest dates on most olive and oil quality variables with means differentiated statistically based on tukey s hsd post hoc test irrigation treatment x harvest date means of 17 october 2019 03 december 2019 and 13 january 2020 are presented in table 7 higher fruit moisture and oil acidity and lower oil yield was found in rdi compared to sdi at the final harvest date according to garcía et al 2013 low fruit moisture enhances oil extractability which may have caused the higher oil content measured in sdi trees the high fruit moisture content in deficit irrigated trees of the current study are also in contrast to corell et al 2020 who related the lower yields of deficit irrigated manzanillo olives compared to the yields of fully irrigated trees to the slow water recovery by the trees that was not enough to maximise fruit moisture extinction k coefficients peroxide values and oil acidity analysis were within the limits set in the standards for extra virgin quality category defined by the european commission regulation 2568 91 the olive oil remained in the same quality category on the three harvest dates for both treatments the k232 values 1 7 are similar to those found by anastasopoulos et al 2011 for koroneiki trees grown in greece peroxide values were significantly higher in the final harvest compared to the two previous harvest dates with an average peroxide value of 2 7 in mid october and 5 2 meqo2 kg 1 oil in early january these peroxide values are lower than those reported by anastasopoulos et al 2011 who found a peroxide value range of 10 19 meqo2 kg 1 oil around mid november and 7 15 meqo2 kg 1 oil during early january the final fruit sampling in january 2020 had a maturity index of 3 0 with an oil content of 43 and 41 dry weight in sdi and rdi respectively emmanouilidou et al 2020 found the same oil content for koroneiki olive trees harvested in december in cyprus at maturity indices between 2 0 and 3 0 stefanoudaki et al 2009 found that at optimum harvest maturity fruits of 50 year old koroneiki trees in greece had 46 51 oil content when trees were fully irrigated and 42 43 when trees were rainfed total phenols were found to be significantly higher p 0 003 during the second harvest on 3 december 2019 compared to the other two harvest dates this increase was observed in six out of eight phenolic compounds table 6 total phenols reached 201 3 mg kg 1oil overall total tyrosols content decreased over time whereas total hydroxytyrosols reached a maximum in december and averaged 100 7 mg kg 1oil regarding the second harvest which coincided with the colour breaking stage maturity index 1 3 total phenols may have reached higher contents if rainfall would have been lower than the 81 mm that fell between the first and second harvest dates mean elenolide content for both treatments decreased from 105 mg kg 1 oil in december to 74 mg kg 1 oil in january which may have been related to high fruit water content in december rigakou et al 2019 in anastasopoulos et al 2011 hydroxytyrosols showed an increasing trend reaching a maximum of 120 mg kg 1 oil in early january with total phenols decreasing from 200 to 410 mg kg 1 oil on 5 december to 240 338 mg kg 1 oil on 7 january dag et al 2014 measured a total phenol content of 683 mg kg 1oil in koroneiki olive trees in one out of five monitoring years the trees received 515 mm of rainfall and irrigation only when ψs reached 4 mpa total phenols remained below 550 mg kg 1oil for less water stressed trees these authors also observed that the lowest peroxide values 4 5 meqo2 kg 1oil coincided with the highest phenol content this was also found in the study of baccouri et al 2008 who observed an increase in the phenolic compounds of chemlali variety reaching 112 mg kg 1 oil and a gradual decrease to 54 mg kg 1 oil maturity index of 3 4 approaching full ripening 3 5 water productivity irrigation wp calculated after subtraction of drainage was 1 0 and 1 4 kg oil m 3 in sdi and rdi respectively the total wp including precipitation but excluding drainage was 0 3 kg oil m 3 in sdi and 0 4 kg oil m 3 in rdi similar wp values were found by iniesta et al 2009 for 8 year old arbequina trees grown in spain these authors reported a wp of 0 5 and 1 6 kg oil m 3 irrigation water for fully and 25 et c irrigated trees respectively the irrigation amounts applied in the current study are lower than those from previous studies in cyprus a total irrigation amount of 430 mm is advised for kalamon trees yielding 18 tons of olive fruits per hectare markou and papadavid 2007 metochis 1998 recommended the application of full crop water requirements totalling 400 450 mm for koroneiki olive trees with 70 canopy cover under an average annual rainfall of 400 mm the irrigation water had an ec of 3dsm 1 but soil salinity observations indicated that winter rainfall was sufficient to prevent salinity build up in the rootzone during the 10 year experiment irrigation was applied every 10 days in summer and every 20 days in the early and late part of the irrigated period flowering and oil accumulation stages metochis 1998 this author achieved a lower wp than the current study an approximate wp of 0 5 kg oil m 3 irrigation water was obtained both for full irrigation i 430 mm and for 70 et c i 300 mm resulting from lower average yields obtained in 70 et c 8 tons ha 1 compared to full irrigation 6 tons ha 1 farmer irrigations in the same orchard as the current study during the main june to november irrigated period totalled approximately 255 mm in 2016 and 218 mm in 2017 siakou et al 2019 as compared to 178 mm for sdi and 124 mm for rdi in 2019 rainfall during the june november period was higher 115 mm in 2019 compared to the 39 mm in 2016 and 7 mm in 2017 but was only partly effective due to drainage losses during two high rainfall events irrigations in 2016 and 2017 were applied every 2 weeks and drainage losses from irrigation estimated from soil water content observations on four trees were much higher than in 2019 4 conclusions this study applied sustained and regulated deficit irrigation to koroneiki olive trees in cyprus during a high crop load year daily and annual water balance components and crop coefficients were estimated from continuous soil water content measurements and meteorological observations a k c of 0 37 was derived for the irrigated period excluding rain days for trees with a canopy cover fraction of 0 38 no major significant differences in plant physiology morphology olive yield and olive oil quality were found between the two deficit irrigation treatments however peroxide value increased from 2 7 mg kg 1 oil in october to 5 2 mg kg 1 oil in january as a result of oxidation while early december harvest had a favourable effect on olive oil quality 201 mg total phenols kg 1 oil compared to 128 mg total phenols kg 1 oil in mid january a water productivity of 1 4 kg oil m 3 irrigation water was computed for the regulated deficit irrigation treatment and 1 0 kg oil m 3 irrigation water for the sustained deficit irrigation treatment overall 32 irrigation water saving was achieved with the regulated compared to the sustained deficit irrigation further research is needed to better understand the olive tree s interactions with the environment plant morphology physiology yield and olive oil quality should be measured during years with different rainfall patterns and crop loads the identification of drought tolerant stages such as pit hardening through the close monitoring and observations on fruits is also an important research issue soil water content observations at different distances around the tree trunk coupled with physiology observations after high rainfall and irrigation events may assist with the quantification of the evapotranspiration and the improvement of the water productivity of olive orchards declaration of competing interest the

9871,agricultural water demand in the mediterranean region is expected to increase due to climate change the application of deficit irrigation practices may improve the efficiency of water use in orchards by accounting for changes in environmental conditions and in the tree growth the main goal of this study was to improve our understanding on the effect of deficit irrigation on physiology morphology yield and oil quality of koroneiki olive trees the effect of two deficit irrigation treatments and three harvest dates on olive yield and oil quality were investigated in a 17 year old low density koroneiki orchard in cyprus during a high crop load year for the sustained deficit irrigation sdi treatment 70 et c was applied over the irrigated period while the regulated deficit irrigation rdi consisted of 70 et c during water stress sensitive growth stages shoot growth flowering bud initiation and 35 et c during water stress tolerant growth stages pit hardening oil accumulation environmental conditions and volumetric soil water content of the 70 cm rootzone were monitored a k c of 0 37 was derived for the irrigated period from daily water balance computations excluding rain days no significant effects of the two irrigation treatments were found on morphology physiology fruit yield and oil quality midday stem water potential reached 4 mpa in september as a result of increasing fruit load leaf conductance ranged between 65 and 228 mmol m 2s 1 with highest values obtained under high soil water conditions and a vapour pressure deficit of 3 6kpa yields were approximately 9tonsha 1 in both irrigation treatments while water productivity was 1 4 and 1 0 kg oil m 3 irrigation water in sdi and rdi respectively maximum phenolic content was found in early december reaching on average 202 mg kg 1 oil in both irrigation treatments overall irrigation water use in rdi was 32 less than in sdi whereas oil quality was only affected by the harvest date keywords regulated deficit irrigation phenology stem water potential leaf conductance phenolic content 1 introduction olive trees are well adapted to mediterranean climate conditions characterised by limited water resources and highly variable annual precipitation fernández et al 2001 rallo et al 2016 future projections for southern mediterranean areas indicate a decrease in annual precipitation between 10 and 40 by the end of the century zittis et al 2019 while increasing demands for water resources from competing economic sectors may further limit available water for agriculture cramer et al 2018 low water availability in agricultural lands may negatively affect olive tree growth and production palese et al 2010 rallo et al 2016 thus research should focus on irrigation practices that optimise water productivity deficit irrigation is widely practised to limit water use in olive orchards fereres et al 2012 considering the drought sensitivity of each plant growth stage fernández 2014 evaluation of irrigation practices requires plant and soil water status measurements fernández et al 2018 field experimental studies explaining the effects of deficit irrigation on vegetative and reproductive growth plant physiology and olive oil quality have been published by several authors e g anastasopoulos et al 2011 dag et al 2010 gucci et al 2019 rapoport et al 2004 however a thorough understanding of the physiological responses of deficit irrigated trees during the growth season is still lacking different studies have shown a decrease in shoot elongation and fruit growth as a result of water stress and heavy crop load palese et al 2010 compared shoot elongation of rainfed coratina olive trees grown in southern italy with that of trees irrigated to sustain soil water potentials at approximately 0 1 mpa the former showed a reduction in growth up to 80 in four year old coratina trees in israel under 900 mm annual irrigation shoot elongation was impeded by crop load and resumed only after harvesting in september dag et al 2010 in addition fernandes et al 2018 found that fruit growth of 11 year old arbequina olive trees decreased by approximately 40 under regulated deficit irrigation compared to fully irrigated trees their regulated deficit irrigation treatment provided 20 et c during pit hardening and 40 et c during oil accumulation consequently changes in tree morphology may occur as drought adaptation mechanisms or result from the overlap of different plant growth processes such as the decreased shoot elongation observed during flowering and fruit growth irrigation requirements of olive orchards can be evaluated using plant physiology alcaras et al 2016 moriana et al 2012 tognetti et al 2009 moriana et al 2003 showed that 18 year old rainfed picual olive trees grown in spain with a tree spacing of 6 6 m and average annual rainfall of 600 mm were able to sustain growth until reaching a stem water potential of 8 mpa alcaras et al 2016 showed that 10 year old manzanilla fina olives grown in argentina with an annual rainfall of 100 mm and irrigation to fulfil 33 and 66 et c were able to maintain stem water potentials of 1 8 mpa when readily available water was above 50 a curvilinear relation between assimilation and leaf conductance was found for several varieties grown under different conditions with assimilation reaching a plateau at leaf conductance of approximately 180 200 mmol m 2 s 1 ahumada orellana et al 2019 fernández et al 2008 and a stem water potential of 2 mpa ahumada orellana et al 2019 the above authors showed that plant physiological measurements may be used to explain changes in assimilation or plant growth as a result of water stress variable responses to water stress in terms of olive oil quality and particularly the phenolic content have been reported in the scientific literature in italy gucci et al 2019 measured a total phenol content of 789 and 958 mg kg 1 oil in fully and 48 et c irrigated trees respectively the opposite response was observed in tunisia with total phenols of arbequina olive oil reaching approximately 270 mg kg 1 oil at 100 et c while remaining at 190 mg kg 1 oil when 50 et c was applied dabbou et al 2010 tovar et al 2002 studied 100 year old arbequina olive trees in spain and showed that applying 25 et c during pit hardening which is the most evaporative and water demanding growth stage in olive trees had a positive influence on olive oil quality and on water consumption compared to full irrigation further research is needed to understand how deficit irrigation practices could affect olive oil phenol content in areas with different climatic conditions harvest dates could have an additional effect on total phenol content koroneiki olive trees the cultivar of the current work are usually harvested between the end of november and december in mediterranean countries during that period optimal maturity of the olive fruits is observed with total phenol content ranging between 200 and 500 mg kg 1 oil psarras et al 2011 stefanoudaki et al 2009 while oil content may reach 46 51 of dry weight in irrigated trees and 42 43 of dry weight in rainfed trees stefanoudaki et al 2009 anastasopoulos et al 2011 found a maximum total phenol content of 480 mg kg 1oil in early december for organically grown koroneiki trees in greece they observed a total phenol content of 224 mg kg 1 oil for the early harvest on 21 november and 298 mg kg 1 oil on 7 of january between the three harvests no irrigation or rainfall occurred and other quality parameters of the olive oil peroxide value oil acidity and k did not change anastasopoulos et al 2011 thus optimising the harvest periods based on continuous fruit observations could result in enhanced olive oil quality contradictory results on tree physiological status vegetative and reproductive growth fruit and oil yield have been reported in different studies that examined water stress effects in olive trees variation may be partly attributed to differences in environmental conditions agronomic management tree varieties and canopy characteristics in this respect the main goal of this study is to improve the understanding of the effects of deficit irrigation on physiology morphology yield and oil quality of koroneiki olive trees the specific objectives of this study are i to derive crop coefficients k c for low density olive orchards under water limited conditions ii to evaluate the effect of two deficit irrigation treatments on shoot and fruit growth fruit set stem water potential and leaf conductance and iii to analyse the effects of two deficit irrigation treatments and three harvest dates on olive fruit ripening oil yield and quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the research was conducted in a commercial organic olive farm cv koroneiki located in the district of nicosia cyprus the orchard was planted in 2002 with a tree spacing of 6 6 m approximately 1 kg of organic fertiliser with 9 0 n 0 9 p 1 7 k that was derived from feather meal and chicken manure dix italpolina s p a verona italy was applied to each tree by top dressing in february 2019 trees were pruned in late may 2019 weeds were cut 4 5 times during the year and left to dry on the surface mechanical analysis showed that the soil texture is loam with 41 5 sand 36 5 silt and 22 0 clay three composite samples were collected for soil chemical analysis in may 2019 after fruit set each composite sample was taken from below the tree canopy at a depth of 20 cm from four randomly selected trees in the field soil analysis performed at the cyprus department of agriculture showed on average 111 mg no3 kg 1 soil 59 mg available p kg 1 soil 1090 mg exchangeable k kg 1 soil and 1 7 organic

ended on 29 february 2020 two deficit irrigation treatments were applied in the field i a sustained deficit irrigation sdi providing 70 et c throughout the irrigated period and ii a regulated deficit irrigation rdi providing 70 et c during drought sensitive stages and 35 et c during drought tolerant stages irrigation scheduling based on sensitivity of plant growth stages was adapted from fernández 2017 maximum rate of pit hardening was identified from a slowdown in fruit volume growth as described by rapoport et al 2013 this was observed on 25 june 2019 after the initial fast increase in fruit volume the 35 et c irrigation application started on 09 july 2019 the irrigation for the rdi trees was returned to 70 et c on 20 august 2019 from 17 september 2019 35 et c was again applied until the beginning of the rainfed period in november a completely randomised design was used with five replicate plots per treatment the experimental design is shown in fig 1 2 3 irrigation supply in march 2019 water metres were installed on the middle irrigation lines of all ten plots while valves were placed on all treatment irrigation lines drip irrigation was facilitated with one spaghetti tube per tree fitted with a small t pipe with two outlets average water flow rate per tube was 110 l h 1 ranging from 99 to 124 l h 1 irrigation amounts for the forthcoming week were based on the average et o of the previous week similar to fernández and moreno 2000 crop evapotranspiration was computed using a k c of 0 40 based on volumetric soil water content and et o observations in the same orchard during 2016 and 2017 siakou et al 2019 before irrigation volumetric soil water content data were checked to ensure that following irrigation field capacity of the 70 cm rootzone would not be exceeded an average wetted area of 5 3 m2 1 3 m radius was assumed based on visual field observations of the wetted surface area after drip irrigation supplementary material a 2 4 meteorological data and volumetric soil water content monitoring a meteorological sensor model ws500 lufft fellbach germany and a tipping bucked rain gauge model 15189 lambrecht gottingen germany were installed in the olive field in may 2016 the meteorological sensors were connected to a datalogger with modem netdl500 ott hydromet kempten germany the datalogger records precipitation every 5 min whereas average temperature relative humidity and wind speed were recorded at 10 min intervals the data were used for the calculation of reference evapotranspiration et o with the penman monteith equation vapour pressure deficit vpd and the maximum crop coefficient k c max according to allen et al 1998 vapour pressure deficits during physiology measurements were calculated from the average temperature and relative humidity values for the 10 00 13 00 measurement period for each treatment two soil water content monitoring stations were installed in two randomly selected replicate plots as indicated in fig 1 see supplementary material b for more information in each plot soil water content sensors model 5tm decagon devices pullman washington usa and smt100 truebner neustadt germany were installed approximately 0 9 m north of the trunk the sensors were installed below three neighbouring trees along the middle irrigation line at 10 20 40 and 60 cm depths two more sensors were installed in the open area halfway between the monitored trees at 20 cm depth loggers recorded volumetric soil water content vswc and soil temperature values hourly missing soil water content data in the sdi treatment only were filled using relative changes in daily soil water content of the other trees in the same treatment missing daily rainfall data were filled with manual raingauge observations 2 5 water balance computations daily and seasonal water balance components were calculated for the 70 cm rootzone the seasonal water balances considered the irrigated period 07 may 2019 30 november 2019 and two rainfed periods 01 march 2019 06 may 2019 and 01 december 2019 28 february 2020 soil water content of the rootzone was calculated assuming that sensors located at 10 and 20 cm depths represent a soil layer thickness of 15 cm and sensors located at 40 and 60 cm depths represent a soil layer thickness of 20 cm field capacity fc was defined from the soil water content observations when hourly soil water content changes δvswc mm at night reached zero following heavy rainfall or irrigation events that saturated the rootzone wilting point wp was defined from the vswc observations at the three deeper depths when δvswc during the day approached zero to estimate crop coefficients and possible drainage losses vswc observations were assumed to represent the rootzone average cross sectional area wetted by irrigation wa m2 of the canopy area of the trees ca m2 during the irrigated period and the field area fa m2 during the rainfed periods canopy cover areas for all 182 trees in the field were

zenmuse x4s camera dji shenzhen china on 17 december 2019 the description of the image acquirement and processing can be found in supplementary material c daily δvswc of the monitored trees rootzone was computed from 00 00 of the current day to 00 00 of the following day the daily water balances were computed with eq 1 for the irrigated period and with eq 2 for the rainfed periods as follows 1 et a c k s k cc et o p i fa ca vswc wa ca dr wa wa ca e 2 et a k s k c et o p vswc dr e where et a c is the actual daily evapotranspiration over the ca during the irrigated period mm et a is the actual daily evapotranspiration over the fa during the rainfed period mm k s is the crop stress coefficient k cc is the crop coefficient over the ca et o is the reference evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is the irrigation mm over the fa dr wa is drainage over the wa mm and dr is the drainage over the fa calculated when the vswc of the rootzone exceeds fc and e is the error mm during the irrigated period the wa fraction wa ca was computed on each irrigation day for irrigation days where the vswc exceeded fc the wa fraction was derived from the δvswc on the first day after the irrigation day at which vswc remained below fc for the k s calculation the readily available water and soil water stress threshold were calculated at 65 of the total available water allen et al 1998 the k cc values for irrigation days k cc wet dry days during the irrigated period k cc ir and dry days during the spring and winter rainfed periods k c rf were derived by minimising the sum of the daily errors e over the respective periods using days without soil water stress only k s 1 the k cc estimation excluded days with an increase in soil water content δvswc 0 which sometimes occurred on days after rainfall for precipitation days the k c max was used as described by allen et al 1998 3 k c max 1 2 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 where u 2 is the average daily wind speed m s 1 at 2 m height rh min is the daily minimum relative humidity and h is the tree height 2 5 m the derived k cc values for the irrigated period k cc wet k cc ir were multiplied by the canopy cover fraction to estimate the k c at field level 4 k c k cc ca fa the effect of the changing wa on the et a c and the derived k cc values is determined as follows 5 vswc end vswc ini vswc wa ca where vswc end and vswc ini are the observed soil water contents mm of the 70 cm rootzone at the end and the beginning of the irrigated period respectively and indicates the summation over the days of the irrigated period assuming that the observed vswc end and vswc ini of the tree rootzone at the beginning and end of the irrigated period represent the soil water content of the field the et a over the fa for the irrigated period can be estimated as follows 6 et a p i vswc end vswc ini dr wa wa fa where all variables are as defined above and computed over the irrigated period if et a c from eq 1 is multiplied by ca fa to scale the et a over the field the rain and δvswc outside the canopy area are not considered thus the field area et a would be underestimated however considering that we are not irrigating the area outside the canopy area eq 1 and eq 4 give the k c as required for irrigation scheduling during the irrigated period 2 6 plant measurements an overview of the plant parameters measured during 2019 20 season is presented in table 1 a more detailed description of each measurement is given below 2 6 1 phenological and morphological observations phenological and morphological observations were made on three selected trees per treatment replicate five replicate plots per treatment as described in fig 1 shoot growth measurements began in early march 2019 weekly shoot elongation was measured for four shoots located in the four azimuthal directions of the trees at 1 5 2 0 m from ground surface olive tree flowering observations began in april observations were made at the four azimuthal directions of each tree every 3 days after the opening of the first flowers in the field a simplified phenological scoring scale with five apparent scoring levels was developed after the ten levels proposed by oteros et al 2013 the macroscopical scoring levels are 1 only swelled buds are observed 2 open flowers are less than the swelled buds 3 open flowers are more than the swelled buds 50 of the canopy full flowering 4 flowers appear a brown pistil and petals are falling 5 first olive fruits observed end of flowering fruit set olive tree flowering was recorded on the day that at least 50 of the flowers were open oteros et al 2013 during flowering four 15 cm flowering shoots in the four azimuthal directions located around 1 5 2 0 m from the ground were labelled flowers inflorescence and fruit numbers were noted at flowering and fruit set fruits and inflorescence numbers were noted weekly until harvest fruit set was defined as the number of fruits per shoot at each plot divided by the number of flowers counted on the same shoots at flowering fruit growth was defined by measuring longitudinal and equatorial diameters of 10 olive fruits per tree fruits were randomly selected at 1

irrigation using standard practices decagon 2019 every second week leaf conductance was additionally measured 2 days after irrigation measurements took around 45 60 min within the time window of 10 00 13 00 when maximum leaf conductance is normally observed bacelar et al 2007 two fully sunlit leaves on the eastside of the tree at 1 5 2 0 m from the ground surface were selected for three trees per treatment replicate in total 30 leaves per treatment were measured stem water potentials ψs were measured with a pressure chamber 1505d pms usa on the same days that leaf conductance was measured before irrigation one leaf was selected and measured from all six trees with soil water content sensors in the two replicate plots per treatment and from two randomly selected trees from each of the other three replicate plots per treatment two days after irrigation again one leaf from all trees with soil water content sensors was selected for measurement and from one randomly selected tree from each of the other three replicate plots per treatment in total 12 and 9 trees per treatment were measured before and after irrigation respectively a leaf close to the tree trunk was selected and covered for 2 h allowing leaf water potential to equilibrate with stem water potential tognetti et al 2005 stem water potential measurements took around 30 50 min within the time window of 12 00 14 00 2 7 yield olive fruit characteristics and oil extraction procedure fruit samples for olive oil quality determinations were harvested on 16 17 october 2019 03 december 2019 and 13 january 2020 healthy olive fruits were selected from around the tree canopy around 4 kg of olives per plot 500 g per tree were collected during the first harvest and 1 6 kg 200 g per tree during the second and third harvests the sample was harvested from eight trees that included the three monitored trees and other representative trees from the middle and border irrigation lines this way the effect of a lighter olive crop load on the monitored trees was reduced trees at the beginning or end of the irrigation lines were excluded from the harvesting total yields were obtained from the final harvest during 15 22 january 2020 trees were harvested with a mechanical vibration machine and mechanical harvesting brushes total fruit weight harvested from three trees per replicate plot was determined with a digital scale in the field in total 15 trees were harvested for the sdi treatment and 13 trees for the rdi treatment the two missing rdi trees b9 in plot rdi2 and b15 in rdi3 were harvested by the farmer at the end of october olive fruit yields on the first and second harvesting dates were estimated from the ratios of the 100 olive fruit weight samples of the earlier yield versus that of the final harvesting fresh fruit weight fruit longitudinal and equatorial diameters and maturity indices for each replicate plot were determined in the lab following the standards of the international olive council iooc 2011 from the total harvested fruit samples per plot 100 randomly selected olives were weighted on a high precision scale to obtain the fresh weight of the olives olive fruit maturity index assessment virgin olive oil extraction and oil content determination were performed at the olive technology laboratory of the agricultural research institute of cyprus the olive fruit maturity index was determined using 100 olives per replicate plot according to the method developed by uceda and frias 1975 based on the assessment of skin and pulp colour on a scale ranging from 0 deep green skin 100 to 7 100 purple flesh and black skin the maturity index mi is defined as follows 8 m i n 0 0 n 1 1 n 2 2 n 3 3 n 4 4 n 5 5 n 6 6 100 where n indicates the number of olives at each maturity stage n0 n6 iooc 2011 olive fruit crushing and paste production followed the procedure described by emmanouilidou et al 2020 briefly whole olive fruits were crushed using a hammer mill

ether present in the thimble results were expressed as dw for virgin olive oil extraction homogeneous olive paste was malaxated at 25 c for 30 min and then centrifuged for 1 min at 3500 rpm without water addition abencor systemy mc2 ingeniería y sistemas s l seville spain olive oil was collected and filtered with qualitative filter paper filterlab 1320 filtros anoia s a barcelona spain bottled in amber glass bottles without headspace and stored at 20 c until analysis water productivity wp kg oil m 3 water of the orchard was computed as the total olive oil produced divided by the total irrigation water applied to each of the deficit irrigation treatments fernández et al 2020 a second wp indicator was calculated as the ratio of the olive oil yield to the sum of daily precipitation and irrigation excluding drainage from 1 march to harvest 2 8 olive oil quality olive oil quality analysis included measurement of components related to olive oil quality category as listed in table 2

analysis all plant variables namely fruit and shoot growth fruit set stem water potential and leaf conductance were statistically analysed for irrigation treatment differences on each measurement date mean values of the measured variables in each replicate plot were calculated to avoid pseudo replication schwarz 2012 data were tested for normality using the shapiro wilk test which can be used with sample sizes below 30 and were assumed to be normally distributed with a 95 confidence interval mean values of measurements were tested for significant differences between irrigation treatments with an independent samples t test two factor anova was used to test the effect of the irrigation treatment and harvest date on the olive oil quality parameters tukey s hsd post hoc test was used to define significant differences between the three harvest days in each treatment statistical significance is reported at α 0 05 all plant measurement data for each irrigation treatment are reported as means and standard errors of the five replicate plots volumetric soil water content at different time points are presented in the results as means and standard errors of six trees from two replicate plots per treatment statistical analysis was done with spss statistical software ibm corp usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological data monthly climatic data for the 2019 20 crop season are shown in table 3 precipitation totalled 428 mm from march 2019 to february 2020 and was preceded by 261 mm in january and february 2019 the absolute maximum temperature in may reached 40 c with maximum vpd reaching 4 2kpa for two consecutive days crop evapotranspiration may have been underestimated due to the low wind speeds observed in the orchard as suggested by allen et al 1998 the average wind speed was 0 4 m s 1 for the crop season the low wind speeds may be due to the location of the meteorological station at 2 m height in between the trees of the monitored field and due to the large olive and cypress trees planted around the perimeter of the field area computation of et o with all daily wind speeds below 0 5 m s 1 replaced by 0 5 m s 1 gave 1119 mm which is very close to the 1078 mm computed with the observed wind speed data monthly difference ranged from 0 5 to 11 4 mm thus the original meteorological observations were used to compute et o 3 2 irrigation monitoring and water balance components the field capacity of the rootzone for the twelve trees with soil water content sensors ranged between 36 and 38 estimated 48 h after two heavy rainfall events 16 june 2019 and 08 january 2020 shown in supplementary material f fig f 1 wilting point as estimated from the soil water content observations in early december was 19 fig 2 the ca as obtained from the image analysis averaged 0 38 for the six sdi trees and 0 32 for the six rdi trees ca of the field was 0 32 during the rainfed period average soil water content of the 70 cm rootzone of the sdi trees and that of the sensors at 20 cm depth in the open area between the trees representing the 0 30 cm soil layer showed a very similar pattern as shown in fig 2 these observations are in line with the assumption that the δvswc of the ca equals the δvswc of the fa during the rainfed period as used in the water balance calculations water balance components and k c estimates for non stressed days without rainfall over the field are shown in table 4 twenty four irrigation events were applied to fulfil 69 et c in sdi and 46 et c in rdi an extreme rainfall event of 72 mm occurred in mid june which resulted in an average increase for both treatments of 14 mm soil water content and 16 mm drainage over the ca in october 66 mm of rainfall resulted in an increase of about 13 mm soil water content and 31 mm drainage over the ca for both irrigation treatments during the irrigated period the et a c computed from the daily water balances was 665 mm in sdi eq 1 and 577 mm in rdi the effect of the wa area estimations eq 5 was 12 mm in sdi and 22 mm in rdi indicating the validity of the wa approach the wa fraction over the field ranged between 5 and 22 in sdi and 1 21 in rdi the larger difference between et a c and et a c wb in rdi compared to sdi could be explained by the smaller wetted areas estimated in rdi the wa fractions fall in line with the 5 20 range of wetted surface areas reported in similar studies testi et al 2006 villalobos et al 2000 although the wa fractions in the current study would be expected to be somewhat larger considering that these were calculated as the average wetted area over the rootzone the k c for the irrigated period which includes irrigation days but excludes rain days was 0 37 in sdi table 4 and 0 25 in rdi the derived k c in sdi was close to the k c of 0 40 used for the irrigation scheduling the difference in k c values between sdi and rdi could indicate lower evaporation losses in the rdi treatment however these k c ir values are also affected by the number of non stressed days over which they are computed see table 4 more water stress days were observed in sdi than in rdi when both treatments received 70 et c due to high soil water content at 40 and 60 cm depths in rdi at the beginning of the irrigated period while the opposite was found when rdi received 35 et c see supplementary material g the average k c max for the rainfed period computed with eq 3 was 1 15 the k cc wet derived with a 6 mm error in sdi and a 2 mm error in rdi was 1 08 for sdi and 1 04 for rdi kc 0 41 and 0 34 respectively the difference between k c max and k cc wet is likely due to the larger wetted surface area under rainfall compared to irrigation leading to higher evaporation losses villalobos et al 2000 reported that high k c in winter may result from enhanced soil evaporation due to rainfall for picual trees grown in spain with 6 6 m planting distances these authors combined eddy covariance observations with empirically derived canopy conductance and a soil evaporation model to calculate the energy balance of the field and suggested a drop in k c during summer due to low soil evaporation from the area wetted by emitters villalobos et al 2000 the average k c was 0 32 during the initial fruit growth stage 21 may 2019 30 june 2019 when average ψs after irrigation was 1 8 mpa in sdi during the period of maximum rate of pit hardening the average kc was 0 39 01 july 2019 01 september 2019 and the average ψs was 2 3 mpa after irrigation in sdi similar values of k c 0 40 0 43 were reported in august for arbequina and picual cultivars grown in spain martinez cob and faci 2010 villalobos et al 2000 and nocellara del belice cultivars grown in italy cammalleri et al 2013 using eddy covariance measurements water balance errors on stress days summed to 66 mm in sdi and 36 mm in rdi these errors suggest that the computed k s overestimated the et a of olives under water stress conditions errors on rain days summed to 88 mm in sdi and 47 mm in rdi indicating that the k c max underestimated the et a errors were found on days with low rainfall which would not have reached the soil water content sensor at 10 cm depth and on days with high rainfall events which may have been caused by preferential wetting and evaporation caused by ponding no surface runoff losses from the field were observed high rainfall frequency has been reported to increase et c and k c fereres et al 2011 testi et al 2006 modelled transpiration interception and soil evaporation from wet and dry soil areas and found that soil evaporation may reach 35 of the annual evapotranspiration for a mature olive orchard 300 trees ha 1 in cordoba as evaluated with a 26 canopy cover arbequina olive orchard in spain 3 3 plant measurements 3 3 1 flowering and plant morphology fast elongation of shoots was observed from early march to mid april with most of the labelled shoots forming inflorescences or stopping their growth between 16 april 2019 and 27 may 2019 palese et al 2010 also found that shoot growth was enhanced in spring and restricted during fruit set fruit development and pit hardening cessation of shoot growth is not broadly discussed in literature but the effect of crop load on the number of newly formed shoots has been reported by castillo llanque and rapoport 2011 these authors found that bearing trees formed 10 30 new shoots compared to non bearing trees that formed 63 74 new shoots in rainfed 20 year old hojiblanca trees grown in spain full bloom occurred on 11 may 2019 inflorescence flower and fruit numbers are shown in table 5 after flowering and before the application of deficit irrigation fruit set was similar and there were no statistically significant differences between the plots of the two treatments fruit set dropped by approximately 30 in both treatments 10 days after initial fruit set remaining around 2 until harvest no significant fruit drop was observed during the summer period in contrast grattan et al 2006 observed 4 3 fruit set under 71 et c and 2 8 under 40 et c for 2 year old arbequina olive trees grown in california corell et al 2020 also reported that fruit drop of manzanillo olive trees irrigated around a ψs threshold of 3 mpa was substantially higher than fruit drop of trees irrigated around a ψs of 1 8 mpa the fruit growth pattern along the season is presented in fig 3 no significant differences were found between irrigation treatments on any of the dates there were two fast periods of increase the initial period until mid june and after the beginning of rainfall in mid october between these two periods from mid june until mid october fruit growth was slower this pattern is commonly reported in conditions of water stress corell et al 2020 gucci et al 2019 several authors suggested that fruit volume is not affected when ψs remains above 2 mpa girón et al 2015 martín palomo et al 2020 3 3 2 plant physiology soil and environment related responses leaf conductance measurements are shown in fig 4 during shoot growth and flowering and until the initial fruit growth stages gs remained near or below 100 mmol m 2s 1 minimum gs of the season was 65 mmol m 2s 1 in sdi vswc 26 and 67 mmol m 2s 1 in rdi vswc 30 observed on 24 june 2019 at the same time vpd was 2 5kpa which is 0 4kpa lower than the average midday vpd for june on 11 july 2019 gs reached 228 and 205 mmol m 2s 1 in sdi and rdi treatments respectively 2 days after irrigation these were the maximum gs values measured in the year although vpd was 3 6kpa similar to the average midday vpd for july the variability observed in gs measurements could not be explained by the soil water content or by the vpd as shown in supplementary material g overall gs ranged between 65 and 228 mmol m 2s 1 in both treatments during the irrigated period and remained within 74 226 mmol m 2s 1 during the rainfed period the maximum gs measured in this study is lower than what was found by moriana et al 2007 these authors reported that a gs of fully irrigated and rainfed 50 year old cornicabra trees grown in spain could reach a maximum of 400 and 300 mmol m 2s 1 respectively in mid summer they also measured a gs around 500 mmol m 2s 1 in fully irrigated and rainfed trees in october moriana et al 2007 although olive trees are well known for their anisohydric behaviour e g diaz espejo et al 2012 tognetti et al 2009 gs response to evaporative demand and soil water deficits was not very clear in the current study stem water potential measurements and soil water content during the season are shown in fig 5 during shoot growth and flowering stem water potentials remained within 1 to 2 mpa in both treatments as a result of low water stress in contrast ψs remained below 2 mpa in july even at high soil water levels a period coinciding with the maximum rate of pit hardening significantly different ψs 3 1 mpa in sdi and 3 5 mpa in rdi were observed after irrigation on 19 september 2019 while gs and soil water content were similar in the two treatments however the computed wetted area fraction of rdi was smaller wa ca 0 046 than that of sdi wa ca 0 078 on 23 september 2019 a minimum ψs of 4 0 mpa was reached in sdi and 3 8 mpa in rdi while on 07 october 2019 ψs was 3 7 mpa in sdi and 4 0 mpa in rdi slow recovery of ψs was observed during the oil accumulation stage in october reaching 3 3 mpa on 14 october 2019 the recovery in ψs occurred before rainfall onset with vpd remaining around 3kpa trees recovered with stem water potentials reaching up to 2 mpa on 21 october 2019 after two heavy rainfall events of 19 and 46 mm 17 and 20 october 2019 this pattern suggests moderate water stress conditions during summer and partial recovery in autumn several authors reported a fast recovery in ψs of trees receiving more severe water stress compared to the current study after the occurrence of rainfall in fall ahumada orellana et al 2017 moriana et al 2003 corell et al 2020 noted that the combination of the water stress level and duration are more important for defining tree water status than the water stress level itself 3 4 yield olive fruit characteristics and oil quality fruit yield obtained during 15 22 january 2020 was on average 9135 977 and 9327 1066 kg ha 1 with an average yield per tree of 33 and 34 kg for sdi and rdi respectively the yield of the sdi treatment was 14 higher than the estimated yield in mid october and 2 6 lower than the estimated yield in early december as shown in table 6 in the rdi treatment the yield was 20 higher than the estimated yield in mid october and 3 3 lower than the estimated yield in early december two factor anova showed no significant interactions between irrigation treatments and harvest dates for most olive and oil quality variables p 0 05 as shown in table 6 significant treatment and harvest date interaction were found for fruit moisture oil content and oil acidity values see table 7 no significant differences were found between irrigation treatments therefore the means of the two irrigation treatments on each harvest date are presented in table 6 the anova analysis showed a statistically significant effect of the harvest dates on most olive and oil quality variables with means differentiated statistically based on tukey s hsd post hoc test irrigation treatment x harvest date means of 17 october 2019 03 december 2019 and 13 january 2020 are presented in table 7 higher fruit moisture and oil acidity and lower oil yield was found in rdi compared to sdi at the final harvest date according to garcía et al 2013 low fruit moisture enhances oil extractability which may have caused the higher oil content measured in sdi trees the high fruit moisture content in deficit irrigated trees of the current study are also in contrast to corell et al 2020 who related the lower yields of deficit irrigated manzanillo olives compared to the yields of fully irrigated trees to the slow water recovery by the trees that was not enough to maximise fruit moisture extinction k coefficients peroxide values and oil acidity analysis were within the limits set in the standards for extra virgin quality category defined by the european commission regulation 2568 91 the olive oil remained in the same quality category on the three harvest dates for both treatments the k232 values 1 7 are similar to those found by anastasopoulos et al 2011 for koroneiki trees grown in greece peroxide values were significantly higher in the final harvest compared to the two previous harvest dates with an average peroxide value of 2 7 in mid october and 5 2 meqo2 kg 1 oil in early january these peroxide values are lower than those reported by anastasopoulos et al 2011 who found a peroxide value range of 10 19 meqo2 kg 1 oil around mid november and 7 15 meqo2 kg 1 oil during early january the final fruit sampling in january 2020 had a maturity index of 3 0 with an oil content of 43 and 41 dry weight in sdi and rdi respectively emmanouilidou et al 2020 found the same oil content for koroneiki olive trees harvested in december in cyprus at maturity indices between 2 0 and 3 0 stefanoudaki et al 2009 found that at optimum harvest maturity fruits of 50 year old koroneiki trees in greece had 46 51 oil content when trees were fully irrigated and 42 43 when trees were rainfed total phenols were found to be significantly higher p 0 003 during the second harvest on 3 december 2019 compared to the other two harvest dates this increase was observed in six out of eight phenolic compounds table 6 total phenols reached 201 3 mg kg 1oil overall total tyrosols content decreased over time whereas total hydroxytyrosols reached a maximum in december and averaged 100 7 mg kg 1oil regarding the second harvest which coincided with the colour breaking stage maturity index 1 3 total phenols may have reached higher contents if rainfall would have been lower than the 81 mm that fell between the first and second harvest dates mean elenolide content for both treatments decreased from 105 mg kg 1 oil in december to 74 mg kg 1 oil in january which may have been related to high fruit water content in december rigakou et al 2019 in anastasopoulos et al 2011 hydroxytyrosols showed an increasing trend reaching a maximum of 120 mg kg 1 oil in early january with total phenols decreasing from 200 to 410 mg kg 1 oil on 5 december to 240 338 mg kg 1 oil on 7 january dag et al 2014 measured a total phenol content of 683 mg kg 1oil in koroneiki olive trees in one out of five monitoring years the trees received 515 mm of rainfall and irrigation only when ψs reached 4 mpa total phenols remained below 550 mg kg 1oil for less water stressed trees these authors also observed that the lowest peroxide values 4 5 meqo2 kg 1oil coincided with the highest phenol content this was also found in the study of baccouri et al 2008 who observed an increase in the phenolic compounds of chemlali variety reaching 112 mg kg 1 oil and a gradual decrease to 54 mg kg 1 oil maturity index of 3 4 approaching full ripening 3 5 water productivity irrigation wp calculated after subtraction of drainage was 1 0 and 1 4 kg oil m 3 in sdi and rdi respectively the total wp including precipitation but excluding drainage was 0 3 kg oil m 3 in sdi and 0 4 kg oil m 3 in rdi similar wp values were found by iniesta et al 2009 for 8 year old arbequina trees grown in spain these authors reported a wp of 0 5 and 1 6 kg oil m 3 irrigation water for fully and 25 et c irrigated trees respectively the irrigation amounts applied in the current study are lower than those from previous studies in cyprus a total irrigation amount of 430 mm is advised for kalamon trees yielding 18 tons of olive fruits per hectare markou and papadavid 2007 metochis 1998 recommended the application of full crop water requirements totalling 400 450 mm for koroneiki olive trees with 70 canopy cover under an average annual rainfall of 400 mm the irrigation water had an ec of 3dsm 1 but soil salinity observations indicated that winter rainfall was sufficient to prevent salinity build up in the rootzone during the 10 year experiment irrigation was applied every 10 days in summer and every 20 days in the early and late part of the irrigated period flowering and oil accumulation stages metochis 1998 this author achieved a lower wp than the current study an approximate wp of 0 5 kg oil m 3 irrigation water was obtained both for full irrigation i 430 mm and for 70 et c i 300 mm resulting from lower average yields obtained in 70 et c 8 tons ha 1 compared to full irrigation 6 tons ha 1 farmer irrigations in the same orchard as the current study during the main june to november irrigated period totalled approximately 255 mm in 2016 and 218 mm in 2017 siakou et al 2019 as compared to 178 mm for sdi and 124 mm for rdi in 2019 rainfall during the june november period was higher 115 mm in 2019 compared to the 39 mm in 2016 and 7 mm in 2017 but was only partly effective due to drainage losses during two high rainfall events irrigations in 2016 and 2017 were applied every 2 weeks and drainage losses from irrigation estimated from soil water content observations on four trees were much higher than in 2019 4 conclusions this study applied sustained and regulated deficit irrigation to koroneiki olive trees in cyprus during a high crop load year daily and annual water balance components and crop coefficients were estimated from continuous soil water content measurements and meteorological observations a k c of 0 37 was derived for the irrigated period excluding rain days for trees with a canopy cover fraction of 0 38 no major significant differences in plant physiology morphology olive yield and olive oil quality were found between the two deficit irrigation treatments however peroxide value increased from 2 7 mg kg 1 oil in october to 5 2 mg kg 1 oil in january as a result of oxidation while early december harvest had a favourable effect on olive oil quality 201 mg total phenols kg 1 oil compared to 128 mg total phenols kg 1 oil in mid january a water productivity of 1 4 kg oil m 3 irrigation water was computed for the regulated deficit irrigation treatment and 1 0 kg oil m 3 irrigation water for the sustained deficit irrigation treatment overall 32 irrigation water saving was achieved with the regulated compared to the sustained deficit irrigation further research is needed to better understand the olive tree s interactions with the environment plant morphology physiology yield and olive oil quality should be measured during years with different rainfall patterns and crop loads the identification of drought tolerant stages such as pit hardening through the close monitoring and observations on fruits is also an important research issue soil water content observations at different distances around the tree trunk coupled with physiology observations after high rainfall and irrigation events may assist with the quantification of the evapotranspiration and the improvement of the water productivity of olive orchards declaration of competing interest the

9872,composite clogging substance is an inevitable issue in irrigation systems that use high sediment water hsw consequently leading to emitter clogging which may damage the whole irrigation system so far settling tanks allow particle deposition before water is applied in the drip irrigation systems so they reduce particle load and therefore clogging risk is reduced however these tanks do not always perform properly particularly when controlling biologging and organic matter clogging this study proposed using a horizontal roughing filter hrf to relieve composite clogging in irrigation

and 22 8 53 1 respectively in addition compared with control treatment ck hrf decreased the clogging substance of lateral and emitter by 32 4 37 6 and 25 5 29 4 respectively which obviously alleviated the risk of emitter clogging finally compared with ck hrf increased the christiansen of uniformity cu of drip irrigation system and average discharge variation ratio dra 9 2 27 1 and 12 3 22 5 moreover the filter performance of hrf under medium thickness of 60 cm was obviously higher than those with thicknesses of 20 cm and 40 m only slightly lower than those with thicknesses of 80 cm the results demonstrated that hrf is an effective filtration treatment with great potential applications for controlling the composite clogging in irrigation systems using high sediment water keywords

also contains a high quantity of microorganisms and organic matter resulting from industrial waste and agricultural pollution which is easy to cause composite emitter clogging zhou et al 2019a 2019b the traditional settling tanks have low removal efficiency for microorganisms and organic matter present in hsw and therefore it is difficult to inhibit the formation of biologging in the drip irrigation system thus the development of effective control for the mitigation of clogging in hws drip irrigation system is in urgent need horizontal roughing filter hrf has attracted extensive interest in water treatment field due to its characteristics of high efficiency low cost simple layout low energy consumption and easy operation bakare et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 anh et al 2020 found that turbidity removal rate of hrf reaches 79 85 nkwonta 2010 strongly supported that hrf suspended solid removal was less than 50 for particle sizes of 5 10 µm and almost 100 for particle sizes of 50 100 µm in addition nkwonta 2010 pointed out that hrf could effectively remove microorganisms and organic matter from water khazaei et al 2016 indicated that hrf removed the total nitrogen total phosphorous and codcr by 50 54 68 respectively adlan et al 2008 indicated that hrf reduced the bod5 and coliform organisms content by 51 67 and 67 96 respectively therefore hrf is expected to constitute an effective method to control composite clogging in drip irrigation systems using hsw however the role of hrf is often used as the pretreatment of slow sand filter mushila et al 2016 rooklidge 2006 the use of hrf to control fouling is rather a new research area particularly the controlling capacities of hrf on composite clogging in drip irrigation systems using hsw remain unknown

73 6 89 6 8 1 62 2 15 3 51 8 22 8 53 1 fig 2 respectively comparing with ck hrf greater decreased sc codcr toc and bod5 by 8 9 25 9 6 34 54 1 4 1 44 4 and 9 6 44 6 respectively the hrf treatment had better effects on d5 and d50 of particle size than the ck treatment compared with ck hrf reduced d5 and d50 by 0 1 2 1 µm and 2 2 15 6 µm respectively moreover the sediment removal capacity of hrf was further improved after 36 days of operation and reached its maximum value at 72 days 3 2 effect of hrf layer thickness on water quality the effect of hrf layer thickness on removals of sc bod5 codcr and toc is shown in fig 3 the results show that sc bod5 codcr and toc decreased with the increase of filter thickness however no linear decrease was observed the values of sc bod5 codcr and toc showed a gradual decline when the hrf layer thickness was lower than 60 cm compared with removal efficiency with filter thickness of 20 cm filtration capacity of 40 cm filter layer was slightly improved and the removal efficiency of sc codcr toc and bod5 was increased by12 5 19 3 3 2 4 7 4 1 7 1 1 9 5 3 however the filtration performance was obvious increased when the filter layer thickness reached 60 cm compared with the removal efficiency with the thickness of 40 cm removal efficiency of 60 cm filter layer was obviously improved and the removal efficiency of sc codcr toc and bod5 was increased by 35 4 51 2 18 9 27 8 10 3 20 8 17 5 29 9 however the removal efficiency of hrf with thickness of 80 cm were increased slightly compared with thickness of 60 cm and the removal efficiency of sc codcr toc and bod5 was only increased by 5 3 9 6 1 6 5 1 3 5 8 3 1 9 4 2 3 3 effect of hrf on composite clogging substance in lateral and emitter the dynamic change of composite clogging substance figs 4 5 shows that hrf controlled the contents of composite clogging substance within laterals and emitters compared with ck hrf significantly p 0 05 table s1 decreased the composite clogging substance of lateral and emitter by 32 4 37 6 and 25 5 29 4 respectively which obviously alleviated the risk of emitter clogging moreover hrf treatments had higher control efficiencies of clay silt and sand contents in laterals and emitter than ck compared with ck treatment hrf significantly p 0 01 table s1 decreased the contents of silt sand and clay in laterals by 23 1 27 4 31 8 39 5 and 27 6 39 8 respectively and significantly p 0 05 table s1 decreased the contents of silt sand and clay in emitter by 24 8 27 4 19 3 26 4 38 1 42 9 3 4 influence path of hrf on composite clogging substance in drip irrigation systems sem was used to further reveal the influence path of hrf on composite clogging substance in drip irrigation systems fig 6 the fitted model χ2 df 1 76 p 0 052 met the significance criteria sema revealed that hrf presented strongest correlations β 0 74 0 66 0 54 0 51 p 0 01 with cs cod bod5 and toc moreover sema also further showed that water quality parameters cs cod bod5 toc were significantly correlated p 0 05 with dry weight of laterals ldw and emitters edw in addition the results showed that there were synergistic interactions between ldw and edw finally edw directly affected dra of the drip irrigation system 4 discussion 4 1 filtration mechanism of hrf on high sediment water desilting basin represents an effective means to remove coarse suspended particles from hsw lak et al 2020 however due to that fine suspended particles are not always easy to settle ma et al 2019 the removal efficiency of these fine particles in the desilting basin is poor therefore it is necessary to develop a filtration technology which allows removing those fine sediment particles for preventing emitter clogging in drip irrigation system this study found that hrf can effectively remove the fine sediment particles in hsw fig 2 one possible reason is that the filter media of hrf has both the functions of mechanical screening and contact flocculation mackiewicz 1983 wang et al 2020c when the hsw reaches the surface of the filter layer the filter medium uses its screening function to remove the large size sediment particles from hsw egemose 2018 then hsw flows into the filter layer that could adsorb the fine particles relying on electric double layer power van der waals forces and chemical bonds chen et al 2019 moreover due to the lower filtration rate of hrf the residence time of hsw in the filter layer became longer which directly increased the chance of collision and adsorption between filter media and fine particles nkwonta 2010 and further improved removal capacity of hrf for fine particles on the other hand with the increase of hrf operation time the filter medium is wrapped by microorganisms these microorganisms will secrete viscous substances and adsorb fine particles from the water rooklidge et al 2002 which also greatly improves hrf s filtration capacity for fine particles in addition it is found that the sediment removal capacity of hrf will be improved after 36 days of operation the reason may be that the microorganisms in the filter media will gradually form biofilm after 36 day of operation and mature biofilm will be formed after 72 day of operation therefore hrf also reaches the maximum sediment removal capacity after 72 day of operation this study also found that hrf effectively reduced cs bod5 cod and toc in hsw fig 2 the reason may be that with the increase of hrf operation time microorganisms adhered to the filter media gradually grow into mature biofilm which will capture organic matter and microorganisms from the water as nutrients for growth and reproduction hashimoto et al 2019 finally hrf can remove microorganisms and organic matter from the water by the predation scavenging adsorption and bio oxidation of microorganisms adhering to the filter media moreover this paper also found that the filtration capacity of hrf under the thickness of 60 cm was higher than that with 20 cm and 40 cm the reason is that the hrf under 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm filter layers were filled with coarse gravel media and normal gravel media respectively fig 1 due to the large gap of the filter media it is difficult to remove fine particles microorganisms and organic matter by mechanical screening khiari et al 2020 while the filter media with large particle sizes did not favor biofilm growth wang et al 2014 thus hrf under 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm filter layers only could rely on a small number of microorganisms on the surface of the filter media to remove fine particles microorganisms and organic matter however the hrf under 60 90 cm filter layers were filled with fine gravel media with small gap so it was easy to form biofilm on the surface of the filter media de oliveira and schneider 2019 4 2 effect of hrf on composite clogging substance in drip irrigation system this study further found that hrf could reduce the risk of clogging of emitters compared with ck treatment hrf reduced the clogging substance of emitters by 25 5 29 4 the reason is that hrf treatment has better water treatment capacity than ck treatment and therefore greatly reduced the content of fine sediment particles microorganisms and organic matter in hsw at the same time the water quality parameters are directly related to the clogging substance of emitter bucks et al 1979 thus hrf directly reduces the content of composite clogging substance formation in the emitter of drip irrigation systems by improving the water quality on the other hand some scholars reported that there was a significant correlation between clogging substance of laterals and emitter han et al 2018 li et al 2015 therefore hrf could also decrease the clogging substance of laterals by affecting the water quality thereby reducing the risk of particles settled on laterals entering the emitter and indirectly affect the content of clogging substance of emitter moreover hrf has better removal ability of microorganisms and organic matter than ck and microorganisms were easy to adsorb particles and organic matter in the emitter to form large particle size clogging substance feng et al 2019 therefore hrf can reduce the formation of large size particle clogging substance in the emitter through water quality control compared with ck treatment the content of sand in the clogging substances was reduced by 19 3 26 4 in this sense hrf directly affected the cu and dra of drip irrigation system by reducing the formation of emitter clogging compared with ck hrf increased the christiansen of uniformity cu and average discharge variation ratio dra of drip irrigation system by 9 2 27 1 and 12 3 22 5 fig 7 4 3 engineering implications of hrf although the results proved that hrf effectively controlled the composite clogging in drip irrigation system it is necessary to evaluate the engineering implications of the results for its successful application of hrf desilting basin is the most common method for controlling clogging in hsw drip irrigation systems wang et al 2020b compared with hrf in terms of filtration performance costs and safety using similar testing devices in addition hrf treatment can remove not only bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms but also synthetic organic matter natural organic matter humus and heavy metal ions dalahmeh et al 2019 dashti et al 2019 jiang and tay 2010 avoiding pollutants in water entering into soil through agricultural irrigation moreover capital cost is another major factor closely related with the successful implications of methods because of its simple structure and modularization hrf has low initial cost and no additional operating costs are needed zahiruddin and rahimuddin 2011 besides we also compared the capacity rate and efficiency of sand filter with hrf this part is shown in s shown in supplementary material section 3 the results show that the removal capacity of hrf for cs cod bod5 and toc is significantly higher than that of sand filter fig s4 the hrf has relatively lower installation cost than sand filter fig s5 and the filtration rate of hrf was also lower than sand filter hence the hrf could be more suitable for small scale agricultural irrigation systems fig s5 based on these results the hrf is a promising method of clogging substance control in agricultural drip irrigation system in addition hrf can be used in high salinity seawater reclaimed water surface lake water and deep groundwater khazaei et al 2016 kim et al 2020 van afferden et al 2011 hrf has been used in many fields such as the pretreatment of slow filtration in drinking water engineering dastanaie et al 2007 the treatment of wastewater in industrial field and the pretreatment of ultrafiltration membrane in seawater desalination field naidu et al 2013 however hrf filtration rate is slow suitable for small farmers with small agricultural area and small water demand and it is best used with water saving irrigation technology in addition other multiple factors are involved which obviously affect the hrf at present there is a lack of quantitative relationship between filter layer thickness filter material filtration rate and filtration flow and filtration capacity it is suggested that hrf performance test with different structural parameters should be carried out in the future under different water quality conditions so as to provide theoretical reference for obtaining the most suitable configuration conditions engineering design method and optimized operation mode of hrf 5 conclusions 1

9872,composite clogging substance is an inevitable issue in irrigation systems that use high sediment water hsw consequently leading to emitter clogging which may damage the whole irrigation system so far settling tanks allow particle deposition before water is applied in the drip irrigation systems so they reduce particle load and therefore clogging risk is reduced however these tanks do not always perform properly particularly when controlling biologging and organic matter clogging this study proposed using a horizontal roughing filter hrf to relieve composite clogging in irrigation systems using hsw results revealed that hrf reduced sediment concentration sc chemical oxygen demand codcr total organic carbon toc and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 by 73 6 89 6 8 1 62 2 15 3 51 8

the risk of emitter clogging finally compared with ck hrf increased the christiansen of uniformity cu of drip irrigation system and average discharge variation ratio dra 9 2 27 1 and 12 3 22 5 moreover the filter performance of hrf under medium thickness of 60 cm was obviously higher than those with thicknesses of 20 cm and 40 m only slightly lower than those with thicknesses of 80 cm the

lateral and emitter by 32 4 37 6 and 25 5 29 4 respectively which obviously alleviated the risk of emitter clogging moreover hrf treatments had higher control efficiencies of clay silt and sand contents in laterals and emitter than ck compared with ck treatment hrf significantly p 0 01 table s1 decreased the contents of silt sand and clay in laterals by 23 1 27 4 31 8 39 5 and 27 6 39 8 respectively and significantly p 0 05 table s1 decreased the contents of silt sand and clay in emitter by 24 8 27 4 19 3 26 4 38 1 42 9 3 4 influence path of hrf on composite clogging substance in drip irrigation systems sem was used to further reveal the influence path of hrf on composite clogging substance in drip irrigation systems fig 6 the fitted model χ2 df 1 76 p 0 052 met the significance criteria sema revealed that hrf presented strongest correlations β 0 74 0 66 0 54 0 51 p 0 01 with cs cod bod5 and toc moreover sema also further showed that water quality parameters cs cod bod5 toc were significantly correlated p 0 05 with dry weight of laterals ldw and emitters edw in addition the results showed that there were synergistic interactions between ldw and edw finally edw directly affected dra of the drip irrigation system 4 discussion 4 1 filtration mechanism of hrf on high sediment water desilting basin represents an effective means to remove coarse suspended particles from hsw lak et al 2020 however due to that fine suspended particles are not always easy to settle ma et al 2019 the removal efficiency of these fine particles in the desilting basin is poor therefore it is necessary to develop a filtration technology which allows removing those fine sediment particles for preventing emitter clogging in drip irrigation system this study found that hrf can effectively remove the fine sediment particles in hsw fig 2 one possible reason is that the filter media of hrf has both the functions of mechanical screening and contact flocculation mackiewicz 1983 wang et al 2020c when the hsw reaches the surface of the filter layer the filter medium uses its screening function to remove the large size sediment particles from hsw egemose 2018 then hsw flows into the filter layer that could adsorb the fine particles relying on electric double layer power van der waals forces and chemical bonds chen et al 2019 moreover due to the lower filtration rate of hrf the residence time of hsw in the filter layer became longer which directly increased the chance of collision and adsorption between filter media and fine particles nkwonta 2010 and further improved removal capacity of hrf for fine particles on the other hand with the increase of hrf operation time the filter medium is wrapped by microorganisms these microorganisms will secrete viscous substances and adsorb fine particles from the water rooklidge et al 2002 which also greatly improves hrf s filtration capacity for fine particles in addition it is found that the sediment removal capacity of hrf will be improved after 36 days of operation the reason may be that the microorganisms in the filter media will gradually form biofilm after 36 day of operation and mature biofilm will be formed after 72 day of operation therefore hrf also reaches the maximum sediment removal capacity after 72 day of operation this study also found that hrf effectively reduced cs bod5 cod and toc in hsw fig 2 the reason may be that with the increase of hrf operation time microorganisms adhered to the filter media gradually grow into mature biofilm which will capture organic matter and microorganisms from the water as nutrients for growth and reproduction hashimoto et al 2019 finally hrf can remove microorganisms and organic matter from the water by the predation scavenging adsorption and bio oxidation of microorganisms adhering to the filter media moreover this paper also found that the filtration capacity of hrf under the thickness of 60 cm was higher than that with 20 cm and 40 cm the reason is that the hrf under 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm filter layers were filled with coarse gravel media and normal gravel media respectively fig 1 due to the large gap of the filter media it is difficult to remove fine particles microorganisms and organic matter by mechanical screening khiari et al 2020 while the filter media with large particle sizes did not favor biofilm growth wang et al 2014 thus hrf under 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm filter layers only could rely on a small number of microorganisms on the surface of the filter media to remove fine particles microorganisms and organic matter however the hrf under 60 90 cm filter layers were filled with fine gravel media with small gap so it was easy to form biofilm on the surface of the filter media de oliveira and schneider 2019 4 2 effect of hrf on composite clogging substance in drip irrigation system this study further found that hrf could reduce the risk of clogging of emitters compared with ck treatment hrf reduced the clogging substance of emitters by 25 5 29 4 the reason is that hrf treatment has better water treatment capacity than ck treatment and therefore greatly reduced the content of fine sediment particles microorganisms and organic matter in hsw at the same time the water quality parameters are directly related to the clogging substance of emitter bucks et al 1979 thus hrf directly reduces the content of composite clogging substance formation in the emitter of drip irrigation systems by improving the water quality on the other hand some scholars reported that there was a significant correlation between clogging substance of laterals and emitter han et al 2018 li et al 2015 therefore hrf could also decrease the clogging substance of laterals by affecting the water quality thereby reducing the risk of particles settled on laterals entering the emitter and indirectly affect the content of clogging substance of emitter moreover hrf has better removal ability of microorganisms and organic matter than ck and microorganisms were easy to adsorb particles and organic matter in the emitter to form large particle size clogging substance feng et al 2019 therefore hrf can reduce the formation of large size particle clogging substance in the emitter through water quality control compared with ck treatment the content of sand in the clogging substances was reduced by 19 3 26 4 in this sense hrf directly affected the cu and dra of drip irrigation system by reducing the formation of emitter clogging compared with ck hrf increased the christiansen of uniformity cu and average discharge variation ratio dra of drip irrigation system by 9 2 27 1 and 12 3 22 5 fig 7 4 3 engineering implications of hrf although the results proved that hrf effectively controlled the composite clogging in drip irrigation system it is necessary to evaluate the engineering implications of the results for its successful application of hrf desilting basin is the most common method for controlling clogging in hsw drip irrigation systems wang et al 2020b compared with hrf in terms of filtration performance costs and safety using similar testing devices in addition hrf treatment can remove not only bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms but also synthetic organic matter natural organic matter humus and heavy metal ions dalahmeh et al 2019 dashti et al 2019 jiang and tay 2010 avoiding pollutants in water entering into soil through agricultural irrigation moreover capital cost is another major factor closely related with the successful implications of methods because of its simple structure and modularization hrf has low initial cost and no additional operating costs are needed zahiruddin and rahimuddin 2011 besides we also compared the capacity rate and efficiency of sand filter with hrf this part is shown in s shown in supplementary material section 3 the results show that the removal capacity of hrf for cs cod bod5 and toc is significantly higher than that of sand filter fig s4 the hrf has relatively lower installation cost than sand filter fig s5 and the filtration rate of hrf was also lower than sand filter hence the hrf could be more suitable for small scale agricultural irrigation systems fig s5 based on these results the hrf is a promising method of clogging substance control in agricultural drip irrigation system in addition hrf can be used in high salinity seawater reclaimed water surface lake water and deep groundwater khazaei et al 2016 kim et al 2020 van afferden et al 2011 hrf has been used in many fields such as the pretreatment of slow filtration in drinking water engineering dastanaie et al 2007 the treatment of wastewater in industrial field and the pretreatment of ultrafiltration membrane in seawater desalination field naidu et al 2013 however hrf filtration rate is slow suitable for small farmers with small agricultural area and small water demand and it is best used with water saving irrigation technology in addition other multiple factors are involved which obviously affect the hrf at present there is a lack of quantitative relationship between filter layer thickness filter material filtration rate and filtration flow and filtration capacity it is suggested that hrf performance test with different structural parameters should be carried out in the future under different water quality conditions so as to provide theoretical reference for obtaining the most suitable configuration conditions engineering design method and optimized operation mode of hrf 5 conclusions 1 horizontal roughing filter hrf reduced sc cod toc and bod5 regarding high sediment water hsw by 73 6 89 6 8 1 62 2 15 3 51 8 and 22 8 53 1 respectively 2 compared with desilting filter ck hrf decreased the clogging substance of laterals and emitters by 32 4 37 6 and 25 5 29 4 respectively which obviously alleviated the risk of emitter clogging 3 the filtration performance of hrf under the thickness of 60 cm was obvious higher than that under the thickness of 20 cm and 40 cm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9873,best management practices bmps are generally considered the most economical and effective methods to control nonpoint source pollution nps however the existing research on bmps does not consider the local receiving water capacity and thus may not yield much practical guidance for controlling local nps in order to improve the practical function of bmp schemes load reduction and bmp implementation cost optimization under receiving water capacity constraints were considered to provide a new optimization methodology for bmps in this study the soil water and assessment tool swat was used to simulate the temporal and spatial distribution of nutrient load and identify priority management areas pmas a multi objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii was used to explore optimal bmps with tradeoffs between economic cost and water quality responses this optimization methodology is applied to the chao river watershed crw north china the main results are as follows a total nitrogen tn priority management area pma was mainly located in the upstream areas of the crw while a total phosphorus tp pma was mainly located in the middle of the crw terrace and contour planting were the most effective bmp measures to reduce tn and tp loads from the crw and filter belts played an important role in reducing the tn and tp loads the allocation scheme of bmps with tn as the control index could meet the receiving water capacity constraints for the crw the optimal allocation method yielded a significantly different bmp allocation from the previous objective of a total control strategy which fully considered the receiving water capacity of the miyun reservoir the new method has been successfully applied in the miyun reservoir watershed and the bmp configuration schemes with practical guidance values were obtained the applied methodology can be a good alternative for controlling agricultural nps in other reservoir water source areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords nonpoint source pollution best management practices swat model nsga ii receiving water environmental constraints optimal allocation 1 introduction nonpoint source pollution nps is characterized by a random and diffuse distribution and difficulty in management nps has resulted in a large amount of nutrient load into receiving waters such as rivers lakes and reservoirs which is the main reason for the deterioration of the water environment in recent years dai et al 2018 tan et al 2011 wang et al 2004 worrall et al 2012 in order to control nps effectively countries around the world have successively done research on comprehensive prevention and control of river watersheds with the main goal of reducing pollutant load and improving receiving water quality giupponi 2007 ouyang et al 2018 panagopoulos et al 2012 sun et al 2019 vörösmarty et al 2010 bmps are usually divided into management measures and engineering measures which are widely used to control agricultural nps cullum et al 2006 mittelstet et al 2019 nash and hannah 2011 wilson et al 2018 the evaluation method of agricultural bmps can be divided into two spatial types small scale watershed and large scale watershed schilling et al 2019 zuliani et al 2005 the combination of field monitoring and nutrient balance often is used at the small watershed scale for large scale watersheds the commonly used assessment methods include risk assessment model simulation and database technology based on literature statistics dunn et al 2014 geng 2015 shultz et al 2018 stuart et al 2018 mathematical models are efficient evaluation tools based on a large number of experimental statistical results which can be used to describe the biochemical processes of pollutant generation migration and transformation in watershed units from a large number of evaluation results compared with the other two methods the reliability of the evaluation results based on model simulation is higher therefore various watershed models have been widely used in the optimal allocation of bmps for agricultural systems of large scale watersheds haas et al 2017 liu et al 2013 peragón et al 2018 the optimal bmp allocation system generally is composed of a watershed model cost evaluation model and optimization algorithm turpin et al 2005 the main purpose of watershed model is to evaluate the pollutant load and the implementation effectiveness of bmps the cost evaluation model mainly is used to calculate the implementation and maintenance costs of bmps the optimization algorithm is used as an engine to search the allocation schemes for bmps the commonly used distributed watershed assessment models for the optimal allocation of bmps include the soil and water assessment tool swat dakhlalla and parajuli 2016 agricultural nonpoint source pollution agnps model cho et al 2008 and hydrological simulation program fortran hspf albek et al 2004 chen et al 2016 proposed a new water quality simulation system framework by combining the swat model and the markov method and this method was tested in the three gorges reservoir region china to help optimize bmp design on a large scale watershed mohammed et al 2004 used the agnps model to study the soil erosion process in the kori watershed of the ethiopian plateau and identified areas with severe soil erosion to provide a basis for the implementation of bmps maringanti et al 2009 studied the l anguille river watershed in eastern arkansas and combined the non dominated sorting algorithm ii nsga ii with the swat model to simulate and compare measures such as detention ponds land use planning different crop cultivation buffer zones etc it was found that buffer zones were an effective measure to control the diffuse nps from farmland most of the previous studies on the optimal allocation of bmps took the reduction of pollution load as the environmental objective and seldom considered the environmental capacity of the local water bodies bernhardt et al 2005 dong et al 2018 geng 2015 merriman et al 2019 shan et al 2014 this may be the reason why the water quality failed to achieve the expected water quality objective after implementing bmps and may also lead to the phenomenon of underprotection or overprotection in watershed management geng 2015 and qiu et al 2018 used a watershed model and genetic algorithm to study the chao river watershed crw which feeds the miyun reservoir however they only considered a load reduction target their research objectives were not related to the actual receiving water capacity therefore this study selected the crw flowing into the miyun reservoir as the study area fully considering the actual characteristics of the water body and closely combining the optimization with the receiving water capacity according to previous research wang et al 2020 the receiving water environmental constraint target was determined and the priority management areas pmas of the crw were identified by using a verified swat model and the non dominated sorting operator based on the identification of pmas the differences in tn and tp loading under different land use types were analyzed considering the receiving water capacity of the miyun reservoir a pollution control strategy based on bmp effectiveness and implementation cost was proposed to improve the water quality and control the nps the main objectives of this study are to 1 propose a new pollution control framework with load reduction and bmp implementation cost optimization under receiving water capacity constraints 2 study the effects of different combinations of bmps on nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction and obtain the bmp allocation with the highest load reduction of tn and tp and 3 explore the optimal bmps combinations that can meet the receiving water capacity for the crw this research can provide a new and enforceable framework for agricultural nps control for various surface water systems including lakes and reservoirs the current example of the proposed optimization method also will show the potential value of the method for other regions with similar concerns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the miyun reservoir the largest reservoir in north china was selected as the study area it is located northeast of beijing nearly 70 km away from the urban area fig 1 the total reservoir storage capacity is 4 40 109 m3 with a water surface area of 188 km2 a maximum water depth of 43 50 m and a maximum water level of 157 50 m the miyun reservoir watershed with a total area of 15 788 km2 includes two main rivers in the upstream area the bai river and chao river the miyun reservoir watershed is a typical farming area where agriculture is the main source of income for local residents the main crops are corn rice and wheat which need large amounts of fertilizer to increase yields in miyun reservoir industrial and domestic water account for 68 5 agricultural water accounts for 18 2 and the remaining 13 3 is reserved water the frequent agricultural activities on the slopes have caused a certain degree of vegetation destruction soil erosion and nutrient loss therefore water pollution mainly comes from agricultural land which also is an important factor affecting the water quality of downstream reservoirs since the 1990s the surface runoff to the miyun reservoir has been greatly reduced the increasing eutrophication trend of the reservoir water brings severe challenges to the drinking water security of beijing residents qiu et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in order to control the nps caused by unreasonable land use and tillage methods in the upper watershed of miyun reservoir over the past 30 years people have changed the use of steep sloped farmland specifically people have applied measures such as returning the grain plots to forest contour farming changing steep farmland to terraces and conservation tillage which can effectively control the nitrogen and phosphorus load in addition the agricultural planting habits of the residents in the watershed have been adjusted and the amount of fertilizer applied has been reduced to control the nps at the source in view of the problems of low vegetation coverage and serious soil erosion the use of vegetation filter strips has a positive effect 2 2 data description the digital elevation model dem was obtained from the resource and environmental data cloud platform of the chinese academy of sciences the meteorological data were from the national meteorological information center of china in order to understand the pollution degree of the sub watersheds this study used the concentration data of tn and tp 1991 2015 from the administration bureau of miyun reservoir the monitoring data showed that the tn concentration ranged from 0 94 to 19 25 mg l mean 4 93 mg l and the tp concentration ranged from 0 006 to 0 77 mg l mean 0 12 mg l in the upstream sub watersheds of the crw this study used the population density of the sub watershed as an alternative indicator of residential sources which was used to identify the pma in the crw shen et al 2015 the specific data source was the national population density data of 2010 provided by the chinese academy of sciences geographic environmental resources data center based on the arcgis 10 2 software the sub watershed population density attributes were extracted from the sub watershed vector data of the crw divided into 39 sub watersheds after statistical analysis of land use and cover data in miyun reservoir basin it was found that the main land use types were forest land grassland and cultivated land accounting for 98 00 of the total area of the whole basin since the 1990s the land use types in miyun reservoir basin have undergone continuous small changes mainly between forest land grassland cultivated land and water area due to the conversion of small scale area the effect on the re classification of land use types and division of hydrological response unit hru can be ignored from the perspective of large spatial distribution the land use data of 2010 provided by the resource and environment science and data center was selected as the basis to set up the swat model 2 3 identification of the pmas identifying the pmas was particularly important for the designing bmp allocation the pma identification was the basis of using the swat model to simulate the temporal and spatial distribution of the nutrient load and to evaluate the pollution level chen et al 2014 sharpley et al 2011 tian et al 2020 the specific implementation process was as follows 1 using the swat model to evaluate the tn and tp loads of each sub watershed unit as the pollution level of the watershed 2 according to the different functions of the local receiving water water quality standards were set for the outlet of the sub watersheds 3 if the water quality exported from a sub watershed meets the water quality requirements the sub watershed is removed from the list of pmas 4 all the potential pmas were sorted by pollution load water quality concentration and population density the sub watershed units with high pollution loads water quality concentrations and population density were selected as the pmas in the crw among the pmas the non dominated set operator was proposed based on a pareto optimal idea jeon et al 2018 the current research applied the non dominated set to determine the dominance hierarchy among all sub watersheds for any two sub watershed units s a and s b each sub watershed has five attributes p i i 1 2 3 4 5 pareto optimality can be defined by eqs 1 and 2 as follows 1 i 1 2 3 4 5 p i s a p i s b 2 i 1 2 3 4 5 p i s a p i s b when eq 1 is satisfied sub watershed s b dominates s a recorded as s a s b when eq 2 is satisfied sub watershed s b weakly dominates s a recorded as s a s b according to the foregoing definitions only if all indexes of sub watershed s b are not lower than those for sub watershed s a is it considered that sub watershed s b weakly dominates sub watershed s a therefore identification of watershed pmas is identifying all the units that can dominate other sub watersheds 2 4 determination of receiving water capacity constraint objectives the implementation of agricultural bmps is an important measure for water environment management in a watershed in order to avoid underprotection and overprotection it is necessary to obtain the water environment objectives according to the actual receiving water capacity of the watershed which is the decision making basis of watershed bmp allocation studied here based on the previous research for the miyun reservoir wang et al 2020 the receiving water capacity constraint objectives were determined taking the maximum allowable load for the miyun reservoir under different water quality guarantee probabilities as the standard the actual load and maximum allowable load for the miyun reservoir were considered the determination of the receiving water capacity constraint objectives was transformed into the calculation of the load reduction needed to achieve a specific water quality guarantee probability the level of the water quality guarantee probability has an important impact on the selection of watershed management measures therefore combined with the actual situation for the miyun reservoir and previous research the water quality guarantee probability was determined as 70 chen et al 2019 wang et al 2015 when the tn constraint objective is 0 76 mg l and the guarantee probability is 70 which means that the tn concentration is less than 0 76 mg l 70 of the time in a year the corresponding tn reduction for the miyun reservoir is 830 74 t the monitoring results for the miyun reservoir show that the actual tn flux from the crw to the miyun reservoir was 2934 44 t in 2010 therefore when the proposed reduction ratio of tn is 28 31 the requirement of tn concentration 0 76 mg l of miyun reservoir can be met in addition the actual tp input to the miyun reservoir from the crw is 34 28 t if the tp constraint objective is 0 01 mg l and the guarantee probability is 70 which means that the tp concentration is less than 0 01 mg l 70 of the time of a year the tp load needs to be reduced by 23 75 t based on these the tp load for the miyun reservoir is to be reduced by 69 28 of the original load and thus the receiving water capacity constraint objective for tp in the miyun reservoir can be achieved to sum up the receiving water capacity constraint objectives for the miyun reservoir were that the tn and tp loads be reduced by 28 31 and 69 28 respectively of the original loads the details are listed in table 1 2 5 watershed model nsga ⅱ optimization framework 2 5 1 swat model several studies have shown that the swat model is widely used in the study of the simulation and evaluation of the effectiveness of bmps arabi et al 2007 qiu et al 2018 the swat model can simulate most common agricultural management measures xie et al 2015 such as management measures fertilizer reduction contour farming stubble mulch conservation tillage etc and engineering measures artificial wetlands terraces vegetation filter strips etc in order to accelerate the process of watershed bmp simulation and improve the efficiency of scientific research an automatic simulation control system of agricultural bmps was developed which included automatic evaluation of measure effectiveness and optimal configuration when the swat model ran the system can automatically adjust the parameters according to the simulation results and continue running first all management measures were fully permutated to form different scheme combinations then the implementation efficiency and cost of various combinations were determined and saved in a specified data file next the nsga ⅱ was used to select the optimal cost effective combination of various measures deb et al 2002 according to the previous research results 11 bmps suitable for the crw were included in the optimal allocation system of agricultural bmps geng 2015 qiu et al 2018 wang et al 2013 the bmps belong to two categories tillage management and farmland nutrient management and the specific types of measures and attributes are listed in table 2 among them the conservation tillage in this study refers to no till farming 2 5 2 multi objective optimization the objective of the multi objective optimization function was to achieve the maximum reduction of tn and tp load at hydrologic response units hrus level while ensuring the minimum implementation cost for the bmps the objective function eq 3 was transformed into an optimization problem of three objective functions including tn tp and implementation cost optimization simultaneously because the bmp measures to be implemented in this study were only allocated to agricultural land the total number of hrus to be implemented was 71 the 11 bmps and the base scenario no bmps were considered the specific optimization objective functions are as follows 3 min i 1 71 tp hrus bmps i 1 71 tn hrus bmps i 1 71 cost hrus bmps the sub objective functions are defined as follows 4 min i 1 71 tp i j tp hrus bmps tp 1 1 tp 2 1 tp 1 j tp 2 j tp 1 11 tp 2 11 tp i 1 tp i j tp i 11 tp 71 1 tp 71 j tp 71 11 5 min i 1 71 tn i j tn hrus bmps tn 1 1 tn 2 1 tn 1 j tn 2 j tn 1 11 tn 2 11 tn i 1 tn i j tn i 11 tn 71 1 tn 71 j tn 71 11 6 min i 1 71 cost i j cost hrus bmps cost 1 1 cost 2 1 cost 1 j cost 2 j cost 1 11 cost 2 11 cost i 1 cost i j cost i 11 cost 71 1 cost 71 j cost 71 11 the objective function eq 3 is defined to simultaneously 1 minimize the tp load with bmps implemented 2 minimize the tn load with bmps implemented and 3 minimize the expenditures of applying bmps where tp i j tn i j and cost i j are the elements of the matrix which correspond to tp load tn load and total cost from the ith hru after the jth bmp was implemented in the nsga ⅱ the set of all solutions or chromosomes is called the population and each chromosome is composed of several gene segments in order to meet the objective function optimization the number of gene segments of each chromosome needs to be set to 71 where the length of chromosome was equal to the number of hrus in this study integer gene coding was used and all bmps were encoded in an integer sequence of 1 11 therefore the genes contained in each chromosome represent the types of bmps implemented in different hrus fig 2 shows the integer gene coding used to realize the combination of bmps and represents the configuration scheme of bmps in the hrus the general flow of the nsga ii is shown in fig 3 first the fitness function of the multi objective evaluation system is constructed based on the environmental effectiveness database and cost database then the initial population of a certain scale is generated according to a set of genetic parameters the chromosome selection cross operation and mutation operation are done according to the fitness function repeating the foregoing operations to reach the maximum evolutionary algebra and the algorithm automatically terminates deb et al 2002 panagopoulos et al 2012 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the swat model the sufi 2 algorithm module built in the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup was used to calibrate and validate the model arnold et al 2012 rusli et al 2017 1991 1992 was the warm up period of the model which was used to eliminate the uncertainty influence of initial parameter values on the model simulation 1993 2004 was the calibration period and 2005 2015 was the validation period according to the sensitivity analysis results of the swat model the sensitivity parameters affecting runoff and tp were optimized and adjusted in this study the final verification results for monthly flow and tp load of the swat model are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 a that the swat model yielded good simulation results for runoff the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r2 during the calibration period are 0 87 and 0 82 respectively and the nse and r2 during the validation period are 0 78 and 0 75 respectively it can be seen from fig 4 b that the simulation results for the swat model for tp can basically meet the needs of model application in which the nse and r2 in the model calibration period are 0 69 and 0 75 respectively and the nse and r2 in validation period are 0 78 and 0 84 respectively when the nse is greater than 0 65 and the r2 is greater than 0 75 the verified model is considered good relative to the criteria of moriasi et al 2007 and can meet the simulation requirements of the current study 3 2 identification of pmas the verified swat model and the nsga ⅱ were used to identify the pmas of nps in the crw geng 2015 taking the water quality concentration at the outlet of the sub watershed and population quantity as the constraint conditions the pmas distribution of tn population water quality and tp population water quality in crw are discussed in fig 5 a when the tn population water quality identification basis was used the crw was divided into five tn management areas namely ma1 ma2 ma3 ma4 and ma5 among them ma1 accounted for 22 68 of the crw area and accounted for 61 99 of the tn load and 36 67 of the total population ma1 belonged to a region with severe nitrogen pollution and the average concentration of tn was 24 28 mg l ma2 accounted for 23 67 of the crw area and accounted for 20 96 of the tn load and 19 41 of the total population the average concentration of tn for ma2 was 11 22 mg l ma3 accounted for 18 16 of the crw area and accounted for 8 12 of the tn load and 15 41 of the total population the average concentration of tn for ma3 was 5 48 mg l ma4 accounted for 14 32 of the crw area and accounted for 4 77 of the tn load and 11 49 of the total population the average concentration of tn for ma4 was 3 74 mg l the area with the lowest risk ma5 accounted for 21 17 of the crw area and only accounted for 4 16 of the tn load and 16 52 of the total population ma1 and ma2 accounted for 46 35 of the crw area accounting for 82 95 of the tn load and 56 08 of the total population ma1 and ma2 have higher populations than other areas and had the most massive tn pollution therefore ma1 and ma2 composed the pmas for tn in the crw as shown in fig 5 b when the tp population water quality was taken as the identification basis the crw was divided into four tp management areas namely ma1 ma2 ma3 and ma4 among them ma1 accounted for 37 20 of the area and accounted for 68 16 of the tp load and 52 49 of the total population the average concentration of tp for ma1 was 0 21 mg l ma2 accounted for 22 95 of the crw area and accounted for 20 56 of the tp load and 17 43 of the total population the average concentration of tp for ma2 was 0 14 mg l ma3 accounted for 27 60 of the crw area and accounted for 7 41 of the tp load and 21 25 of the total population the average concentration of tp for ma3 was 0 094 mg l ma4 accounted for 12 25 of the crw area and accounted for 3 87 of the tp load and 8 83 of the total population the average concentration of tp for ma4 was 0 055 mg l ma1 had the largest area the highest population and the largest phosphorus load therefore ma1 composed the pma for tp in the crw as can be seen in fig 6 the pmas for tn in the crw were mainly concentrated in the upper watershed the pmas for tp were mainly concentrated in the upper middle watershed by comparing the spatial distribution of tn and tp pmas sub watersheds 12 13 16 and 21 were identified as pma1 areas for tn and tp this shows that the tn and tp load from these four sub watersheds were the highest in the crw and should have the highest priority for control on the basis of the pma identification this study also analyzed the difference of the tn and tp load for different land use types fig 7 in terms of tn the cultivated land had the highest load average 25 47 kg ha followed by grassland average 3 50 kg ha while orchard and forest land had the lowest loads average 0 43 and 0 32 kg ha respectively therefore cultivated land was the main land use type for tn similarly for tp cultivated land had the highest load average 2 47 kg ha followed by grassland average 0 26 kg ha while orchard and forest had the lowest loads average 0 17 and 0 11 kg ha respectively according to the foregoing analysis cultivated land is the key land use type affecting the tn and tp load and is mainly distributed in the middle and upper reaches of crw crop fertilization is the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus load the development of bmps needs to be aimed at the reduction of agricultural resources in cultivated land 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the nsga ⅱ parameters the main parameters in nsga ⅱ optimization included the number of generations population size crossover probability and mutation probability in order to ensure the robustness and convergence of the nsga ii it was necessary to analyze the sensitivity of the key parameters of the algorithm and determine the optimal combination of parameters rodriguez et al 2011 shen et al 2012 in order to reduce the computational complexity of a high dimensional parameter combination space one at a time oat was used as the parameter setting of sensitivity analysis the specific parameter settings are listed in table 3 the goal of nsga ⅱ optimization is to maximize the environmental objectives tn reduction tp reduction and minimize the economic objective implementation cost of bmps the pareto optimal front curve was drawn with the ecological effect objectives as the horizontal axis and the economic objective as the vertical axis when the pareto optimal front curve tends to the lower right end of a figure it indicates that the optimization scheme has better cost effectiveness and the parameters of the optimization scheme can be considered as the optimal parameters rodriguez et al 2011 the number of generations was one of the parameters that significantly influenced the results of the bmp optimization as shown in fig 8 when the number of evolutionary generations reached 10 000 the results tended to converge the number of generations was set to 10 000 the appropriate population size was determined to guarantee the fast convergence of the nsga ii optimization a given time when the population size was 250 the bmp implementation had a relatively good cost effectiveness and the pareto optimal front of the cost effectiveness curve was evenly distributed so the population size was set to 250 when the crossover probability increased from 0 10 to 0 60 the cost effectiveness value of bmp optimization results gradually was optimized when the crossover probability increased from 0 60 to 0 80 the cost effectiveness value of bmp optimization results tended to be stable considering the diversity and uniformity of the bmp space configuration scheme the crossover probability was set to 0 80 by analyzing the impact of the mutation probability on the cost effectiveness of bmp optimization results within the set range of the mutation probability the cost effectiveness of bmps gradually tended to be optimal as the mutation probability value increased when the mutation probability was 0 005 the cost effectiveness of bmps for tn and tp was optimized therefore the mutation probability was set as 0 005 3 4 effect of different bmp schemes on the nutrient load reduction 3 4 1 optimization scenarios for tp load reduction the effect of different bmps on tp load reduction from the crw was studied by using the nsga ⅱ optimization in order to analyze the search results of the optimization process this study focused on the pareto optimal front results of the optimization process shown in fig 9 a four representative solution sets were selected including the lowest cost solution scheme a the best cost effectiveness solution scheme b with lower cost and higher load reduction the zero cost solution scheme c and the highest reduction solution scheme d specifically when scheme a is selected the total implementation cost of the bmp scheme was 3 80 106 chinese yuan and the tp load of the bmp scheme for the crw can be reduced by 12 55 when scheme b is selected the total implementation cost of the scheme was 1 50 106 chinese yuan and the tp load can be reduced by 46 81 the reason why the cost of schemes a and b is negative is that the proportion reduced fertilizer application of bmps is higher so the cost expenditure can be reduced under the zero cost scheme scheme c the tp reduction of the bmp scheme for the crw was 56 74 when scheme d is selected the total implementation cost of the scheme was 1 99 107 chinese yuan and the tp reduction can reach 90 83 the implementation types and proportions of tp bmps are shown in fig 9 b when choosing the lowest cost scheme scheme a six types of bmps are included in this scenario namely no 1 traditional farming no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 no 6 stubble mulch no 10 conservation tillage and no 11 fertilize a month in advance the main types of bmps included nos 4 5 and 6 and their implementation proportions are 26 76 35 21 and 22 54 respectively when the best cost effectiveness scheme scheme b is selected eight different types of bmps are included among which no 2 contour planting no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 and no 6 stubble mulch are used in greater proportions than other bmp measures these proportions reached 8 45 15 49 26 76 and 38 03 respectively in the zero cost scheme scheme c seven different types of bmp measures are included with no 2 contour planting no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 and no 6 stubble mulch accounting for 18 31 12 66 22 54 and 38 03 respectively when the highest reduction scheme scheme d is selected six types of bmps are included with no 2 contour planting no 3 terraces and no 6 stubble mulch accounting for the main portion of bmps with the proportion reaching 28 17 46 48 and 15 49 respectively 3 4 2 optimization scenarios for the tn load reduction the cost effectiveness curve of the bmp optimization scheme for tn as the control objective is shown in fig 10 a four representative solution sets were selected from the pareto optimal front of the optimization process including the lowest cost solution scheme a the best cost effectiveness solution scheme b the zero cost solution scheme c and the highest reduction solution scheme d when lowest cost scheme is selected scheme a the total implementation cost of the bmp scheme is 3 80 106 chinese yuan and the tn load can be reduced by 7 14 when the best cost effectiveness scheme is selected scheme b the total implementation cost of the scheme is 1 40 106 chinese yuan and the tn reduction of the scheme can reach 17 58 under the zero cost scheme scheme c the tn reduction of the bmp scheme was 20 01 when the highest reduction scheme is selected scheme d the total implementation cost of the bmp scheme is 1 94 107 chinese yuan and the tn reduction could reach 29 99 the implementation and proportion of bmps under the different schemes are shown in fig 10 b when choosing the lowest cost bmp allocation scheme scheme a six types of bmps are included in this scenario i e no 1 traditional farming no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 no 6 stubble mulch no 10 conservation tillage and no 11 fertilize a month in advance among them the main types of bmps included nos 4 5 6 and 10 and their implementation proportions are 32 39 38 03 9 86 and 11 27 respectively when the cost effectiveness optimal scheme is selected scheme b eight different types of bmps are included among which the proportion of no 3 terraces no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 and no 6 stubble mulch have higher proportions than the other bmp measures the implementation proportions are 14 08 14 08 21 13 and 29 58 respectively for the zero cost scheme scheme c eight different types of bmp measures are included among which no 3 terraces no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 and no 6 stubble mulch have higher proportions than the other bmp measures with the proportions reaching 9 86 16 90 23 94 and 35 21 respectively when choosing the highest reduction scheme scheme d the scheme includes seven different types of bmp measures including no 2 contour farming no 3 terraces no 6 stubble mulch no 8 filter strips of 10 m and no 9 filter strips of 15 m with the proportions reaching 18 31 40 85 14 08 5 53 and 12 68 respectively 3 5 optimal allocation of bmps based on receiving water capacity constraints in order to achieve the goal of improving the water quality in the miyun reservoir under receiving water capacity constraints it is necessary to simultaneously reduce the tn and tp loads from the authors previous research the tn load to the miyun reservoir needed to be reduced by 28 31 while the tp load needed to be reduced by 69 28 wang et al 2020 these reduction amounts were used as the receiving water capacity constraints for the optimal allocation of bmps and the verified nsga ii was used to obtain the allocation scheme of bmps under the receiving water capacity constraints the optimal bmp scheme for the crw was obtained using a cost effectiveness analysis of the bmp allocation scheme under the constraint conditions the implementation types and proportions of the bmp schemes with the tn and tp control target are shown in fig 11 it can be seen from the figure that when the tn was taken as the control index to ensure that the tn reduction reaches the constraint target seven different types of bmp measures needed to be applied in the crw including bmps nos 2 3 6 7 8 9 and 10 the implementation ratios of the corresponding bmps are 26 76 46 78 16 90 1 41 2 82 4 23 and 1 41 respectively it can be seen that bmps no 2 contour farming no 3 terraces and no 6 stubble mulch are the main measures for nitrogen control for agricultural land in the crw when the tp was taken as the control index to ensure that the tp reduction reaches the constraint target the allocation scheme of bmps in the crw included 7 different bmp measures including nos 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 10 the implementation ratios of the corresponding bmps are 2 82 25 35 18 31 7 04 12 68 32 39 and 1 41 respectively it can be seen that bmps no 2 contour farming no 3 terraces no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 and no 6 stubble mulch are the main measures for nitrogen and phosphorus control for agricultural land in the crw the cost effectiveness information of the bmp configuration scheme for the crw based on the receiving water capacity constraints is listed in table 4 the actual reduction rates of tn and tp in the bmp configuration scheme with tn as the control index were 28 31 and 78 91 respectively and the total implementation cost of bmps was 1 63 108 chinese yuan this scheme is able to meet the nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction targets under the receiving water capacity constraints tn 28 31 tp 69 28 the tn and tp reductions of the bmp configuration scheme with tp as the control index were 25 02 and 69 28 respectively and the total cost of implementation was 4 07 107 chinese yuan this scheme can t meet the target of nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction under the receiving water capacity constraints tn 28 31 tp 69 28 compared with the tn control measures the tp control measures are dominated by management bmps which was the main reason why the bmp configuration scheme with tp as the control index can t meet the target for tn reduction 4 discussion 4 1 effect of bmps on tp load reduction fig 9 a shows a combination of bmps for four different scenarios with the increase in cost the proportion of engineering bmps increases and the magnitude of tp reduction also increases when the reduction is the highest scheme d the main bmps are contour farming terraces and stubble mulch accounting for 28 17 46 48 and 15 49 respectively among them terraces have the greatest impact on the tp reduction rate which can effectively reduce the tp load briak et al 2019 park et al 2014 because terraces are an engineering management measure the cost of implementation is larger according to a comparison of the pmas for tp the area with the greatest amount of the tp load is located in the middle of the crw cultivated land is the primary land type yielding tp output and rice corn among others are the main crops the cultivated land in the crw is slightly steep and is suitable for construction of terraces which can retain surface runoff and reduce nutrient losses özcan et al 2017 when the amount of tp reduction is low the main bmps are fertilizer reduction and stubble mulch therefore the cost of implementing bmps and the efficiency of tp reduction are low liu et al 2019a panagopoulos et al 2011 proved that specific fertilization management had no effect on crop yield but it was effective in reducing pollutant yield however reduction of fertilizer application in a short period can reduce part of the tp load but the effect is not obvious in scheme a only 12 55 of the tp load was reduced because there was a large amount of phosphorus retained in the soil sediment long term fertilization management or engineering bmps are required to reduce phosphorus loss through comprehensive analysis it has been found that terraces are the most effective measure to reduce the tp load in the crw 4 2 effect of bmps on tn load reduction as shown in fig 10 a in the scheme with the lowest cost scheme a the main bmp is to control the use of chemical fertilizer which accounts for 70 42 of all bmps however the effect of chemical fertilizer reduction on tn load reduction is not obvious in addition to the nitrogen retained in the soil atmospheric nitrogen deposition and livestock manure also are important factors affecting tn load reduction deng et al 2020 similar to the reduction effect of tp with the increase of the reduction of tn the proportion of management bmps gradually decreases while the proportion of engineering bmps such as terraces filter strips etc gradually increases in the highest reduction scheme scheme d contour farming and terraces account for a large proportion of the total which are the major measures to improve the tn reduction contour farming and tillage refer to the cultivation and planting according to the contour lines of the field rather than straight line tillage these measures improve the soil infiltration capacity and reduce soil erosion intensity mtibaa et al 2018 in order to reduce the loss of sediment and nutrients protection measures in the form of filter strips are applied in the key sub watersheds filter strips remove contaminants sediment nutrients etc by reducing the surface velocity resulting in particulate deposition himanshu et al 2019 kaini et al 2012 lam et al 2011 lowrance et al 1984 proposed there are two effects of filter strips on tn load reduction first filter strips reduce runoff velocity and promote nitrogen infiltration filter strips can also reduce the nitrogen load through the absorption by plants in the filter vegetation as well as the immobilization and denitrification by of microorganisms the current study found that terraces are the most effective measure to improve the reduction of tn among the bmps for the crw filter strips and contour farming also play an important role in the tn load reduction 4 3 scenario analysis of bmps under receiving water capacity constraints in this study the receiving water capacity was included in the constraints and a new multi objective optimization framework for lakes or reservoirs was proposed arabi et al 2006 and chen et al 2016 used different genetic algorithms and watershed models to simulate nutrient load reduction in a small watershed in indiana usa and the three gorges reservoir area in china respectively although the simulation was successful they only assumed a reduction target and did not fully consider the receiving water capacity of the study watershed similar studies liu et al 2019b makarewicz et al 2015 monaghan et al 2007 uribe et al 2018 wang et al 2018 made the theoretical research separate from the actual watershed receiving water capacity thus reducing the practical guidance value of the research results geng 2015 has explored the effect of different combinations of bmps on nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction in the crw however he did not consider the receiving water capacity of the crw and only studied the scenarios of the lowest cost and the largest reduction bmp schemes qiu et al 2018 considered two schemes a high water quality standard and a drinking water standard from the perspective of the government and farmer respectively finding that there were significant differences in bmp types spatial allocation and economic costs between the two schemes the resulting bmp allocation also was not combined with the actual situation in the crw on the basis of the authors previous research wang et al 2020 starting from the actual receiving water capacity in the crw for the miyun reservoir two bmp combination schemes with tn and tp as control indices were obtained the bmp combination scheme with tn as the control index mainly included engineered bmps while the scheme with tp as the control index mainly included managerial bmps this difference in bmps was the main reason why the latter scheme cannot meet the expected reduction targets liu et al 2019a for cost effective analysis the bmp combination scheme with tp as the control index had a lower cost because managerial bmps are more cost effective measures liu et al 2019b under the constraints of the receiving water capacity the bmp combination that fully met the receiving water capacity of the crw needed to reduce the tn and tp loads by 28 31 and 78 91 respectively and the total implementation cost was 1 63 108 chinese yuan geng 2015 calculated the bmp cost for control of tn and tp separately without considering the simultaneous reduction of both the receiving water capacity of the miyun reservoir can only be met in the maximum reduction scheme and its implementation cost was much higher than the current research scheme the results of the current study yielded good environmental and economic benefits however there were also some deficiencies in the current work when using a combination of bmps with tn as the control index although the nutrient load reduction requirement can be met the reduction of tp exceeded the target value by 9 63 points which increased the implementation cost of bmps exceeding the expected target was mainly because few combinations of bmps were considered in the current study and not enough optional combinations were considered when using the nsga ⅱ algorithm in future research the bmp combination database can be increased so that the reduction of the bmp combinations coincides with the receiving water capacity which can be widely and effectively applied to the formulation of other agricultural watershed management schemes 5 conclusions this research proposed a pollution control strategy based on joint optimization of bmps and implementation cost under the constraints of the receiving water capacity this optimization strategy is obviously different from the goal oriented control applied in previous studies this proposed approach emphasizes that the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus load should be combined with the actual environmental capacity of water bodies to effectively control water pollution taking the tn tp cost as the optimization index the swat model and nsga ⅱ optimization were used to construct the optimal allocation framework for general watershed management measures the following important conclusions were found the tn pmas are mainly located in the upper watershed of the crw while the tp pmas are mainly concentrated in the middle of the crw sub watersheds 12 13 16 and 21 have the highest priority for control in the crw with the increase of the proportion of engineering management measures the reduction of tn and tp loads also will increase and the corresponding implementation cost also will increase it is found that terraces are the most effective measure to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus load in the crw filter strips and contour farming also play an important role in nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction the reduction percentage of tp is significantly higher than that of total nitrogen in the crw when taking tn tp cost as the joint optimization target the bmp allocation schemes contour farming terraces and stubble mulch account for 26 76 46 78 and 6 90 respectively with tn as the control index can meet the receiving water capacity constraints for the crw for this allocation of bmps the actual reduction of tn and tp is 28 31 and 78 91 respectively and the total implementation cost of the corresponding bmp scheme is 1 63 108 chinese yuan fully considering the actual characteristics and capacity of the crw the bmp configuration schemes with a practical guiding value was obtained the proposed multi objective optimization framework based on receiving water capacity was not only suitable for the crw flowing into the miyun reservoir but also is suitable for other reservoirs the applied methodology can be a good alternative for controlling the agricultural nps in reservoir water source areas declaration of

9873,best management practices bmps are generally considered the most economical and effective methods to control nonpoint source pollution nps however the existing research on bmps does not consider the local receiving water capacity and thus may not yield much practical guidance for controlling local nps in order to improve the practical function of bmp schemes load reduction and bmp implementation cost optimization under receiving water capacity constraints were considered to provide a new optimization methodology for bmps in this study the soil water and assessment tool swat was used to simulate the temporal and spatial distribution of nutrient load and identify priority management areas pmas a multi objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii was used to explore optimal bmps with tradeoffs between economic cost and water quality responses this optimization methodology is applied to the chao river watershed crw north china the main results are as follows a total nitrogen tn priority management area pma was mainly located in the upstream areas of the crw while a total phosphorus tp pma was mainly located in the middle of the crw terrace and contour planting were the most effective bmp measures to reduce tn and tp loads from the crw and filter belts played an important role in reducing the tn and tp loads the allocation scheme of bmps with tn as the control index could meet the receiving water capacity constraints for the crw the optimal allocation method yielded a significantly different bmp allocation from the previous objective of a total control strategy which fully considered the receiving water capacity of the miyun reservoir the new method has been successfully applied in the miyun reservoir watershed and the bmp configuration schemes with practical guidance values were obtained the applied methodology can be a good alternative for controlling agricultural nps in other reservoir water source areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords nonpoint source pollution best management practices swat model nsga ii receiving water environmental constraints optimal allocation 1 introduction nonpoint source pollution nps is characterized by a random and diffuse distribution and difficulty in management nps has resulted in a large amount of nutrient load into receiving waters such as rivers lakes and reservoirs which is the main reason for the deterioration of the water environment in recent years dai et al 2018 tan et al 2011 wang et al 2004 worrall et al 2012 in order to control nps effectively countries around the world have successively done research on comprehensive prevention and control of river watersheds with the main goal of reducing pollutant load and improving receiving water quality giupponi 2007 ouyang et al 2018 panagopoulos et al 2012 sun et al 2019 vörösmarty et al 2010 bmps are usually divided into management measures and engineering measures which are widely used to control agricultural nps cullum et al 2006 mittelstet et al 2019 nash and hannah 2011 wilson et al 2018 the evaluation method of agricultural bmps can be divided into two spatial types small scale watershed and large scale watershed schilling et al 2019 zuliani et al 2005 the combination of field monitoring and nutrient balance often is used at the small watershed scale for large scale watersheds the commonly used assessment methods include risk assessment model simulation and database technology based on literature statistics dunn et al 2014 geng 2015 shultz et al 2018 stuart et al 2018 mathematical models are efficient evaluation tools based on a large number of experimental statistical results which can be used to describe the biochemical processes of pollutant generation migration and transformation in watershed units from a large number of evaluation results compared with the other two methods the reliability of the evaluation results based on model simulation is higher therefore various watershed models have been widely used in the optimal allocation of bmps for agricultural systems of large scale watersheds haas et al 2017 liu et al 2013 peragón et al 2018 the optimal bmp allocation system generally is composed of a watershed model cost evaluation model and optimization algorithm turpin et al 2005 the main purpose of watershed model is to evaluate the pollutant load and the implementation effectiveness of bmps the cost evaluation model mainly is used to calculate the implementation and maintenance costs of bmps the optimization algorithm is used as an engine to search the allocation schemes for bmps the commonly used distributed watershed assessment models for the optimal allocation of bmps include the soil and water assessment tool swat dakhlalla and parajuli 2016 agricultural nonpoint source pollution agnps model cho et al 2008 and hydrological simulation program fortran hspf albek et al 2004 chen et al 2016 proposed a new water quality simulation system framework by combining the swat model and the markov method and this method was tested in the three gorges reservoir region china to help optimize bmp design on a large scale watershed mohammed et al 2004 used the agnps model to study the soil erosion process in the kori watershed of the ethiopian plateau and identified areas with severe soil erosion to provide a basis for the implementation of bmps maringanti et al 2009 studied the l anguille river watershed in eastern arkansas and combined the non dominated sorting algorithm ii nsga ii with the swat model to simulate and compare measures such as detention ponds land use planning different crop cultivation buffer zones etc it was found that buffer zones were an effective measure to control the diffuse nps from farmland most of the previous studies on the optimal allocation of bmps took the reduction of pollution load as the environmental objective and seldom considered the environmental capacity of the local water bodies bernhardt et al 2005 dong et al 2018 geng 2015 merriman et al 2019 shan et al 2014 this may be the reason why the water quality failed to achieve the expected water quality objective after implementing bmps and may also lead to the phenomenon of underprotection or overprotection in watershed management geng 2015 and qiu et al 2018 used a watershed model and genetic algorithm to study the chao river watershed crw which feeds the miyun reservoir however they only considered a load reduction target their research objectives were not related to the actual receiving water capacity therefore this study selected the crw flowing into the miyun reservoir as the study area fully considering the actual characteristics of the water body and closely combining the optimization with the receiving water capacity according to previous research wang et al 2020 the receiving water environmental constraint target was determined and the priority management areas pmas of the crw were identified by using a verified swat model and the non dominated sorting operator based on the identification of pmas the differences in tn and tp loading under different land use types were analyzed considering the receiving water capacity of the miyun reservoir a pollution control strategy based on bmp effectiveness and implementation cost was proposed to improve the water quality and control the nps the main objectives of this study are to 1 propose a new pollution control framework with load reduction and bmp implementation cost optimization under receiving water capacity constraints 2 study the effects of different combinations of bmps on nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction and obtain the bmp allocation with the highest load reduction of tn and tp and 3 explore the optimal bmps combinations that can meet the receiving water capacity for the crw this research can provide a new and enforceable framework for agricultural nps control for various surface water systems including lakes and reservoirs the current example of the proposed optimization method also will show the potential value of the method for other regions with similar concerns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the miyun reservoir the largest reservoir in north china was selected as the study area it is located northeast of beijing nearly 70 km away from the urban area fig 1 the total reservoir storage capacity is 4 40 109 m3 with a water surface area of 188 km2 a maximum water depth of 43 50 m and a maximum water level of 157 50 m the miyun reservoir watershed with a total area of 15 788 km2 includes two main rivers in the upstream area the bai river and chao river the miyun reservoir watershed is a typical farming area where agriculture is the main source of income for local residents the main crops are corn rice and wheat which need large amounts of fertilizer to increase yields in miyun reservoir industrial and domestic water account for 68 5 agricultural water accounts for 18 2 and the remaining 13 3 is reserved water the frequent agricultural activities on the slopes have caused a certain degree of vegetation destruction soil erosion and nutrient loss therefore water pollution mainly comes from agricultural land which also is an important factor affecting the water quality of downstream reservoirs since the 1990s the surface runoff to the miyun reservoir has been greatly reduced the increasing eutrophication trend of the reservoir water brings severe challenges to the drinking water security of beijing residents qiu et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in order to control the nps caused by unreasonable land use and tillage methods in the upper watershed of miyun reservoir over the past 30 years people have changed the use of steep sloped farmland specifically people have applied measures such as returning the grain plots to forest contour farming changing steep farmland to terraces and conservation tillage which can effectively control the nitrogen and phosphorus load in addition the agricultural planting habits of the residents in the watershed have been adjusted and the amount of fertilizer applied has been reduced to control the nps at the source in view of the problems of low vegetation coverage and serious soil erosion the use of vegetation filter strips has a positive effect 2 2 data description the digital elevation model dem was obtained from the resource and environmental data cloud platform of the chinese academy of sciences the meteorological data were from the national meteorological information center of china in order to understand the pollution degree of the sub watersheds this study used the concentration data of tn and tp 1991 2015 from the administration bureau of miyun reservoir the monitoring data showed that the tn concentration ranged from 0 94 to 19 25 mg l mean 4 93 mg l and the tp concentration ranged from 0 006 to 0 77 mg l mean 0 12 mg l in the upstream sub watersheds of the crw this study used the population density of the sub watershed as an alternative indicator of residential sources which was used to identify the pma in the crw shen et al 2015 the specific data source was the national population density data of 2010 provided by the chinese academy of sciences geographic environmental resources data center based on the arcgis 10 2 software the sub watershed population density attributes were extracted from the sub watershed vector data of the crw divided into 39 sub watersheds after statistical analysis of land use and cover data in miyun reservoir basin it was found that the main land use types were forest land grassland and cultivated land accounting for 98 00 of the total area of the whole basin since the 1990s the land use types in miyun reservoir basin have undergone continuous small changes mainly between forest land grassland cultivated land and water area due to the conversion of small scale area the effect on the re classification of land use types and division of hydrological response unit hru can be ignored from the perspective of large spatial distribution the land use data of 2010 provided by the resource and environment science and data center was selected as the basis to set up the swat model 2 3 identification of the pmas identifying the pmas was particularly important for the designing bmp allocation the pma identification was the basis of using the swat model to simulate the temporal and spatial distribution of the nutrient load and to evaluate the pollution level chen et al 2014 sharpley et al 2011 tian et al 2020 the specific implementation process was as follows 1 using the swat model to evaluate the tn and tp loads of each sub watershed unit as the pollution level of the watershed 2 according to the different functions of the local receiving water water quality standards were set for the outlet of the sub watersheds 3 if the water quality exported from a sub watershed meets the water quality requirements the sub watershed is removed from the list of pmas 4 all the potential pmas were sorted by pollution load water quality concentration and population density the sub watershed units with high pollution loads water quality concentrations and population density were selected as the pmas in the crw among the pmas the non dominated set operator was proposed based on a pareto optimal idea jeon et al 2018 the current research applied the non dominated set to determine the dominance hierarchy among all sub watersheds for any two sub watershed units s a and s b each sub watershed has five attributes p i i 1 2 3 4 5 pareto optimality can be defined by eqs 1 and 2 as follows 1 i 1 2 3 4 5 p i s a p i s b 2 i 1 2 3 4 5 p i s a p i s b when eq 1 is satisfied sub watershed s b dominates s a recorded as s a s b when eq 2 is satisfied sub watershed s b weakly dominates s a recorded as s a s b according to the foregoing definitions only if all indexes of sub watershed s b are not lower than those for sub watershed s a is it considered that sub watershed s b weakly dominates sub watershed s a therefore identification of watershed pmas is identifying all the units that can dominate other sub watersheds 2 4 determination of receiving water capacity constraint objectives the implementation of agricultural bmps is an important measure for water environment management in a watershed in order to avoid underprotection and overprotection it is necessary to obtain the water environment objectives according to the actual receiving water capacity of the watershed which is the decision making basis of watershed bmp allocation studied here based on the previous research for the miyun reservoir wang et al 2020 the receiving water capacity constraint objectives were determined taking the maximum allowable load for the miyun reservoir under different water quality guarantee probabilities as the standard the actual load and maximum allowable load for the miyun reservoir were considered the determination of the receiving water capacity constraint objectives was transformed into the calculation of the load reduction needed to achieve a specific water quality guarantee probability the level of the water quality guarantee probability has an important impact on the selection of watershed management measures therefore combined with the actual situation for the miyun reservoir and previous research the water quality guarantee probability was determined as 70 chen et al 2019 wang et al 2015 when the tn constraint objective is 0 76 mg l and the guarantee probability is 70 which means that the tn concentration is less than 0 76 mg l 70 of the time in a year the corresponding tn reduction for the miyun reservoir is 830 74 t the monitoring results for the miyun reservoir show that the actual tn flux from the crw to the miyun reservoir was 2934 44 t in 2010 therefore when the proposed reduction ratio of tn is 28 31 the requirement of tn concentration 0 76 mg l of miyun reservoir can be met in addition the actual tp input to the miyun reservoir from the crw is 34 28 t if the tp constraint objective is 0 01 mg l and the guarantee probability is 70 which means that the tp concentration is less than 0 01 mg l 70 of the time of a year the tp load needs to be reduced by 23 75 t based on these the tp load for the miyun reservoir is to be reduced by 69 28 of the original load and thus the receiving water capacity constraint objective for tp in the miyun reservoir can be achieved to sum up the receiving water capacity constraint objectives for the miyun reservoir were that the tn and tp loads be reduced by 28 31 and 69 28 respectively of the original loads the details are listed in table 1 2 5 watershed model nsga ⅱ optimization framework 2 5 1 swat model several studies have shown that the swat model is widely used in the study of the simulation and evaluation of the effectiveness of bmps arabi et al 2007 qiu et al 2018 the swat model can simulate most common agricultural management measures xie et al 2015 such as management measures fertilizer reduction contour farming stubble mulch conservation tillage etc and engineering measures artificial wetlands terraces vegetation filter strips etc in order to accelerate the process of watershed bmp simulation and improve the efficiency of scientific research an automatic simulation control system of agricultural bmps was developed which included automatic evaluation of measure effectiveness and optimal configuration when the swat model ran the system can automatically adjust the parameters according to the simulation results and continue running first all management measures were fully permutated to form different scheme combinations then the implementation efficiency and cost of various combinations were determined and saved in a specified data file next the nsga ⅱ was used to select the optimal cost effective combination of various measures deb et al 2002 according to the previous research results 11 bmps suitable for the crw were included in the optimal allocation system of agricultural bmps geng 2015 qiu et al 2018 wang et al 2013 the bmps belong to two categories tillage management and farmland nutrient management and the specific types of measures and attributes are listed in table 2 among them the conservation tillage in this study refers to no till farming 2 5 2 multi objective optimization the objective of the multi objective optimization function was to achieve the maximum reduction of tn and tp load at hydrologic response units hrus level while ensuring the minimum implementation cost for the bmps the objective function eq 3 was transformed into an optimization problem of three objective functions including tn tp and implementation cost optimization simultaneously because the bmp measures to be implemented in this study were only allocated to agricultural land the total number of hrus to be implemented was 71 the 11 bmps and the base scenario no bmps were considered the specific optimization objective functions are as follows 3 min i 1 71 tp hrus bmps i 1 71 tn hrus bmps i 1 71 cost hrus bmps the sub objective functions are defined as follows 4 min i 1 71 tp i j tp hrus bmps tp 1 1 tp 2 1 tp 1 j tp 2 j tp 1 11 tp 2 11 tp i 1 tp i j tp i 11 tp 71 1 tp 71 j tp 71 11 5 min i 1 71 tn i j tn hrus bmps tn 1 1 tn 2 1 tn 1 j tn 2 j tn 1 11 tn 2 11 tn i 1 tn i j tn i 11 tn 71 1 tn 71 j tn 71 11 6 min i 1 71 cost i j cost hrus bmps cost 1 1 cost 2 1 cost 1 j cost 2 j cost 1 11 cost 2 11 cost i 1 cost i j cost i 11 cost 71 1 cost 71 j cost 71 11 the objective function eq 3 is defined to simultaneously 1 minimize the tp load with bmps implemented 2 minimize the tn load with bmps implemented and 3 minimize the expenditures of applying bmps where tp i j tn i j and cost i j are the elements of the matrix which correspond to tp load tn load and total cost from the ith hru after the jth bmp was implemented in the nsga ⅱ the set of all solutions or chromosomes is called the population and each chromosome is composed of several gene segments in order to meet the objective function optimization the number of gene segments of each chromosome needs to be set to 71 where the length of chromosome was equal to the number of hrus in this study integer gene coding was used and all bmps were encoded in an integer sequence of 1 11 therefore the genes contained in each chromosome represent the types of bmps implemented in different hrus fig 2 shows the integer gene coding used to realize the combination of bmps and represents the configuration scheme of bmps in the hrus the general flow of the nsga ii is shown in fig 3 first the fitness function of the multi objective evaluation system is constructed based on the environmental effectiveness database and cost database then the initial population of a certain scale is generated according to a set of genetic parameters the chromosome selection cross operation and mutation operation are done according to the fitness function repeating the foregoing operations to reach the maximum evolutionary algebra and the algorithm automatically terminates deb et al 2002 panagopoulos et al 2012 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the swat model the sufi 2 algorithm module built in the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup was used to calibrate and validate the model arnold et al 2012 rusli et al 2017 1991 1992 was the warm up period of the model which was used to eliminate the uncertainty influence of initial parameter values on the model simulation 1993 2004 was the calibration period and 2005 2015 was the validation period according to the sensitivity analysis results of the swat model the sensitivity parameters affecting runoff and tp were optimized and adjusted in this study the final verification results for monthly flow and tp load of the swat model are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 a that the swat model yielded good simulation results for runoff the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r2 during the calibration period are 0 87 and 0 82 respectively and the nse and r2 during the validation period are 0 78 and 0 75 respectively it can be seen from fig 4 b that the simulation results for the swat model for tp can basically meet the needs of model application in which the nse and r2 in the model calibration period are 0 69 and 0 75 respectively and the nse and r2 in validation period are 0 78 and 0 84 respectively when the nse is greater than 0 65 and the r2 is greater than 0 75 the verified model is considered good relative to the criteria of moriasi et al 2007 and can meet the simulation requirements of the current study 3 2 identification of pmas the verified swat model and the nsga ⅱ were used to identify the pmas of nps in the crw geng 2015 taking the water quality concentration at the outlet of the sub watershed and population quantity as the constraint conditions the pmas distribution of tn population water quality and tp population water quality in crw are discussed in fig 5 a when the tn population water quality identification basis was used the crw was divided into five tn management areas namely ma1 ma2 ma3 ma4 and ma5 among them ma1 accounted for 22 68 of the crw area and accounted for 61 99 of the tn load and 36 67 of the total population ma1 belonged to a region with severe nitrogen pollution and the average concentration of tn was 24 28 mg l ma2 accounted for 23 67 of the crw area and accounted for 20 96 of the tn load and 19 41 of the total population the average concentration of tn for ma2 was 11 22 mg l ma3 accounted for 18 16 of the crw area and accounted for 8 12 of the tn load and 15 41 of the total population the average concentration of tn for ma3 was 5 48 mg l ma4 accounted for 14 32 of the crw area and accounted for 4 77 of the tn load and 11 49 of the total population the average concentration of tn for ma4 was 3 74 mg l the area with the lowest risk ma5 accounted for 21 17 of the crw area and only accounted for 4 16 of the tn load and 16 52 of the total population ma1 and ma2 accounted for 46 35 of the crw area accounting for 82 95 of the tn load and 56 08 of the total population ma1 and ma2 have higher populations than other areas and had the most massive tn pollution therefore ma1 and ma2 composed the pmas for tn in the crw as shown in fig 5 b when the tp population water quality was taken as the identification basis the crw was divided into four tp management areas namely ma1 ma2 ma3 and ma4 among them ma1 accounted for 37 20 of the area and accounted for 68 16 of the tp load and 52 49 of the total population the average concentration of tp for ma1 was 0 21 mg l ma2 accounted for 22 95 of the crw area and accounted for 20 56 of the tp load and 17 43 of the total population the average concentration of tp for ma2 was 0 14 mg l ma3 accounted for 27 60 of the crw area and accounted for 7 41 of the tp load and 21 25 of the total population the average concentration of tp for ma3 was 0 094 mg l ma4 accounted for 12 25 of the crw area and accounted for 3 87 of the tp load and 8 83 of the total population the average concentration of tp for ma4 was 0 055 mg l ma1 had the largest area the highest population and the largest phosphorus load therefore ma1 composed the pma for tp in the crw as can be seen in fig 6 the pmas for tn in the crw were mainly concentrated in the upper watershed the pmas for tp were mainly concentrated in the upper middle watershed by comparing the spatial distribution of tn and tp pmas sub watersheds 12 13 16 and 21 were identified as pma1 areas for tn and tp this shows that the tn and tp load from these four sub watersheds were the highest in the crw and should have the highest priority for control on the basis of the pma identification this study also analyzed the difference of the tn and tp load for different land use types fig 7 in terms of tn the cultivated land had the highest load average 25 47 kg ha followed by grassland average 3 50 kg ha while orchard and forest land had the lowest loads average 0 43 and 0 32 kg ha respectively therefore cultivated land was the main land use type for tn similarly for tp cultivated land had the highest load average 2 47 kg ha followed by grassland average 0 26 kg ha while orchard and forest had the lowest loads average 0 17 and 0 11 kg ha respectively according to the foregoing analysis cultivated land is the key land use type affecting the tn and tp load and is mainly distributed in the middle and upper reaches of crw crop fertilization is the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus load the development of bmps needs to be aimed at the reduction of agricultural resources in cultivated land 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the nsga ⅱ parameters the main parameters in nsga ⅱ optimization included the number of generations population size crossover probability and mutation probability in order to ensure the robustness and convergence of the nsga ii it was necessary to analyze the sensitivity of the key parameters of the algorithm and determine the optimal combination of parameters rodriguez et al 2011 shen et al 2012 in order to reduce the computational complexity of a high dimensional parameter combination space one at a time oat was used as the parameter setting of sensitivity analysis the specific parameter settings are listed in table 3 the goal of nsga ⅱ optimization is to maximize the environmental objectives tn reduction tp reduction and minimize the economic objective implementation cost of bmps the pareto optimal front curve was drawn with the ecological effect objectives as the horizontal axis and the economic objective as the vertical axis when the pareto optimal front curve tends to the lower right end of a figure it indicates that the optimization scheme has better cost effectiveness and the parameters of the optimization scheme can be considered as the optimal parameters rodriguez et al 2011 the number of generations was one of the parameters that significantly influenced the results of the bmp optimization as shown in fig 8 when the number of evolutionary generations reached 10 000 the results tended to converge the number of generations was set to 10 000 the appropriate population size was determined to guarantee the fast convergence of the nsga ii optimization a given time when the population size was 250 the bmp implementation had a relatively good cost effectiveness and the pareto optimal front of the cost effectiveness curve was evenly distributed so the population size was set to 250 when the crossover probability increased from 0 10 to 0 60 the cost effectiveness value of bmp optimization results gradually was optimized when the crossover probability increased from 0 60 to 0 80 the cost effectiveness value of bmp optimization results tended to be stable considering the diversity and uniformity of the bmp space configuration scheme the crossover probability was set to 0 80 by analyzing the impact of the mutation probability on the cost effectiveness of bmp optimization results within the set range of the mutation probability the cost effectiveness of bmps gradually tended to be optimal as the mutation probability value increased when the mutation probability was 0 005 the cost effectiveness of bmps for tn and tp was optimized therefore the mutation probability was set as 0 005 3 4 effect of different bmp schemes on the nutrient load reduction 3 4 1 optimization scenarios for tp load reduction the effect of different bmps on tp load reduction from the crw was studied by using the nsga ⅱ optimization in order to analyze the search results of the optimization process this study focused on the pareto optimal front results of the optimization process shown in fig 9 a four representative solution sets were selected including the lowest cost solution scheme a the best cost effectiveness solution scheme b with lower cost and higher load reduction the zero cost solution scheme c and the highest reduction solution scheme d specifically when scheme a is selected the total implementation cost of the bmp scheme was 3 80 106 chinese yuan and the tp load of the bmp scheme for the crw can be reduced by 12 55 when scheme b is selected the total implementation cost of the scheme was 1 50 106 chinese yuan and the tp load can be reduced by 46 81 the reason why the cost of schemes a and b is negative is that the proportion reduced fertilizer application of bmps is higher so the cost expenditure can be reduced under the zero cost scheme scheme c the tp reduction of the bmp scheme for the crw was 56 74 when scheme d is selected the total implementation cost of the scheme was 1 99 107 chinese yuan and the tp reduction can reach 90 83 the implementation types and proportions of tp bmps are shown in fig 9 b when choosing the lowest cost scheme scheme a six types of bmps are included in this scenario namely no 1 traditional farming no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 no 6 stubble mulch no 10 conservation tillage and no 11 fertilize a month in advance the main types of bmps included nos 4 5 and 6 and their implementation proportions are 26 76 35 21 and 22 54 respectively when the best cost effectiveness scheme scheme b is selected eight different types of bmps are included among which no 2 contour planting no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 and no 6 stubble mulch are used in greater proportions than other bmp measures these proportions reached 8 45 15 49 26 76 and 38 03 respectively in the zero cost scheme scheme c seven different types of bmp measures are included with no 2 contour planting no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 and no 6 stubble mulch accounting for 18 31 12 66 22 54 and 38 03 respectively when the highest reduction scheme scheme d is selected six types of bmps are included with no 2 contour planting no 3 terraces and no 6 stubble mulch accounting for the main portion of bmps with the proportion reaching 28 17 46 48 and 15 49 respectively 3 4 2 optimization scenarios for the tn load reduction the cost effectiveness curve of the bmp optimization scheme for tn as the control objective is shown in fig 10 a four representative solution sets were selected from the pareto optimal front of the optimization process including the lowest cost solution scheme a the best cost effectiveness solution scheme b the zero cost solution scheme c and the highest reduction solution scheme d when lowest cost scheme is selected scheme a the total implementation cost of the bmp scheme is 3 80 106 chinese yuan and the tn load can be reduced by 7 14 when the best cost effectiveness scheme is selected scheme b the total implementation cost of the scheme is 1 40 106 chinese yuan and the tn reduction of the scheme can reach 17 58 under the zero cost scheme scheme c the tn reduction of the bmp scheme was 20 01 when the highest reduction scheme is selected scheme d the total implementation cost of the bmp scheme is 1 94 107 chinese yuan and the tn reduction could reach 29 99 the implementation and proportion of bmps under the different schemes are shown in fig 10 b when choosing the lowest cost bmp allocation scheme scheme a six types of bmps are included in this scenario i e no 1 traditional farming no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 no 6 stubble mulch no 10 conservation tillage and no 11 fertilize a month in advance among them the main types of bmps included nos 4 5 6 and 10 and their implementation proportions are 32 39 38 03 9 86 and 11 27 respectively when the cost effectiveness optimal scheme is selected scheme b eight different types of bmps are included among which the proportion of no 3 terraces no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 and no 6 stubble mulch have higher proportions than the other bmp measures the implementation proportions are 14 08 14 08 21 13 and 29 58 respectively for the zero cost scheme scheme c eight different types of bmp measures are included among which no 3 terraces no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 and no 6 stubble mulch have higher proportions than the other bmp measures with the proportions reaching 9 86 16 90 23 94 and 35 21 respectively when choosing the highest reduction scheme scheme d the scheme includes seven different types of bmp measures including no 2 contour farming no 3 terraces no 6 stubble mulch no 8 filter strips of 10 m and no 9 filter strips of 15 m with the proportions reaching 18 31 40 85 14 08 5 53 and 12 68 respectively 3 5 optimal allocation of bmps based on receiving water capacity constraints in order to achieve the goal of improving the water quality in the miyun reservoir under receiving water capacity constraints it is necessary to simultaneously reduce the tn and tp loads from the authors previous research the tn load to the miyun reservoir needed to be reduced by 28 31 while the tp load needed to be reduced by 69 28 wang et al 2020 these reduction amounts were used as the receiving water capacity constraints for the optimal allocation of bmps and the verified nsga ii was used to obtain the allocation scheme of bmps under the receiving water capacity constraints the optimal bmp scheme for the crw was obtained using a cost effectiveness analysis of the bmp allocation scheme under the constraint conditions the implementation types and proportions of the bmp schemes with the tn and tp control target are shown in fig 11 it can be seen from the figure that when the tn was taken as the control index to ensure that the tn reduction reaches the constraint target seven different types of bmp measures needed to be applied in the crw including bmps nos 2 3 6 7 8 9 and 10 the implementation ratios of the corresponding bmps are 26 76 46 78 16 90 1 41 2 82 4 23 and 1 41 respectively it can be seen that bmps no 2 contour farming no 3 terraces and no 6 stubble mulch are the main measures for nitrogen control for agricultural land in the crw when the tp was taken as the control index to ensure that the tp reduction reaches the constraint target the allocation scheme of bmps in the crw included 7 different bmp measures including nos 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 10 the implementation ratios of the corresponding bmps are 2 82 25 35 18 31 7 04 12 68 32 39 and 1 41 respectively it can be seen that bmps no 2 contour farming no 3 terraces no 4 fertilizer reduction of 30 no 5 fertilizer reduction of 50 and no 6 stubble mulch are the main measures for nitrogen and phosphorus control for agricultural land in the crw the cost effectiveness information of the bmp configuration scheme for the crw based on the receiving water capacity constraints is listed in table 4 the actual reduction rates of tn and tp in the bmp configuration scheme with tn as the control index were 28 31 and 78 91 respectively and the total implementation cost of bmps was 1 63 108 chinese yuan this scheme is able to meet the nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction targets under the receiving water capacity constraints tn 28 31 tp 69 28 the tn and tp reductions of the bmp configuration scheme with tp as the control index were 25 02 and 69 28 respectively and the total cost of implementation was 4 07 107 chinese yuan this scheme can t meet the target of nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction under the receiving water capacity constraints tn 28 31 tp 69 28 compared with the tn control measures the tp control measures are dominated by management bmps which was the main reason why the bmp configuration scheme with tp as the control index can t meet the target for tn reduction 4 discussion 4 1 effect of bmps on tp load reduction fig 9 a shows a combination of bmps for four different scenarios with the increase in cost the proportion of engineering bmps increases and the magnitude of tp reduction also increases when the reduction is the highest scheme d the main bmps are contour farming terraces and stubble mulch accounting for 28 17 46 48 and 15 49 respectively among them terraces have the greatest impact on the tp reduction rate which can effectively reduce the tp load briak et al 2019 park et al 2014 because terraces are an engineering management measure the cost of implementation is larger according to a comparison of the pmas for tp the area with the greatest amount of the tp load is located in the middle of the crw cultivated land is the primary land type yielding tp output and rice corn among others are the main crops the cultivated land in the crw is slightly steep and is suitable for construction of terraces which can retain surface runoff and reduce nutrient losses özcan et al 2017 when the amount of tp reduction is low the main bmps are fertilizer reduction and stubble mulch therefore the cost of implementing bmps and the efficiency of tp reduction are low liu et al 2019a panagopoulos et al 2011 proved that specific fertilization management had no effect on crop yield but it was effective in reducing pollutant yield however reduction of fertilizer application in a short period can reduce part of the tp load but the effect is not obvious in scheme a only 12 55 of the tp load was reduced because there was a large amount of phosphorus retained in the soil sediment long term fertilization management or engineering bmps are required to reduce phosphorus loss through comprehensive analysis it has been found that terraces are the most effective measure to reduce the tp load in the crw 4 2 effect of bmps on tn load reduction as shown in fig 10 a in the scheme with the lowest cost scheme a the main bmp is to control the use of chemical fertilizer which accounts for 70 42 of all bmps however the effect of chemical fertilizer reduction on tn load reduction is not obvious in addition to the nitrogen retained in the soil atmospheric nitrogen deposition and livestock manure also are important factors affecting tn load reduction deng et al 2020 similar to the reduction effect of tp with the increase of the reduction of tn the proportion of management bmps gradually decreases while the proportion of engineering bmps such as terraces filter strips etc gradually increases in the highest reduction scheme scheme d contour farming and terraces account for a large proportion of the total which are the major measures to improve the tn reduction contour farming and tillage refer to the cultivation and planting according to the contour lines of the field rather than straight line tillage these measures improve the soil infiltration capacity and reduce soil erosion intensity mtibaa et al 2018 in order to reduce the loss of sediment and nutrients protection measures in the form of filter strips are applied in the key sub watersheds filter strips remove contaminants sediment nutrients etc by reducing the surface velocity resulting in particulate deposition himanshu et al 2019 kaini et al 2012 lam et al 2011 lowrance et al 1984 proposed there are two effects of filter strips on tn load reduction first filter strips reduce runoff velocity and promote nitrogen infiltration filter strips can also reduce the nitrogen load through the absorption by plants in the filter vegetation as well as the immobilization and denitrification by of microorganisms the current study found that terraces are the most effective measure to improve the reduction of tn among the bmps for the crw filter strips and contour farming also play an important role in the tn load reduction 4 3 scenario analysis of bmps under receiving water capacity constraints in this study the receiving water capacity was included in the constraints and a new multi objective optimization framework for lakes or reservoirs was proposed arabi et al 2006 and chen et al 2016 used different genetic algorithms and watershed models to simulate nutrient load reduction in a small watershed in indiana usa and the three gorges reservoir area in china respectively although the simulation was successful they only assumed a reduction target and did not fully consider the receiving water capacity of the study watershed similar studies liu et al 2019b makarewicz et al 2015 monaghan et al 2007 uribe et al 2018 wang et al 2018 made the theoretical research separate from the actual watershed receiving water capacity thus reducing the practical guidance value of the research results geng 2015 has explored the effect of different combinations of bmps on nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction in the crw however he did not consider the receiving water capacity of the crw and only studied the scenarios of the lowest cost and the largest reduction bmp schemes qiu et al 2018 considered two schemes a high water quality standard and a drinking water standard from the perspective of the government and farmer respectively finding that there were significant differences in bmp types spatial allocation and economic costs between the two schemes the resulting bmp allocation also was not combined with the actual situation in the crw on the basis of the authors previous research wang et al 2020 starting from the actual receiving water capacity in the crw for the miyun reservoir two bmp combination schemes with tn and tp as control indices were obtained the bmp combination scheme with tn as the control index mainly included engineered bmps while the scheme with tp as the control index mainly included managerial bmps this difference in bmps was the main reason why the latter scheme cannot meet the expected reduction targets liu et al 2019a for cost effective analysis the bmp combination scheme with tp as the control index had a lower cost because managerial bmps are more cost effective measures liu et al 2019b under the constraints of the receiving water capacity the bmp combination that fully met the receiving water capacity of the crw needed to reduce the tn and tp loads by 28 31 and 78 91 respectively and the total implementation cost was 1 63 108 chinese yuan geng 2015 calculated the bmp cost for control of tn and tp separately without considering the simultaneous reduction of both the receiving water capacity of the miyun reservoir can only be met in the maximum reduction scheme and its implementation cost was much higher than the current research scheme the results of the current study yielded good environmental and economic benefits however there were also some deficiencies in the current work when using a combination of bmps with tn as the control index although the nutrient load reduction requirement can be met the reduction of tp exceeded the target value by 9 63 points which increased the implementation cost of bmps exceeding the expected target was mainly because few combinations of bmps were considered in the current study and not enough optional combinations were considered when using the nsga ⅱ algorithm in future research the bmp combination database can be increased so that the reduction of the bmp combinations coincides with the receiving water capacity which can be widely and effectively applied to the formulation of other agricultural watershed management schemes 5 conclusions this research proposed a pollution control strategy based on joint optimization of bmps and implementation cost under the constraints of the receiving water capacity this optimization strategy is obviously different from the goal oriented control applied in previous studies this proposed approach emphasizes that the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus load should be combined with the actual environmental capacity of water bodies to effectively control water pollution taking the tn tp cost as the optimization index the swat model and nsga ⅱ optimization were used to construct the optimal allocation framework for general watershed management measures the following important conclusions were found the tn pmas are mainly located in the upper watershed of the crw while the tp pmas are mainly concentrated in the middle of the crw sub watersheds 12 13 16 and 21 have the highest priority for control in the crw with the increase of the proportion of engineering management measures the reduction of tn and tp loads also will increase and the corresponding implementation cost also will increase it is found that terraces are the most effective measure to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus load in the crw filter strips and contour farming also play an important role in nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction the reduction percentage of tp is significantly higher than that of total nitrogen in the crw when taking tn tp cost as the joint optimization target the bmp allocation schemes contour farming terraces and stubble mulch account for 26 76 46 78 and 6 90 respectively with tn as the control index can meet the receiving water capacity constraints for the crw for this allocation of bmps the actual reduction of tn and tp is 28 31 and 78 91 respectively and the total implementation cost of the corresponding bmp scheme is 1 63 108 chinese yuan fully considering the actual characteristics and capacity of the crw the bmp configuration schemes with a practical guiding value was obtained the proposed multi objective optimization framework based on receiving water capacity was not only suitable for the crw flowing into the miyun reservoir but also is suitable for other reservoirs the applied methodology can be a good alternative for controlling the agricultural nps in reservoir water source areas declaration of

9874,the existence of suspended particles in water poses a great challenge to the adaptability of drip irrigation technology to explore the differences in emitter clogging caused by irrigation water containing various suspended solids this research used irrigation water containing yellow river sand quartz sand and sodium bentonite as the main suspended particles designated hw sw and bw respectively to conduct a short period emitter anti clogging test and particle settlement test in static water the results showed that the type of suspended particles had a very significant impact on the relative flow rate dra of the emitter p 0 01 emitter clogging was the most serious in the hw treatment followed by the sw treatment and emitters in the bw treatment had the lowest clogging degree the clogging substance formed in the hw treatment exhibited a compact and stable structure that in the sw treatment was a loosely structured accumulation of large particles and that in the bw treatment had a flocculent structure with strong plasticity that flowed easily with water these three types of suspended particles experienced two stages of sedimentation short rapid sedimentation followed by slow sedimentation grid clogging at the emitter s water inlet caused emitter clogging the total mass of sediment in laterals in the hw treatment was the largest and the dra was the smallest the total mass of sediment in laterals in the bw treatment was the smallest and the dra was the largest in the sw treatment the values of these two indexes were between those in the hw and bw treatments single suspended particles such as quartz sand powder or sodium bentonite clay had more difficulty forming stable clogging structures so the dra was relatively high coarse and fine particles were balanced in yellow river sand thus the emitter was easily clogged and the degree of clogging was the most serious this study tried to provide a basis for the differences and formation mechanisms of emitter clogging and the anti clogging strategies of emitters in drip irrigation systems in different reaches of the yellow river keywords emitter clogging yellow river sand quartz sand sodium bentonite grid clogging channel clogging 1 introduction the yellow river basin is an important ecological barrier and economic zone in china the sustainable development of agriculture at the yellow river basin is inseparable from the support of modern irrigation technology as a water saving irrigation technology drip irrigation technology has a great role in promoting the sustainable development of agriculture in the yellow river basin however the yellow river contains less water and more sand and the relationship between water and sand is not coordinated the existence of suspended particles in water poses a great challenge to the adaptability of drip irrigation technology drip irrigation has significantly improved water use efficiency wue and increased grain yield and quality benouniche et al 2014 kachwaya et al 2016 utkhede 1999 it is a promising agricultural technology for solving the shortage of agricultural water however emitter clogging reduces the irrigation quality of drip irrigation projects increases the maintenance cost and shortens the life of drip irrigation systems oron et al 1991 emitter clogging also results in uneven water distribution in the soil and low yield and quality of crops el bouhali et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 barragan et al 2010 wang et al 2014 therefore emitter clogging is the key factor restricting the further promotion of drip irrigation technology farmland along the yellow river in northwest china mainly uses the yellow river as a source of irrigation water the average sediment content in yellow river water is 28 36 kg m3 and the sediment content in the flood season is often greater than 300 kg m3 yao et al 2016 even after layer by layer filtration particles smaller than 0 67 mm still enter the drip irrigation system these suspended solids are subjected to strong mixing in the labyrinth channel for example by turbulent flow therefore the probability of contact among particles increases and emitters easily become clogged ge et al 2010 thill et al 2001 niu et al 2012 oliveira 2017 solid particles are the major components of emitter clogging problems nakayama and bucks 1991 yu et al 2018 lavanholi et al 2018 the yellow river flows through 3 different tectonic units from west to east the qinghai tibet fault block the qinling qilianshan fold belt and the north china platform the different regional geology and geomorphology in the various catchment areas and the means by which the sediment enters the river lead to very distinctive heterogeneous water and sediment features in the yellow river basin ye 1994 for example the sediment particles in the ningxia to mongolia section of the yellow river are mainly hornblende pyroxene epidote and hematite and the sediment particles in the middle section of the stream are mainly illite quartz chlorite calcite and feldspar in the gui de section near the source of the yellow river the main viscous mineral components of yellow river silt account for only 10 32 in the middle and upper reaches of baotou and tongguan that value increases to 19 05 and 18 48 respectively in the lower pingyin section the maximum value is 54 44 zhou et al 2015 non clay minerals mainly include quartz and feldspar and clay minerals mainly include montmorillonite illite kaolinite etc tian et al 2020 arsenović et al 2014 tsozué et al 2017 noncohesive mineral particles are usually granular and their shape is similar to that of a sphere zhao et al 2016 clay mineral particles are usually flakes with large specific surface areas and their particle shape is very different from that of a sphere shah 2018 shah et al 2018 the surface charge density of clay mineral particles is much higher than that of non clay mineral particles clay minerals adsorb a thicker water film which increases their equivalent diameter and reduces their equivalent weight the zeta potential of clay mineral particles is much greater than that of non clay minerals so its solution has good colloidal stability wang 2019 differences in particle shape and particle surface charge among different mineral types may cause various suspended particulates to undergo different sedimentation processes skinnebach et al 2019 resulting in differences in the amount and characteristics of clogging materials the composition of suspended particles in the water may lead to different degrees and forms of emitter clogging prevention and treatment methods for emitter clogging are needed however there are few studies focused on this topic the influence of three kinds of suspended particles on the clogging of emitters was analyzed to discuss the formation process of emitter clogging in different sections of the yellow river this research aimed to provide a technical basis for the prevention and control of emitter clogging 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design previous studies have shown that the non clay mineral content that is primarily quartz sio2 is greater than 70 in the yellow river drip irrigation system and sodium bentonite al2 mg3 si4o10 oh 2 nh2o is the main viscous mineral constituent zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 in this study quartz sand s sodium bentonite p and yellow river sand h were selected to represent non cohesive particles cohesive particles and mixed cohesive and noncohesive particles to prepare a water source with a suspended particle concentration of 2 0 g l the corresponding treatments were recorded as sw bw and hw respectively for an emitter anti clogging test each treatment included two lateral laying methods for the emitter s water inlet upwards and downwards in total there were 6 treatments in the emitter anti clogging test in addition the above three kinds of particles were mixed with ultrapure water into a 5 0 g l suspension for a hydrostatic sedimentation test 2 2 material yellow river sand was taken from riverbed silt in the floodplain of the qingtongxia reach of the yellow river in ningxia after removing the impurities on the surface of the riverbed a shovel was used to collect the surface 0 15 cm silt the collected samples were air dried and ground then they were mixed uniformly sodium bentonite and quartz sand were purchased from a water purification company the three types of sediments were all passed through a 320 mesh screen to obtain the target sediments guan et al 2018 liu et al 2018 the mechanical composition is shown in table 1 non compensating inner mounted labyrinth channel emitters are common in drip irrigation systems because of their low cost zhang et al 2011 therefore this kind of emitter was chosen in this experiment the non compensating inner mounted labyrinth channel emitter shandong chunyu water saving irrigation equipment co ltd used in this experiment had a rated flow of 1 1 l h at a working pressure of 100 kpa the tip angle of the emitter labyrinth channel was 30 the tooth height was 1 13 mm the tooth width was 1 25 mm the runner width was 1 69 mm and the runner depth was 0 75 mm the lateral diameter was 16 mm the wall thickness was 0 38 mm and the distance between the emitters was 30 cm as shown in fig 1 the anti clogging test platform was built with reference to the following methods agricultural irrigation equipment emitters and emitter pipe specification and test methods gb t 17187 2009 micro irrigation emitters micro tubings micro tapes sl t 67 2 1994 and clogging test methods for emitters iso tc 23 sc 18 wg5 n4 the test platform included the water supply system pressure control device drip irrigation laterals to be tested and drainage device the mixer was equipped above the water bucket to ensure the uniform silt distribution of the water source and eliminate the impact of sedimentation during the irrigation period the first part controlled the return water flow by adjusting the valve opening degree to maintain a set working pressure after the test the entire irrigation network system was fully flushed and cleaned to avoid the system s silt and sand from interfering with the test results the test platform laid 6 drip irrigation laterals for every irrigation three drip irrigation laterals had upward emitter inlets and the other 3 drip irrigation laterals had downward emitter inlets fig 2 2 3 test implementation 2 3 1 anti clogging test in this experiment the test laterals were irrigated twice per day each irrigation lasted for 2 h with a 1 h break in total a continuous 10 d irrigation was considered one cycle and the cumulative irrigation for each treatment was 40 h during the irrigation period 10 emitters were selected on each lateral when the system ran stably the water collecting cups were placed under the selected emitters to collect the water volume for 10 min to calculate the emitter flow rate after a one cycle test each lateral section was divided into three equal sections the sediment in the laterals was collected in a tin foil bowl dried in an oven at 105 c and then weighed with a balance accuracy 0 0001 g the clogged emitter was dissected to extract the clogging substance the clogged substance in the emitter was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem s 4800 hitachi japan 2 3 2 sedimentation test ten grams of soil sample was weighed with a balance and placed in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask the flask was shaken well and placed on an electric hot plate to slightly boil for 1 h to obtain a solution containing dispersed sand particles the solution was stirred continuously with a glass rod during the entire boiling period to prevent soil particles from depositing sticking together into lumps or scorching after the dispersed suspension was cooled it was poured into a 2000 ml sedimentation cylinder without any solution volume loss then distilled water was added to make the water surface of the suspension even with the 2000 ml graduation line of the graduated cylinder the suspension was evenly stirred up and down for 1 min with a stirrer to evenly distribute the sediment after the stirring was stopped 10 ml of the suspension was taken to test the turbidity degree orion aquafast thermo usa at a fixed depth from the water surface at 400 1000 and 1600 ml scale lines according to the set time interval 0 5 15 30 60 120 and 240 min respectively and the turbidity degree was converted to sediment concentration according to preset markings 2 4 data treatment 2 4 1 solution concentration turbidity trendline a balance with an accuracy of 0 0001 g was used to weigh 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 0 30 0 35 0 40 0 45 and 0 50 g of quartz sand sodium bentonite and yellow river sand in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask one hundred milliliters of distilled water was measured in a cylinder and poured into an erlenmeyer flask to make sediment suspensions with concentrations of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 g l the suspensions were shaken well and heated to disperse the sediment after the dispersed suspension was cooled it was shaken evenly and 10 ml of the suspension was quickly taken to test the turbidity this was repeated 3 times a linear regression was taken of the turbidity and concentration to obtain turbidity concentration curves the trendlines for the three different suspensions 2 4 2 anti clogging performance the average relative flow dra was used to characterize the overall clogging of the entire drip irrigation lateral zhang et al 2020 the density of muddy water is greater than that of clear water the ratio of the emitter flow rate at the initial stage to the emitter flow rate at the time of sampling was used to characterize the dra to eliminate the error caused by sediment the temperature error was corrected by the method of pei pei et al 2014 1 d r a i 1 n q i q i 0 n 100 where dra is the average relative flow rate in q i is the flow rate of the i th tested emitter in l h q i0 is the flow rate of the i th tested emitter at the initial stage of irrigation in l h and n is the number of tested emitters on a lateral 2 4 3 data analysis spss software was used for the analysis of variance and least significant difference lsd multiple comparison originpro 2016 software was used for drawing figures 3 results 3 1 correspondence between suspended solids concentration and turbidity the relationship between the suspended particle concentration and turbidity fig 3 shows that when the water temperature was 20 c as the concentration of suspended particles increased the turbidity of the suspension exhibited a very significant linear increasing trend the slope of bw was the largest at 340 16 the slope of hw was the second largest at 157 44 and the slope of sw was the smallest at 46 86 when the concentration of suspended particles was the same the turbidity of the water was different for example when the concentration of suspended particles was 2 0 g l the turbidity of the bw sw and hw suspensions was 691 2 60 91 56 5 57 and 328 14 12 37 fau respectively the turbidity of the bw suspension was the largest in the sedimentation test by measuring the turbidity of the suspension the corresponding suspended particle concentration was determined according to the relationship curve in fig 2 3 2 sedimentation of suspended particles within the initial 0 5 min settling stage the concentration of suspended particles showed an abruptly rapid downward trend as the concentration dropped from 5 0 g l to 2 0 g l fig 4 this stage involved rapid sedimentation generally the stable sedimentation stage occurred after 5 min and the concentration of suspended particles slowly and continuously decreased during this stage different suspended particles showed different settling speeds for example when the settling time was 15 min the concentrations of the sw bw and hw suspensions at the 1600 ml line were 1 32 1 93 and 1 73 g l respectively the concentrations at the 1000 ml line were 1 65 2 07 and 1 81 g l respectively and the concentrations at the 400 ml line were 1 91 2 10 and 1 93 g l respectively the sw suspension particles settled the fastest and the particle concentration was the lowest the bw suspension particles settled the slowest and the particle concentration was the highest the concentration of the bw suspension gradually increased as the depth below the liquid surface increased the bottom sediment concentrations were 4 7 21 2 higher than those of the surface layer within the first 60 min the sediment concentration at the bottom of the sw suspension was 0 9 17 higher than the sediment concentration at the top with the extension of the settling time the difference in concentration at different locations gradually narrowed finally there was no significant difference in the sediment concentration at different locations at 120 min the change in the sediment concentration distribution of the hw suspension was between those of the bw and sw suspensions 3 3 mass of sediment particles as shown in table 2 when the emitter s water inlet was upward the mass of deposited particles from the first section to the end of the lateral decreased significantly p 0 05 the sedimentation amount in the hw treatment in the front section of the lateral 24 02 g m was significantly larger than that in the sw treatment 17 18 g m the sedimentation mass in the sw treatment was significantly greater than that in the bw treatment 6 60 g m the sedimentation amount in the middle section of the lateral was significantly reduced compared with that in the first section the difference between the three treatments was still significant the sw treatment at the end of the lateral had the largest sediment settlement the difference between the hw and sw treatments was not significant nor was that between the hw and bw treatments there were significant differences in the amount of deposited particles in different suspensions in the first and middle sections of the lateral but no significant difference was found in those at the end of the lateral the direction of the emitter s water inlet was an important factor that affected the lateral sedimentation volume when the emitter s water inlet was downward the mass of particles flowing out of the emitter decreased and the amount of sedimentation increased in the front section of the lateral the mass of deposited particles in the downward treatment was close to twice that in the upward treatment at the end of the lateral direction the mass of deposited particles in the downward treatment was almost the same as that in the upward treatment the difference between the sedimentation amounts of different suspended solids suspensions was reduced at the end section the sedimentation mass of the hw and sw treatments was significantly greater than that of the bw treatment p 0 05 there was no significant difference in the sedimentation mass between the hw and sw treatments when the emitter s water inlet was upwards the mass of deposited particles at the head middle and end of the lateral in the hw treatment was reduced by 37 37 52 46 and 1 19 respectively compared to that when the emitter s water inlet was downwards the values were 51 62 61 25 and 49 88 for the sw treatment and 43 92 57 42 and 77 86 for the bw treatment table 2 the total mass of deposited sediment in the lateral when the emitter s water inlet was down was 76 06 139 23 greater than that when the emitter s water inlet was up fig 5 3 4 relative flow rate dra fig 6 shows the influence of the hw sw and bw suspensions on the degree of emitter clogging as the number of irrigations increased the dra decreased differently under the three irrigation water sources with the three types of suspended solids the suspended matter composition significantly affected the emitter clogging process p 0 05 when the emitter s water inlet was upward the dra in the hw treatment was 27 65 after 20 irrigations which was the most seriously clogged the clogging in the bw treatment was light and the dra was 85 61 the dra in the sw treatment was 47 62 which was between the dra in the bw and hw treatments fig 5a when the emitter s water inlet was downward the dra values corresponding to the hw sw and bw treatments were 81 19 98 51 and 99 96 respectively after 20 irrigations fig 5b the bw and sw treatments had no significant difference in emitter clogging however the sw and hw treatments had significant differences in emitter clogging p 0 05 which was the same as the bw and hw treatments in the final test irrigation the dra when the emitter s water inlet was downward was 53 54 50 89 and 14 35 higher than that when the emitter s water inlet was upward the results of the analysis of variance for the flow rate of the clogging showed table 3 that both the type of suspended particle and the direction of the emitter s water inlet had a significant effect on the dra p 0 01 this meant that when the sediment concentration was 2 0 g l suspended particles were an important factor affecting emitter clogging the suspended particles interacted with the direction of the emitter s water inlet which significantly affected the dra different types of suspended particles had different degrees of emitter clogging when the emitter s water inlet was downward emitter clogging caused by all types of suspended particles was alleviated well 3 5 morphology of the clogging substance the microscopic morphology of the clogging substance in the hw sw and bw treatments had different characteristics fig 7 the clogging substance that formed at the flow channel of the emitter in the hw treatment had an obvious mosaic block structure the gaps among large particles were filled with flakes and rod shaped small particles the blockage structure was dense and stable the initial state was an accumulating body in a loose structure the particle size of quartz sand was large with a median size of 0 06 mm the initial state was a loose accumulation structure with natural overlap between the particles the gap between the particles was very large the morphological characteristics of the clogging substance formed in the clogging flow channel were basically the same as the initial particle structure however there was more compact overlap between the particles more reduced pores and enhanced stability of clogging substances compared with the initial particles in the sw treatment sodium bentonite initially accumulated as a body in obvious small groups that had a close structure the links between different small groups were not tight and the pores were large the clogging substance at the flow channel of the emitter in the bw treatment was composed of strip like or block like floc structures comparative analysis of the morphological characteristics of the clogging substance formed by three different suspended particles revealed that the clogging substance formed in the hw treatment was inlaid and bonded forming a dense and stable structure which is difficult to break and loses stability the clogging substance formed in the sw treatment was mainly an unstable structure caused by large particles which was easily damaged bentonite was composed of extremely fine particles so the flocculent structure that formed was plastically deformable there were links between different flocculent structures but they were not strong therefore the bentonite clogging material was greatly affected by flow erosion 4 discussion 4 1 grid clogging at the emitter s water inlet as the sedimentation rate of particulate matter changed from rapid sedimentation in the early stage to slow sedimentation in the later stage the sedimentation volume in the front middle and end of the lateral changed from large to small the number of water inlet clogged emitters at the front section of the lateral was the largest along the flow direction of the lateral the number of clogged emitters decreased table 4 the pearson correlation analysis results showed that there was a very significant positive linear correlation between the number of grid clogged emitters and the mass of deposited particles fig 8 which means that the more suspended particles that settled the greater the probability of grid clogging therefore the probability of particles entering the labyrinth channel may increase further adding the risk of emitter clogging for example this experiment revealed that the mass of deposited particles in the lateral in the hw treatment was the largest so the dra was the smallest and the number of clogged emitters was the largest the mass of deposited particles in the lateral in the bw treatment was the smallest the emitter dra was the largest and the emitters were the least clogged the suspended particles deposited at the bottom of the lateral could directly block the grid of the emitter s water inlet fig 9 preventing water from entering the emitter and causing grid inlet clogging additionally the deposited particles may have entered the emitter labyrinth channel during the movement of the water causing the sand concentration of the water flow in the channel to be much higher than the initial concentration thereby adding an extra clogging risk the sediment mass in the lateral correlated too closely with the type of suspended particles for example settlement more easily occurred in the hw treatment compared to the bw treatment therefore the sediment mass in the lateral in the hw treatment was larger than that in the bw treatment in addition the sediment mass in the lateral was closely related to the structure of the sediment for example although the sw treatment had the fastest settlement in this test the lateral sedimentation volume of the sw treatment was less than that of the hw treatment the most likely reason is that the loose structure of the sediment formed by the settlement was easily discharged by the water flow through the emitter channel to the outside of the emitter the sediment mass in the lateral was the result of the combined effect of the sedimentation of suspended particles and the emitters delivery and discharge ability from the perspective of particle sedimentation only without considering the movement of sediment the sediment mass in the lateral decreased gradually from the front to the end of the lateral as the particles gradually settled the sediment concentration was lower in the flow at the end of the lateral than at the front of the lateral therefore the risk of emitter clogging at the end of the lateral was reduced however in the actual irrigation process due to the influx of water the deposited particles in the lateral gradually move to the end of the lateral therefore the number of clogged emitters was the highest when the emitter s water inlet was upward because the lateral tended to accumulate sediment most easily in its end section 4 2 flow channel clogging when emitters were installed on the top of the lateral so that the emitter s water inlet was downwards the clogging risk of the emitter s grid inlet was basically eliminated at the same time due to the sedimentation in the lateral the sand concentration in the water decreased reducing the clogging probability and clogging degree the change in the direction of the emitter s water inlet also avoided the clogging difference caused by grid clogging with the three types of suspended particles when the emitter s water inlet was downwards the number of clogged emitters and degree of clogging in the hw sw and bw treatments were significantly lower than those when the emitter s water inlet was upwards the grid clogging in the hw and sw treatments was significantly improved the dra in the bw treatment was improved although there was no significant difference between treatments when the emitter s water inlet was upwards versus downwards table 4 in drip irrigation practice arranging the emitter s water inlet downwards should be considered to control grid clogging and reduce the risk of emitter clogging especially when using water with many non sticky coarse particles for irrigation when the emitter s water inlet was downwards the type of suspended particles was still an important factor affecting emitter clogging from the perspective of mechanical components table 1 although the median particle size of the hw 0 025 mm treatment was smaller than that of the sw 0 060 mm treatment the emitter in the hw treatment was the most prone to be clogged and the degree of clogging was the most serious this is because the hw treatment had both large particles and small particles and it easily formed a dense and stable structure with large particles as the skeleton and small particles as the filling matter the sw treatment mainly contained coarser particles there was less adhesion between the clogging particles and the structure of the clogging substance was unstable its degree of emitter clogging was lower than that of the hw treatment the clogging substance formed in the bw treatment was a flocculent structure although the structure was not easily destroyed due to the lack of large particles as a support the flocculent structure was highly plastic and easily released water and the emitter was the least clogged in the bw treatment therefore when the type and diameter size of the suspended particles in the water was relatively single coarse particles were more likely to clog the emitter than fine particles however it was more difficult for a single particle size to cause serious clogging of the emitter in contrast when the suspended particles in the water had a balanced distribution of coarse particles and fine particles emitter clogging most likely occurred in addition during the continuous irrigation process the fluctuation of the flow in the sw treatment was mainly caused by the process of instability damage and reformation of the clogging substance sodium bentonite had little effect on emitter clogging and the flow rate of the emitter easily recovered under bw drip irrigation conditions because the surface charge of the bw treatment made the particles repulsive and it was difficult to form a firm and stable plugging structure de oliveira et al 2020 the bw treatment had the greatest viscosity at 20 c table 5 which means that the viscous bentonite particles in the water body had better water flow followability wang et al 1994 2017 it easily flowed out of the labyrinth channel under the action of hydrodynamic force avoiding excessive sedimentation in the emitter labyrinth channel which is similar to the research results of wang et al 2009 therefore the bw treatment corresponded to the smallest number of water inlet clogged emitters table 4 and the largest dra fig 5 nevertheless the increase in the concentration of suspended particles passing through the labyrinth channel increased the probability of emitter channel adhesion and blockage wu et al 2014 a drip irrigation system with water containing more viscous particles should be mainly used to prevent the emitter channel from being clogged the hw treatment was a mixture of viscous and non sticky suspended particles non viscous particles easily collided and remained in the flow channel compared to the pvc wall of the channel the rough surface of the colliding non sticky particles more easily adsorbed sticky particles among them sticky particles aggregated under the flocculation effect caused by van der waals forces and surface charges fettweis and lee 2017 they filled the voids of the skeleton formed by large particles to bond and strengthen the stability of the clogging substance resulting in irreversible emitter clogging this supports the view of niu et al 2012 that the agglomeration of non sticky particles and clay particles is the main reason for physical emitter clogging furthermore when the proportion of viscous and non sticky suspended particles in the water is balanced the risk of clogging greatly increases and this water quality needs to be specifically addressed overall to avoid emitter clogging caused by sedimentation of suspended particles it is recommended that when laying the lateral the emitter s water inlet should be downwards when there are many viscous particles in the water the powdered particles should be filtered out as much as possible since the number and activity of microorganisms and the content of organic matter in yellow river water are at a relatively low level this article does not consider the role of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substance eps in the sedimentation and flocculation of suspended particles nor does it consider the adhesion and volume growth of clogging substances however only a small number of microorganisms and organic matter may have a nonnegligible impact on the formation and growth of emitter clogging ait mouheb et al 2019 li et al 2017 wang et al 2020 further research needs to be carried out to assess this topic in addition the threshold of the suspended particle concentration and grading also require further research 5 conclusions and suggestions 1 the type of suspended particles significantly affected the clogging process of the emitter p 0 05 emitter clogging in the hw treatment was the most serious and emitter clogging in the bw treatment was the lightest 2 the direction of the emitter s water inlet significantly affects grid clogging changing the emitters water inlet upwards to downwards can significantly alleviate the emitter clogging caused by various suspended particles the dra of the emitter when the emitter s water inlet was downwards was 53 54 50 89 and 14 35 higher than that when the emitter s water inlet was upwards when the emitter s water inlet was upwards grid clogging induced by the sedimentation of particles was the main cause of emitter clogging under these conditions the hw treatment had the largest mass of deposited particles and the smallest dra the bw treatment had the smallest mass of deposited particles and the largest dra 3 flocculent blockage formed by a single sticky particle was easy to deform its water flow ability was strong and it did not easily cause emitter clogging the structure of the single non sticky coarse particle accumulation was loose and unstable and did not easily cause serious emitter clogging when irrigation water contained both viscous and non viscous particles it easily formed a blockage with a stable and compact structure and emitter clogging became serious and irreversible 4 when using yellow river water for drip irrigation selecting appropriate anti clogging management methods according to the main characteristics of the sediment in different river sections is recommended when irrigation water contains both viscous and non sticky particles additional attention and measures should be added to prevent emitters from clogging declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

9874,the existence of suspended particles in water poses a great challenge to the adaptability of drip irrigation technology to explore the differences in emitter clogging caused by irrigation water containing various suspended solids this research used irrigation water containing yellow river sand quartz sand and sodium bentonite as the main suspended particles designated hw sw and bw respectively to conduct a short period emitter anti clogging test and particle settlement test in static water the results showed that the type of suspended particles had a very significant impact on the relative flow rate dra of the emitter p 0 01 emitter clogging was the most serious in the hw treatment followed by the sw treatment and emitters in the bw treatment had the lowest clogging degree the clogging substance formed in the hw treatment exhibited a compact and stable structure that in the sw treatment was a loosely structured accumulation of large particles and that in the bw treatment had a flocculent structure with strong plasticity that flowed easily with water these three types of suspended particles experienced two stages of sedimentation short rapid sedimentation followed by slow sedimentation grid clogging at the emitter s water inlet caused emitter clogging the total mass of sediment in laterals in the hw treatment was the largest and the dra was the smallest the total mass of sediment in laterals in the bw treatment was the smallest and the dra was the largest in the sw treatment the values of these two indexes were between those in the hw and bw treatments single suspended particles such as quartz sand powder or sodium bentonite clay had more difficulty forming stable clogging structures so the dra was relatively high coarse and fine particles were balanced in yellow river sand thus the emitter was easily clogged and the degree of clogging was the most serious this study tried to provide a basis for the differences and formation mechanisms of emitter clogging and the anti clogging strategies of emitters in drip irrigation systems in different reaches of the yellow river keywords emitter clogging yellow river sand quartz sand sodium bentonite grid clogging channel clogging 1 introduction the yellow river basin is an important ecological barrier and economic zone in china the sustainable development of agriculture at the yellow river basin is inseparable from the support of modern irrigation technology as a water saving irrigation technology drip irrigation technology has a great role in promoting the sustainable development of agriculture in the yellow river basin however the yellow river contains less water and more sand and the relationship between water and sand is not coordinated the existence of suspended particles in water poses a great challenge to the adaptability of drip irrigation technology drip irrigation has significantly improved water use efficiency wue and increased grain yield and quality benouniche et al 2014 kachwaya et al 2016 utkhede 1999 it is a promising agricultural technology for solving the shortage of agricultural water however emitter clogging reduces the irrigation quality of drip irrigation projects increases the maintenance cost and shortens the life of drip irrigation systems oron et al 1991 emitter clogging also results in uneven water distribution in the soil and low yield and quality of crops el bouhali et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 barragan et al 2010 wang et al 2014 therefore emitter clogging is the key factor restricting the further promotion of drip irrigation technology farmland along the yellow river in northwest china mainly uses the yellow river as a source of irrigation water the average sediment content in yellow river water is 28 36 kg m3 and the sediment content in the flood season is often greater than 300 kg m3 yao et al 2016 even after layer by layer filtration particles smaller than 0 67 mm still enter the drip irrigation system these suspended solids are subjected to strong mixing in the labyrinth channel for example by turbulent flow therefore the probability of contact among particles increases and emitters easily become clogged ge et al 2010 thill et al 2001 niu et al 2012 oliveira 2017 solid particles are the major components of emitter clogging problems nakayama and bucks 1991 yu et al 2018 lavanholi et al 2018 the yellow river flows through 3 different tectonic units from west to east the qinghai tibet fault block the qinling qilianshan fold belt and the north china platform the different regional geology and geomorphology in the various catchment areas and the means by which the sediment enters the river lead to very distinctive heterogeneous water and sediment features in the yellow river basin ye 1994 for example the sediment particles in the ningxia to mongolia section of the yellow river are mainly hornblende pyroxene epidote and hematite and the sediment particles in the middle section of the stream are mainly illite quartz chlorite calcite and feldspar in the gui de section near the source of the yellow river the main viscous mineral components of yellow river silt account for only 10 32 in the middle and upper reaches of baotou and tongguan that value increases to 19 05 and 18 48 respectively in the lower pingyin section the maximum value is 54 44 zhou et al 2015 non clay minerals mainly include quartz and feldspar and clay minerals mainly include montmorillonite illite kaolinite etc tian et al 2020 arsenović et al 2014 tsozué et al 2017 noncohesive mineral particles are usually granular and their shape is similar to that of a sphere zhao et al 2016 clay mineral particles are usually flakes with large specific surface areas and their particle shape is very different from that of a sphere shah 2018 shah et al 2018 the surface charge density of clay mineral particles is much higher than that of non clay mineral particles clay minerals adsorb a thicker water film which increases their equivalent diameter and reduces their equivalent weight the zeta potential of clay mineral particles is much greater than that of non clay minerals so its solution has good colloidal stability wang 2019 differences in particle shape and particle surface charge among different mineral types may cause various suspended particulates to undergo different sedimentation processes skinnebach et al 2019 resulting in differences in the amount and characteristics of clogging materials the composition of suspended particles in the water may lead to different degrees and forms of emitter clogging prevention and treatment methods for emitter clogging are needed however there are few studies focused on this topic the influence of three kinds of suspended particles on the clogging of emitters was analyzed to discuss the formation process of emitter clogging in different sections of the yellow river this research aimed to provide a technical basis for the prevention and control of emitter clogging 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design previous studies have shown that the non clay mineral content that is primarily quartz sio2 is greater than 70 in the yellow river drip irrigation system and sodium bentonite al2 mg3 si4o10 oh 2 nh2o is the main viscous mineral constituent zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 in this study quartz sand s sodium bentonite p and yellow river sand h were selected to represent non cohesive particles cohesive particles and mixed cohesive and noncohesive particles to prepare a water source with a suspended particle concentration of 2 0 g l the corresponding treatments were recorded as sw bw and hw respectively for an emitter anti clogging test each treatment included two lateral laying methods for the emitter s water inlet upwards and downwards in total there were 6 treatments in the emitter anti clogging test in addition the above three kinds of particles were mixed with ultrapure water into a 5 0 g l suspension for a hydrostatic sedimentation test 2 2 material yellow river sand was taken from riverbed silt in the floodplain of the qingtongxia reach of the yellow river in ningxia after removing the impurities on the surface of the riverbed a shovel was used to collect the surface 0 15 cm silt the collected samples were air dried and ground then they were mixed uniformly sodium bentonite and quartz sand were purchased from a water purification company the three types of sediments were all passed through a 320 mesh screen to obtain the target sediments guan et al 2018 liu et al 2018 the mechanical composition is shown in table 1 non compensating inner mounted labyrinth channel emitters are common in drip irrigation systems because of their low cost zhang et al 2011 therefore this kind of emitter was chosen in this experiment the non compensating inner mounted labyrinth channel emitter shandong chunyu water saving irrigation equipment co ltd used in this experiment had a rated

device the mixer was equipped above the water bucket to ensure the uniform silt distribution of the water source and eliminate the impact of sedimentation during the irrigation period the first part controlled the return water flow by adjusting the valve opening degree to maintain a set working pressure after the test the entire irrigation network system was fully flushed and cleaned to avoid the system s silt and sand from interfering with the test results the test platform laid 6 drip irrigation laterals for every irrigation three drip irrigation laterals had upward emitter inlets and the other 3 drip irrigation laterals had downward emitter inlets fig 2 2 3 test implementation 2 3 1 anti clogging test in this experiment the test laterals were irrigated twice per day each irrigation lasted for 2 h with a 1 h break in total a continuous 10 d irrigation was considered one cycle and the cumulative irrigation for each treatment was 40 h during the irrigation period 10 emitters were selected on each lateral when the system ran stably the water collecting cups were placed under the selected emitters to collect the water volume for 10 min to calculate the emitter flow rate after a one cycle test each lateral section was divided into three equal sections the sediment in the laterals was collected in a tin foil bowl dried in an oven at 105 c and then weighed with a balance accuracy 0 0001 g the clogged emitter was dissected to extract the clogging substance the clogged substance in the emitter was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem s 4800 hitachi japan 2 3 2 sedimentation test ten grams of soil sample was weighed with a balance and placed in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask the flask was shaken well and placed on an electric hot plate to slightly boil for 1 h to obtain a solution containing dispersed sand particles the solution was stirred continuously with a glass rod during the entire boiling period to prevent soil particles from depositing sticking together into lumps or scorching after the dispersed suspension was cooled it was poured into a 2000 ml sedimentation cylinder without any solution volume loss then distilled water was added to make the water surface of the suspension even with the 2000 ml graduation line of the graduated cylinder the suspension was evenly stirred up and down for 1 min with a stirrer to evenly distribute the sediment after the stirring was stopped 10 ml of the suspension was taken to test the turbidity degree orion aquafast thermo usa at a fixed depth from the water surface at 400 1000 and 1600 ml scale lines according to the set time interval 0 5 15 30 60 120 and 240 min respectively and the turbidity degree was converted to sediment concentration according to preset markings 2 4 data

bentonite and yellow river sand in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask one hundred milliliters of distilled water was measured in a cylinder and poured into an erlenmeyer flask to make sediment suspensions with concentrations of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 g l the suspensions were shaken well and heated to disperse the sediment after the dispersed suspension was cooled it was shaken evenly and 10 ml of the suspension was quickly taken to test the turbidity this was repeated 3 times a linear regression was taken of the turbidity and concentration to obtain turbidity concentration curves the trendlines for the three different suspensions 2 4 2 anti clogging performance the average relative flow dra was used to characterize the overall clogging of the entire drip irrigation lateral zhang et al 2020 the density of muddy water is greater than that of clear water the ratio of the emitter flow rate at the initial stage to the emitter flow rate at the time of sampling was used to characterize the dra to eliminate the error caused by sediment the temperature error was corrected by the method of pei pei et al 2014 1 d r a i 1 n q i q i 0 n 100 where dra is the average relative flow rate in q i is the flow rate of the i th tested emitter in l h q i0 is the flow rate of the i th tested emitter at the initial stage of irrigation in l h and n is the number of tested emitters on a lateral 2 4 3 data analysis spss software was used for the analysis of variance and least significant difference lsd multiple comparison originpro 2016 software was used for drawing figures 3 results 3 1 correspondence between suspended solids concentration and turbidity the relationship between the suspended particle concentration and turbidity fig 3 shows that when the water temperature was 20 c as the concentration of suspended particles increased the turbidity of the suspension exhibited a very significant linear increasing trend the slope of bw was the largest at 340 16 the slope of hw was the second largest at 157 44 and the slope of sw was the smallest at 46 86 when the concentration of suspended particles was the same the turbidity of the water was different for example when the concentration of suspended particles was 2 0 g l the turbidity of the bw sw and hw suspensions was 691 2 60 91 56 5 57 and 328 14 12 37 fau respectively the turbidity of the bw suspension was the largest in the sedimentation test by measuring the turbidity of the suspension the corresponding suspended particle concentration was determined according to the relationship curve in fig 2 3 2 sedimentation of suspended particles within the initial 0 5 min settling stage the concentration of suspended particles showed an abruptly rapid downward trend as the concentration dropped from 5 0 g l to 2 0 g l fig 4 this stage involved rapid sedimentation generally the stable sedimentation stage occurred after 5 min and the concentration of suspended particles slowly and continuously decreased during this stage different suspended particles showed different settling speeds for example when the settling time was 15 min the concentrations of the sw bw and hw suspensions at the 1600 ml line were 1 32 1 93 and 1 73 g l respectively the concentrations at the 1000 ml line were 1 65 2 07 and 1 81 g l respectively and the concentrations at the 400 ml line were 1 91 2 10 and 1 93 g l respectively the sw suspension particles settled the fastest and the particle concentration was the lowest the bw suspension particles settled the slowest and the particle concentration was the highest the concentration of the bw suspension gradually increased as the depth below the liquid surface increased the bottom sediment concentrations were 4 7 21 2 higher than those of the surface layer within the first 60 min the sediment concentration at the bottom of the sw suspension was 0 9 17 higher than the sediment concentration at the top with the extension of the settling time the difference in concentration at different locations gradually narrowed finally there was no significant difference in the sediment concentration at different locations at 120 min the change in the sediment concentration distribution of the hw suspension was between those of the bw and sw suspensions 3 3 mass of sediment particles as shown in table 2 when the emitter s water inlet was upward the mass of deposited particles from the first section to the end of the lateral decreased significantly p 0 05 the sedimentation amount in the hw treatment in the front section of the lateral 24 02 g m was significantly larger than that in the sw treatment 17 18 g m the sedimentation mass in the sw treatment was significantly greater than that in the bw treatment 6 60 g m the sedimentation amount in the middle section of the lateral was significantly reduced compared with that in the first section the difference between the three treatments was still significant the sw treatment at the end of the lateral had the largest sediment settlement the difference between the hw and sw treatments was not significant nor was that between the hw and bw treatments there were significant differences in the amount of deposited particles in different suspensions in the first and middle sections of the lateral but no significant difference was found in those at the end of the lateral the direction of the emitter s water inlet was an important factor that affected the lateral sedimentation volume when the emitter s water inlet was downward the mass of particles flowing out of the emitter decreased and the amount of sedimentation increased in the front section of the lateral the mass of deposited particles in the downward treatment was close to twice that in the upward treatment at the end of the lateral direction the mass of deposited particles in the downward treatment was almost the same as that in the upward treatment the difference between the sedimentation amounts of different suspended solids suspensions was reduced at the end section the sedimentation mass of the hw and sw treatments was significantly greater than that of the bw treatment p 0 05 there was no significant difference in the sedimentation mass between the hw and sw treatments when the emitter s water inlet was upwards the mass of deposited particles at the head middle and end of the lateral in the hw treatment was reduced by 37 37 52 46 and 1 19 respectively compared to that when the emitter s water inlet was downwards the values were 51 62 61 25 and 49 88 for the sw treatment and 43 92 57 42 and 77 86 for the bw treatment table 2 the total mass of deposited sediment in the lateral when the emitter s water inlet was down was 76 06 139 23 greater than that when the emitter s water inlet was up fig 5 3 4 relative flow rate dra fig 6 shows the influence of the hw sw and bw suspensions on the degree of emitter clogging as the number of irrigations increased the dra decreased differently under the three irrigation water sources with the three types of suspended solids the suspended matter composition significantly affected the emitter clogging process p 0 05 when the emitter s water inlet was upward the dra in the hw treatment was 27 65 after 20 irrigations which was the most seriously clogged the clogging in the bw treatment was light and the dra was 85 61 the dra in the sw treatment was 47 62 which was between the dra in the bw and hw treatments fig 5a when the emitter s water inlet was downward the dra values corresponding to the hw sw and bw treatments were 81 19 98 51 and 99 96 respectively after 20 irrigations fig 5b the bw and sw treatments had no significant difference in emitter clogging however the sw and hw treatments had significant differences in emitter clogging p 0 05 which was the same as the bw and hw treatments in the final test irrigation the dra when the emitter s water inlet was downward was 53 54 50 89 and 14 35 higher than that when the emitter s water inlet was upward the results of the analysis of variance for the flow rate of the clogging showed table 3 that both the type of suspended particle and the direction of the emitter s water inlet had a significant effect on the dra p 0 01 this meant that when the sediment concentration was 2 0 g l suspended particles were an important factor affecting emitter clogging the suspended particles interacted with the direction of the emitter s water inlet which significantly affected the dra different types of suspended particles had different degrees of emitter clogging when the emitter s water inlet was downward emitter clogging caused by all types of suspended particles was alleviated well 3 5 morphology of the clogging substance the microscopic morphology of the clogging substance in the hw sw and bw treatments had different characteristics fig 7 the clogging substance that formed at the flow channel of the emitter in the hw treatment had an obvious mosaic block structure the gaps among large particles were filled with flakes and rod shaped small particles the blockage structure was dense and stable the initial state was an accumulating body in a loose structure the particle size of quartz sand was large with a median size of 0 06 mm the initial state was a loose accumulation structure with natural overlap between the particles the gap between the particles was very large the morphological characteristics of the clogging substance formed in the clogging flow channel were basically the same as the initial particle structure however there was more compact overlap between the particles more reduced pores and enhanced stability of clogging substances compared with the initial particles in the sw treatment sodium bentonite initially accumulated as a body in obvious small groups that had a close structure the links between different small groups were not tight and the pores were large the clogging substance at the flow channel of the emitter in the bw treatment was composed of strip like or block like floc structures comparative analysis of the morphological characteristics of the clogging substance formed by three different suspended particles revealed that the clogging substance formed in the hw treatment was inlaid and bonded forming a dense and stable structure which is difficult to break and loses stability the clogging substance formed in the sw treatment was mainly an unstable structure caused by large particles which was easily damaged bentonite was composed of extremely fine particles so the flocculent structure that formed was plastically deformable there were links between different flocculent structures but they were not strong therefore the bentonite clogging material was greatly affected by flow erosion 4 discussion 4 1 grid clogging at the emitter s water inlet as the sedimentation rate of particulate matter changed from rapid sedimentation in the early stage to slow sedimentation in the later stage the sedimentation volume in the front middle and end of the lateral changed from large to small the number of water inlet clogged emitters at the front section of the lateral was the largest along the flow direction of the lateral the number of clogged emitters decreased table 4 the pearson correlation analysis results showed that there was a very significant positive linear correlation between the number of grid clogged emitters and the mass of deposited particles fig 8 which means that the more suspended particles that settled the greater the probability of grid clogging therefore the probability of particles entering the labyrinth channel may increase further adding the risk of emitter clogging for example this experiment revealed that the mass of deposited particles in the lateral in the hw treatment was the largest so the dra was the smallest and the number of clogged emitters was the largest the mass of deposited particles in the lateral in the bw treatment was the smallest the emitter dra was the largest and the emitters were the least clogged the suspended particles deposited at the bottom of the lateral could directly block the grid of the emitter s water inlet fig 9 preventing water from entering the emitter and causing grid inlet clogging additionally the deposited particles may have entered the emitter labyrinth channel during the movement of the water causing the sand concentration of the water flow in the channel to be much higher than the initial concentration thereby adding an extra clogging risk the sediment mass in the lateral correlated too closely with the type of suspended particles for example settlement more easily occurred in the hw treatment compared to the bw treatment therefore the sediment mass in the lateral in the hw treatment was larger than that in the bw treatment in addition the sediment mass in the lateral was closely related to the structure of the sediment for example although the sw treatment had the fastest settlement in this test the lateral sedimentation volume of the sw treatment was less than that of the hw treatment the most likely reason is that the loose structure of the sediment formed by the settlement was easily discharged by the water flow through the emitter channel to the outside of the emitter the sediment mass in the lateral was the result of the combined effect of the sedimentation of suspended particles and the emitters delivery and discharge ability from the perspective of particle sedimentation only without considering the movement of sediment the sediment mass in the lateral decreased gradually from the front to the end of the lateral as the particles gradually settled the sediment concentration was lower in the flow at the end of the lateral than at the front of the lateral therefore the risk of emitter clogging at the end of the lateral was reduced however in the actual irrigation process due to the influx of water the deposited particles in the lateral gradually move to the end of the lateral therefore the number of clogged emitters was the highest when the emitter s water inlet was upward because the lateral tended to accumulate sediment most easily in its end section 4 2 flow channel clogging when emitters were installed on the top of the lateral so that the emitter s water inlet was downwards the clogging risk of the emitter s grid inlet was basically eliminated at the same time due to the sedimentation in the lateral the sand concentration in the water decreased reducing the clogging probability and clogging degree the change in the direction of the emitter s water inlet also avoided the clogging difference caused by grid clogging with the three types of suspended particles when the emitter s water inlet was downwards the number of clogged emitters and degree of clogging in the hw sw and bw treatments were significantly lower than those when the emitter s water inlet was upwards the grid clogging in the hw and sw treatments was significantly improved the dra in the bw treatment was improved although there was no significant difference between treatments when the emitter s water inlet was upwards versus downwards table 4 in drip irrigation practice arranging the emitter s water inlet downwards should be considered to control grid clogging and reduce the risk of emitter clogging especially when using water with many non sticky coarse particles for irrigation when the emitter s water inlet was downwards the type of suspended particles was still an important factor affecting emitter clogging from the perspective of mechanical components table 1 although the median particle size of the hw 0 025 mm treatment was smaller than that of the sw 0 060 mm treatment the emitter in the hw treatment was the most prone to be clogged and the degree of clogging was the most serious this is because the hw treatment had both large particles and small particles and it easily formed a dense and stable structure with large particles as the skeleton and small particles as the filling matter the sw treatment mainly contained coarser particles there was less adhesion between the clogging particles and the structure of the clogging substance was unstable its degree of emitter clogging was lower than that of the hw treatment the clogging substance formed in the bw treatment was a flocculent structure although the structure was not easily destroyed due to the lack of large particles as a support the flocculent structure was highly plastic and easily released water and the emitter was the least clogged in the bw treatment therefore when the type and diameter size of the suspended particles in the water was relatively single coarse particles were more likely to clog the emitter than fine particles however it was more difficult for a single particle size to cause serious clogging of the emitter in contrast when the suspended particles in the water had a balanced distribution of coarse particles and fine particles emitter clogging most likely occurred in addition during the continuous irrigation process the fluctuation of the flow in the sw treatment was mainly caused by the process of instability damage and reformation of the clogging substance sodium bentonite had little effect on emitter clogging and the flow rate of the emitter easily recovered under bw drip irrigation conditions because the surface charge of the bw treatment made the particles repulsive and it was difficult to form a firm and stable plugging structure de oliveira et al 2020 the bw treatment had the greatest viscosity at 20 c table 5 which means that the viscous bentonite particles in the water body had better water flow followability wang et al 1994 2017 it easily flowed out of the labyrinth channel under the action of hydrodynamic force avoiding excessive sedimentation in the emitter labyrinth channel which is similar to the research results of wang et al 2009 therefore the bw treatment corresponded to the smallest number of water inlet clogged emitters table 4 and the largest dra fig 5 nevertheless the increase in the concentration of suspended particles passing through the labyrinth channel increased the probability of emitter channel adhesion and blockage wu et al 2014 a drip irrigation system with water containing more viscous particles should be mainly used to prevent the emitter channel from being clogged the hw treatment was a mixture of viscous and non sticky suspended particles non viscous particles easily collided and remained in the flow channel compared to the pvc wall of the channel the rough surface of the colliding non sticky particles more easily adsorbed sticky particles among them sticky particles aggregated under the flocculation effect caused by van der waals forces and surface charges fettweis and lee 2017 they filled the voids of the skeleton formed by large particles to bond and strengthen the stability of the clogging substance resulting in irreversible emitter clogging this supports the view of niu et al 2012 that the agglomeration of non sticky particles and clay particles is the main reason for physical emitter clogging furthermore when the proportion of viscous and non sticky suspended particles in the water is balanced the risk of clogging greatly increases and this water quality needs to be specifically addressed overall to avoid emitter clogging caused by sedimentation of suspended particles it is recommended that when laying the lateral the emitter s water inlet should be downwards when there are many viscous particles in the water the powdered particles should be filtered out as much as possible since the number and activity of microorganisms and the content of organic matter in yellow river water are at a relatively low level this article does not consider the role of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substance eps in the sedimentation and flocculation of suspended particles nor does it consider the adhesion and volume growth of clogging substances however only a small number of microorganisms and organic matter may have a nonnegligible impact on the formation and growth of emitter clogging ait mouheb et al 2019 li et al 2017 wang et al 2020 further research needs to be carried out to assess this topic in addition the threshold of the suspended particle concentration and grading also require further research 5 conclusions and suggestions 1 the type of suspended particles significantly affected the clogging process of the emitter p 0 05 emitter clogging in the hw treatment was the most serious and emitter clogging in the bw treatment was the lightest 2 the direction of the emitter s water inlet significantly affects grid clogging changing the emitters water inlet upwards to downwards can significantly alleviate the emitter clogging caused by various suspended particles the dra of the emitter when the emitter s water inlet was downwards was 53 54 50 89 and 14 35 higher than that when the emitter s water inlet was upwards when the emitter s water inlet was upwards grid clogging induced by the sedimentation of particles was the main cause of emitter clogging under these conditions the hw treatment had the largest mass of deposited particles and the smallest dra the bw treatment had the smallest mass of deposited particles and the largest dra 3 flocculent blockage formed by a single sticky particle was easy to deform its water flow ability was strong and it did not easily cause emitter clogging the structure of the single non sticky coarse particle accumulation was loose and unstable and did not easily cause serious emitter clogging when irrigation water contained both viscous and non viscous particles it easily formed a blockage with a stable and compact structure and emitter clogging became serious and irreversible 4 when using yellow river water for drip irrigation selecting appropriate anti clogging management methods according to the main characteristics of the sediment in different river sections is recommended when irrigation water contains both viscous and non sticky particles additional attention and measures should be added to prevent emitters from clogging declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared
