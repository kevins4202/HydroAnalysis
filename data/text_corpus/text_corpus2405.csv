12025,the purpose of this study is to evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the groundwater from semi arid environment in the context of climate change by taking the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers of essaouira basin morocco as an example for a period of 43 years 1976 2019 the piezometric level shows a continuous decline which reaches 8 m for the barremian aptian aquifer and 5 m for the hauterivian hydrogeochemical analysis shows i a remarkable evolution of the facies from the cl na facies to the cl ca mg facies ii the groundwater mineralization is governed by the dissolution and bases exchange phenomenon iii the spatial temporal evolution of the groundwater quality shows a gradual deterioration in time and space the isotopic technique shows that the groundwater recharge is ensured by precipitation of oceanic origin without notable evaporation tritium tracing shows that the recharge of groundwater is post nuclear confirming that the recharge of the aquifers within the study area is in close relation to the precipitation this recharge takes place at altitudes varying between 500 and 700 m asl for the barremian aptian aquifer and between altitudes 350 and 400 m asl for the hauterivian aquifer however the results obtained indicate that the water resource of essaouira region is very vulnerable to global warming and requires adequate

area it is located in the high western atlas between latitudes 31 05 and 31 40 n and longitudes 9 00 and 9 50 w the essaouira basin comprises several aquifer systems among these systems we notice the barremian aptian and the hauterivian aquifers these two aquifers are located about 40 km south of the essaouira city fig 1 the barremian aptian aquifer is limited to the north by tidzi wadi the amssittene anticline to the south the lower cretaceous formations to the east and by the atlantic ocean to the west over an area of 250 km2 as for the hauterivian it is bounded in the north by the amssittene anticline the igouzoullene wadi in the south the lower cretaceous formations in the east and by the atlantic ocean in the west fig 1 over an area of 100 km2 the study area is subject to a semi arid climate characterized by two seasons one rainy span from november to march and the other dry intersperse between april and october the average annual precipitation does not exceed 300 mm and the average annual temperature is around 20 c ouhamdouch and bahir 2017 geologically and hydrogeologically the essaouira basin comprises a sedimentary series which ranges from the triassic to the quaternary thus containing several aquifers such as that of the barremian aptian and d hauterivian the barremian about 70 m thickness corresponds to an alternation of gray marl or marl limestone with traces of gypsum fractured fossiliferous and lumachellic limestones and sandstone as for the aptian about 100 m thickness it consists of an alternation of red clays and sandstone with intercalations of sandstone dolomites or bioclastic limestones as well as fine marly levels the transmissivity of this aquifer is about 1 5 10 3 m2 s mennani 2001 as for hautevian whose thickness is about 200 m it is made up of more or less altered and fractured marly and silty clays alternating with levels of hard fractured siliceous limestones marly siltstones altered and fractured marly limestones as well as more or less fractured dolomitic limestones fig 1 rey et al 1988 duffaud et al 1966 duffaud 1960 according to mennani 2001 this aquifer has transmissivities varying between 1 6 10 5 and 6 7 10 5 m2 s 3 material and methods in this investigation the results of five campaigns 1997 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 were used to assess the of groundwater quality of the studied aquifers electrical conductivity temperature ph and nitrates were measured in situ and the depths of the wells solicited have been measured using a 200 m piezometric probe for the campaign of 1997 the analyses of the chemical elements were carried out at the laboratory of hydrogeology at the faculty of sciences semlalia of marrakech morocco mennani 2001 as for that of 2015 2019 the analyses were carried out at the laboratory of geosciences and environment ens at the ecole normale superieure of marrakech morocco so4 concentrations were determined by the nephelometric technique concentrations of ca and mg cations were measured by the complexometry method edta and those of cl by the mohr technique the na and k contents were determined by flame photometry rodier et al 2009 as for hco3 contents they were determined by titration using a 0 1 m hcl solution all the samples display an ion balance of less than 10 which allowed us to validate the obtained results the obtained results are grouped in table 1 stable and radioactive isotopes analysis δ2h δ18o and 3h was carried out at the nuclear technology institute in lisbon portugal by adopting the mass spectrometry method friedman 1953 epstein and mayeda 1953 for isotopes stable and the electrolytic enrichment technique followed by the liquid scintillation counting method lucas and unterweger 2000 for tritium the obtained results are grouped in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 piezometry the evolution of the groundwater piezometric is closely related to the variation of precipitation and the contributions of surface water bahir et al 2016 ouhamdouch et al 2018 the piezometric maps drawn up from the data of 1976 1997 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 campaigns for the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers show that the general direction of the groundwater flow of barremian aptian aquifer is generally from south east to north west fig 2 the groundwater flow within the barremian aptian aquifer is imposed by the north flank of the amssittene anticline and the uplift of the substratum of the lower cretaceous formations concerning the hauterivian aquifer the general direction of flow is from the northeast to the southwest and this follows the southern flank of the amssittene anticline over a 43 year observation period 1976 2019 fig 2 the groundwater of the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifer keeps the same direction of flow with a decent piezometric level with a total of nine wells which six wells capture the barremian aptian aquifer and three captures the hauterivian aquifer having experienced measurements of their water body during 1976 1997 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 the study of the groundwater level of the aforementioned aquifers shows a decrease in piezometric levels table 3 for the barremian aptien aquifer it reached 9 1 m at well 176 51 and 8 8 m at well 173 51 between 1976 and 2019 i e an average annual decrease of 0 2 m as for the hauterivian aquifer this reduction reached 4 8 m at the level of well p6 and 3 m at the level of well 193 51 i e an average annual decrease of 0 11 and 0 07 m respectively since the study area is characterized by the absence of industrial activity and the agricultural activity practiced is of the food type the decrease in the piezometric level could only be explained by the decrease in precipitation under the climate change effect 4 2 hydrogeochemistry 4 2 1 electrical conductivity the electrical conductivity is mainly governed by the concentration of dissolved ions it is in close relation with the aquifer matrix formation the speed and the flow direction of groundwater as well as the residence time the results obtained are shown in fig 3 for the barremian aptian aquifer the majority of the samples have ec values that range over the class 1 2 ms cm while the rest fall within the class 2 4 ms cm the highest values are observed towards the northwest and the west and this under the influence of the triassic salt formations as well as the likely effect of sea spray and aerosols leached by the rains infiltrating towards the aquifer towards the east the influence of these factors is absorbed and the values of the ec decrease this is the recharge zone of the aquifer with the exception of the samples from the 1997 campaign the waters of the hauterivian aquifer show ec values of between 1 and 2 ms cm outliers observed in 1997 can be explained by the fact that certain water points measured in 1997 were not measured during the other campaigns generally the evolution of the average values of the ec observed within the two aquifers is stable and this could be explained by the captive nature of these two aquifers 4 2 2 chemical facies to specify the chemical facies of groundwater in the study area the major element composition has been plotted on the piper diagram piper 1944 the analysis of the piper diagrams for the groundwater of the barremian aptian and those of the hauterivian shows the present of three types of chemical facies cl na cl ca mg and hco3 ca mg with the dominance of the second facies fig 4 a and b the dominance of cl over hco3 could be explained by the influence of triassic saliferous formations the comparison between the water points sampled in 1997 and 2019 fig 4c shows a remarkable evolution in the groundwater chemistry of the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers from the mixed facies cl na and cl ca mg to the facets cl ca mg on the cations triangle concerning the 1997 campaign the majority of the points have a percentage higher than 50 in na with a tendency towards the na pole during the other campaigns the majority of the points do not exceed 50 in na with a tendency towards the center of the sorting no dominant cations for the anion triangle a clear dominance of cl is noted whether in 1997 or in 2019 4 2 3 groundwater mineralization in order to determine the origin and the main processes controlling the groundwater mineralization of the studied aquifers a first approach consists in presenting the relationships between the chemical elements ca mg na k hco3 cl so4 and no3 and the total dissolved solids tds the various established diagrams illustrating the evolution of the major elements concentrations contained in water as a function of the tds fig 5 as well as the correlation between these elements show that the mineralization of the analysed waters is essentially controlled by the contents in cl na ca mg and so4 chlorides contents in groundwater of the barremian aptian aquifer vary between 181 and 1250 mg l with an average of 529 mg l as for those of sodium they vary between 42 and 480 mg l with an average of 235 mg l for the hauterivian aquifer the cl contents vary between 120 and 412 mg l with an average of 290 mg l and the na concentrations vary between 28 and 116 mg l with an average of 79 mg l the correlation diagram na vs cl fig 6 a shows a positive correlation between these two elements this suggests that these two ions probably have the same origin some samples are scattered around the line with slope 1 line 1 1 reflecting the contribution of halite dissolution in the groundwater mineralization this hypothesis could be supported by the negative values of the saturation indices with respect to this mineral fig 7 the rest of the points are located below the line 1 1 and this in a parallel way reflecting a cl excess and na deficit this suggests the contribution of a phenomenon other than the halite dissolution in the groundwater mineralization this situation could be linked to the ion exchange processes where the na ions are released from the complex and are replaced by ca ions fig 6f the ca contents vary between 79 and 280 mg l with an average of 151 mg l for the barremian aptian aquifer between 83 and 190 mg l with an average of 155 mg l for the hauterivian aquifer as for the so4 concentrations they vary between 39 and 522 mg l with an average of 130 mg l for the barremian aptian aquifer and between 42 and 374 mg l with an average of 176 mg l for the hauterivian aquifer the ca vs so4 diagram fig 6b shows that few samples are closed to line 1 1 reflecting the contribution of gypsum and or anhydride dissolution in groundwater mineralization this is corroborated by the negative values of the saturation indices with respect to gypsum and or anhydride minerals fig 7 the rest of the points are located above the line 1 1 showing an excess of ca this situation suggests the contribution of another phenomenon to the groundwater mineralization fig 6f shows that the points are aligned to the line with slope 1 reflecting that the excess in ca is due to the phenomenon of reverse bases exchange the ca vs mg diagram fig 6c shows that the hauterivian samples and some representing the barremian aptian are aligned to the dolomite dissolution line line 1 1 whereas the rest of the barremian aptian samples they present an excess in ca this excess in ca could be explained by the phenomenon of basic exchange as indicated in fig 6f the ca vs hco3 correlation fig 6d shows that these two elements do not have a significant correlation this suggests that the contribution of hco3 in groundwater mineralization this is confirmed by the weak correlation between this ion and tds fig 5f 4 2 4 nitrates contamination the main source of nitrate in water is the leaching of nitrogenous products in the soil following the decomposition of organic matter or synthetic and or natural fertilizers the nitrate content of unpolluted natural waters is highly variable varying from 1 to 15 mg l depending on the season and the origin chenaker et al 2017 the no3 contents in groundwater of the barremian aptian aquifer vary between 5 and 60 mg l while the hauterivian has concentrations varying between 3 and 16 mg l fig 8 the very weak correlation between cl and no3 fig 6e makes it possible to say that the no3 contents assayed in the analysed samples are not of agricultural origin since the chlorides are due to the dissolution of the evaporated minerals for the barremian aptian aquifer only two points have the 50 mg l threshold fixed by who 2011 the high concentrations at well p5 are caused by the public waste dump of the smimou village because this dump is located a few meters from this water point regarding the hauterivian aquifer all the samples have no3 concentrations of less than 50 mg l the contamination of the other wells with significant contents could be explained by traditional methods of drawing which cause that a significant part of water flowing around the wells constitutes quasi permanent puddles which enrich no3 by livestock excrement during watering 4 2 5 evolution of groundwater salinity in areas of water scarcity especially the saharan arid and semi arid areas groundwater is the main source of drinking water and irrigation in recent decades this resource has known enormous pressures under the climate change cause which have thus led to a degradation of their quality in this regard the study of the spatio temporal evolution of the salinity of the groundwater of the two barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers has been made fig 9 the salinity values of the barremian aptian groundwater vary between 0 2 and 3 2 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the samples of the 1997 campaign from 0 3 to 2 1 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the points collected in 2015 and 2017 between 0 4 and 2 8 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the analysed points of 2018 campaign and between 0 7 and 2 4 g l with an average of 1 2 g l for the samples representing the 2019 campaign fig 9 the spatial temporal distribution of salinity of the barremian aptian aquifer fig 9 shows a slight upward trend these last years for the hauterivian aquifer the salinity values range between 0 6 and 2 6 g l with an average for samples of the 1997 campaign between 0 5 and 1 1 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the 2015 samples between 0 6 and 1 2 g l with an average of 0 9 g l for the waters representing the 2017 campaign between 0 4 and 1 1 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the samples of 2018 campaign and between 0 4 and 1 3 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the 2019 samples the spatial temporal distribution of the salinity of the hauterivian aquifer shows a slight dilution of the waters analysed in 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 compared to those representing the 1997 campaign this could be explained by the installation of the igouzoullene dam in 2004 in upstream favoring the recharge of this aquifer as the study sector is characterized by the absence of industrial activity and by agricultural activity of the food crop type and it is part of the semi arid zones with a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature ouhamdouch et al 2020 causing periods of drought and a decline in the piezometric level the degradation of the quality of groundwater is mainly caused by climate change 4 3 isotopy the isotopic approach is a technique used to determine the origin mode and residence time of groundwater it also makes it possible to identify and quantify the mixing rate between two types of water and to locate the recharge zones fontes 1976 a total of 9 samples collected in 2015 were analysed for stable isotopes oxygen 18 and deuterium and radioactive tritium six samples represent the barremian aptian aquifer and three represent the hauterivian aquifer for the barremian aptian aquifer the oxygen 18 contents vary between a minimum of 4 8 vs smow and a maximum of 4 3 vs smow with an average of 4 6 vs smow for deuterium the maximum value is 22 vs smow and the minimum value equal to 25 8 vs smow with an average of 23 3 vs smow table 2 as for the hauterivian aquifer the contents of oxygen 18 vary between a minimum of 4 vs smow and a maximum of 3 9 vs smow with an average of 4 vs smow for deuterium contents the maximum value is 21 5 vs smow and the minimum value equal to 23 0 vs smow with an average value of 22 3 vs smow as the absence of a local meteorological line of precipitation representing the study area the meteoric line of equation δ2h 7 95 x δ18o 11 3 determined by mennani et al 2001 was considered as an input function for the study area the correlation diagram δ2h vs δ18o of groundwater representing the barremian aptian and hauterian aquifers fig 10 a shows that all the samples are scattered around the local meteoric water line lmwl and above the global meteoric water line lmwl this suggests that the recharge of these aquifers studied is ensured by direct infiltration of precipitation of oceanic origin without significant evaporation the combination of physicochemical such as electrical conductivity ec and isotopic such as δ18o elements makes it possible to highlight the processes controlling the groundwater mineralization the ec vs oxygen 18 correlation diagram fig 10b shows that the ec values are not correlated with the oxygen 18 contents this shows that the groundwater mineralization of studied aquifers is controlled by the dissolution phenomenon this confirms the results obtained by the hydrogeochemical approach and suggests that evaporation seems to be an insignificant process involved in the groundwater mineralization the tritium contents of the samples analysed for the barremian aptian range from 0 8 to 1 7 tu with an average of 1 3 tu and between 1 3 and 2 2 tu with an average of 1 8 tu table 2 according to mazor 1991 a tritium content greater than 1 tu corresponds to a post nuclear recharge and a concentration less than 1 tu represents a pre nuclear recharge the projection of the collected samples in 2015 on the 3h vs δ18o diagram fig 10c shows that all the points are located above the line 3h 1 tu this reflects a recent recharge of the barremien aptian and hauterivien aquifers and confirms the results obtained by the δ2h vs δ18o diagram in order to estimate the groundwater recharge area in the study area the equation of the regional oxygen 18 gradient with elevation eq was used mennani 2001 this gradient has been used assuming that it has not changed over time δ o 18 3 2 6 10 3 altitude from fig 10d the altitudes of groundwater recharge of the barremian aptian aquifer are between 500 and 700 m asl these altitudes correspond to the outcrops of the cretaceous formations to the east of the aquifer fig 1 as for the hauterivian the recharging areas are located at altitudes of 350 400 m asl these areas correspond to the outcrops of the hauterivian formations to the north of the aquifer following the uprising of the jurassic formations amssittene anticline 5 conclusion the combination of piezometric hydrogeochemical and isotopic techniques adopted to assess the quantitative and qualitative evolution of groundwater of barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers of essaouira basin show that the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers have retained the general direction of flow of their groundwater during the study period monitoring the piezometry over a period of 43 years 1976 2019 shows a continuous decline in the piezometric level around 8 m for the barremian aptian aquifer and 5 m for the hauterivian this general downward of piezometric level could be explained by the decrease in precipitation caused by climate change in turn this decline causes a qualitative deterioration in the groundwater quality as for the hydrogeochemical approach it shows that the groundwater representing the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers have three types of chemical facies cl na cl ca mg and hco3 ca mg with the dominance of the cl ca mg facies for the study period a remarkable evolution of the facies from the cl na facies to the cl ca mg facies was observed the correlations established between the concentrations of major elements have shown that the groundwater mineralization is controlled by the dissolution phenomenon such as the dissolution of evaporitic and carbonates minerals and by the bases exchange phenomenon the spatial temporal evolution of the groundwater quality shows a gradual deterioration in time and space the isotopic technique shows that the groundwater recharge is ensured by precipitation of oceanic origin without notable evaporation tritium tracing shows that the recharge of groundwater is post nuclear confirming that the recharge of the aquifers within the study area is in close relation to the precipitation this recharge takes place at altitudes varying between 500 and 700 m asl eastern part of the aquifer where the cretaceous formations are exposed for the barremian aptian aquifer and between altitudes 350 and 400 m asl northern part of the aquifer where the hauterivian formations are exposed following the uprising of the jurassic formations amssittene anticline for the hauterivian aquifer however the complementarity of piezometric hydrogeochemical and isotopic approaches can lead to the diagnosis of the vulnerability state of the aquifers of the essaouira basin in the face to climate change however the development of a rational exploitation strategy could therefore make it possible to develop its waters while safeguarding its long term potential as well as the use of unconventional resources such as desalinated seawater for drinking water supply or treated wastewater for agriculture the techniques followed in this study remain valid to apply to other basins with the same climatic conditions such as arid and semi arid basins declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

2016 ouhamdouch et al 2018 the piezometric maps drawn up from the data of 1976 1997 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 campaigns for the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers show that the general direction of the groundwater flow of barremian aptian aquifer is generally from south east to north west fig 2 the groundwater flow within the barremian aptian aquifer is imposed by the north flank of the amssittene anticline and the uplift of the substratum of the lower cretaceous formations concerning the hauterivian aquifer the general direction of flow is from the northeast to the southwest and this follows the southern flank of the amssittene anticline over a 43 year observation period 1976 2019 fig 2 the groundwater of the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifer keeps the same direction of flow with a decent piezometric level with a total of nine wells which six wells capture the barremian aptian aquifer and three captures the hauterivian aquifer having experienced measurements of their water body during 1976 1997 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 the study of the groundwater level of the aforementioned aquifers shows a decrease in piezometric levels table 3 for the barremian aptien aquifer it reached 9 1 m at well 176 51 and 8 8 m at well 173 51 between 1976 and 2019 i e an average annual decrease of 0 2 m as for the hauterivian aquifer this reduction reached 4 8 m at the level of well p6 and 3 m at the level of well 193 51 i e an average annual decrease of 0 11 and 0 07 m respectively since the study area is characterized by the absence of industrial activity and the agricultural activity practiced is of the food type the decrease in the piezometric level could only be explained by the decrease in precipitation under the climate change effect 4 2 hydrogeochemistry 4 2 1 electrical conductivity the electrical conductivity is mainly governed by the concentration of dissolved ions it is in close relation with the aquifer matrix formation the speed and the flow direction of groundwater as well as the residence time the results obtained are shown in fig 3 for the barremian aptian aquifer the majority of the samples have ec values that range over the class 1 2 ms cm while the rest fall within the class 2 4 ms cm the highest values are observed towards the northwest and the west and this under the influence of the triassic salt formations as well as the likely effect of sea spray and aerosols leached by the rains infiltrating towards the aquifer towards the east the influence of these factors is absorbed and the values of the ec decrease this is the recharge zone of the aquifer with the exception of the samples from the 1997 campaign the waters of the hauterivian aquifer show ec values of between 1 and 2 ms cm outliers observed in 1997 can be explained by the fact that certain water points measured in 1997 were not measured during the other campaigns generally the evolution of the average values of the ec observed within the two aquifers is stable and this could be explained by the captive nature of these two aquifers 4 2 2 chemical facies to specify the chemical facies of groundwater in the study area the major element composition has been plotted on the piper diagram piper 1944 the analysis of the piper diagrams for the groundwater of the barremian aptian and those of the hauterivian shows the present of three types of chemical facies cl na cl ca mg and hco3 ca mg with the dominance of the second facies fig 4 a and b the dominance of cl over hco3 could be explained by the influence of triassic saliferous formations the comparison between the water points sampled in 1997 and 2019 fig 4c shows a remarkable evolution in the groundwater chemistry of the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers from the mixed facies cl na and cl ca mg to the facets cl ca mg on the cations triangle concerning the 1997 campaign the majority of the points have a percentage higher than 50 in na with a tendency towards the na pole during the other campaigns the majority of the points do not exceed 50 in na with a tendency towards the center of the sorting no dominant cations for the anion triangle a clear dominance of cl is noted whether in 1997 or in 2019 4 2 3 groundwater mineralization in order to determine the origin and the main processes controlling the groundwater mineralization of the studied aquifers a first approach consists in presenting the relationships between the chemical elements ca mg na k hco3 cl so4 and no3 and the total dissolved solids tds the various established diagrams illustrating the evolution of the major elements concentrations contained in water as a function of the tds fig 5 as well as the correlation between these elements show that the mineralization of the analysed waters is essentially controlled by the contents in cl na ca mg and so4 chlorides contents in groundwater of the barremian aptian aquifer vary between 181 and 1250 mg l with an average of 529 mg l as for those of sodium they vary between 42 and 480 mg l with an average of 235 mg l for the hauterivian aquifer the cl contents vary between 120 and 412 mg l with an average of 290 mg l and the na concentrations vary between 28 and 116 mg l with an average of 79 mg l the correlation diagram na vs cl fig 6 a shows a positive correlation between these two elements this suggests that these two ions probably have the same origin some samples are scattered around the line with slope 1 line 1 1 reflecting the contribution of halite dissolution in the groundwater mineralization this hypothesis could be supported by the negative values of the saturation indices with respect to this mineral fig 7 the rest of the points are located below the line 1 1 and this in a parallel way reflecting a cl excess and na deficit this suggests the contribution of a phenomenon other than the halite dissolution in the groundwater mineralization this situation could be linked to the ion exchange processes where the na ions are released from the complex and are replaced by ca ions fig 6f the ca contents vary between 79 and 280 mg l with an average of 151 mg l for the barremian aptian aquifer between 83 and 190 mg l with an average of 155 mg l for the hauterivian aquifer as for the so4 concentrations they vary between 39 and 522 mg l with an average of 130 mg l for the barremian aptian aquifer and between 42 and 374 mg l with an average of 176 mg l for the hauterivian aquifer the ca vs so4 diagram fig 6b shows that few samples are closed to line 1 1 reflecting the contribution of gypsum and or anhydride dissolution in groundwater mineralization this is corroborated by the negative values of the saturation indices with respect to gypsum and or anhydride minerals fig 7 the rest of the points are located above the line 1 1 showing an excess of ca this situation suggests the contribution of another phenomenon to the groundwater mineralization fig 6f shows that the points are aligned to the line with slope 1 reflecting that the excess in ca is due to the phenomenon of reverse bases exchange the ca vs mg diagram fig 6c shows that the hauterivian samples and some representing the barremian aptian are aligned to the dolomite dissolution line line 1 1 whereas the rest of the barremian aptian samples they present an excess in ca this excess in ca could be explained by the phenomenon of basic exchange as indicated in fig 6f the ca vs hco3 correlation fig 6d shows that these two elements do not have a significant correlation this suggests that the contribution of hco3 in groundwater mineralization this is confirmed by the weak correlation between this ion and tds fig 5f 4 2 4 nitrates contamination the main source of nitrate in water is the leaching of nitrogenous products in the soil following the decomposition of organic matter or synthetic and or natural fertilizers the nitrate content of unpolluted natural waters is highly variable varying from 1 to 15 mg l depending on the season and the origin chenaker et al 2017 the no3 contents in groundwater of the barremian aptian aquifer vary between 5 and 60 mg l while the hauterivian has concentrations varying between 3 and 16 mg l fig 8 the very weak correlation between cl and no3 fig 6e makes it possible to say that the no3 contents assayed in the analysed samples are not of agricultural origin since the chlorides are due to the dissolution of the evaporated minerals for the barremian aptian aquifer only two points have the 50 mg l threshold fixed by who 2011 the high concentrations at well p5 are caused by the public waste dump of the smimou village because this dump is located a few meters from this water point regarding the hauterivian aquifer all the samples have no3 concentrations of less than 50 mg l the contamination of the other wells with significant contents could be explained by traditional methods of drawing which cause that a significant part of water flowing around the wells constitutes quasi permanent puddles which enrich no3 by livestock excrement during watering 4 2 5 evolution of groundwater salinity in areas of water scarcity especially the saharan arid and semi arid areas groundwater is the main source of drinking water and irrigation in recent decades this resource has known enormous pressures under the climate change cause which have thus led to a degradation of their quality in this regard the study of the spatio temporal evolution of the salinity of the groundwater of the two barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers has been made fig 9 the salinity values of the barremian aptian groundwater vary between 0 2 and 3 2 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the samples of the 1997 campaign from 0 3 to 2 1 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the points collected in 2015 and 2017 between 0 4 and 2 8 g l with an average of 1 1 g l for the analysed points of 2018 campaign and between 0 7 and 2 4 g l with an average of 1 2 g l for the samples representing the 2019 campaign fig 9 the spatial temporal distribution of salinity of the barremian aptian aquifer fig 9 shows a slight upward trend these last years for the hauterivian aquifer the salinity values range between 0 6 and 2 6 g l with an average for samples of the 1997 campaign between 0 5 and 1 1 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the 2015 samples between 0 6 and 1 2 g l with an average of 0 9 g l for the waters representing the 2017 campaign between 0 4 and 1 1 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the samples of 2018 campaign and between 0 4 and 1 3 g l with an average of 0 8 g l for the 2019 samples the spatial temporal distribution of the salinity of the hauterivian aquifer shows a slight dilution of the waters analysed in 2015 2017 2018 and 2019 compared to those representing the 1997 campaign this could be explained by the installation of the igouzoullene dam in 2004 in upstream favoring the recharge of this aquifer as the study sector is characterized by the absence of industrial activity and by agricultural activity of the food crop type and it is part of the semi arid zones with a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature ouhamdouch et al 2020 causing periods of drought and a decline in the piezometric level the degradation of the quality of groundwater is mainly caused by climate change 4 3 isotopy the isotopic approach is a technique used to determine the origin mode and residence time of groundwater it also makes it possible to identify and quantify the mixing rate between two types of water and to locate the recharge zones fontes 1976 a total of 9 samples collected in 2015 were analysed for stable isotopes oxygen 18 and deuterium and radioactive tritium six samples represent the barremian aptian aquifer and three represent the hauterivian aquifer for the barremian aptian aquifer the oxygen 18 contents vary between a minimum of 4 8 vs smow and a maximum of 4 3 vs smow with an average of 4 6 vs smow for deuterium the maximum value is 22 vs smow and the minimum value equal to 25 8 vs smow with an average of 23 3 vs smow table 2 as for the hauterivian aquifer the contents of oxygen 18 vary between a minimum of 4 vs smow and a maximum of 3 9 vs smow with an average of 4 vs smow for deuterium contents the maximum value is 21 5 vs smow and the minimum value equal to 23 0 vs smow with an average value of 22 3 vs smow as the absence of a local meteorological line of precipitation representing the study area the meteoric line of equation δ2h 7 95 x δ18o 11 3 determined by mennani et al 2001 was considered as an input function for the study area the correlation diagram δ2h vs δ18o of groundwater representing the barremian aptian and hauterian aquifers fig 10 a shows that all the samples are scattered around the local meteoric water line lmwl and above the global meteoric water line lmwl this suggests that the recharge of these aquifers studied is ensured by direct infiltration of precipitation of oceanic origin without significant evaporation the combination of physicochemical such as electrical conductivity ec and isotopic such as δ18o elements makes it possible to highlight the processes controlling the groundwater mineralization the ec vs oxygen 18 correlation diagram fig 10b shows that the ec values are not correlated with the oxygen 18 contents this shows that the groundwater mineralization of studied aquifers is controlled by the dissolution phenomenon this confirms the results obtained by the hydrogeochemical approach and suggests that evaporation seems to be an insignificant process involved in the groundwater mineralization the tritium contents of the samples analysed for the barremian aptian range from 0 8 to 1 7 tu with an average of 1 3 tu and between 1 3 and 2 2 tu with an average of 1 8 tu table 2 according to mazor 1991 a tritium content greater than 1 tu corresponds to a post nuclear recharge and a concentration less than 1 tu represents a pre nuclear recharge the projection of the collected samples in 2015 on the 3h vs δ18o diagram fig 10c shows that all the points are located above the line 3h 1 tu this reflects a recent recharge of the barremien aptian and hauterivien aquifers and confirms the results obtained by the δ2h vs δ18o diagram in order to estimate the groundwater recharge area in the study area the equation of the regional oxygen 18 gradient with elevation eq was used mennani 2001 this gradient has been used assuming that it has not changed over time δ o 18 3 2 6 10 3 altitude from fig 10d the altitudes of groundwater recharge of the barremian aptian aquifer are between 500 and 700 m asl these altitudes correspond to the outcrops of the cretaceous formations to the east of the aquifer fig 1 as for the hauterivian the recharging areas are located at altitudes of 350 400 m asl these areas correspond to the outcrops of the hauterivian formations to the north of the aquifer following the uprising of the jurassic formations amssittene anticline 5 conclusion the combination of piezometric hydrogeochemical and isotopic techniques adopted to assess the quantitative and qualitative evolution of groundwater of barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers of essaouira basin show that the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers have retained the general direction of flow of their groundwater during the study period monitoring the piezometry over a period of 43 years 1976 2019 shows a continuous decline in the piezometric level around 8 m for the barremian aptian aquifer and 5 m for the hauterivian this general downward of piezometric level could be explained by the decrease in precipitation caused by climate change in turn this decline causes a qualitative deterioration in the groundwater quality as for the hydrogeochemical approach it shows that the groundwater representing the barremian aptian and hauterivian aquifers have three types of chemical facies cl na cl ca mg and hco3 ca mg with the dominance of the cl ca mg facies for the study period a remarkable evolution of the facies from the cl na facies to the cl ca mg facies was observed the correlations established between the concentrations of major elements have shown that the groundwater mineralization is controlled by the dissolution phenomenon such as the dissolution of evaporitic and carbonates minerals and by the bases exchange phenomenon the spatial temporal evolution of the groundwater quality shows a gradual deterioration in time and space the isotopic technique shows that the groundwater recharge is ensured by precipitation of oceanic origin without notable evaporation tritium tracing shows that the recharge of groundwater is post nuclear confirming that the recharge of the aquifers within the study area is in close relation to the precipitation this recharge takes place at altitudes varying between 500 and 700 m asl eastern part of the aquifer where the cretaceous formations are exposed for the barremian aptian aquifer and between altitudes 350 and 400 m asl northern part of the aquifer where the hauterivian formations are exposed following the uprising of the jurassic formations amssittene anticline for the hauterivian aquifer however the complementarity of piezometric hydrogeochemical and isotopic approaches can lead to the diagnosis of the vulnerability state of the aquifers of the essaouira basin in the face to climate change however the development of a rational exploitation strategy could therefore make it possible to develop its waters while safeguarding its long term potential as well as the use of unconventional resources such as desalinated seawater for drinking water supply or treated wastewater for agriculture the techniques followed in this study remain valid to apply to other basins with the same climatic conditions such as arid and semi arid basins declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

12026,in recent years groundwater has been affected by anthropogenic pollutants such as nitrates the latter has the potential to produce nitrosamines and can therefore cause blue baby syndrome as well as several types of cancer including that of the digestive system moreover nitrates lead to eutrophication in water bodies such as rivers and lakes these adverse effects make it necessary to remove nitrates from water this work consisted of the denitrification technique study by electrocoagulation ec of nitrate rich groundwater for the production of drinking water tests were carried out on nitrate based synthetic water prepared in the laboratory the ec test was realized in a batch reactor comprising two aluminum electrodes powered by different dc voltages the operating parameters were the applied voltage between the electrodes 5 30 v a ph fixed at 7 an initial nitrate concentration of 100 mg l the results showed that the removal efficiency depended on the applied voltage and the immersed surface of the electrodes this removal efficiency was 94 41 after 150 min under the following conditions ph 7 electrical voltage 30 v immersed surface 33 75 cm2 in addition this study concluded that the nitrate removal by electrocoagulation could be achieved by adsorption on al oh 3 and or reduction to nitrites or to ammonium a significant quantity of by products ammonium and nitrite formed during the process however the addition of cl allowed decrease in nitrite and ammonium formation the current density monitoring determined the maximum current intensity that could be kept constant to improve removal efficiency and reduce treatment time graphical abstract image 1 keywords aluminum electrocoagulation groundwater nitrate removal nitrite abbreviations ec

2014b 2015 saleh and gupta 2012b the water pollution by organic and inorganic compounds is of great public concern gupta et al 2002 khani et al 2010 gupta and saleh 2013 over recent decades a continuous increase of nitrate concentrations no 3 in groundwater reserves and surface water has been observed in the most european countries nitrate concentration in groundwater was approximately stable 17 5 mg l between 1992 and 2012 after that period finland and malta regularize the minimum 1 mg l and maximum 58 1 mg l values respectively groundwater pollution by the nitrogen compounds was also reported in various countries such as morocco niger nigeria senegal india pakistan japan lebanon philippines and turkey ward et al 2018 in different regions of morocco nitrates were present in some aquifers at high concentrations around 45 of the groundwater was evaluated of degraded quality against 55 of excellent quality on average recorded in the beni amir beni moussa maamora 73 mg l fez

presence of nitrogen compounds in groundwater was at critical levels of pollution the main sources of nitrate pollution were related to the use of nitrogen fertilizers and wastewater discharges schoeman and steyn 2003 rezaee et al 2008 consumption of nitrate contaminated water might cause health problems including methaemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome in infants due to the transformation

2016 the increase of toxic compound levels both in air and water requires effective methods and techniques for their degradation and or conversion into harmless species romero saez et al 2017 several physicochemical and biological methods have been used to remove nitrate from water the physicochemical techniques included ion exchange reverse osmosis etc ghafari et al 2008 reverse osmosis and ion exchange could not selectively remove nitrate and the presence of interfering ions decreased the nitrate removal efficiency dehghani et al 2010 ec is one of the nitrate treatment techniques where the coagulant was produced in situ using sacrificial anodes kumar and goel 2010a table 1 presents different methods used in water treatment with their advantages and disadvantages showing our choice regarding nitrates many studies have studied their elimination by this technique emamjomeh and sivakumar 2005 used an ec cell with five aluminum electrodes to remove nitrates from the drinking water the results obtained showed that the maximum nitrate removal efficiency reaches 90 after 90 min by applying a current intensity of 2 5 a another study was conducted by malakootian et al 2011 using four pairs of aluminum electrodes to remove nitrates from the water of kerman province iran the obtained results from this study showed that this cell was efficient enough to reduce the nitrate concentration from 100 to 10 3 mg l 89 7 within 60 min of treatment ec is based on the application of an electric current or potential between two electrodes usually iron or aluminum to destabilize suspended emulsified or dissolved contaminants in a solution the anode provides metal ions to the system while the cathode releases hydrogen gas the main electrochemical reactions in the case of aluminum electrodes are at the anode oxidation of aluminum according to eq 1 1 al s al3 aq 3e at the cathode several reactions can take place according to the medium ph at neutral or basic ph hydrogen

in this paper we study the relevant parameters in the nitrate removal efficiency from synthetic water such as the electrolysis time the applied voltage and the aluminum electrodes immersed surface the present work aimed to improve the efficiency of nitrate elimination and reduce the treatment time via i the exploration of factors that affect the performance of the electrocoagulation system ii the study of the effect of chlorides on the elimination of nitrates by reducing the by products formed and iii the determination of the maximum current density by controlling the electrical voltage 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials synthetic nitrate rich waters were prepared in order to analyze the removal of nitrate by electrocoagulation the ph adjustment was carried out with 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh potassium nitrate kno3 was used as the source of nitrates all of the chemicals were of analytical grade supplied by scharlau and all solutions were prepared using double distilled water 2 2 experimental equipment and procedures electrochemical tests were performed in a pyrex reactor the treated volume of nitrate rich water was 500 ml the electrochemical cell consisted of two aluminum electrodes immersed at a depth of 7 5 cm and connected to the voltage generator 0 30 v model al 823 with a power of 550 w operating at an input voltage of 220 v fig 1 a the gap between the electrodes was 1 8 cm 2 3 design of experiments in this study four tests were performed with aluminum electrodes the first test studied the effect of the voltage 5 10 20 and 30 v on the nitrate removal efficiency using electrodes of dimensions 20 cm 1 5 cm 2 mm with 0 5 g l nacl for increase the conductivity of synthetic water the second test studied the effect of nacl on the nitrate removal efficiency at a fixed voltage 30 v using electrodes of dimensions 20 cm 1 5 cm 2 mm for this experiment three tests with nacl 0 0 20 0 50 g l were carried out the third test studied the effect of the immersed surface of the electrodes 11 25 cm2 22 5 cm2 33 75 cm2 on the nitrate removal efficiency at a constant voltage 30 v using electrodes of dimensions 20 cm 1 5 cm 2 mm 20 cm 3 cm 2 mm and 20 cm 4 5 cm 2 mm the fourth test studied the variation of the current intensity during the ec at 30 v using electrodes of dimensions 20 cm 4 5 cm 2 mm to determine the maximum current intensity for high removal efficiency all the experiments were repeated three times and average values were reported the electrodes used are made of aluminum with a purity of 100 the pretreatment of aluminum electrodes was performed with 4 hcl acid solution electrodes were rinsed with distilled water after treatment and before each run a sample of 5 ml was taken by a syringe from the centre part of the reactor after that it was filtered with a 0 20 μm syringe filter to enable particle separation 2 4 analysis procedure the monitoring of the current intensity was carried out by an acquisition electronic card which measures and sends the instant value of the current to an excel file fig 1b the nitrates and nitrites concentrations were measured using ion chromatograph 881 compact ic pro metrohm according to the standard nf en iso 10304 1 ammonium was determined by indophenol blue spectrophotometric method according to nft 90 015 using a u v spectrophotometer uv 1650pc shimadzu the yield of nitrate removal could be calculated as follows r ci cf ci 100 where ci is the initial concentration and cf is the final concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of applied voltage on the nitrate removal efficiency the applied voltage is one of the most significant factors affecting the electrocoagulation process in this study the experiments were carried out at four voltages namely 5 10 20 and 30 v the obtained results are shown in fig 2 this figure showed that the nitrate removal efficiency improved with increasing applied voltage it goes from 35 48 5 v to 86 97 30 v for 5 h this improvement can be explained by the increase under the effect of the potential of the ion transport towards the electrodes and the acceleration of the next ec kunvarani and pandya 2014 this result is in agreement with those obtained by various authors khemis et al 2006 emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 pak 2015 which showed that the higher quantity of aluminum produced the greater the coagulation so the destabilization of the nitrate ions is more significant in another study kumar and goel 2010a showed that the nitrate removal efficiency by ec increased with the reaction time and the applied voltage this efficiency was 84 at 25 v majlesi et al 2016 noted the same evolution of nitrate removal efficiency with increasing current density it goes from 55 0 4 ma cm 2 to 96 3 2 ma cm 2 after 30 min of treatment vasudevan et al 2010 have shown that this behaviour of nitrate removal efficiency is easily explained by the increased coagulation rate when the current is increased indicating that adsorption is dependent on the availability of nitrate bonding sites our results are in agreement with those obtained by malakootian et al 2011 which showed that the increase of the imposed potential further improved the nitrate removal efficiency due to the increased production of hydroxide flocs at high voltage 3 2 evolution of nitrates and nitrites concentrations during the ec process the concentration of nitrates decreases over time for the different voltages studied fig 3 a mainly when the voltage between the electrodes increases the removal efficiencies as well as the residual nitrates concentrations obtained after 5 h are presented in table 2 the nitrates removal seems to be due to two phenomena adsorption on al oh 3 flocs and reduction of no3 to no2 adsorption eq 4 has been highlighted by several authors who have shown that the nitrate abatement depends only on the quantity of flocs formed lacasa et al 2011 yehya et al 2014 showed that the decrease of nitrates is mainly due to their electro reduction to ammonium and their adsorption on aluminum flocs as a secondary elimination mechanism massaï et al 2009 showed that nitrates can be reduced on a copper electrode by adsorption and reduction to nitrite on the one hand and to no in the other hand yang et al 2017 showed that according to the theory of surface complexation aluminum ions on the surface of activated alumina are complexed with water molecules to form al oh groups duan et al 2013 kasprzyk hordern 2004 thus the nitrate can be adsorbed by ion exchange eq 14 bhatnagar et al 2010 kasprzyk hordern 2004 halajnia et al 2013 milmile et al 2011 or by hydrogen bonding eq 15 teimouri et al 2016 with the hydroxyl group 14 m oh no3 m no3 oh 15 m oh no3 m oh no3 concerning the reduction of no3 to no2 the appearance of nitrite is indeed observed but in low concentrations included between 2 48 and 3 06 mg l fig 3b some authors have highlighted the electroreduction of nitrates aouina 2009 talhi 2010 shin et al 2014 part of which leads to the formation of nitrites other reduction products can be formed according to well defined mechanisms depending on reaction conditions including ph murphy 1991 reported that nitrate removal can be achieved by reducing nitrite to ammonium and nitrogen gas at ph range between 9 and 10 5 majlesi et al 2016 have proposed the nitrate removal to nitrite according to the following reactions 16 3no3 2al 3h2o 3no2 2al oh 3 17 2no2 2al 4h2o n2 g 2al oh 3 2oh we note that for 5 and 10 v the maximum no2 is reached after 300 min while for voltages 20 and 30 v it is reached after 150 min table 3 the previous results highlighting the effect of the applied voltage on the nitrate removal efficiency table 2 are confirmed by those relating to nitrites indeed the kinetics of nitrites formation is greater at high voltages 20 and 30 v the time required to reach the maximum concentration is halved the nitrite concentration decreases beyond 150 min for 20 and 30 v fig 3b this can probably be explained by the increase of the electrochemical reactions kinetics leading to their adsorption fixation on the flocs of al oh 3 formed abundantly at high voltage or by exchange reaction eq 17 or their reduction eq 8 and eq 12 several authors have shown that ec is an efficient method to remove nitrate ions but propose different mechanisms of elimination koparal and öğütveren 2002 and emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 have suggested electroreduction of nitrates to ammonium and then nitrogen gas lacasa et al 2011 have proposed a mechanism based on the adsorption of nitrates on precipitates of oxyhydroxides formed during ec 3 3 study of nitrates adsorption kinetics the nitrate removal curves fig 3a show an exponential decay corresponding to a pseudo first order kinetic model of lagergren ct c0 e k t where c0 and ct are the nitrate concentrations at the initial moment and at the time t respectively the linearization of the nitrate removal curves fig 4 makes it possible to determine the kinetic constant k the values of which are presented in table 4 k values increase as the voltage applied between the electrodes increases this result confirms the previous conclusions concerning the adsorption of nitrates on al oh 3 flocs our finding is consistent with the results found by emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 the values of the constant k are low compared to those determined by ghanim and ajjam 2013 who found values ranging from 0 0183 to 0 0355 for current densities between 2 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively our results remain comparable to those determined by yehya et al 2014 that found values ranging from 0 0035 to 0 012 for current intensities ranging from 1 5 to 4 5 a respectively 3 4 effect of nacl addition on nitrate removal efficiency the nitrate concentration decreases for the three tests according to fig 5 the efficiency of these tests is presented in table 5 the addition of nacl gives slightly lower efficiency than the salt free test fig 5a this decrease is probably due to the competition between cl and no3 on the adsorption and or exchange sites at the al oh 3 flocs as suggested above these results are in agreement with those obtained by different authors li et al 2009a which reported that nitrate removal in the absence of nacl was greater than that in the presence of nacl the authors explained this by the presence of chloride ions dash and chaudhari 2005 used titanium as a cathode to reduce nitrates electrochemically they found that the kinetics of nitrate reduction decreased in the presence of 250 mg l nacl li and liu 2009 and díaz et al 2011 conducted nitrate electroreduction experiments in the presence of chloride ions using different electrodes such as iron copper and titanium they found that increasing the chloride concentration lowers the rate of nitrate removal it should be noted that the chlorides present in solution can by anodic electro oxidation give rise to hypochlorite ions according to the following reactions 18 2cl 2cl2 2e 19 cl2 h2o hclo hcl 20 hclo ocl h on the one hand the hypochlorite ions can react with nh3 to transform it into n2 eq 21 on the other hand they can react with no2 to regenerate the nitrates eq 22 21 2nh3 2ocl n2 2hcl 2h2o 2e 22 no2 ocl no3 cl these two reactions are antagonistic the first one helps to eliminate nitrates indirectly by acting on ammonia the second one regenerates nitrates this observation probably explains the decrease in the nitrate removal efficiency in the presence of nacl however szpyrkowicz et al 2006 have shown that the addition of chloride ions has no effect on this rate by using pd cu pd co or pd cu co sprayed on stainless steel or titanium oxide used as cathodes in contrast a positive effect of chloride concentration on electroreduction of nitrate was observed with tin electrodes katsounaros and kyriacou 2007 boron doped diamond bdd pérez et al 2012 and graphite gf ding et al 2015 the presence of chloride ions could cause various phenomena that influence the electrochemical reduction rate of nitrates depending on the nature of the electrodes used li et al 2009a 2009b hasnat et al 2009 dash and chaudhari 2005 unlike nitrates nitrites show a fairly differentiated evolution for the three tests fig 5c as for the previous tests their concentration increases and then decreases it is found that salt significantly affects their concentration the nitrite behaviour in the presence of nacl could be explained by eq 22 during which they are further removed when the salt concentration increases this could support the previous results for nitrates the nitrites are more toxic than nitrates see some toxic effects of nitrites mentioned in the introduction who drinking water guidelines are 3 mg l for no2 cotruvo 2017 our results show that treatment of nitrate rich waters is possible but a quantity of nacl must be added to reduce nitrite formation during electrocoagulation treatment 3 5 evolution of ammonium nitrates and nitrites during electrocoagulation process fig 6 shows the evolution of the concentration of ammonium nitrite nitrates and their removal efficiency in the presence of different quantities of nacl during electrocoagulation treatment from these curves we observed the appearance of nitrites and ammonium during the elimination of nitrates by electrocoagulation which could explain well the mechanism of nitrate removal by electrocoagulation our results are in agreement with several works mentioned above koparal and öğütveren 2002 emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 the addition of nacl reduces nitrites and formed ammonium and it promotes the elimination of nitrates by adsorption on formed aluminum hydroxides 3 6 effect of immersed surface on nitrate removal efficiency according to the previous results a large part of the removed nitrates are adsorbed onto the aluminum flocs hence the importance of studying the effect of the electrodes submerged surface fig 7 shows the evolution of nitrate removal their efficiency and the nitrite concentration versus time the nitrate removal is slightly improved when the active surface of the electrodes increases this is probably due to the increase of the exchange surface fig 8 d which allows the formation of more al oh 3 thus promoting a strong adsorption of nitrates on the hydroxides this improvement of the nitrate removal efficiency as a function of the active surface of the electrodes was also found by tabash 2013 he showed that the use of a larger active surface generates large amounts of iron which traps more pollutants and improves the nitrate removal efficiency as in previous tests the nitrite concentration increases initially fig 7c probably due to the nitrate reduction nitrates reduction could be explained by their reduction according to different reactions eq 8 to eq 12 or by their adsorption fixation eq 4 or by exchange reaction eq 5 on al oh 3 flocs the nitrites decrease improves over time fig 8e and more as the surface of the electrodes increases the nitrites concentration decreases further as the active surface of the electrodes increases it is the same when the time of ec increases this decrease is probably due to their adsorption on the aluminum hydroxides on the one hand or their reduction to n2 and or nh3 on the other hand eq 8 and eq 9 fig 8 a and b c shows the evolution of nitrates and nitrites during ec tests we note that when the nitrite concentration reaches its maximum the nitrates concentration further decreases as the surface of the electrodes increases residual values of nitrates after 150 min are presented in table 6 3 7 evolution of the current density during the ec process fig 9 shows the evolution of the current density as a function of time at 30 v during ec treatment of nitrates for electrodes of dimensions 20 cm 4 5 cm 2 mm examination of this figure shows that the current density increases slightly during the first minutes it reaches 22 compared to the initial density this increase could be due to the formation of al3 and oh ions and the nitrates reduction to nitrite having a greater mobility than that of nitrates the current density then decreases of 75 this decrease can probably be attributed to several effects the most important of which are the precipitation of the oh and al3 ions in the form of the al oh 3 precipitate eq 4 and the nitrite removal by adsorption on this precipitate or their transformation into gases or products in low concentrations thus contributing very little to the conductivity of the medium in the literature several authors have shown that the efficiency of nitrate removal by ec is strongly influenced by the value of the current density daneshvar et al 2004 emamjomeh and sivakumar 2005 aoudj et al 2016 pak 2015 showed that the nitrate removal efficiency is proportional to the value of the density of the applied current in our experiment it is noted that the increase of the current density induces a decrease of nitrates of about 50 for 60 min of ec when this density decreases it is noted that the time required to complete the removal of nitrates is about 5 h this means that it is more convenient to operate at higher current density values keeping it constant to improve efficiency and reduce processing time 4 conclusions the conducted research on the electrocoagulation treatment of nitrate rich water has provided an understanding of the phenomenon occurring during the process the results illustrated that the nitrate removal efficiency depends on several parameters such as the electrolysis time the applied voltage and the immersed surface of the electrodes the removal yield achieved was 94 41 for 150 min of treatment however nitrates can be eliminated in three ways 1 by adsorption on aluminum hydroxides and or 2 by reduction to nitrites and then nitrogen gas and or 3 by reduction to ammonium the addition of nacl favor removal nitrate by adsorption the adsorption of nitrates on aluminum hydroxides can be described by a pseudo first order model in addition the nitrate removal efficiency is influenced by the variation of the current density therefore it is necessary to operate at higher density values to improve the removal efficiency and reduce the processing time funding this research did not receive any specific grant from

12026,in recent years groundwater has been affected by anthropogenic pollutants such as nitrates the latter has the potential to produce nitrosamines and can therefore cause blue baby syndrome as well as several types of cancer including that of the digestive system moreover nitrates lead to eutrophication in water bodies such as rivers and lakes these adverse effects make it necessary to remove nitrates from water this work consisted of the denitrification technique study by electrocoagulation ec of nitrate rich groundwater for the production of drinking water tests were carried out on nitrate based synthetic water prepared in the laboratory the ec test was realized in a batch reactor comprising two aluminum electrodes powered by different dc voltages the operating parameters were the applied voltage between the electrodes 5 30 v a ph fixed at 7 an initial nitrate concentration of 100 mg l the results showed that the removal efficiency depended on the applied voltage and the immersed surface of the electrodes this removal efficiency was 94 41 after 150 min under the following conditions ph 7 electrical voltage 30 v immersed surface 33 75 cm2 in addition this study concluded that the nitrate removal by electrocoagulation could be achieved by adsorption on al oh 3 and or reduction to nitrites or to ammonium a significant quantity of by products ammonium and nitrite formed during the process however the addition of cl allowed decrease in nitrite and ammonium formation the current density monitoring determined the maximum current intensity that could be

regarding nitrates many studies have studied their elimination by this technique emamjomeh and sivakumar 2005 used an ec cell with five aluminum electrodes to remove nitrates from the drinking water the results obtained showed that the maximum nitrate removal efficiency reaches 90 after 90 min by applying a current intensity of 2 5 a another study was conducted by malakootian et al 2011 using four pairs of aluminum electrodes to remove nitrates from the water of kerman province iran the obtained results from this study showed that this cell was efficient enough to reduce the nitrate

study of the effect of chlorides on the elimination of nitrates by reducing the by products formed and iii the determination of the maximum current density by controlling the electrical voltage 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials synthetic nitrate rich waters were prepared in order to analyze the removal of nitrate by electrocoagulation the ph adjustment was carried out with 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh potassium nitrate kno3 was used as the source of nitrates all of the chemicals were of analytical grade supplied by scharlau and all solutions were prepared using double distilled water 2 2 experimental equipment and procedures electrochemical tests were performed in a pyrex reactor the treated volume of nitrate rich water was 500 ml the electrochemical cell consisted of two aluminum electrodes immersed at a depth of 7 5 cm and connected to the voltage generator 0 30 v model al 823 with a power of 550 w operating at an input voltage of 220 v fig 1 a the gap between the electrodes was 1 8 cm 2 3 design of experiments in this study four tests were performed with aluminum electrodes the first test studied the effect of the voltage 5 10 20 and 30 v on the nitrate removal efficiency using electrodes of dimensions 20 cm 1 5 cm 2 mm with 0 5 g l nacl for increase the conductivity of synthetic water the second test studied the effect of nacl on the nitrate removal efficiency at a fixed voltage 30 v using electrodes of dimensions 20 cm 1 5 cm 2 mm for this experiment three tests with nacl 0 0 20 0 50 g l were carried out the third test studied the effect of the

removal efficiency all the experiments were repeated three times and average values were reported the electrodes used are made of aluminum with a purity of 100 the pretreatment of aluminum electrodes was performed with 4 hcl acid solution electrodes were rinsed with distilled water after treatment and before each run a sample of 5 ml was taken by a syringe from the centre part of the reactor after that it was filtered with a 0 20 μm syringe filter to enable particle separation 2 4 analysis procedure the monitoring of the current intensity was carried out by an acquisition electronic card which measures and sends the instant value of the current to an excel file fig 1b the nitrates and nitrites concentrations were measured using ion chromatograph 881 compact ic pro metrohm according to the

could be calculated as follows r ci cf ci 100 where ci is the initial concentration and cf is the final concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of applied voltage on the nitrate removal efficiency the applied voltage is one of the most significant factors affecting the electrocoagulation process in this study the experiments were carried out at four voltages namely 5 10 20 and 30 v the obtained results are shown in fig 2 this figure showed that the nitrate removal efficiency improved with increasing applied voltage it goes from 35 48 5 v to 86 97 30 v for 5 h this improvement can be explained by the increase under the effect of the potential of the ion transport towards the electrodes and the acceleration of the next ec kunvarani and pandya 2014 this result is in agreement with those obtained by various authors khemis et al 2006 emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 pak 2015 which showed that the higher quantity of aluminum produced the greater the coagulation so the destabilization of the nitrate ions is more significant in another study kumar and goel 2010a showed that the nitrate removal efficiency by ec increased with the reaction time and the applied voltage this efficiency was 84 at 25 v majlesi et al 2016 noted the same evolution of nitrate removal efficiency with increasing current density it goes from 55 0 4 ma cm 2 to 96 3 2 ma cm 2 after 30 min of treatment vasudevan et al 2010 have shown that this behaviour of nitrate removal efficiency is easily explained by the increased coagulation rate when the current is increased indicating that adsorption is dependent on the availability of nitrate bonding sites our results are in agreement with those obtained by malakootian et al 2011 which showed that the increase of the imposed potential further improved the nitrate removal efficiency due to the increased production of hydroxide flocs at high voltage 3 2 evolution of nitrates and nitrites concentrations during the ec process the concentration of nitrates decreases over time for the different voltages studied fig 3 a mainly when the voltage between the electrodes increases the removal efficiencies as well as the residual nitrates concentrations obtained after 5 h are presented in table 2 the nitrates removal seems to be due to two phenomena adsorption on al oh 3 flocs and reduction of no3 to no2 adsorption eq 4 has been highlighted by several authors who have shown that the nitrate abatement depends only on the quantity of flocs formed lacasa et al 2011 yehya et al 2014 showed that the decrease of nitrates is mainly due to their electro reduction to ammonium and their adsorption on aluminum flocs as a secondary elimination mechanism massaï et al 2009 showed that nitrates can be reduced on a copper electrode by adsorption and reduction to nitrite on the one hand and to no in the other hand yang et al 2017 showed that according to the theory of surface complexation aluminum ions on the surface of activated alumina are complexed with water molecules to form al oh groups duan et al 2013 kasprzyk hordern 2004 thus the nitrate can be adsorbed by ion exchange eq 14 bhatnagar et al 2010 kasprzyk hordern 2004 halajnia et al 2013 milmile et al 2011 or by hydrogen bonding eq 15 teimouri et al 2016 with the hydroxyl group 14 m oh no3 m no3 oh 15 m oh no3 m oh no3 concerning the reduction of no3 to no2 the appearance of nitrite is indeed observed but in low concentrations included between 2 48 and 3 06 mg l fig 3b some authors have highlighted the electroreduction of nitrates aouina 2009 talhi 2010 shin et al 2014 part of which leads to the formation of nitrites other reduction products can be formed according to well defined mechanisms depending on reaction conditions including ph murphy 1991 reported that nitrate removal can be achieved by reducing nitrite to ammonium and nitrogen gas at ph range between 9 and 10 5 majlesi et al 2016 have proposed the nitrate removal to nitrite according to the following reactions 16 3no3 2al 3h2o 3no2 2al oh 3 17 2no2 2al 4h2o n2 g 2al oh 3 2oh we note that for 5 and 10 v the maximum no2 is reached after 300 min while for voltages 20 and 30 v it is reached after 150 min table 3 the previous results highlighting the effect of the applied voltage on the nitrate removal efficiency table 2 are confirmed by those relating to nitrites indeed the kinetics of nitrites formation is greater at high voltages 20 and 30 v the time required to reach the maximum concentration is halved the nitrite concentration decreases beyond 150 min for 20 and 30 v fig 3b this can probably be explained by the increase of the electrochemical reactions kinetics leading to their adsorption fixation on the flocs of al oh 3 formed abundantly at high voltage or by exchange reaction eq 17 or their reduction eq 8 and eq 12 several authors have shown that ec is an efficient method to remove nitrate ions but propose different mechanisms of elimination koparal and öğütveren 2002 and emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 have suggested electroreduction of nitrates to ammonium and then nitrogen gas lacasa et al 2011 have proposed a mechanism based on the adsorption of nitrates on precipitates of oxyhydroxides formed during ec 3 3 study of nitrates adsorption kinetics the nitrate removal curves fig 3a show an exponential decay corresponding to a pseudo first order kinetic model of lagergren ct c0 e k t where c0 and ct are the nitrate concentrations at the initial moment and at the time t respectively the linearization of the nitrate removal curves fig 4 makes it possible to determine the kinetic constant k the values of which are presented in table 4 k values increase as the voltage applied between the electrodes increases this result confirms the previous conclusions concerning the adsorption of nitrates on al oh 3 flocs our finding is consistent with the results found by emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 the values of the constant k are low compared to those determined by ghanim and ajjam 2013 who found values ranging from 0 0183 to 0 0355 for current densities between 2 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively our results remain comparable to those determined by yehya et al 2014 that found values ranging from 0 0035 to 0 012 for current intensities ranging from 1 5 to 4 5 a respectively 3 4 effect of nacl addition on nitrate removal efficiency the nitrate concentration decreases for the three tests according to fig 5 the efficiency of these tests is presented in table 5 the addition of nacl gives slightly lower efficiency than the salt free test fig 5a this decrease is probably due to the competition between cl and no3 on the adsorption and or exchange sites at the al oh 3 flocs as suggested above these results are in agreement with those obtained by different authors li et al 2009a which reported that nitrate removal in the absence of nacl was greater than that in the presence of nacl the authors explained this by the presence of chloride ions dash and chaudhari 2005 used titanium as a cathode to reduce nitrates electrochemically they found that the kinetics of nitrate reduction decreased in the presence of 250 mg l nacl li and liu 2009 and díaz et al 2011 conducted nitrate electroreduction experiments in the presence of chloride ions using different electrodes such as iron copper and titanium they found that increasing the chloride concentration lowers the rate of nitrate removal it should be noted that the chlorides present in solution can by anodic electro oxidation give rise to hypochlorite ions according to the following reactions 18 2cl 2cl2 2e 19 cl2 h2o hclo hcl 20 hclo ocl h on the one hand the hypochlorite ions can react with nh3 to transform it into n2 eq 21 on the other hand they can react with no2 to regenerate the nitrates eq 22 21 2nh3 2ocl n2 2hcl 2h2o 2e 22 no2 ocl no3 cl these two reactions are antagonistic the first one helps to eliminate nitrates indirectly by acting on ammonia the second one regenerates nitrates this observation probably explains the decrease in the nitrate removal efficiency in the presence of nacl however szpyrkowicz et al 2006 have shown that the addition of chloride ions has no effect on this rate by using pd cu pd co or pd cu co sprayed on stainless steel or titanium oxide used as cathodes in contrast a positive effect of chloride concentration on electroreduction of nitrate was observed with tin electrodes katsounaros and kyriacou 2007 boron doped diamond bdd pérez et al 2012 and graphite gf ding et al 2015 the presence of chloride ions could cause various phenomena that influence the electrochemical reduction rate of nitrates depending on the nature of the electrodes used li et al 2009a 2009b hasnat et al 2009 dash and chaudhari 2005 unlike nitrates nitrites show a fairly differentiated evolution for the three tests fig 5c as for the previous tests their concentration increases and then decreases it is found that salt significantly affects their concentration the nitrite behaviour in the presence of nacl could be explained by eq 22 during which they are further removed when the salt concentration increases this could support the previous results for nitrates the nitrites are more toxic than nitrates see some toxic effects of nitrites mentioned in the introduction who drinking water guidelines are 3 mg l for no2 cotruvo 2017 our results show that treatment of nitrate rich waters is possible but a quantity of nacl must be added to reduce nitrite formation during electrocoagulation treatment 3 5 evolution of ammonium nitrates and nitrites during electrocoagulation process fig 6 shows the evolution of the concentration of ammonium nitrite nitrates and their removal efficiency in the presence of different quantities of nacl during electrocoagulation treatment from these curves we observed the appearance of nitrites and ammonium during the elimination of nitrates by electrocoagulation which could explain well the mechanism of nitrate removal by electrocoagulation our results are in agreement with several works mentioned above koparal and öğütveren 2002 emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 the addition of nacl reduces nitrites and formed ammonium and it promotes the elimination of nitrates by adsorption on formed aluminum hydroxides 3 6 effect of immersed surface on nitrate removal efficiency according to the previous results a large part of the removed nitrates are adsorbed onto the aluminum flocs hence the importance of studying the effect of the electrodes submerged surface fig 7 shows the evolution of nitrate removal their efficiency and the nitrite concentration versus time the nitrate removal is slightly improved when the active surface of the electrodes increases this is probably due to the increase of the exchange surface fig 8 d which allows the formation of more al oh 3 thus promoting a strong adsorption of nitrates on the hydroxides this improvement of the nitrate removal efficiency as a function of the active surface of the electrodes was also found by tabash 2013 he showed that the use of a larger active surface generates large amounts of iron which traps more pollutants and improves the nitrate removal efficiency as in previous tests the nitrite concentration increases initially fig 7c probably due to the nitrate reduction nitrates reduction could be explained by their reduction according to different reactions eq 8 to eq 12 or by their adsorption fixation eq 4 or by exchange reaction eq 5 on al oh 3 flocs the nitrites decrease improves over time fig 8e and more as the surface of the electrodes increases the nitrites concentration decreases further as the active surface of the electrodes increases it is the same when the time of ec increases this decrease is probably due to their adsorption on the aluminum hydroxides on the one hand or their reduction to n2 and or nh3 on the other hand eq 8 and eq 9 fig 8 a and b c shows the evolution of nitrates and nitrites during ec tests we note that when the nitrite concentration reaches its maximum the nitrates concentration further decreases as the surface of the electrodes increases residual values of nitrates after 150 min are presented in table 6 3 7 evolution of the current density during the ec process fig 9 shows the evolution of the current density as a function of time at 30 v during ec treatment of nitrates for electrodes of dimensions 20 cm 4 5 cm 2 mm examination of this figure shows that the current density increases slightly during the first minutes it reaches 22 compared to the initial density this increase could be due to the formation of al3 and oh ions and the nitrates reduction to nitrite having a greater mobility than that of nitrates the current density then decreases of 75 this decrease can probably be attributed to several effects the most important of which are the precipitation of the oh and al3 ions in the form of the al oh 3 precipitate eq 4 and the nitrite removal by adsorption on this precipitate or their transformation into gases or products in low concentrations thus contributing very little to the conductivity of the medium in the literature several authors have shown that the efficiency of nitrate removal by ec is strongly influenced by the value of the current density daneshvar et al 2004 emamjomeh and sivakumar 2005 aoudj et al 2016 pak 2015 showed that the nitrate removal efficiency is proportional to the value of the density of the applied current in our experiment it is noted that the increase of the current density induces a decrease of nitrates of about 50 for 60 min of ec when this density decreases it is noted that the time required to complete the removal of nitrates is about 5 h this means that it is more convenient to operate at higher current density values keeping it constant to improve efficiency and reduce processing time 4 conclusions the conducted research on the electrocoagulation treatment of nitrate rich water has provided an understanding of the phenomenon occurring during the process the results illustrated that the nitrate removal efficiency depends on several parameters such as the electrolysis time the applied voltage and the immersed surface of the electrodes the removal yield achieved was 94 41 for 150 min of treatment however nitrates can be

12028,the global demand for clean water is growing due to the decreasing of natural renewable water resources with increasing public awareness of the limitations of groundwater resources the needs for protection and remediation of groundwater are gaining significant importance however groundwater is highly depleted due to unsustainable use of groundwater this implies the importance of sustainable use and management of groundwater resources although the groundwater in the state of qatar is not used as drinking water for the public it is widely used for agricultural domestic and recreational projects the high salinity concentrations of the groundwater are due to the stress from agriculture urban development and climate change this paper reviews the hydro geochemical characterizations of qatar s aquifer in addition it highlights the opportunities in the current groundwater management practices to achieve a sustainable groundwater use in qatar such as assessing and monitoring the groundwater quantity and quality in this review article the driver pressure state impact response framework was used to analyze the water resource system in qatar begins by describing the causal chain from driving forces of impacts and finally state the responses as the main driver was the intensive use of groundwater for agriculture irrigation this causes high pressure on groundwater abstraction and deteriorate the state of the groundwater environment in term of quantity and quality which has an impact on the food and water supply demands therefore the final response highlights the need for the enhancing the rainfall infiltration to the aquifers recharging the groundwater aquifers using treated sewage effluent or desalinated water development of groundwater treatment techniques the use of efficient water irrigation practices the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation and the development of certain water use tariff structures and awareness campaigns for farmers graphical abstract

arid country located between latitudes north 24 27 26 10 and longitudes east 50 45 51 40 along the eastern region of the arabian peninsula mdps 2017 the total surface area of qatar is 11 586 km2 it is about 180 km in length and about 90 km in width baalousha 2016 qatar has flat rocky surfaces nevertheless it consists of some hills of 100 m above sea level mdps 2017 the northern region of qatar is relatively low elevations and increases slowly to the west and southwest it is about 103 m above sea level in the southwest to about 6 m below sea level in dukhan sabkha sadiq and nasir 2002 qatar is mostly located over a uniform limestone bed and the oldest exposed rocks are the lower eocene rus formation that contains most of dolomite and limestone with few outcrops of the miocene covering about 8 of the surface area mdps 2015 karst is extensive in qatar it involves depressions sinkholes caves and solution hollows it is associated with the calcareous dolomitic and gypsiferous anhydride horizons of the eocene rus and dammam formations it happened because of preferential dissolution related to the variation in composition between dolomitic calcitic and gypsum rocks sadiq and nasir 2002 1 1 groundwater hydrogeology for the state of qatar the cretaceous age rocks and younger age paleogene age rocks have been investigated for the presence of potable water potable water has been found in eocene age rocks in qatar while brackish groundwater has been found in upper cretaceous age rocks shamrukh et al 2012 in qatar the descriptions of the middle eocene age are dammam formation rus formation while umm er radhuma is the early eocene paleocene age al naimi and mgbeojedo 2018 the dammam formation appears over most of the qatar peninsula the depth of the formation is about 50 m the upper part has limestone called the abarug member underlain by chalky limestone called the umm bab member and the lower part has a massive clayey fossiliferous limestone known as the dukhan member underlain by the midra shale member made up of yellow brown to greenish gray attapulgite shale of low carbonate al saad 2005 the upper part is significantly fractured and has solution cavities alsharhan et al 2001 the rus formation conformably lies under the dammam formation thickness of the rus formation varies from 28 to 44 m in the north and central of qatar and about 110 m in the south west of qatar al yousef 2003 it contains abundant of limestone dolomite anhydride and some marl un escwa bgr 2013 umm er radhuma formation conformably lies under the rus it consists of a dense sequence of about 300 500 m of brownish or grayish limestone that is dolomitic and well porous in the upper part which characterized by the presence of well fractured karstic dolomite and argillaceous in the lower part most wells in the center and south of qatar reportedly tap the rus formation aquifer above the confining gypsum that overlies the umm er radhuma uer formation aquifer in north qatar most wells reportedly tap both the rus and the upper of umm er radhuma formation aquifer while in the abo samra southwest groundwater wells reportedly tap the alat aquifer of the dammam formation and some tap deep older aruma aquifers of aruma formation which come from saudi arabia al yousef 2003 aquifers of dammam formation is unconfined in many areas due to erosion of the confining layers and or the formation of karst structures alsharhan et al 2001 all the fresh ground water in qatar comes from local rainfall except for the confined slightly brackish water near abu samara which receives inflow groundwater from the west saudi arabia un escwa bgr 2013 the higher part of the annual recharge comes from infiltration of runoff that generally collects in surface depressions recharge from rainfall to ground water is estimated to be 25 million m3 per year which is similar to previous studies that estimated 7 to 10 percent of annual rainfall the average annual rainfall volume is about 0 052 billion m3 in north of qatar and 3 5 to 5 percent in south of qatar baalousha et al 2015 1 2 groundwater interactions interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies known as hyporheic and with the surface terrestrial environment are the main groundwater contaminant pathways smith 2005 fig 1 shows the potential contaminating sources from agricultural such as fertilizer urban such as wastewater and industry such as spills and leaks as well as the groundwater interaction with surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes groundwater interactions may affect the transport of contamination within the ecosystem iaea 1999 these interactions can be effective in removing and diluting the contaminant from reaching groundwater iaea 1999 furthermore groundwater flux supplies organic matter and oxygen to stygofauna which live in a groundwater ecosystem humphreys 2008 numerous stygobitic species are relict group of faunas that have diminished from surface systems relict group was once a diverse and widespread group then a significant change happened in their habitat and a subset of the group is survived in confined hospitable habitat danielopol and griebler 2008 they are the engineers of the ecosystems that keep good quality of groundwater for example the burrows the tubificid worms which adjust water flows and re spread the sediment particle are significantly important to maintain the biogeochemical functions porter 2007 another groundwater interaction is the rock water interactions within the aquifer re distribution of elements may occur between the rock and aqueous system due to different mechanisms such as dissolution precipitation sorption and desorption kumar et al 2016 rock water interactions highly influence the quality of the groundwater through dissolution and cation exchange which are the major mechanisms yehia et al 2017 the level of chemicals in a certain groundwater relies on the occurrence of the elements in the aquifer matrix and the mobility and the removal mechanisms from the groundwater by adsorption and precipitation porcelli 2008 therefore the element levels in groundwater are controlled by the aquifer characteristics and the physicochemical characteristic of elements the geological hydrogeological hydrological physical chemical and biological characteristics of the aquifers control element levels and groundwater quality porcelli 2008 jakeman et al 2016 the intrinsic properties of the geologic and hydrogeological formations are aquifer lithology and the aquifer properties which include permeability effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity gradient such as flow directions jakeman et al 2016 danielopol and griebler 2008 here flow directions and velocities are to provide information on rates of water recharge to the subsurface locations and rates of groundwater discharge to surface and in any other features that represent the boundaries of the groundwater flow system jakeman et al 2016 the aquifer hydrological properties include precipitation and its rainfall water chemistry and spatiotemporal evapotranspiration while the aquifers biological properties such as meio and micro organisms and vegetation humphreys 2008 danielopol and griebler 2008 porcelli 2008 rock water interactions depend on mineralogical composition the geochemical hydro chemical and physical conditions within the aquifer matrix such as the weathering of the rock water flow redox conditions and soil ions retention time yehia et al 2017 the physical characteristics of the aquifer that control mineral levels in groundwater are the dense of the aquifer and the temperature of the water baeza et al 2008 the geochemical processes that influence element s behavior include dissolution precipitation and or co precipitation sorption e g ion exchange chemisorption and biologically mediated reactions carvalho et al 2017 mainly high levels of calcium and carbonate ions indicate rock water interaction whereas high levels of na and cl ions indicate evaporation crystallization actions the ion ratio plot helps to identify different processes like ion exchange mineral dissolution and precipitation kanagaraj and elango 2016 the transfer mechanisms of elements in groundwater are controlled by their physicochemical characteristics such as solubility and aqueous speciation precipitation adsorption and desorption capacities volatility carvalho et al 2017 and sensitivity to redox conditions which have a significant effect on the mobility of metals poinssot and geckeis 2012 for example maxwell et al 2015 stated that metals like cadmium cd and zinc zn complexes with organic matter in the soil are not stable while copper cu lead pb or mercury hg complexes are stable nevertheless some studies reported that dissolved organic matter may decrease cd adsorption by the formation of some complexes cd and zn are highly attached to clay minerals carbonates or hydrous oxides cadmium also can be precipitated such as cadmium carbonate hydroxide and phosphate the oxidation states of the toxic ions such as cd2 pb2 hg2 and ag are the most stable oxidation states hashim et al 2011 wongsasuluk et al 2013 the mobility of the metals speciation which may cause leaching to aquifer depends on various reactions in soil environment such as acid base precipitation dissolution oxidation reduction sorption or ion exchange processes fujinaga 2016 knowing that element speciation is the distribution of its chemical forms or species among different phases thus heavy metal forms can be divided into solid species that tend to be less mobile in comparison with colloidal or dissolved forms and the labile complexes that in equilibrium with their environment whereas the inert complexes are not in groundwater management process the knowledge about metals speciation is important to understand their mobility for instance the mobility of the metals that bound to solid can be enhanced by lowering the ph changing the redox increasing the inorganic salts which compete for heterogeneous reactions and dissolved complexation and increasing of natural or synthetic complexing agents bourg 1995 for example santos 2002 studied the spill on groundwater samples that reduce water ph increase of ec and s ca mg and k and heavy metals zn cd pb and cu levels therefore the authors change the ph of the polluted groundwater to the previous values before the spill to change metal speciation of pb and cu to less available forms as they precipitate while zn and cd remain available in mobile forms another example was stated by hashim et al 2011 to reduce cr6 from chromium industry effluents using ferrous sulfate as shown in reaction 1 1 c r a q 6 3 f e a q 2 c r a q 3 3 f e a q 3 then the rapid precipitation could be happening when the ph was near neutral as shown in reaction 2 2 c r 3 3 o h c r o h 3 in addition if excess fe was available then the reaction will be as reaction 3 3 1 x fe 3 xcr 3 3 o h cr x fe 1 x o h 3 s o l i d 1 3 sustainable groundwater management sustainable use and management of groundwater are very important processes for environmental economic technological and social development as shown in fig 2 for example due to the greatly spread technologies of extraction and distribution groundwater beside the low prices of these technologies the quantity and quality of the groundwater are changed so new irrigation technologies should be adopted such as root zone irrigation greenhouse technologies or by saving the water consumptions through the reuse of wastewater in homes brown et al 2018 however the groundwater deterioration was unnoticed for long periods due to the invisibility of the groundwater resources limited data insufficient knowledge inadequate detection and monitoring systems and absence of integrated institutional social economic technology and ecological frameworks jakeman et al 2016 there is growing concern regarding protection groundwater dependent ecosystem gde to support sustainable water management that includes protection of human flora and fauna nevertheless to protect gdes a comprehensive dataset is required for each location hoyos et al 2016 the conservation of the quality and quantity of qatar s groundwater resources contributes in supporting the implementation of the national development strategy nds goals 2018 2022 that ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all mdps 2017 1 4 water resources evaluation the state of qatar is a semi arid country with no surface water and restricted water resources from little rainfall from may to november mdps 2017 the mean annual rainfall of 80 mm per year while the rate of the evapotranspiration is about 2000 mm y darwish et al 2014 according to fao 2016 the average annual rainfall volume for the gulf cooperation council gcc countries is about 273 9 billion m3 fig 3 a shows the comparison of average annual rainfall volume in the gcc it shows that the average annual rainfall volume for qatar and bahrain are very little of about 0 88 and 0 052 billion m3 respectively whereas the highest percentage of about 90 is from saudi arabia oman make about 7 of the total annual rainfall for the gcc countries followed by uae and kuwait of about 2 and 1 respectively due to the low elevation in the surface of most of the gcc countries and the high evaporation rate it is difficult to directly harvest the surface water runoff therefore the groundwater recharge is very limited fig 3b compares the total actual renewable water resources billion m3 and the annual groundwater withdrawal billion m3 between the gcc countries according to fao 2016 as shown in fig 3b the groundwater withdrawal is very high in all gcc countries and it exceeds the total actual renewable water resources except in oman however oman groundwater withdrawal as a percentage of total actual renewable water resources is high 87 the highest groundwater withdrawal as a percentage of total actual renewable water resources is from the uae of about 2031 followed by kuwait withdrawal of about 2465 then saudi arabia qatar and bahrain of about 943 455 and 219 8 respectively the total annual water resources and use million m3 in all gcc countries for the year 2005 as fao 2016 are shown in fig 3c the highest percentages of the total water resources in the gcc are the surface and groundwater and the highest percentages of water use are for irrigation and livestock this paper emphasizes the importance of water in the gcc countries the lack of freshwater resources is the main obstacle against the sustainable groundwater management due to its larger population along with the adaptation of huge agricultural programs saudi arabia alone consumes about 82 of the total water resources whereas bahrain qatar and kuwait respectively consume less water furthermore fig 2a shows the percentage of the water resources in the state of qatar for the year 2016 the groundwater is the single natural resource of fresh water in qatar as shown in fig 4 a the main source of the total water production is the seawater desalination of about 61 followed by the groundwater abstraction of about 25 the treated wastewater for agriculture and green spaces irrigation of about 13 in addition to 1 water produced by the industrial sector for their own uses such as desalinated water mdps 2017 moreover all wastewater treatment plants in qatar have at least a secondary treatment level the largest operational plant treating 245 500 m³ of wastewater on a daily basis provides tertiary treatment for nitrogen and phosphorus removal by biological treatment using an anaerobic anoxic aerobic method fig 4b presents the percentage of the utilization and discharge of treated sewage effluent tse in the state of qatar for the year 2017 furthermore fig 4c presents the percentage of the abstraction from groundwater basins in the year 2009 the groundwater safe yield is defined as the amount of water which can be withdrawn from a groundwater basin annually without producing an undesirable result such as decreasing groundwater recharge and depletion of aquifers zhou 2009 in the state of qatar the groundwater safe yield is estimated of about 55 8 million m3 per year whereas the current groundwater abstraction reached 250 8 million m3 per year mdps 2017 the annual water deficit is mainly due to the groundwater abstraction which ranged from 97 million m3 per year to 158 million m3 per year during the period 2008 2016 mdps 2015 groundwater abstraction is mostly for agricultural uses about 296 million m3 per year in recent years 92 of total abstracted groundwater current groundwater abstraction greatly exceeds the rate of rainfall induced recharge and this continues to result in declining groundwater levels and degradation of groundwater quality fig 4d presents the percentage of the use of groundwater wells the overall number of wells with various uses is greater than 8509 where 74 of the overall wells are farm well about 6299 wells 15 are municipal wells 3 domestic wells and 8 are industrial wells the over extraction of the qatar s groundwater aquifers can reduce the aquifer levels causing the seawater intrusion thus the groundwater is highly vulnerable to salinization kuiper et al 2015 the freshwater lens in the northcentral part of qatar has decreased in area such that in 1971 it underlay around 15 of the country and it is decreased in 2009 to around 2 of the country the freshwater lens is around 11 of its size in 1971 in the year 2014 the groundwater levels in central and north were insignificantly above sea level however the groundwater level in al mashabiya south of qatar was significantly below sea level mdps 2017 according to fao 1992 and based on the salinity classification there is no well in qatar characterized as non saline on september 2014 whereas on april 1998 the percentage of the non saline wells were 8 the percentage of the little saline wells decreased from 19 to 11 whereas the percentage of the highly or very highly saline wells enhanced from 17 to 20 in 2012 69 of the wells were classified as moderately saline making their waters harmful to sensitive crops causing high soil salinity and increasing the risk of higher sodicity the amount of sodium held in a soil mdps 2017 fig 4e and f represent the classification of the groundwater wells by salinity in 2014 in south and north of qatar al mashabiya using fao salinity classification non saline water 0 7 ds m slightly saline water 0 7 2 ds m moderately saline water 2 10 ds m highly saline 10 25 ds m very highly saline 25 45 and brine 45 ds m 1 ds m 1 mmho cm mdps 2015 according to the studies shown in fig 5 all gcc countries except oman showed moderately saline groundwater as the mean tds in groundwater in higher than 1500 mg l while oman showed slightly saline water according to salinity classification fao 1992 1 5 management of the groundwater quantity groundwater is a highly important natural resource that makes about 30 of the global freshwater and about 99 of the global liquid freshwater parkinson 2010 the worldwide decline of the water table and groundwater storage during the last six months of the twentieth century were correlated with the significant groundwater extractions and climate changes such as the global warming jakeman et al 2016 groundwater supplies significant percentages of freshwater to about 2 billion people it makes about 40 of the world s irrigation water and about 50 of the world s municipal water jakeman et al 2016 food demand requires groundwater as a source for irrigated food production climate changes will enhance global water demand for food production by 70 90 according to that the abstraction of the non renewable groundwater which makes 18 of the world gross irrigation water demand will significantly be increased jakeman et al 2016 in qatar the groundwater safe yield is about 55 8 million m3 per year however the groundwater abstraction is about 250 8 million m3 per year which will deplete aquifers decrease groundwater levels and rise salinity levels ashghal and schlumberger 2013 this is crucial especially with the high economic growth and the population of qatar increases from 600 000 in 2000 to 2 685 000 in 2018 mdps 2018 in 2011 the irrigated agriculture used about 36 2 of the total water resources in qatar where about 43 of the water used for agriculture is used to irrigate fodder crops and about 70 is used for flood irrigation ismail 2015 according to fao 2008 the most commonly used irrigation techniques in qatar for the year 2000 2001 was the surface irrigation according to fao 2008 the surface irrigation such as by basins and furrows which is practiced on about 9707 2 ha while the sprinkler irrigation is practiced on about 1813 ha the dripper is about 868 6 ha and the bubbler is about 546 ha as shown in fig 6 inadequate irrigation management and poor efficiency of irrigation systems are directly related to the groundwater management thus the qatar s government has supported agriculture and irrigation projects the research and studies irrigation with saline water and its economics enhancement the use of tse for forage production mainly rhodes grass to feed livestock and the use of modern greenhouses and irrigation systems to increase the efficiency of the groundwater use hukoomi 2019 in qatar it is estimated that a three time enhancement in domestic livestock herd size would be achieved by more than two time share of tse to agriculture fodder production by 2020 brown et al 2018 artificial recharge of the groundwater aquifers by a treated sewage effluent tse injection recharge wells and recharge from irrigation are about 54 6 of the annual additions to the groundwater reserve whereas 43 4 of the groundwater recharge is from rainfall and about 2 is from inflow from saudi arabia artificial recharge is used to manage groundwater quality and quantity by using infiltration ponds or ditches or injection wells that are used to increase infiltration treat water through soil layers and store groundwater in aquifers it should be considered that treated water based on the drinking water guidelines could be used to direct or indirect recharge while water with degraded quality could be used for infiltration recharge that enhance additional natural treatment however artificial recharge management should search for simple and cheap pre or post water treatment technologies the economic cost plays an important role in artificial recharge management for example infiltration ponds may reduce the costs of recharge water treatment planning and production development and water resources department in kahramaa qatar general electricity and water corporation established restrictions on the future groundwater extraction by decreasing or restricting the use of wells kahramaa 2016 future projects for the groundwater management are stated in kahramaa website such as monitoring groundwater abstraction from farms using advanced well water monitoring system such as online from remote kahramaa 2018a 2018b kahramaa also conducting experiments to re inject the aquifer artificially with desalinated water to meet water demand kahramaa 2016 1 6 management of the groundwater quality groundwater has higher concentration levels of natural elements than surface water because it passes throughout rocks and soil formations dissolving different compounds and minerals caridi et al 2017 since mid of the 20th century an extraordinary change in the world s ecosystems has been noticed due to the natural and anthropogenic activities which rapidly altered the groundwater ecosystem structures and functions the anthropogenic degradation of groundwater ecosystems is firmly correlated to the growing demands for natural resources danielopol and griebler 2008 for example intensive use of water to sustain agriculture industrial growth economic development and human increase as a result the environmental problems related with the groundwater extraction and use are increased hoyos et al 2016 such as the groundwater depletion soil collapse seawater intrusion loss of biodiversity and decreasing of groundwater quality because of the increase in different contaminant such as nutrients salts chemicals and pathogens jakeman et al 2016 griebler and avramov 2015 the climate change such as the decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration have a destructive result in groundwater concentrations due to the decrease in groundwater recharge hoyos et al 2016 in qatar a significant climate warming is detected at an increasing rate during a 30 year from 1983 to 2012 cheng et al 2015 for example a high evapotranspiration of the shallow groundwater may cause to dissolution of mostly halite and gypsum shomar 2015 among other climate process sand dust storms and soil erosion may cause significant changes on the topsoil geochemistry shomar 2015 groundwater salinity is a significant environmental issue salinization mainly happens as a result of intensive groundwater use leading to saline water introduce from deep underlying basement rock from deep buried valleys or from adjacent surface water bodies which also could be aggravated by drought and sea level rise suursoo et al 2017 salinization may increase the total dissolved solids and enhance water rock interaction vinson et al 2013 a strong relationship is exist between elevated levels of naturally occurring element levels with salinity as the hydro geochemical condition has an important function in the distribution of these natural elements in groundwater walsh et al 2014 a significant correlation between the high salinity of soil and metals concentration in the groundwater shomar 2015 for example the study of acosta et al 2011 shows that the soil salinity enhances heavy metal mobilization as shown by pb cd cu and zn release from soil by competition with calcium for sorption sites complexation with chlorides complexation with sulfates and competition with mg and or ca moreover there are anthropogenic sources of the groundwater contamination with metals including leachate from landfill sewage waste disposal agrochemicals and industrial waste or from industrial spills and leaks rehman et al 2017 the water resources are globally threatened by different contaminants from residential municipal commercial industrial and agricultural activities manickum et al 2014 the spillage and leakage of the industrial chemical such as methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe by accident is considered as a serious groundwater contamination jakeman et al 2016 in addition fertilizers pesticides sewage and industrial wastes can be an anthropogenic source of toxic elements in groundwater seyedmohammadi et al 2016 the produced water or coproduced water from oil and gas industries is very salty and contains a mixture of organic and inorganic residues generally in the past this produced water is disposed with or without treatment to the sea or into the deep aquifer shomar 2015 different sever reactions and environmental consequences occur according the physiochemical characteristic of the produced water and aquifer shomar 2015 smedley and kinniburgh 2017 another new anthropogenic source of groundwater contamination is known as the emerging organic contamination eocs such as synthetic micro organic compounds used in healthcare food preservation and pharmaceutical products jakeman et al 2016 the chemical physical and biological characteristics of the aquifers function together and alter groundwater quality jakeman et al 2016 physical processes such as dispersion dilution and filtration chemical processes such as complexation acid base reactions oxidation reduction precipitation solution and adsorption desorption and the biochemical processes such as microbial respiration and cell synthesis influence water quality in aquifers bartram and balance 1996 as an example mccarthy et al 2001 stated that with increasing the temperature and precipitation with climate change the weathering of base cation might increase and change alkalinity of infiltration water increase the temperature might also enhance the growth of microorganism which plays a role in oxidation reduction of elements and alter the quality of groundwater the study of physicochemical characteristics of the carboniferous aquifers demonstrated that hydro geochemical changes are induced from not only natural but also anthropogenic processes galitskaya et al 2013 the prime reason for hydro geochemical changes is the disturbing of hydrodynamic regime such as climate change sea level rise and spatial temporal alteration in precipitation and evapotranspiration and overexploitation of the groundwater jakeman et al 2016 thus local hydrogeological formations must be considered when allowing the maximum production rates as well as for developing a water quality monitoring plan suursoo et al 2017 in addition the groundwater quality is affected by rock interaction within the aquifer and soil above the aquifer shallow coastal aquifers are more vulnerable to be contaminated from surface soil due to the high population densities and relatively short distance needed to reach the water table shomar 2015 kuiper et al 2015 the saq and wajid aquifers in saudi arabia have low salinity of tds lower than 1500 mg l however the carbonate aquifer has the salinity that reaches 15 000 mg l in the east of saudi arabia and toward the arabian gulf rajmohan et al 2019 carbonate aquifers such that in qatar are within the karst formation and depressions generally the karst aquifers are susceptible to pollution sadiq and nasir 2002 anthropogenic contamination from the agricultural effluents and wastewater above very fractures strata could infiltrate contaminant very fast into the aquifer and extend over a large area baalousha 2016 in qatar shallow groundwater with high hydraulic conductivity in the coastal and the north aquifers are of a high vulnerability because of the presence of depression areas consequently as shown in fig 7 the southwest formation is thick formations with thick vadose zone with a clay layer midra shale that block infiltrations of water and lower the vulnerability of the southwest aquifers baalousha 2016 in summary due to the complicated groundwater systems such as recharge discharge and land use the natural and anthropogenic variables such as climate change drought overexploitation and socio economic development could change water quality jakeman et al 2016 there is a worldwide growing concern regarding the quality of the groundwater because of the significances of the water to support people s life the expanding use of the groundwater resources for the agriculture and irrigation purposes requests a careful hydro geochemical evaluation of the groundwater high quality water resources are significant factors to sustain social and economic development manickum et al 2014 in arid countries such as qatar groundwater is the most valuable natural resource hence assessment of the presence of chemicals in groundwater as well as other water quality parameters are vital for sustainable use the levels of potential toxic metals are significant factors affecting groundwater quality yehia et al 2017 an investigation of the potentially harmful elements in groundwater sources is of importance to protect the public health in qatar there is a significant freshwater shortage because of the low annual rainfall in addition to the large amount of groundwater extraction that resulting in severe groundwater deterioration some deterioration of groundwater quality has already been observed in the coastal areas in the north and east sides of qatar due to the current high extractions the expanded use of the groundwater resources for agriculture and irrigation purposes requires a careful hydro geochemical evaluation of the groundwater in the state of qatar in order to develop effective recommendations by the concerned authorities groundwater in the gcc countries is on a limited quantity and mostly poor quality due to the high agricultural and some oil related activities to increase the recovery and the production of oil in 2009 the department of agriculture and water resources dawr in the state of qatar has conducted a national groundwater survey to understand and manage the groundwater resources through collecting information on groundwater occurrence groundwater quality recharge rates and groundwateur use the water quality monitoring results showed that sulfate and boron were higher than the drinking water standard of 250 and 0 5 mg l respectively or irrigation guidelines of 400 and 1 5 mg l respectively moreover fluoride was also found to be above the drinking water guideline of 1 5 mg l a potential source of molybdenum in qatar s groundwater mean 26 9 μg l max 103 μg l could be from the oil and gas processing sector as mainly the local natural gas is a sulfur containing and molybdenum is used as a catalyst in the desulfurization process kuiper et al 2015 qatar plans to produce water for agriculture using energy efficient desalination plants such as using solar energy ismail 2015 similar high concentration of molybdenum of a mean about 98 μg l that explained by authors as oil shale rock in the study area that contains high molybdenum and agricultural activity such as fertilizers kuisi et al 2015 fig 8 shows the mean detected values for boron and lithium in qatar ksa and oman the maximum detected value for boron in ksa groundwater was 3 56 mg l this is explained by infiltrating wastewater that boron is used in soaps and detergents manufacturing also the release of boron from rock water interaction that boron enhancement is occurred by an ion exchange of saline groundwater that decreases ca and increases na as shown by piper and durov diagrams in fig 9 alfy et al 2017 alfy et al 2017 indicated from piper diagram two types of groundwater which are high alkalis with sulfate and chloride as dominant and alkaline water with prevailing sulfate chloride ions while durov diagrams illustrated that about 40 water is rainfall water ca hco3 2 and mgso4 and caso4 which were dissolute of sulfate and carbonate mineral and then mixed with the irrigation return flow and 60 of water is mgcl2 and nacl type which are derived from the dissolution of na mg rich host carbonate rocks these results are supported by the calculated mean values of the mineral phase saturation indices that shows under saturation conditions and consequently increase groundwater salinity with the groundwater path flow from southwest to southeast alfy et al 2017 the study of daniel et al 2017 showed that the average boron in rus formation aquifers is 1 7 mg l and in dammam formation aquifers is 1 04 mg l due to boron desorption from mineral surfaces daniel et al 2017 in kuwait molybdenum was detected below 0 05 mg l however strontium concentration is up to 36 mg l lithium levels of up to 2 mg l and boron was above the irrigation standard al senafy and abraham 2004 the study of the groundwater in al ahssa saudi arabia showed that the groundwater was not contaminated by some chemical elements from anthropogenic sources and it was less than the maximum fao s guidelines except for cu cd fe and pb which were very high furthermore high concentration of cadmium is detected in the uae was about 0 429 mg l which is higher than the who permissible limit khan et al 2019 the results of the groundwater of north west bank in palestine indicated a possible human risk from some chemical elements the study showed that cr mn ni cu mo and al were observed in all samples with co and thallium tl which are significant toxic metals malassa et al 2014 in another study of the groundwater from al minya egypt showed that the levels of cr and pd are higher than the maximum permissible limits suggested by environmental organizations in different countries the authors recommended that the groundwater must not be used for drinking purposes unless it is treated before bassioni et al 2015 various international concentrations of some chemicals present in groundwater are illustrated in table 1 1 7 groundwater treatment qatar has recently undertaken the challenge to become the most self reliant and sustainable country of the middle eastern region since then agriculture and farming industry have been blooming to increase food production in the country today in qatar groundwater is the major renewable water resource comprising around 47 5 million m3 year qatar has been historically relying on groundwater 92 of the total abstraction and treated wastewater tww nearly 35 of the total production in 2015 for agricultural activities groundwater abstraction is 30 times higher than average recharge rates this has led to a dramatic drop in the groundwater table and the increase in salinity previous research has shown that the total dissolved solids tds in qatar s groundwater vary from 1000 to 7500 mg l which can cause reverse osmosis ro membrane scaling and therefore requires expensive pre treatment methods elsaid 2017 our preliminary results have also shown that the quality of the groundwater is declined and several contaminants including toxic metals and metalloids are exceeding permissible limits boron b lithium li and molybdenum mo were found to be 1 28 0 08 and 0 02 mg l respectively these elements are of great concern as they can potentially induce toxicity to agricultural products in addition to metals and metalloids numerous studies have shown the presence of pathogenic microorganisms and other emerging toxic organic chemicals in tww posing significant risk to public and environmental health upon reuse al maadheed et al 2019 shomar and hawari 2017 since tww and groundwater resources are predicted to be the most accessible and available in the near future in qatar it is essential to develop novel treatment approaches that are low cost and environmentally friendly to improve the quality of these water sources in qatar this will help to enhance water security at the national level and resolve the problems of safe tww reuse to yield a groundwater with superior quality and quantity the latter being the prime objective of the qatar national development strategy 2018 2022 this is also in line with our previous studies ashfaq et al 2018 in which driver pressure status impact response dpsir framework was used to analyze water resources in qatar qatar depends 100 on seawater desalination to meet the different needs of water however groundwater is the national strategic reservoir at all levels high priority is given for groundwater management and protection generally groundwater contamination by toxic elements may result from the natural and anthropogenic sources such as the weathering of the earth s surface wastewater used for irrigation land in addition to effluent from city sewage and industrial wastewater assubaie 2015 karnib et al 2014 nriagu et al 2007 from our preliminary study of the physicochemical characteristic of the groundwater in the state of qatar the mean concentration of boron lithium and molybdenum 1 28 0 079 and 0 02 mg l respectively were higher than who limits of drinking purposes in some locations 11 out 35 samples using inverse distance weighted idw parameters of power 3 and maximum neighbors 15 and type of 8 circular sectors generated the lowest root mean square prediction error rmse consequently the best spatial variation output map as shown in fig 6 about 11379 11 km2 of the total area 97 76 was high in boron levels which exceeded 0 5 mg l high boron concentrations are in the coastal area of qatar consequently 2 21 about 258 93 km2 of the total area is within this value mainly in the central area of qatar whereas 34 08 about 3966 88 km2 is higher than the usepa irrigation water guideline of 1 5 mg l singh and verma 2019 as shown in fig 10 about 9710 49 km2 of the total area 83 42 presented high lithium concentrations which exceeded the who drinking water guideline of 0 05 mg l high lithium concentrations are found in the coastal area of qatar consequently 16 56 about 1927 56 km2 of the total area is within the who drinking water guideline mainly in the central area of qatar similarly it was also found that only 0 019 of the total area presented high molybdenum concentrations which exceeded the who drinking water guideline of 0 07 mg l high molybdenum concentrations are in the central of qatar a total of 99 97 about 11635 82 km2 of the area is within the who drinking water guideline whereas 74 36 about 8655 09 km2 is within the usepa irrigation water guideline of 0 01 mg l from previous studies 205 samples of qatar s groundwater an elevated mo mean 26 9 μg l max 103 μg l were observed kuiper et al 2015 groundwater remediation applies various techniques such as chemical remediation which is widely used for controlling large plume contamination xie et al 2018 classified the methods for chemical remediation as chemical precipitation coagulation ion exchange chemical oxidation chemical reduction solidification and stabilization chemical remediation requires high operational and maintenance costs and complicated steps moreover it generates toxic sludge ahmad et al 2011 chemical precipitation is relatively expensive according to chemical agent costs and need safety controls zhang et al 2018 ion exchange resins has a high regenerated efficiency compared with adsorbents hashim et al 2011 ozone is broadly used in chemical oxidation due to its strong oxidation characteristic nevertheless low efficiency of chemical oxidation by ozone in groundwater remediation is due to the low solubility and fast decay rate of ozone in liquid solutions temesgen et al 2017 physicochemical remediation methods of groundwater such membrane and filtration technologies are of different kinds like electro dialytic membrane liquid membrane polymer membrane ultrafiltration membrane nanofiber membrane and reverse osmosis yanga et al 2017 reverse osmosis generates a lot of wasteful water xie et al 2018 filtration and membranes are of high capital and energy costs and there are membrane clogging and sludge discharge complications another treatment of groundwater is biological remediation which is broadly studied and developed due to various factors such as its cost effectiveness with less by product pollutants and long term sustainability lofrano et al 2013 however biological remediation does not have the ability to remove pollutants from deep aquifers and it consider long term remediation methods beside the biosafety issues that need to be developed ayanda 2017 various living organisms such as plants fungi bacteria yeast and algae capture pollutants inside their bodies or enhances removing of pollutants such as biosurfactants there are many benefits of biosorption remediation such as high economic efficiency low chemical or biological sludge and high removal capacity ye et al 2012 conventional adsorbent such as activated carbons are expensive cause environmental problems such as the nonbiodegradable nature of silica gel and their regeneration cost is also high whereas the non conventional adsorbent such as natural material sorbents are of extensive source environmentally friendly and low cost the non conventional adsorbent could be natural minerals like clay cellulosic materials such as agricultural wastes sludge and fly ash from industrial by product guan et al 2016 al ghouti and khan 2018 al ghouti et al 2017 man et al 2015 mohamed et al 2017 mousa and taha 2015 shah et al 2019 babiker et al 2019 mardiah et al 2018 tenev et al 2019 sulyman et al 2018 nam et al 2017 the attractive forces between adsorbed pollutants adsorbates and the adsorbent surface are weak van der waals forces hydrogen bonding and dipole dipole interaction which provides significant desorption al ghouti et al 2010 upon investigating potential treatment options the operation and maintenance costs in addition to removal efficiency should be considered to keep the system running esmeray and aydin 2008 shafiq et al 2018 the adsorption methods are of high efficiency in the removal of different pollutants practical easy simple low cost low chemical and biological sludge and there is a possibility for regeneration of adsorbent and metal recovery dodbiba et al 2015 ahmad et al 2011 huang et al 2016 adsorption is like ion exchange technique but in ion exchange the elements are exchanged with the ion counter ion on the active sites wang et al 2009a b sorption is also assessed as an eco friendly treatment method yang et al 2009 karnib et al 2014 amin et al 2016 various sorbents are used in adsorption processes for water treatment such as the adsorption of metal ions onto adsorbent s surfaces shafiq et al 2018 activated carbon adsorption is a common efficient treatment method li et al 2009 however the activation process is of high cost the adsorption of metals using a coal fired power plant ash as activated carbon was described to be effective various conventional techniques such as advanced oxidation membrane filtration processes reverse osmosis chemical precipitation ion exchange and sorption are used for eliminating metals from water however these methodologies have their advantages and boundaries in application for an example precipitation elements that are soluble in oxidized environment and insoluble in the reduced environment hashim et al 2011 in precipitation the metallic elements become insoluble hydroxides at high ph for further lowering the solubility of elements sulfide or carbonate ions are added to water taylor 2015 however chemical precipitation is inadequate when the metal concentration is low moreover it involves a great amount of chemicals and generating huge amounts of sludge that will necessitate further treatment hashim et al 2011 taylor 2015 the efficiency of the other methodologies in metal removal such as ion exchange and membrane technologies would be high with low chemical consumption and high metal selectivity however the operation costs are expensive ahmad et al 2011 comparatively the metal adsorption on an adsorbent has the benefit over liquid liquid extraction which requires mixing and settling sorption techniques adsorption and ion exchange become one of the mainly applied techniques for removing metals from groundwater huang et al 2016 adsorption method adsorbed elements on the active sites on a porous particle and within the pores of the particles the element is moved from the liquid phase to the surface of a solid and bounds by physical and or chemical reactions barakat 2011 wang et al 2009a b adsorption and ion exchange methods have some limitations such as the great capital and operational costs low adsorption capacity or weak chemical affinity especially at very low metal ion concentration 1 100 mg l resulting in secondary pollution or needing rigorous conditions such as anaerobic and carbonate free hilal et al 2012 however sorption is assessed as one of the best techniques because of the low cost and the simplicity of design and operation particularly with moderate and low contaminant levels huang et al 2016 sorption is also assessed as an eco friendly treatment method yang et al 2009 adsorption technique is economically achievable metal selectivity simple design easy operation and efficient for removing chemical elements karnib et al 2014 amin et al 2016 the adsorption relies on the adsorption of the metal ions from the solutions onto adsorbent s surfaces shafiq et al 2018 metal ions of larger electronegativity would adsorb easily and the metal ions of larger hydrolysis constants would increase adsorptive capacity while metal ions with higher ionic radius have a lower charge density and a lower electrostatic attraction which decreases the adsorption minceva et al 2008 the attractive forces between adsorbate and the solid surface of adsorbent are chemical bonding hydrogen bonding weak van der waals forces dipole dipole interaction dipole induced dipole interaction induced dipole induced dipole interaction and ion exchange ahmad et al 2011 furthermore electrostatic chemical bonding between the adsorbate and adsorbent forms in a monolayer and it is an irreversible process the electrostatic adsorption is a site specific and rely on the high temperature in contrast the physisorption is mono or multilayer reversible process and it decreases with high temperature such that very high temperatures are required for desorption shafiq et al 2018 1 8 groundwater modelling and mapping using gis it should be noted that in groundwater management the objective is not only to monitor and assess a groundwater but more to make use of the information to construct a good decision for example if groundwater monitoring and assessment showed some locations of groundwater contamination then the question is whether to use remediation and what type of remediation to use sethi and molfetta 2019 making decisions will almost always have some extent of risk such as the risk of wrong decision or the risk of selecting an unappropriated treatment technique geographic information system gis is a significant tool for analyzing and visualizing spatially continuous data resulting in reducing the risk of making the wrong decision and supports management and planning processes water resources study is considered the second scientific field that highly apply geo statistics li and heap 2011 in groundwater studies gis is used to investigate sample locations manage the inventory data study the correlation between groundwater quality and different natural or anthropogenic disturbances investigate the vulnerability to contamination estimate groundwater flow and integrate groundwater quality assessments balakrishnan et al 2019 arcgis software has geostatistical analysis which significantly combined geo statistics and gis analysis the geostatistical analysis includes spatial interpolation to estimate or predict an attribute data anywhere from a limited number of observations in addition geostatistical analysis develops spatial interpolation techniques to model the spatial correlation of the variables such as groundwater quality parameters and to investigate the variability in space and time seyedmohammadi et al 2016 to produce high precision maps for groundwater quality variables data needs to be collected from all coordinates within the study area such sample collection for the whole area is not viable due to time money and labor consuming li and heap 2011 groundwater samples are considered data points in gis with some spatial data which depend on polygons these sampled points will be used to predict values of non sampled points within the same field area therefore values to whole polygons will be assigned and a continuous data surface data will be produced surface data represented by a grid that divides the whole site into small cells where each cell assigned a value a high precision of surface data representation depends on the size of the cells such that small cell sizes will produce higher detailed maps than large cell sizes geostatistical analysis incorporates different interpolation methods each has special advantages and gives different output however in some instances methods give the same output surface in other instances the output can be little different spatial interpolation is defined as a process of prediction or estimation values for unsampled locations from the measured points taken at known locations paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 interpolation methods are grouped to deterministic non geostatistical interpolation and geostatistical interpolation deterministic interpolation methods produce surfaces from measured values depend on either the degree of similarity such as on inverse distance weighted idw method or the extent of smoothing such as radial basis functions rbfs method njeban 2018 they do not provide a measure of uncertainty error of the predictions deterministic interpolation methods can be grouped to global interpolation such as global polynomial which calculate predicted values from the entire dataset and local interpolation such as idw and rbfs which predict values of the measured points within neighborhoods paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 geostatistical interpolation contains several methods which are all in the kriging family such as ordinary simple universal probability indicator and disjunctive kriging in addition to cokriging magesh and elango 2019 geostatistical interpolation methods exploit the statistical characteristics of the measured points to create surfaces they include the spatial autocorrelation the statistical relationships between the measured values keranen and kolvoord 2017 geostatistical methods create prediction error associated with the predictions probability and quantile output surfaces an interpolation method that estimates a value that is exactly as the measured point at a sampled location is known as an exact interpolator such as idw and rbfs while the interpolation method that estimates a different value from the measured point is known as an inexact interpolator such as kriging the study of bajjali 2005 comparing idw and kriging methods to model the effect of four artificial recharge dams on the quality of groundwater in oman the authors showed that the kriging and idw produced realistic smooth interpolated surface maps that both interpolated maps show decreases in the salinity in addition in the ksa the study of marko et al 2013 showed that kriging method produced good mapping for water quality parameters using the best semi variogram model based on rmse varies for each water quality parameter an example is shown in fig 11 for electrical conductivity ec and tds interpolated map of western saudi arabia groundwater vulnerability and risk mapping models have three types of techniques of vulnerability assessment maps statistical techniques process based simulation techniques and overlay and index based techniques kumar et al 2015 index based techniques overcome the limitations of the statistical techniques and process based simulation techniques thus it is widely preferred due to its sensitivity and simplicity index based techniques have three types namely parametric non parametric and hybrid models thapa et al 2018 different models are suitable for different geophysical environmental conditions kumar et al 2015 the vulnerability maps produced by all the vulnerability assessment models give an insight about the groundwater contamination and its spatial distribution baalousha 2016 showed that vulnerability mapping using parametric index based techniques is a significant tool for groundwater management and protect aquifers as it can also be used for groundwater monitoring as shown in fig 12 the most widely used drastic model and epik model which is used for groundwater vulnerability mapping of karst aquifers in particular 2 drivers pressures state impact response dpsir framework for groundwater resources management dpsir framework was established by the organization of economic cooperation and development which was evolved from pressure state and response psr model oecd 1993 the driver and impact terms into psr models aid the policy makers to understand cause and effect relationships sun et al 2016 previously the information from the dpsir model was used to analyze water resources of qatar ashfaq et al 2018 to develop an integrated water resources management iwrm systems kagalou et al 2012 integrated coastal zones management iczm and to strategically assess the groundwater resource consumption hazarika and nitivattananon 2016 it is an adaptive management tool used for analyzing environmental issues such as water resources and then developing cause effect relationships between human activities and their environmental impacts thus it facilitates the resource managers hydrologists and policy makers managing the water resources of the region in more effective and sustainable manner the model of dpsir was used to analyze the groundwater resources of qatar fig 13 dpsir is useful in describing the relationships between the sources and consequences of environmental problems generally drivers term includes all the driving forces acting on regional water resource systems it is basically comprised of human needs such as water and food since 92 of the total consumption of the groundwater is done for the agricultural activities therefore it can be classified as the main driver for unsustainable consumption of the groundwater resources of qatar the increase in the agricultural demands due to population and economic growth has further exacerbated the situation in addition climate change such as increase the temperature and the decrease rainfall lead to reduce the groundwater recharge the pressure term of the dpsir represents the human activities undertaken to fulfil needs and demands the increase in the water abstraction greater than the recharge rates of groundwater is leading to unsustainable consumption of water resources and seawater intrusion these human activities will apply pressure on the environment and available resources which will lead to changes in state of the environment hence decrease in water resources as a result of unsustainable consumption deterioration in water quantity and quality can be included under the state term of dpsir these changes in the state of the environmental compartment have resulted in impacts which can include increased the groundwater and soil salinity that deteriorates crops and plants health and productivity due to which the farming industry will be affected and food supply demands would be unfulfilled therefore it is important to devise certain response measures that can help in safeguarding the limited water resources of qatar these measures are also suggested and summarized in fig 13 measures responses are to develop and evaluate water treatment techniques that can help in efficient treatment of groundwater to adopt efficient water irrigation practices to conserve limited water resources to reuse of treated wastewater as an alternative water source for irrigation in order to reduce the pressure on groundwater resources to increase the groundwater storage reservoirs by recharge with treated wastewater or desalinated water and finally to develop of certain water use tariff structures and awareness campaigns for farmers are also advised to ensure efficient utilization of water resources in qatar 3 conclusions in order to achieve a sustainable use and management of the groundwater in qatar supply and demand management practices should be adopted the major groundwater consumption is for the agricultural activities therefore a management plan should focus on these activities for demand management educating the agricultural sector of the consequences of groundwater mining encouraging the use of alternative sources of water and the use of efficient irrigation techniques to lower groundwater extraction are highly recommended for example farmers should be encouraged to use desalinated seawater and treated sewage effluent tse for irrigation rather than abstraction groundwater in addition farmers are encouraged to adopt developed irrigation and agronomic practices such as using water efficient irrigation methods sprinkler and drip irrigation systems and replacing water intensive crops with water efficient crops in addition to developing reliable and cost efficient treatment techniques for low groundwater quality the supply management should include developed monitoring systems managed storage recovery projects and artificial recharge by recharge wells and lagoons using treated wastewater and desalinated seawater recently the full groundwater characterizations and measurement by using advanced technology in data analysis remote sensing and modelling generate significant data and knowledge to decision makers with lower uncertainty to protect the groundwater quality the monitoring strategy should also include vulnerability maps using geostatistical analysis and interpolation models in addition the classification of aquifer systems

12028,the global demand for clean water is growing due to the decreasing of natural renewable water resources with increasing public awareness of the limitations of groundwater resources the needs for protection and remediation of groundwater are gaining significant importance however groundwater is highly depleted due to unsustainable use of groundwater this implies the importance of sustainable use and management of groundwater resources although the groundwater in the state of qatar is not used as drinking water for the public it is widely used for agricultural domestic and recreational projects the high salinity concentrations of the groundwater are due to the stress from agriculture urban development and climate change this paper reviews the hydro geochemical characterizations of qatar s aquifer in addition it highlights the opportunities in the current groundwater management practices to achieve a sustainable groundwater use in qatar such as assessing and monitoring the groundwater quantity and quality in this review article the driver pressure state impact response framework was used to analyze the water resource system in qatar begins by describing the causal chain from driving forces of impacts and finally state the responses as the main driver was the intensive use of groundwater for agriculture irrigation this causes high pressure on groundwater abstraction and deteriorate the state of the groundwater environment in term of quantity and quality which has an impact on the food and water supply demands therefore the final response highlights the need for the enhancing the rainfall infiltration to the aquifers recharging the groundwater aquifers using treated sewage effluent or desalinated water development of groundwater treatment techniques the use of efficient water irrigation practices the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation and the development of certain water use tariff structures and awareness campaigns for farmers graphical abstract

arid country located between latitudes north 24 27 26 10 and longitudes east 50 45 51 40 along the eastern region of the arabian peninsula mdps 2017 the total surface area of qatar is 11 586 km2 it is about 180 km in length and about 90 km in width baalousha 2016 qatar has flat rocky surfaces nevertheless it consists of some hills of 100 m above sea level mdps 2017 the northern region of qatar is relatively low elevations and increases slowly to the west and southwest it is about 103 m above sea level in the southwest to about 6 m below sea level in dukhan sabkha sadiq and nasir 2002 qatar is mostly located over a uniform limestone bed and the oldest exposed rocks are the lower eocene rus formation that contains most of dolomite and limestone with few outcrops of the miocene covering about 8 of the surface area mdps 2015 karst is extensive in qatar it involves depressions sinkholes caves and solution hollows it is associated with the calcareous dolomitic and gypsiferous anhydride horizons of the eocene rus and dammam formations it happened because of preferential dissolution related to the variation in composition between dolomitic calcitic and gypsum rocks sadiq and nasir 2002 1 1 groundwater hydrogeology for the state of qatar the cretaceous age rocks and younger age paleogene age rocks have been investigated for the presence of potable water potable water has been found in eocene age rocks in qatar while brackish groundwater has been found in upper cretaceous age rocks shamrukh et al 2012 in qatar the descriptions of the middle eocene age are dammam formation rus formation while umm er radhuma is the early eocene paleocene age al naimi and mgbeojedo 2018 the dammam formation appears over most of the qatar peninsula the depth of the formation is about 50 m the upper part has limestone called the abarug member underlain by chalky limestone called the umm bab member and the lower part has a massive clayey fossiliferous limestone known as the dukhan member underlain by the midra shale member made up of yellow brown to greenish gray attapulgite shale of low carbonate al saad 2005 the upper part is significantly fractured and has solution cavities alsharhan et al 2001 the rus formation conformably lies under the dammam formation thickness of the rus formation varies from 28 to 44 m in the north and central of qatar and about 110 m in the south west of qatar al yousef 2003 it contains abundant of limestone dolomite anhydride and some marl un escwa bgr 2013 umm er radhuma formation conformably lies under the rus it consists of a dense sequence of about 300 500 m of brownish or grayish limestone that is dolomitic and well porous in the upper part which characterized by the presence of well fractured karstic dolomite and argillaceous in the lower part most wells in the center and south of qatar reportedly tap the rus formation aquifer above the confining gypsum that overlies the umm er radhuma uer formation aquifer in north qatar most wells reportedly tap both the rus and the upper of umm er radhuma formation aquifer while in the abo samra southwest groundwater wells reportedly tap the alat aquifer of the dammam formation and some tap deep older aruma aquifers of aruma formation which come from saudi arabia al yousef 2003 aquifers of dammam formation is unconfined in many areas due to erosion of the confining layers and or the formation of karst structures alsharhan et al 2001 all the fresh ground water in qatar comes from local rainfall except for the confined slightly brackish water near abu samara which receives inflow groundwater from the west saudi arabia un escwa bgr 2013 the higher part of the annual recharge comes from infiltration of runoff that generally collects in surface depressions recharge from rainfall to ground water is estimated to be 25 million m3 per year which is similar to previous studies that estimated 7 to 10 percent of annual rainfall the average annual rainfall volume is about 0 052 billion m3 in north of qatar and 3 5 to 5 percent in south of qatar baalousha et al 2015 1 2 groundwater interactions interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies known as hyporheic and with the surface terrestrial environment are the main groundwater contaminant pathways smith 2005 fig 1 shows the potential contaminating sources from agricultural such as fertilizer urban such as wastewater and industry such as spills and leaks as well as the groundwater interaction with surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes groundwater interactions may affect the transport of contamination within the ecosystem iaea 1999 these interactions can be effective in removing and diluting the contaminant from reaching groundwater iaea 1999 furthermore groundwater flux supplies organic matter and oxygen to stygofauna which live in a groundwater ecosystem humphreys 2008 numerous stygobitic species are relict group of faunas that have diminished from surface systems relict group was once a diverse and widespread group then a significant change happened in their habitat and a subset of the group is survived in confined hospitable habitat danielopol and griebler 2008 they are the engineers of the ecosystems that keep good quality of groundwater for example the burrows the tubificid worms which adjust water flows and re spread the sediment particle are significantly important to maintain the biogeochemical functions porter 2007 another groundwater interaction is the rock water interactions within the aquifer re distribution of elements may occur between the rock and aqueous system due to different mechanisms such as dissolution precipitation sorption and desorption kumar et al 2016 rock water interactions highly influence the quality of the groundwater through dissolution and cation exchange which are the major mechanisms yehia et al 2017 the level of chemicals in a certain groundwater relies on the occurrence of the elements in the aquifer matrix and the mobility and the removal mechanisms from the groundwater by adsorption and precipitation porcelli 2008 therefore the element levels in groundwater are controlled by the aquifer characteristics and the physicochemical characteristic of elements the geological hydrogeological hydrological physical chemical and biological characteristics of the aquifers control element levels and groundwater quality porcelli 2008 jakeman et al 2016 the intrinsic properties of the geologic and hydrogeological formations are aquifer lithology and the aquifer properties which include permeability effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity gradient such as flow directions jakeman et al 2016 danielopol and griebler 2008 here flow directions and velocities are to provide information on rates of water recharge to the subsurface locations and rates of groundwater discharge to surface and in any other features that represent the boundaries of the groundwater flow system jakeman et al 2016 the aquifer hydrological properties include precipitation and its rainfall water chemistry and spatiotemporal evapotranspiration while the aquifers biological properties such as meio and micro organisms and vegetation humphreys 2008 danielopol and griebler 2008 porcelli 2008 rock water interactions depend on mineralogical composition the geochemical hydro chemical and physical conditions within the aquifer matrix such as the weathering of the rock water flow redox conditions and soil ions retention time yehia et al 2017 the physical characteristics of the aquifer that control mineral levels in groundwater are the dense of the aquifer and the temperature of the water baeza et al 2008 the geochemical processes that influence element s behavior include dissolution precipitation and or co precipitation sorption e g ion exchange chemisorption and biologically mediated reactions carvalho et al 2017 mainly high levels of calcium and carbonate ions indicate rock water interaction whereas high levels of na and cl ions indicate evaporation crystallization actions the ion ratio plot helps to identify different processes like ion exchange mineral dissolution and precipitation kanagaraj and elango 2016 the transfer mechanisms of elements in groundwater are controlled by their physicochemical characteristics such as solubility and aqueous speciation precipitation adsorption and desorption capacities volatility carvalho et al 2017 and sensitivity to redox conditions which have a significant effect on the mobility of metals poinssot and geckeis 2012 for example maxwell et al 2015 stated that metals like cadmium cd and zinc zn complexes with organic matter in the soil are not stable while copper cu lead pb or mercury hg complexes are stable nevertheless some studies reported that dissolved organic matter may decrease cd adsorption by the formation of some complexes cd and zn are highly attached to clay minerals carbonates or hydrous oxides cadmium also can be precipitated such as cadmium carbonate hydroxide and phosphate the oxidation states of the toxic ions such as cd2 pb2 hg2 and ag are the most stable oxidation states hashim et al 2011 wongsasuluk et al 2013 the mobility of the metals speciation which may cause leaching to aquifer depends on various reactions in soil environment such as acid base precipitation dissolution oxidation reduction sorption or ion exchange processes fujinaga 2016 knowing that element speciation is the distribution of its chemical forms or species among different phases thus heavy metal forms can be divided into solid species that tend to be less mobile in comparison with colloidal or dissolved forms and the labile complexes that in equilibrium with their environment whereas the inert complexes are not in groundwater management process the knowledge about metals speciation is important to understand their mobility for instance the mobility of the metals that bound to solid can be enhanced by lowering the ph changing the redox increasing the inorganic salts which compete for heterogeneous reactions and dissolved complexation and increasing of natural or synthetic complexing agents bourg 1995 for example santos 2002 studied the spill on groundwater samples that reduce water ph increase of ec and s ca mg and k and heavy metals zn cd pb and cu levels therefore the authors change the ph of the polluted groundwater to the previous values before the spill to change metal speciation of pb and cu to less available forms as they precipitate while zn and cd remain available in mobile forms another example was stated by hashim et al 2011 to reduce cr6 from chromium industry effluents using ferrous sulfate as shown in reaction 1 1 c r a q 6 3 f e a q 2 c r a q 3 3 f e a q 3 then the rapid precipitation could be happening when the ph was near neutral as shown in reaction 2 2 c r 3 3 o h c r o h 3 in addition if excess fe was available then the reaction will be as reaction 3 3 1 x fe 3 xcr 3 3 o h cr x fe 1 x o h 3 s o l i d 1 3 sustainable groundwater management sustainable use and management of groundwater are very important processes for environmental economic technological and social development as shown in fig 2 for example due to the greatly spread technologies of extraction and distribution groundwater beside the low prices of these technologies the quantity and quality of the groundwater are changed so new irrigation technologies should be adopted such as root zone irrigation greenhouse technologies or by saving the water consumptions through the reuse of wastewater in homes brown et al 2018 however the groundwater deterioration was unnoticed for long periods due to the invisibility of the groundwater resources limited data insufficient knowledge inadequate detection and monitoring systems and absence of integrated institutional social economic technology and ecological frameworks jakeman et al 2016 there is growing concern regarding protection groundwater dependent ecosystem gde to support sustainable water management that includes protection of human flora and fauna nevertheless to protect gdes a comprehensive dataset is required for each location hoyos et al 2016 the conservation of the quality and quantity of qatar s groundwater resources contributes in supporting the implementation of the national development strategy nds goals 2018 2022 that ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all mdps 2017 1 4 water resources evaluation the state of qatar is a semi arid country with no surface water and restricted water resources from little rainfall from may to november mdps 2017 the mean annual rainfall of 80 mm per year while the rate of the evapotranspiration is about 2000 mm y darwish et al 2014 according to fao 2016 the average annual rainfall volume for the gulf cooperation council gcc countries is about 273 9 billion m3 fig 3 a shows the comparison of average annual rainfall volume in the gcc it shows that the average annual rainfall volume for qatar and bahrain are very little of about 0 88 and 0 052 billion m3 respectively whereas the highest percentage of about 90 is from saudi arabia oman make about 7 of the total annual rainfall for the gcc countries followed by uae and kuwait of about 2 and 1 respectively due to the low elevation in the surface of most of the gcc countries and the high evaporation rate it is difficult to directly harvest the surface water runoff therefore the groundwater recharge is very limited fig 3b compares the total actual renewable water resources billion m3 and the annual groundwater withdrawal billion m3 between the gcc countries according to fao 2016 as shown in fig 3b the groundwater withdrawal is very high in all gcc countries and it exceeds the total actual renewable water resources except in oman however oman groundwater withdrawal as a percentage of total actual renewable water resources is high 87 the highest groundwater withdrawal as a percentage of total actual renewable water resources is from the uae of about 2031 followed by kuwait withdrawal of about 2465 then saudi arabia qatar and bahrain of about 943 455 and 219 8 respectively the total annual water resources and use million m3 in all gcc countries for the year 2005 as fao 2016 are shown in fig 3c the highest percentages of the total water resources in the gcc are the surface and groundwater and the highest percentages of water use are for irrigation and livestock this paper emphasizes the importance of water in the gcc countries the lack of freshwater resources is the main obstacle against the sustainable groundwater management due to its larger population along with the adaptation of huge agricultural programs saudi arabia alone consumes about 82 of the total water resources whereas bahrain qatar and kuwait respectively consume less water furthermore fig 2a shows the percentage of the water resources in the state of qatar for the year 2016 the groundwater is the single natural resource of fresh water in qatar as shown in fig 4 a the main source of the total water production is the seawater desalination of about 61 followed by the groundwater abstraction of about 25 the treated wastewater for agriculture and green spaces irrigation of about 13 in addition to 1 water produced by the industrial sector for their own uses such as desalinated water mdps 2017 moreover all wastewater treatment plants in qatar have at least a secondary treatment level the largest operational plant treating 245 500 m³ of wastewater on a daily basis provides tertiary treatment for nitrogen and phosphorus removal by biological treatment using an anaerobic anoxic aerobic method fig 4b presents the percentage of the utilization and discharge of treated sewage effluent tse in the state of qatar for the year 2017 furthermore fig 4c presents the percentage of the abstraction from groundwater basins in the year 2009 the groundwater safe yield is defined as the amount of water which can be withdrawn from a groundwater basin annually without producing an undesirable result such as decreasing groundwater recharge and depletion of aquifers zhou 2009 in the state of qatar the groundwater safe yield is estimated of about 55 8 million m3 per year whereas the current groundwater abstraction reached 250 8 million m3 per year mdps 2017 the annual water deficit is mainly due to the groundwater abstraction which ranged from 97 million m3 per year to 158 million m3 per year during the period 2008 2016 mdps 2015 groundwater abstraction is mostly for agricultural uses about 296 million m3 per year in recent years 92 of total abstracted groundwater current groundwater abstraction greatly exceeds the rate of rainfall induced recharge and this continues to result in declining groundwater levels and degradation of groundwater quality fig 4d presents the percentage of the use of groundwater wells the overall number of wells with various uses is greater than 8509 where 74 of the overall wells are farm well about 6299 wells 15 are municipal wells 3 domestic wells and 8 are industrial wells the over extraction of the qatar s groundwater aquifers can reduce the aquifer levels causing the seawater intrusion thus the groundwater is highly vulnerable to salinization kuiper et al 2015 the freshwater lens in the northcentral part of qatar has decreased in area such that in 1971 it underlay around 15 of the country and it is decreased in 2009 to around 2 of the country the freshwater lens is around 11 of its size in 1971 in the year 2014 the groundwater levels in central and north were insignificantly above sea level however the groundwater level in al mashabiya south of qatar was significantly below sea level mdps 2017 according to fao 1992 and based on the salinity classification there is no well in qatar characterized as non saline on september 2014 whereas on april 1998 the percentage of the non saline wells were 8 the percentage of the little saline wells decreased from 19 to 11 whereas the percentage of the highly or very highly saline wells enhanced from 17 to 20 in 2012 69 of the wells were classified as moderately saline making their waters harmful to sensitive crops causing high soil salinity and increasing the risk of higher sodicity the amount of sodium held in a soil mdps 2017 fig 4e and f represent the classification of the groundwater wells by salinity in 2014 in south and north of qatar al mashabiya using fao salinity classification non saline water 0 7 ds m slightly saline water 0 7 2 ds m moderately saline water 2 10 ds m highly saline 10 25 ds m very highly saline 25 45 and brine 45 ds m 1 ds m 1 mmho cm mdps 2015 according to the studies shown in fig 5 all gcc countries except oman showed moderately saline groundwater as the mean tds in groundwater in higher than 1500 mg l while oman showed slightly saline water according to salinity classification fao 1992 1 5 management of the groundwater quantity groundwater is a highly important natural resource that makes about 30 of the global freshwater and about 99 of the global liquid freshwater parkinson 2010 the worldwide decline of the water table and groundwater storage during the last six months of the twentieth century were correlated with the significant groundwater extractions and climate changes such as the global warming jakeman et al 2016 groundwater supplies significant percentages of freshwater to about 2 billion people it makes about 40 of the world s irrigation water and about 50 of the world s municipal water jakeman et al 2016 food demand requires groundwater as a source for irrigated food production climate changes will enhance global water demand for food production by 70 90 according to that the abstraction of the non renewable groundwater which makes 18 of the world gross irrigation water demand will significantly be increased jakeman et al 2016 in qatar the groundwater safe yield is about 55 8 million m3 per year however the groundwater abstraction is about 250 8 million m3 per year which will deplete aquifers decrease groundwater levels and rise salinity levels ashghal and schlumberger 2013 this is crucial especially with the high economic growth and the population of qatar increases from 600 000 in 2000 to 2 685 000 in 2018 mdps 2018 in 2011 the irrigated agriculture used about 36 2 of the total water resources in qatar where about 43 of the water used for agriculture is used to irrigate fodder crops and about 70 is used for flood irrigation ismail 2015 according to fao 2008 the most commonly used irrigation techniques in qatar for the year 2000 2001 was the surface irrigation according to fao 2008 the surface irrigation such as by basins and furrows which is practiced on about 9707 2 ha while the sprinkler irrigation is practiced on about 1813 ha the dripper is about 868 6 ha and the bubbler is about 546 ha as shown in fig 6 inadequate irrigation management and poor efficiency of irrigation systems are directly related to the groundwater management thus the qatar s government has supported agriculture and irrigation projects the research and studies irrigation with saline water and its economics enhancement the use of tse for forage production mainly rhodes grass to feed livestock and the use of modern greenhouses and irrigation systems to increase the efficiency of the groundwater use hukoomi 2019 in qatar it is estimated that a three time enhancement in domestic livestock herd size would be achieved by more than two time share of tse to agriculture fodder production by 2020 brown et al 2018 artificial recharge of the groundwater aquifers by a treated sewage effluent tse injection recharge wells and recharge from irrigation are about 54 6 of the annual additions to the groundwater reserve whereas 43 4 of the groundwater recharge is from rainfall and about 2 is from inflow from saudi arabia artificial recharge is used to manage groundwater quality and quantity by using infiltration ponds or ditches or injection wells that are used to increase infiltration treat water through soil layers and store groundwater in aquifers it should be considered that treated water based on the drinking water guidelines could be used to direct or indirect recharge while water with degraded quality could be used for infiltration recharge that enhance additional natural treatment however artificial recharge management should search for simple and cheap pre or post water treatment technologies the economic cost plays an important role in artificial recharge management for example infiltration ponds may reduce the costs of recharge water treatment planning and production development and water resources department in kahramaa qatar general electricity and water corporation established restrictions on the future groundwater extraction by decreasing or restricting the use of wells kahramaa 2016 future projects for the groundwater management are stated in kahramaa website such as monitoring groundwater abstraction from farms using advanced well water monitoring system such as online from remote kahramaa 2018a 2018b kahramaa also conducting experiments to re inject the aquifer artificially with desalinated water to meet water demand kahramaa 2016 1 6 management of the groundwater quality groundwater has higher concentration levels of natural elements than surface water because it passes throughout rocks and soil formations dissolving different compounds and minerals caridi et al 2017 since mid of the 20th century an extraordinary change in the world s ecosystems has been noticed due to the natural and anthropogenic activities which rapidly altered the groundwater ecosystem structures and functions the anthropogenic degradation of groundwater ecosystems is firmly correlated to the growing demands for natural resources danielopol and griebler 2008 for example intensive use of water to sustain agriculture industrial growth economic development and human increase as a result the environmental problems related with the groundwater extraction and use are increased hoyos et al 2016 such as the groundwater depletion soil collapse seawater intrusion loss of biodiversity and decreasing of groundwater quality because of the increase in different contaminant such as nutrients salts chemicals and pathogens jakeman et al 2016 griebler and avramov 2015 the climate change such as the decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration have a destructive result in groundwater concentrations due to the decrease in groundwater recharge hoyos et al 2016 in qatar a significant climate warming is detected at an increasing rate during a 30 year from 1983 to 2012 cheng et al 2015 for example a high evapotranspiration of the shallow groundwater may cause to dissolution of mostly halite and gypsum shomar 2015 among other climate process sand dust storms and soil erosion may cause significant changes on the topsoil geochemistry shomar 2015 groundwater salinity is a significant environmental issue salinization mainly happens as a result of intensive groundwater use leading to saline water introduce from deep underlying basement rock from deep buried valleys or from adjacent surface water bodies which also could be aggravated by drought and sea level rise suursoo et al 2017 salinization may increase the total dissolved solids and enhance water rock interaction vinson et al 2013 a strong relationship is exist between elevated levels of naturally occurring element levels with salinity as the hydro geochemical condition has an important function in the distribution of these natural elements in groundwater walsh et al 2014 a significant correlation between the high salinity of soil and metals concentration in the groundwater shomar 2015 for example the study of acosta et al 2011 shows that the soil salinity enhances heavy metal mobilization as shown by pb cd cu and zn release from soil by competition with calcium for sorption sites complexation with chlorides complexation with sulfates and competition with mg and or ca moreover there are anthropogenic sources of the groundwater contamination with metals including leachate from landfill sewage waste disposal agrochemicals and industrial waste or from industrial spills and leaks rehman et al 2017 the water resources are globally threatened by different contaminants from residential municipal commercial industrial and agricultural activities manickum et al 2014 the spillage and leakage of the industrial chemical such as methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe by accident is considered as a serious groundwater contamination jakeman et al 2016 in addition fertilizers pesticides sewage and industrial wastes can be an anthropogenic source of toxic elements in groundwater seyedmohammadi et al 2016 the produced water or coproduced water from oil and gas industries is very salty and contains a mixture of organic and inorganic residues generally in the past this produced water is disposed with or without treatment to the sea or into the deep aquifer shomar 2015 different sever reactions and environmental consequences occur according the physiochemical characteristic of the produced water and aquifer shomar 2015 smedley and kinniburgh 2017 another new anthropogenic source of groundwater contamination is known as the emerging organic contamination eocs such as synthetic micro organic compounds used in healthcare food preservation and pharmaceutical products jakeman et al 2016 the chemical physical and biological characteristics of the aquifers function together and alter groundwater quality jakeman et al 2016 physical processes such as dispersion dilution and filtration chemical processes such as complexation acid base reactions oxidation reduction precipitation solution and adsorption desorption and the biochemical processes such as microbial respiration and cell synthesis influence water quality in aquifers bartram and balance 1996 as an example mccarthy et al 2001 stated that with increasing the temperature and precipitation with climate change the weathering of base cation might increase and change alkalinity of infiltration water increase the temperature might also enhance the growth of microorganism which plays a role in oxidation reduction of elements and alter the quality of groundwater the study of physicochemical characteristics of the carboniferous aquifers demonstrated that hydro geochemical changes are induced from not only natural but also anthropogenic processes galitskaya et al 2013 the prime reason for hydro geochemical changes is the disturbing of hydrodynamic regime such as climate change sea level rise and spatial temporal alteration in precipitation and evapotranspiration and overexploitation of the groundwater jakeman et al 2016 thus local hydrogeological formations must be considered when allowing the maximum production rates as well as for developing a water quality monitoring plan suursoo et al 2017 in addition the groundwater quality is affected by rock interaction within the aquifer and soil above the aquifer shallow coastal aquifers are more vulnerable to be contaminated from surface soil due to the high population densities and relatively short distance needed to reach the water table shomar 2015 kuiper et al 2015 the saq and wajid aquifers in saudi arabia have low salinity of tds lower than 1500 mg l however the carbonate aquifer has the salinity that reaches 15 000 mg l in the east of saudi arabia and toward the arabian gulf rajmohan et al 2019 carbonate aquifers such that in qatar are within the karst formation and depressions generally the karst aquifers are susceptible to pollution sadiq and nasir 2002 anthropogenic contamination from the agricultural effluents and wastewater above very fractures strata could infiltrate contaminant very fast into the aquifer and extend over a large area baalousha 2016 in qatar shallow groundwater with high hydraulic conductivity in the coastal and the north aquifers are of a high vulnerability because of the presence of depression areas consequently as shown in fig 7 the southwest formation is thick formations with thick vadose zone with a clay layer midra shale that block infiltrations of water and lower the vulnerability of the southwest aquifers baalousha 2016 in summary due to the complicated groundwater systems such as recharge discharge and land use the natural and anthropogenic variables such as climate change drought overexploitation and socio economic development could change water quality jakeman et al 2016 there is a worldwide growing concern regarding the quality of the groundwater because of the significances of the water to support people s life the expanding use of the groundwater resources for the agriculture and irrigation purposes requests a careful hydro geochemical evaluation of the groundwater high quality water resources are significant factors to sustain social and economic development manickum et al 2014 in arid countries such as qatar groundwater is the most valuable natural resource hence assessment of the presence of chemicals in groundwater as well as other water quality parameters are vital for sustainable use the levels of potential toxic metals are significant factors affecting groundwater quality yehia et al 2017 an investigation of the potentially harmful elements in groundwater sources is of importance to protect the public health in qatar there is a significant freshwater shortage because of the low annual rainfall in addition to the large amount of groundwater extraction that resulting in severe groundwater deterioration some deterioration of groundwater quality has already been observed in the coastal areas in the north and east sides of qatar due to the current high extractions the expanded use of the groundwater resources for agriculture and irrigation purposes requires a careful hydro geochemical evaluation of the groundwater in the state of qatar in order to develop effective recommendations by the concerned authorities groundwater in the gcc countries is on a limited quantity and mostly poor quality due to the high agricultural and some oil related activities to increase the recovery and the production of oil in 2009 the department of agriculture and water resources dawr in the state of qatar has conducted a national groundwater survey to understand and manage the groundwater resources through collecting information on groundwater occurrence groundwater quality recharge rates and groundwateur use the water quality monitoring results showed that sulfate and boron were higher than the drinking water standard of 250 and 0 5 mg l respectively or irrigation guidelines of 400 and 1 5 mg l respectively moreover fluoride was also found to be above the drinking water guideline of 1 5 mg l a potential source of molybdenum in qatar s groundwater mean 26 9 μg l max 103 μg l could be from the oil and gas processing sector as mainly the local natural gas is a sulfur containing and molybdenum is used as a catalyst in the desulfurization process kuiper et al 2015 qatar plans to produce water for agriculture using energy efficient desalination plants such as using solar energy ismail 2015 similar high concentration of molybdenum of a mean about 98 μg l that explained by authors as oil shale rock in the study area that contains high molybdenum and agricultural activity such as fertilizers kuisi et al 2015 fig 8 shows the mean detected values for boron and lithium in qatar ksa and oman the maximum detected value for boron in ksa groundwater was 3 56 mg l this is explained by infiltrating wastewater that boron is used in soaps and detergents manufacturing also the release of boron from rock water interaction that boron enhancement is occurred by an ion exchange of saline groundwater that decreases ca and increases na as shown by piper and durov diagrams in fig 9 alfy et al 2017 alfy et al 2017 indicated from piper diagram two types of groundwater which are high alkalis with sulfate and chloride as dominant and alkaline water with prevailing sulfate chloride ions while durov diagrams illustrated that about 40 water is rainfall water ca hco3 2 and mgso4 and caso4 which were dissolute of sulfate and carbonate mineral and then mixed with the irrigation return flow and 60 of water is mgcl2 and nacl type which are derived from the dissolution of na mg rich host carbonate rocks these results are supported by the calculated mean values of the mineral phase saturation indices that shows under saturation conditions and consequently increase groundwater salinity with the groundwater path flow from southwest to southeast alfy et al 2017 the study of daniel et al 2017 showed that the average boron in rus formation aquifers is 1 7 mg l and in dammam formation aquifers is 1 04 mg l due to boron desorption from mineral surfaces daniel et al 2017 in kuwait molybdenum was detected below 0 05 mg l however strontium concentration is up to 36 mg l lithium levels of up to 2 mg l and boron was above the irrigation standard al senafy and abraham 2004 the study of the groundwater in al ahssa saudi arabia showed that the groundwater was not contaminated by some chemical elements from anthropogenic sources and it was less than the maximum fao s guidelines except for cu cd fe and pb which were very high furthermore high concentration of cadmium is detected in the uae was about 0 429 mg l which is higher than the who permissible limit khan et al 2019 the results of the groundwater of north west bank in palestine indicated a possible human risk from some chemical elements the study showed that cr mn ni cu mo and al were observed in all samples with co and thallium tl which are significant toxic metals malassa et al 2014 in another study of the groundwater from al minya egypt showed that the levels of cr and pd are higher than the maximum permissible limits suggested by environmental organizations in different countries the authors recommended that the groundwater must not be used for drinking purposes unless it is treated before bassioni et al 2015 various international concentrations of some chemicals present in groundwater are illustrated in table 1 1 7 groundwater treatment qatar has recently undertaken the challenge to become the most self reliant and sustainable country of the middle eastern region since then agriculture and farming industry have been blooming to increase food production in the country today in qatar groundwater is the major renewable water resource comprising around 47 5 million m3 year qatar has been historically relying on groundwater 92 of the total abstraction and treated wastewater tww nearly 35 of the total production in 2015 for agricultural activities groundwater abstraction is 30 times higher than average recharge rates this has led to a dramatic drop in the groundwater table and the increase in salinity previous research has shown that the total dissolved solids tds in qatar s groundwater vary from 1000 to 7500 mg l which can cause reverse osmosis ro membrane scaling and therefore requires expensive pre treatment methods elsaid 2017 our preliminary results have also shown that the quality of the groundwater is declined and several contaminants including toxic metals and metalloids are exceeding permissible limits boron b lithium li and molybdenum mo were found to be 1 28 0 08 and 0 02 mg l respectively these elements are of great concern as they can potentially induce toxicity to agricultural products in addition to metals and metalloids numerous studies have shown the presence of pathogenic microorganisms and other emerging toxic organic chemicals in tww posing significant risk to public and environmental health upon reuse al maadheed et al 2019 shomar and hawari 2017 since tww and groundwater resources are predicted to be the most accessible and available in the near future in qatar it is essential to develop novel treatment approaches that are low cost and environmentally friendly to improve the quality of these water sources in qatar this will help to enhance water security at the national level and resolve the problems of safe tww reuse to yield a groundwater with superior quality and quantity the latter being the prime objective of the qatar national development strategy 2018 2022 this is also in line with our previous studies ashfaq et al 2018 in which driver pressure status impact response dpsir framework was used to analyze water resources in qatar qatar depends 100 on seawater desalination to meet the different needs of water however groundwater is the national strategic reservoir at all levels high priority is given for groundwater management and protection generally groundwater contamination by toxic elements may result from the natural and anthropogenic sources such as the weathering of the earth s surface wastewater used for irrigation land in addition to effluent from city sewage and industrial wastewater assubaie 2015 karnib et al 2014 nriagu et al 2007 from our preliminary study of the physicochemical characteristic of the groundwater in the state of qatar the mean concentration of boron lithium and molybdenum 1 28 0 079 and 0 02 mg l respectively were higher than who limits of drinking purposes in some locations 11 out 35 samples using inverse distance weighted idw parameters of power 3 and maximum neighbors 15 and type of 8 circular sectors generated the lowest root mean square prediction error rmse consequently the best spatial variation output map as shown in fig 6 about 11379 11 km2 of the total area 97 76 was high in boron levels which exceeded 0 5 mg l high boron concentrations are in the coastal area of qatar consequently 2 21 about 258 93 km2 of the total area is within this value mainly in the central area of qatar whereas 34 08 about 3966 88 km2 is higher than the usepa irrigation water guideline of 1 5 mg l singh and verma 2019 as shown in fig 10 about 9710 49 km2 of the total area 83 42 presented high lithium concentrations which exceeded the who drinking water guideline of 0 05 mg l high lithium concentrations are found in the coastal area of qatar consequently 16 56 about 1927 56 km2 of the total area is within the who drinking water guideline mainly in the central area of qatar similarly it was also found that only 0 019 of the total area presented high molybdenum concentrations which exceeded the who drinking water guideline of 0 07 mg l high molybdenum concentrations are in the central of qatar a total of 99 97 about 11635 82 km2 of the area is within the who drinking water guideline whereas 74 36 about 8655 09 km2 is within the usepa irrigation water guideline of 0 01 mg l from previous studies 205 samples of qatar s groundwater an elevated mo mean 26 9 μg l max 103 μg l were observed kuiper et al 2015 groundwater remediation applies various techniques such as chemical remediation which is widely used for controlling large plume contamination xie et al 2018 classified the methods for chemical remediation as chemical precipitation coagulation ion exchange chemical oxidation chemical reduction solidification and stabilization chemical remediation requires high operational and maintenance costs and complicated steps moreover it generates toxic sludge ahmad et al 2011 chemical precipitation is relatively expensive according to chemical agent costs and need safety controls zhang et al 2018 ion exchange resins has a high regenerated efficiency compared with adsorbents hashim et al 2011 ozone is broadly used in chemical oxidation due to its strong oxidation characteristic nevertheless low efficiency of chemical oxidation by ozone in groundwater remediation is due to the low solubility and fast decay rate of ozone in liquid solutions temesgen et al 2017 physicochemical remediation methods of groundwater such membrane and filtration technologies are of different kinds like electro dialytic membrane liquid membrane polymer membrane ultrafiltration membrane nanofiber membrane and reverse osmosis yanga et al 2017 reverse osmosis generates a lot of wasteful water xie et al 2018 filtration and membranes are of high capital and energy costs and there are membrane clogging and sludge discharge complications another treatment of groundwater is biological remediation which is broadly studied and developed due to various factors such as its cost effectiveness with less by product pollutants and long term sustainability lofrano et al 2013 however biological remediation does not have the ability to remove pollutants from deep aquifers and it consider long term remediation methods beside the biosafety issues that need to be developed ayanda 2017 various living organisms such as plants fungi bacteria yeast and algae capture pollutants inside their bodies or enhances removing of pollutants such as biosurfactants there are many benefits of biosorption remediation such as high economic efficiency low chemical or biological sludge and high removal capacity ye et al 2012 conventional adsorbent such as activated carbons are expensive cause environmental problems such as the nonbiodegradable nature of silica gel and their regeneration cost is also high whereas the non conventional adsorbent such as natural material sorbents are of extensive source environmentally friendly and low cost the non conventional adsorbent could be natural minerals like clay cellulosic materials such as agricultural wastes sludge and fly ash from industrial by product guan et al 2016 al ghouti and khan 2018 al ghouti et al 2017 man et al 2015 mohamed et al 2017 mousa and taha 2015 shah et al 2019 babiker et al 2019 mardiah et al 2018 tenev et al 2019 sulyman et al 2018 nam et al 2017 the attractive forces between adsorbed pollutants adsorbates and the adsorbent surface are weak van der waals forces hydrogen bonding and dipole dipole interaction which provides significant desorption al ghouti et al 2010 upon investigating potential treatment options the operation and maintenance costs in addition to removal efficiency should be considered to keep the system running esmeray and aydin 2008 shafiq et al 2018 the adsorption methods are of high efficiency in the removal of different pollutants practical easy simple low cost low chemical and biological sludge and there is a possibility for regeneration of adsorbent and metal recovery dodbiba et al 2015 ahmad et al 2011 huang et al 2016 adsorption is like ion exchange technique but in ion exchange the elements are exchanged with the ion counter ion on the active sites wang et al 2009a b sorption is also assessed as an eco friendly treatment method yang et al 2009 karnib et al 2014 amin et al 2016 various sorbents are used in adsorption processes for water treatment such as the adsorption of metal ions onto adsorbent s surfaces shafiq et al 2018 activated carbon adsorption is a common efficient treatment method li et al 2009 however the activation process is of high cost the adsorption of metals using a coal fired power plant ash as activated carbon was described to be effective various conventional techniques such as advanced oxidation membrane filtration processes reverse osmosis chemical precipitation ion exchange and sorption are used for eliminating metals from water however these methodologies have their advantages and boundaries in application for an example precipitation elements that are soluble in oxidized environment and insoluble in the reduced environment hashim et al 2011 in precipitation the metallic elements become insoluble hydroxides at high ph for further lowering the solubility of elements sulfide or carbonate ions are added to water taylor 2015 however chemical precipitation is inadequate when the metal concentration is low moreover it involves a great amount of chemicals and generating huge amounts of sludge that will necessitate further treatment hashim et al 2011 taylor 2015 the efficiency of the other methodologies in metal removal such as ion exchange and membrane technologies would be high with low chemical consumption and high metal selectivity however the operation costs are expensive ahmad et al 2011 comparatively the metal adsorption on an adsorbent has the benefit over liquid liquid extraction which requires mixing and settling sorption techniques adsorption and ion exchange become one of the mainly applied techniques for removing metals from groundwater huang et al 2016 adsorption method adsorbed elements on the active sites on a porous particle and within the pores of the particles the element is moved from the liquid phase to the surface of a solid and bounds by physical and or chemical reactions barakat 2011 wang et al 2009a b adsorption and ion exchange methods have some limitations such as the great capital and operational costs low adsorption capacity or weak chemical affinity especially at very low metal ion concentration 1 100 mg l resulting in secondary pollution or needing rigorous conditions such as anaerobic and carbonate free hilal et al 2012 however sorption is assessed as one of the best techniques because of the low cost and the simplicity of design and operation particularly with moderate and low contaminant levels huang et al 2016 sorption is also assessed as an eco friendly treatment method yang et al 2009 adsorption technique is economically achievable metal selectivity simple design easy operation and efficient for removing chemical elements karnib et al 2014 amin et al 2016 the adsorption relies on the adsorption of the metal ions from the solutions onto adsorbent s surfaces shafiq et al 2018 metal ions of larger electronegativity would adsorb easily and the metal ions of larger hydrolysis constants would increase adsorptive capacity while metal ions with higher ionic radius have a lower charge density and a lower electrostatic attraction which decreases the adsorption minceva et al 2008 the attractive forces between adsorbate and the solid surface of adsorbent are chemical bonding hydrogen bonding weak van der waals forces dipole dipole interaction dipole induced dipole interaction induced dipole induced dipole interaction and ion exchange ahmad et al 2011 furthermore electrostatic chemical bonding between the adsorbate and adsorbent forms in a monolayer and it is an irreversible process the electrostatic adsorption is a site specific and rely on the high temperature in contrast the physisorption is mono or multilayer reversible process and it decreases with high temperature such that very high temperatures are required for desorption shafiq et al 2018 1 8 groundwater modelling and mapping using gis it should be noted that in groundwater management the objective is not only to monitor and assess a groundwater but more to make use of the information to construct a good decision for example if groundwater monitoring and assessment showed some locations of groundwater contamination then the question is whether to use remediation and what type of remediation to use sethi and molfetta 2019 making decisions will almost always have some extent of risk such as the risk of wrong decision or the risk of selecting an unappropriated treatment technique geographic information system gis is a significant tool for analyzing and visualizing spatially continuous data resulting in reducing the risk of making the wrong decision and supports management and planning processes water resources study is considered the second scientific field that highly apply geo statistics li and heap 2011 in groundwater studies gis is used to investigate sample locations manage the inventory data study the correlation between groundwater quality and different natural or anthropogenic disturbances investigate the vulnerability to contamination estimate groundwater flow and integrate groundwater quality assessments balakrishnan et al 2019 arcgis software has geostatistical analysis which significantly combined geo statistics and gis analysis the geostatistical analysis includes spatial interpolation to estimate or predict an attribute data anywhere from a limited number of observations in addition geostatistical analysis develops spatial interpolation techniques to model the spatial correlation of the variables such as groundwater quality parameters and to investigate the variability in space and time seyedmohammadi et al 2016 to produce high precision maps for groundwater quality variables data needs to be collected from all coordinates within the study area such sample collection for the whole area is not viable due to time money and labor consuming li and heap 2011 groundwater samples are considered data points in gis with some spatial data which depend on polygons these sampled points will be used to predict values of non sampled points within the same field area therefore values to whole polygons will be assigned and a continuous data surface data will be produced surface data represented by a grid that divides the whole site into small cells where each cell assigned a value a high precision of surface data representation depends on the size of the cells such that small cell sizes will produce higher detailed maps than large cell sizes geostatistical analysis incorporates different interpolation methods each has special advantages and gives different output however in some instances methods give the same output surface in other instances the output can be little different spatial interpolation is defined as a process of prediction or estimation values for unsampled locations from the measured points taken at known locations paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 interpolation methods are grouped to deterministic non geostatistical interpolation and geostatistical interpolation deterministic interpolation methods produce surfaces from measured values depend on either the degree of similarity such as on inverse distance weighted idw method or the extent of smoothing such as radial basis functions rbfs method njeban 2018 they do not provide a measure of uncertainty error of the predictions deterministic interpolation methods can be grouped to global interpolation such as global polynomial which calculate predicted values from the entire dataset and local interpolation such as idw and rbfs which predict values of the measured points within neighborhoods paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 geostatistical interpolation contains several methods which are all in the kriging family such as ordinary simple universal probability indicator and disjunctive kriging in addition to cokriging magesh and elango 2019 geostatistical interpolation methods exploit the statistical characteristics of the measured points to create surfaces they include the spatial autocorrelation the statistical relationships between the measured values keranen and kolvoord 2017 geostatistical methods create prediction error associated with the predictions probability and quantile output surfaces an interpolation method that estimates a value that is exactly as the measured point at a sampled location is known as an exact interpolator such as idw and rbfs while the interpolation method that estimates a different value from the measured point is known as an inexact interpolator such as kriging the study of bajjali 2005 comparing idw and kriging methods to model the effect of four artificial recharge dams on the quality of groundwater in oman the authors showed that the kriging and idw produced realistic smooth interpolated surface maps that both interpolated maps show decreases in the salinity in addition in the ksa the study of marko et al 2013 showed that kriging method produced good mapping for water quality parameters using the best semi variogram model based on rmse varies for each water quality parameter an example is shown in fig 11 for electrical conductivity ec and tds interpolated map of western saudi arabia groundwater vulnerability and risk mapping models have three types of techniques of vulnerability assessment maps statistical techniques process based simulation techniques and overlay and index based techniques kumar et al 2015 index based techniques overcome the limitations of the statistical techniques and process based simulation techniques thus it is widely preferred due to its sensitivity and simplicity index based techniques have three types namely parametric non parametric and hybrid models thapa et al 2018 different models are suitable for different geophysical environmental conditions kumar et al 2015 the vulnerability maps produced by all the vulnerability assessment models give an insight about the groundwater contamination and its spatial distribution baalousha 2016 showed that vulnerability mapping using parametric index based techniques is a significant tool for groundwater management and protect aquifers as it can also be used for groundwater monitoring as shown in fig 12 the most widely used drastic model and epik model which is used for groundwater vulnerability mapping of karst aquifers in particular 2 drivers pressures state impact response dpsir framework for groundwater resources management dpsir framework was established by the organization of economic cooperation and development which was evolved from pressure state and response psr model oecd 1993 the driver and impact terms into psr models aid the policy makers to understand cause and effect relationships sun et al 2016 previously the information from the dpsir model was used to analyze water resources of qatar ashfaq et al 2018 to develop an integrated water resources management iwrm systems kagalou et al 2012 integrated coastal zones management iczm and to strategically assess the groundwater resource consumption hazarika and nitivattananon 2016 it is an adaptive management tool used for analyzing environmental issues such as water resources and then developing cause effect relationships between human activities and their environmental impacts thus it facilitates the resource managers hydrologists and policy makers managing the water resources of the region in more effective and sustainable manner the model of dpsir was used to analyze the groundwater resources of qatar fig 13 dpsir is useful in describing the relationships between the sources and consequences of environmental problems generally drivers term includes all the driving forces acting on regional water resource systems it is basically comprised of human needs such as water and food since 92 of the total consumption of the groundwater is done for the agricultural activities therefore it can be classified as the main driver for unsustainable consumption of the groundwater resources of qatar the increase in the agricultural demands due to population and economic growth has further exacerbated the situation in addition climate change such as increase the temperature and the decrease rainfall lead to reduce the groundwater recharge the pressure term of the dpsir represents the human activities undertaken to fulfil needs and demands the increase in the water abstraction greater than the recharge rates of groundwater is leading to unsustainable consumption of water resources and seawater intrusion these human activities will apply pressure on the environment and available resources which will lead to changes in state of the environment hence decrease in water resources as a result of unsustainable consumption deterioration in water quantity and quality can be included under the state term of dpsir these changes in the state of the environmental compartment have resulted in impacts which can include increased the groundwater and soil salinity that deteriorates crops and plants health and productivity due to which the farming industry will be affected and food supply demands would be unfulfilled therefore it is important to devise certain response measures that can help in safeguarding the limited water resources of qatar these measures are also suggested and summarized in fig 13 measures responses are to develop and evaluate water treatment techniques that can help in efficient treatment of groundwater to adopt efficient water irrigation practices to conserve limited water resources to reuse of treated wastewater as an alternative water source for irrigation in order to reduce the pressure on groundwater resources to increase the groundwater storage reservoirs by recharge with treated wastewater or desalinated water and finally to develop of certain water use tariff structures and awareness campaigns for farmers are also advised to ensure efficient utilization of water resources in qatar 3 conclusions in order to achieve a sustainable use and management of the groundwater in qatar supply and demand management practices should be adopted the major groundwater consumption is for the agricultural activities therefore a management plan should focus on these activities for demand management educating the agricultural sector of the consequences of groundwater mining encouraging the use of alternative sources of water and the use of efficient irrigation techniques to lower groundwater extraction are highly recommended for example farmers should be encouraged to use desalinated seawater and treated sewage effluent tse for irrigation rather than abstraction groundwater in addition farmers are encouraged to adopt developed irrigation and agronomic practices such as using water efficient irrigation methods sprinkler and drip irrigation systems and replacing water intensive crops with water efficient crops in addition to developing reliable and cost efficient treatment techniques for low groundwater quality the supply management should include developed monitoring systems managed storage recovery projects and artificial recharge by recharge wells and lagoons using treated wastewater and desalinated seawater recently the full groundwater characterizations and measurement by using advanced technology in data analysis remote sensing and modelling generate significant data and knowledge to decision makers with lower uncertainty to protect the groundwater quality the monitoring strategy should also include vulnerability maps using geostatistical analysis and interpolation models in addition the classification of aquifer systems should be developed declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

12029,the present study targets of tiznit region s water which is a semi arid zone located in south western part of moroccan anti atlas coordinates 29 42 00 north 9 43 37 west it is concerned with the geochemical study since the quality of groundwater depends on several factors such as recharge water quality geology grade of chemical weathering of the different rock types a water rock interface emenike et al 2017 aly 2015 this study was carried out using the representations of piper and schoeller berkaloff of water in this region at the first moment the predominant facies are calcium and magnesium hyperchloride and calcium bicarbonate with a slight preponderance of this latter the thermodynamic characterization of the scaling power of water in this region is then given at a second moment this study was carried out using the method of legrand poirier leroy lpl legrand et al 1981 belattar et al 2018 and allowed us to determine the position of water in tiznit region with respect to the calco carbonic equilibrium and to conclude that this water is calcifying type graphical abstract water geochemical facies piper schoeller berkaloff lpl scaling power calcifying tiznit image 1 keywords water geochemical facies piper schoeller berkaloff lpl scaling power calcifying tiznit 1 introduction groundwater is a vital source for local populations in tiznit region because it contributes immensely to drinking water supply of the region s populations and to irrigation of many palm groves the lack of information regarding aquifer recharge could affect the quantity and the quality during improper use and mismanagement of these resources the region of tiznit knows a poor quality of water this region consumes surface water from youssef ibn tachfine dam and water of tiznit aquifer exploitation of this water requires their transport from their production points in pvc pipes ductile iron and cement a scaling process is initiated in the pipes and the clogging rate may exceed in some cases 60 after a few years of operation lédion 2010 the formation of scale on surfaces in contact with water depends on several factors such as the hardness of water and its temperature belattar et al 2020 this phenomenon of scaling in water pipes is therefore a common and unavoidable problem in areas that exploit groundwater ben aazza et al 2017 hadfi et al 2018 rezaei et al 2020 the deposit of encrusted tartar at the level of the pipes in contact with water has the consequences of numerous technical problems economic and environmental opinion of anses referral no 2015 sa 0228 all these observations prompted us at the first moment to evaluate the quality of water extracted from each sampling point by following the physicochemical parameters of this water by standard methods volumetric mohr method gravimetric colorimetric uv visible spectrophotometry and atomic absorption and using the geochemical representations of piper and schoeller berkaloff andolssi et al 2015 carrera villacrés et al 2016 taouil et al 2018 this geochemical study concerned 60 water samples taken from the various sampling points during the monitoring of the physico chemical quality of tiznit region s water we are interested in a second moment to thermodynamic study of scaling power of this water using the legrand poirier leroy lpl method legrand et al 1981 this study was carried out for the four water samples representative of the different sampling points 2 materials and methods 2 1 physico chemical characterization of water to characterize water in tiznit region we have selected five sampling points representatives of the different types of water distributed in this region which is reggada s water spring water r mixture of reggada s water spring and dam water r b talaint well water t youssef ibn tachfine dam water b and the reservoir of water water r b t or it is reggada s water spring mix with those of youssef ibn tachfine dam and talaint well to take into account the variation of the physico chemical quality of water of this region according to the seasons at the consumer level we then monitored the quality of this water for 1 year at one sampling per month and per sampling point we analyzed 60 water samples from this region the physicochemical characterization of water samples was carried out using standard methods national health foundation 2013 gholizadeha et al 2017 the calcium magnesium and hydrogen carbonate ions were determined by the volumetric method the chloride sulphate nh4 and no3 ions were respectively determined by the mohr method the gravimetric colorimetric and uv visible spectrophotometry method type suv 6705 the determination of na and k ion concentrations is performed by atomic absorption using atomic absorption spectrophotometer type perkinelmer aanalyst 400 2 2 geochemical characterization of water to understand the phenomenon of scaling and to have an indication of the qualitative aspect of water in this region we will exploit the results of the chemical analysis by looking at the piper diagram and that of schoeller berkaloff the main tool used is the diagrams software created by roland simler of the hydrogeology laboratory of avignon cécile potot 2011 which is software of hydrochemistry in free distribution facilitating the exploitation of water analysis these functions are varied and completed 2 2 1 piper s method the piper diagram represents the chemical facies of a set of water samples it is composed of two triangles to represent the cationic facies and the anionic facies and a rhombus frédérick 2005 rezaei et al 2020 synthesizing the global facies the piper diagram thus makes it possible to establish a quantitative classification of water and can highlight facies that reflect the morphology of the lands that this water pass through it 2 2 2 schoeller berkaloff method the schoeller berkaloff diagram is used to represent the chemical facies of several water samples each sample is represented by a broken line the concentration of each chemical element is represented by a vertical line in logarithmic scale bakalowicz 1979 bret 2002 the broken line is formed by connecting all the points representing the different chemical elements when the lines intersect a change of chemical facies is highlighted according to schoeller berkaloff water can be classified according to the importance of anions first and then cations 2 3 thermodynamic study using this technique we have determined the position of drinking water in tiznit region with respect to the calco carbonic equilibrium thus we have determined using legrand poirier leroy diagrams software lplwin the ionic balance the supersaturation coefficient β and the potential quantity of calcium carbonate δcaco3 in mg l that must precipitate a liter of water to reach equilibrium 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical and geochemical analyzes of water of tiznit region 3 1 1 physico chemical parameters of selected water the results obtained from physico chemical analyzes of drinking water in tiznit region show that the sodium content varies between 48 46 mg l and 103 42 mg l recorded respectively for water of talaint reservoir and talaint well potassium levels range from 1 81 mg l to 2 60 mg l during water quality monitoring period for this region potability standards provide a maximum allowable concentration that ranges between 10 and 100 mg l for sodium and up to 12 mg l for potassium there is slightly elevated sodium content in talaint well which may be due to the leaching of geological formations containing sodium chloride belghiti et al 2013 according to moroccan drinking standards the maximum permissible value for ammonium ion is 0 5 mg l in all our samples this cation was not detected the chloride anion content is very high in tallaint water t and reservoir samples r b t and reaches 333 70 mg l and 223 65 mg l respectively the maximum allowable value for chlorides according to the national standard for drinking water is 750 mg l and therefore water samples of tiznit region comply with national standards for this parameter nm 03 7 001 2006 it should be noted that the world health organization recommends a guideline value of 250 mg l for taste considerations and corrosion risks hafid et al 2013 since nitrate anions are the most dominant nitrogenous in rivers and groundwater their levels in the studied water remain below the value allowed by moroccan standards 50 mg l sulphate anions are presented in water studied at variable levels that remain below 31 67 mg l observed in talaint well examination of the results of physicochemical analysis shows that with the exception of youssef ibn tachfine s water dam the calcium and magnesium contents of this different water are very high and consequently this water are very hard the hydrotimetric th titer fig 1 is 64 f 640 mg l caco3 the total alkalinity titer tac fig 1 varies between 19 5 and 82 f the th and tac values of tis water is very important for precipitating calcium carbonate which is salt with very low solubility which causes the most common scaling problems tabouche and achour 2004 hadda 2009 gholizadeha et al 2017 3 1 2 geochemical analysis of the selected water piper s method the geochemical study according to the piper representation involved 60 samples of water taken from the various sampling points during the monitoring of the physicochemical quality in tiznit region s water fig 2 illustrates the representation of the results of chemical analysis of drinking water from tiznit region in the piper diagram we observe that carbonate bicarbonate is the dominant anion for about 80 of the analyzed water samples the remaining 20 of the samples show dominance of the chloride anion 75 of water samples analyzed do not have a dominant cation while the remaining 25 of the samples show a dominance of the calcium cations the facies of this water samples are calcium bicarbonate probably due to shale formations in south of tiznit region drouiche et al 2019 rezaei et al 2020 with a slight tendency towards chlorinated and sulphated calcium facies these facies are probably due to the leaching of agricultural land following the infiltration of water to the aquifer groundwater quality is influenced by many factors such as seepage chemistry topography reservoir rock geology emenike et al 2017 aly 2015 and anthropogenic factors frape et al 1984 drouiche et al 2019 schoeller berkaloff method the graphic representation of schoeller berkaloff also concerned the 60 samples of water taken during the monitoring of the physico chemical quality of tiznit region s water these representations are shown in figs 3 and 4 water sample of ain reggada spring water r and water mixture of this spring with youssef ibn tachfine s water dam water r b have maximums at the poles ca2 mg2 cl and hco3 co3 2 water collected in talaint well water t and talaint reservoirs water r b t have maximums at the poles ca2 cl and hco3 co3 2 the graphical representation of the results of the chemical water analysis of tiznit region according to schoeller berkaloff s semi logarithmic diagram confirms the chemical facies already highlighted by the graphical representation of piper namely calcium bicarbonate with a slight tendency towards the chlorinated facies note that these geochemical processes are responsible for the seasonal and spatial variation in the chemical quality of groundwater belkhiri et al 2010 drouiche et al 2019 3 2 thermodynamic study of scaling power of selected water concerning the thermodynamic study of scaling power in tiznit region s water we have selected four representative samples of this water the physicochemical characteristics of the selected water are given in table 1 using legrand poirier leroy s software lplwin we have determined the supersaturation coefficient and the amount of calcium carbonate that a liter of water has to precipitate to reach equilibrium belattar et al 2020 this study was done for the four selected water samples the analysis was performed on the nine chemical elements assayed mg2 ca2 na k hco3 cl no3 so4 2 and the parameters measured in the field ph χ table 2 gives the results of the thermodynamic predictions of the selected water of tiznit region it is noted that the ionic balance for each point is between 1 and 5 which confirms the accuracy of the chemical analysis methods used elfil 2005 according to legrand et al the ionic balance must be less than 5 belattar et al 2019 gholizadeha et al 2017 ferguson 2015 the supersaturation coefficient is denoted β limit indeed the thermodynamic equilibrium can be largely exceeded β 1 without there being this massive precipitation songa et al 2020 we can then consider that the water is under metastable conditions it is noted that the amount of calcium carbonate that must be dissolved to reach equilibrium varies between 5 63 and 56 44 mg l 4 conclusion the physicochemical characterization of drinking water in tiznit region has made it possible with the exception of youssef ibn tachfine s water dam to conclude that these water samples are of hard types the representations of piper and schoeller berkaloff showed the predominance of calcium bicarbonate with a slight tendency towards chloridic facies the thermodynamic study by the legrand poirier leroy lpl method was carried out for four water samples representative of the different sampling points and allowed us to determine the position of this water with respect to the calco carbonic equilibrium and conclude that this water was found calcifying as a logical follow up to this work methods to fight against this phenomenon of scaling by water of tiznit region must be
