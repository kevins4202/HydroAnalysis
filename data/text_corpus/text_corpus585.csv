2925,although wheel tracks cover only a small portion of the surface of agricultural fields their effect on surface runoff and sediment transport is substantial wheel tracks change the microrelief of the soil surface and influence how the surface is further altered by rainfall and runoff this study presents a plot scale microrelief analysis of a tilled surface with wheel tracks under simulated rainfall digital elevation models of the microrelief with 1 cm spatial resolution were obtained using the structure from motion method the random roughness the structural connectivity and functional connectivity were calculated for before rainfall and after rainfall soil surface conditions the experiments were carried out on inclined freshly tilled plots 8 m long 2 m wide the wheel tracks were created by four passages of machinery in the slope direction swt and in the contour line direction cwt the experiments were compared to reference plots without wheel tracks nwt the wheel tracks increase water and sediment connectivity if they are oriented in slope wise direction microrelief analysis shows that swt drains water from the surrounding soil the soil surface adjacent to swt can also become more connected with the wheel track due to changes in microrelief introduced by rainfall and runoff the calculated higher connectivity in the swt plot corresponded to the measured increased sediment loads this suggests faster overland flow and therefore shorter flow pathways on the soil surface microrelief cwt leads to a decrease in the water and sediment connectivity compared to the nwt and swt plots although the surface runoff can overflow the cwt the network of flow paths results in decreased flow velocity and a slower sediment transport rate however the cwt effect is not permanent and declines as the wheel tracks become silted with the deposited sediment it is shown that detailed microrelief data provide relevant information for a study of the changes in flow routing in a tilled agricultural field with the presence of a wheel track swt accelerates the runoff and especially the sediment transport during a rainfall event the hydraulic connection between the wheel track and the surrounding soil increases dramatically cwt reduces the surface runoff and also the sediment transport in the long term rainfall events and surface runoff alter the microrelief connectivity causing the soil surface to be more hydraulically connected irrespective of the wheel track orientation this study demonstrates the effect of wheel tracks on water and sediment transport the results draw attention to the importance of appropriate soil protection measures as a bare unprotected surface microrelief exposed to rainfall leads to increased sediment connectivity keywords surface runoff erosion microrelief connectivity structure from motion agricultural fields data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface runoff and sediment transport from arable land have a negative impact on soil quality boardman and poesen 2006 and this is nowadays the topic of international strategies such as the eu soil strategy for 2030 ec com 2021 699 european commission 2021 surface runoff and sediment transport also have negative off site effects such as damage to the infrastructure boardman et al 2019 siltation of streams and water reservoirs e g krása et al 2005 loss of nutrients from fields e g probst 1985 and eutrophication of water bodies e g carpenter et al 1998 although water driven nutrient transport can also occur in shallow groundwater flow outram et al 2016 or sometimes via percolation through tile drainage systems deasy et al 2009 surface runoff prevails in agricultural fields e g carpenter et al 1998 direct wheel track compaction has been recognized as a cause of soil degradation because compaction changes the physical and infiltration properties of soils lal 1999 lindstrom et al 1981 topsoil saturated hydraulic conductivity may decrease up to fourfold in the upper soil horizon mainly due to the decrease in macroporosity under direct compaction e g kim et al 2010 the effect of compaction was observed mainly in the top 10 cm of the soil profile where the proportion of elongated pores decreased rapidly pagliai et al 2003 compacted soil in wheel tracks also exhibits reduced near saturated hydraulic conductivity due to the reduction in water conducting pores e g ankeny et al 1990 seehusen et al 2019 daraghmeh et al 2008 pagliai et al 2004 the decrease in porosity and the increase in bulk density is in fact an effect of rearrangements of the soil particles which lead to an increased risk of runoff and erosion events gps tracking shows that most parts of agricultural fields are crossed by a tractor at least once in the course of a single season and some of the wheel tracks remain undisrupted on the soil surface until the harvest kroulík et al 2011 augustin et al 2020 wheel tracks act as preferential pathways for surface runoff and sediment transport if they are oriented in the direction of the slope heathwaite et al 2005 silgram et al 2010 ryken et al 2018 and they act as an obstacle if they are oriented in the contour line direction heathwaite et al 2005 moreover the flow direction introduced by the tillage exceeded the flow direction based on topography on 50 to 100 of the catchment area souchere et al 1998 takken et al 2001 couturier et al 2013 thus wheeltrack induced compaction may affect runoff sediment transport and therefore soil quality on the scale of whole parcels or fields soil surface conditions leys et al 2007 and soil surface microtopography are among key factors in the generation of surface runoff e g jester and klik 2005 prosdocimi et al 2017 the microtopography greatly influences runoff generation since it affects whether and when the water from a local microrelief depression starts to contribute to runoff antoine et al 2009 due to the microtopography the overland flow may become channeled and may therefore gain higher velocity and initiate soil erosion chen et al 2013 gómez and nearing 2005 infiltration is also affected by microtopography soil sealing in a microrelief depression may reduce infiltration while higher soil water content may increase infiltration thompson et al 2010 surface roughness is often used to characterize the conditions of the soil surface taconet and ciarletti 2007 croft et al 2013 moreno et al 2008 luo et al 2018 surface roughness has been investigated to estimate surface depression storage onstad 1984 to partition rainfall water into infiltration and surface runoff zhao et al 2018 and to estimate runoff and sediment flow rates luo et al 2018 the initial roughness affects the runoff and the development of rill flow gómez and nearing 2005 in addition temporal changes in surface roughness have been observed due to the impact of raindrops zobeck and onstad 1987 bauer et al 2015 surface runoff zobeck and onstad 1987 or during infiltration onstad et al 1984 random roughness rr decreases in wheel tracks but this effect is diminished when no till management systems are used lindstrom et al 1981 the principle of hydrological connectivity is often used to explore the linkages of various water pools within the landscape pringle 2003 bracken et al 2013 hydrological connectivity can be divided into concepts of structural topography based connectivity and functional process based connectivity bracken et al 2013 which have been utilized in several studies antoine et al 2009 angermann et al 2017 jackisch et al 2017 rinderer et al 2018 structural connectivity was developed from dem based topographic indices some of the most popular indices are the topography wetness index beven and kirkby 1979 and modifications to it stieglitz et al 2003 hjerdt et al 2004 a combination of indices can also be used to identify the spill and fill runoff behavior on hillslopes hopp and mcdonnell 2009 furthermore the index of connectivity ic was developed to assess the connectivity of water flow and sediment within a landscape borselli et al 2008 although ic was initially created with a focus on steep alpine valleys and alluvial fans it has been successfully used to identify sediment source areas at submeter scales with a digital elevation model dem of 1 cm resolution e g prosdocimi et al 2017 small scale functional connectivity is often studied through observations of the temporal changes in the inter dis connection between soil surface depressions darboux et al 2002a b antoine et al 2009 or roughness organization smith 2014 antoine et al 2009 introduced the relative surface connection function rscf which was a metric of surface depression connectivity rscf was then used in other studies to observe surface runoff connectivity antoine et al 2011 yang and chu 2013 peñuela et al 2016 appels et al 2011 appels et al 2016 rscf expresses how much runoff is generated for a given fullness of the surface depressions storage sds and therefore how well the surface depressions are hydraulically connected at each moment in practical terms the connectivity is assessed with a curve function relating the surface runoff and the actual filled surface depression storage the gradient of the curve expresses how quickly the surface depressions are being connected and surface runoff is being generated a large gradient indicates threshold behavior the abrupt connection of a major surface storage to the outlet a low gradient indicates a more complex surface where e g multiple surface depressions need to be filled and connected with each other to produce runoff a horizontal shift of the curve indicates an increase or a decrease in the surface depression storage during the experiment according to peñuela et al 2016 the soil surface changes during a rainfall event and the subsequent response of the surface runoff are well explained by rscf moreover rscf can be used to improve the simple stepwise surface retention parameter of large scale hydrological models as the runoff is usually observed before all depressions get filled antoine et al 2009 antoine et al 2011 peñuela et al 2016 as has been shown above a vast amount of research has been done on analyzing the microrelief in terms of roughness or connectivity however there is a lack of studies on combinations of macro features and micro features e g wheel tracks and the soil surface microrelief in this study we present a microrelief analysis of soil surfaces with the presence of wheel tracks and we relate the analysis to direct measurements of the surface runoff and the sediment transport during a rainfall simulation the goal is to better understand the dynamics of the initiation of surface runoff soil erosion and rainfall runoff induced surface changes on a bare tilled soil the structure from motion sfm photogrammetric method was used to capture the soil surface changes caused by rainfall and by surface runoff westoby et al 2012 and to calculate the connectivity indices prosdocimi et al 2017 wolstenholme et al 2020 the specific objectives of our investigation are 1 to assess the changes in microtopography caused by a wheel track and by rainfall and surface runoff utilizing high resolution microrelief dems and several indicators surface roughness structural and functional connectivity and 2 to confront the observed changes in microrelief with the measured surface runoff and sediment transport on the plot scale 2 materials and methods a series of artificial rainfall experiments were performed to study the effect of the presence and the orientation of wheel tracks on surface runoff and sediment transport in general we utilized two approaches direct monitoring of surface runoff and sediment transport and microrelief analysis utilizing random roughness and two connectivity indicators in total five experiments were performed in two independent experimental campaigns the first experimental campaign was undertaken in september 2018 referred to as campaign no 1 and the second was undertaken in june 2019 referred to as campaign no 2 two wheel track orientations were examined slope wise direction swt and contour line direction cwt the experimental setup was complemented by reference experiments on plots with no wheel tracks nwt as shown in fig 1 2 1 location the experiments were carried out on experimental plots located on an agricultural site ca 30 km to the north west of prague czech republic at coordinates 50 13 2 0 n 14 1 2 2 e fig 1 the site is at an elevation of 310 315 m a s l the annual mean temperature is 8 c and the mean annual precipitation is 500 mm the climate is characterized as humid continental the site is located at the edge of larger fields on which winter wheat and rapeseed were planted in both experimental years the topsoil is classified as loam with 18 3 of clay 33 8 of silt and 47 9 of sand the soils are developed on sedimentary rocks consisting of claystone sandstone and arkose and are classified as cambisols according to the world reference base for soil resources the content of organic matter is in the range of 1 2 1 5 in the topsoil 2 2 experimental plots all experimental plots had an inclination of approximately 10 and were 8 m long and 2 m wide the size of the plot was adopted from kavka et al 2018 the length of the plot is long enough to study the erosion process while preserving uniform rainfall distribution along the plot the each experimental plot was delineated by metal plates inserted ca 5 cm into the soil the seedbed was prepared and the wheel tracks were created several days before the experiments for both campaigns no precipitation was recorded between the preparation of the topsoil and the experiments 2 2 1 campaign no 1 campaign no 1 was conducted on september 18th and 19th 2018 the soil was stubble tilled to a depth of 12 15 cm using a stubble cultivator one day before the experiment september 17th the wheel tracks were created directly after cultivation by four passages of a new holland t7 185 tractor and a trailed cultivator in non operational state with two axles driving in the uphill direction in the case of the swt plot fig 1 four passages were chosen in order to produce a representative wheel rut without making an unrealistic number of passages it has been shown that most compaction changes occur within the first 4 5 passages botta et al 2009 the pressure in the tires of the tractor was 1 4 bar front wheels and 2 0 bar rear wheels the tire pressure of the stubble cultivator was 3 5 bar the total weight of the machinery was 8 5 t 6 t for the tractor and 2 5 t for the stubble cultivator the axle loads of the tractor were 2 8 t on the front axle and 3 2 t on the rear axle the axle load of the stubble cultivator was 1 25 t the maximum static ground pressure of a single tire was estimated using the soilphysics r package de lima et al 2021 to be 201 kpa for the front axle of the tractor and 272 kpa for the rear axle and 439 kpa for the stubble cultivator the initial topsoil water conditions were very dry with a volumetric water content of 0 10 0 01 cm3 cm 3 the topsoil bulk density was 1 31 0 09 g cm 3 the topsoil bulk density of the soil in the wheel track was 1 40 0 1 g cm 3 the mean wheel rut depth was 3 9 0 9 cm during campaign no 1 only the slope wise wt was set 2 2 2 campaign no 2 experimental campaign no 2 was conducted between july 18th and 20th 2019 the vegetation cover mainly atriplex galium aparine and common grasses that had grown on the experimental plot location during the vegetation season was mulched on june 14th 2019 dry vegetation residues were manually removed from the soil surface one day before the experiment the topsoil was stubble tilled to a depth of 12 15 cm the wheel tracks were prepared after stubble tillage with a new holland t8040 tractor and a full 12 m3 water tank trailer with 4 wheels driving 4 times in downhill direction fig 1 the tire pressure of the tractor was 1 4 bar front wheels and 1 6 bar rear wheels the pressure of each water tanker tire was 3 5 bar the total weight of the machinery was about 22 t 8 t for new holland t8040 2 t for the water tank and 12 t for the water the axle load of the tractor was 3 8 t for the front axle and 4 2 t for the rear axle the axle load of the water tank was approximately 7 t the maximum static single tire ground pressure was estimated to be 206 kpa for the front wheels of the tractor 236 kpa for the rear wheels of the tractor and 455 kpa for the wheels of the water tank also using the soil physics r package de lima et al 2021 the initial soil water conditions were very dry with a volumetric water content around 0 13 0 02 cm3 cm 3 the topsoil bulk density was 1 19 0 37 g cm 3 the topsoil bulk density of the soil in the wheel track was 1 35 0 03 g cm 3 the mean wheel rut depth at the swt plot was 3 5 1 9 cm both slope direction and contour line direction wheel tracks were set up for campaign no 2 2 3 surface microtopography observation the soil surface morphology was monitored by means of the structure from motion close range photogrammetry method images for photogrammetry were taken before and after each experiment using a sony a6000 mirrorless camera with an aps c size sensor with resolution of 24 mpx and equipped with a standard sony 16 50 mm zoom lens fixed on 16 mm each measurement consisted of approximately 40 60 images taken in two rows from a distance of 1 5 m photogrammetry reference targets were installed on the perimeter of each plot at a mutual distance of 1 to 2 m the targets were inserted into the soil with 15 cm long screws which held the targets in a steady position during the experiment a small number of targets were also attached to the collection flume the gps positions of all targets were measured with vertical and horizontal accuracy of 15 mm images with geo referenced targets were processed in agisoft photoscan professional 1 4 2 build 6205 agisoft llc the output was an orthophoto and a digital elevation model dem of the surface with a 1 mm ground sampling distance 10 mm spatial resolution in and y direction was used for all analyses this resolution was optimized in order to maintain high detail in the analysis while providing reasonably low noise in the data and reasonable time for computation the dems were rotated to reorient the plots into the north direction in order to simplify further image processing the coordinates are shown in fig 1 the installed sensors which partially covered the soil surface were clipped off the images and the missing areas were linearly interpolated in the south north direction the raster cells on the sides of the plots were raised by 0 2 m to form a boundary for the drainage area which was in reality maintained by metal sheets during the experiment the raster was further resampled to 10 mm spatial resolution in order to reduce the noise of the initial point clouds and to decrease the size of the data for further processing and computation 2 4 rainfall simulation artificial rainfall with intensity of 27 4 7 8 mm h 1 measured with multiple totalizators throughout the simulation and mean rainfall kinetic energy of 127 j m 2 h 1 measured on site with a disdrometer was set for all experiments the target value of the rainfall was 30 mm h 1 which is the 5 year return period rainfall at the location kašpar et al 2021 the duration of the experiments varied between 290 min and 433 min funnels were installed at the bottom of each experimental plot to collect the surface runoff and sediment for a detailed description of the simulator see kavka et al 2018 on the swt plots two flumes were installed in order to separate the water flowing through the wheel track and the water flowing from the adjacent tilled soil surface fig 1 the runoff sampling interval was prolonged during the experiment starting at 2 5 min and reaching 20 min when the runoff was approaching a steady state 2 5 microrelief analysis 2 5 1 roughness the random roughness rr was calculated from the before and after rainfall dems for each plot in addition the wheel tracks and the adjacent tilled soil surface were analyzed separately for the swt and cwt plots the rr calculation was adopted according to taconet and ciarletti 2007 the dems were leveled in order to exclude the plot slope from the rr calculation subsequently rr was calculated as the standard deviation of the leveled pixel elevations rr 1 n 1 m 1 i n j m z i j z 2 1 where z stands for detrended surface elevation and z stands for the mean of the detrended surface elevation n and m stand for the number of rows and columns in the rotated raster 2 5 2 structural connectivity analysis the normalized downslope distance ndd was used to assess the structural connectivity our approach was inspired by the index of connectivity borselli et al 2008 where the downslope distance is a part of the algorithm the downslope distance algorithm provided by the taudem terrain analysis tool tarboton 2015 was used to perform the analysis as a result of the algorithm a raster was created in which each cell contains a flow path length l d to the bottom of the plot at this stage the downslope distance is dependent on the organization of the surface topography and the position of a given cell along the slope to compensate the cell position along the plot we normalized the pathway length l d by the shortest length to the bottom of the plot l s as is shown in fig 2 ndd is therefore calculated as ndd l d l s the ndd expresses the bulk complexity of the surface topography from the perspective of the moving particle the trajectory of which is being tracked 2 5 3 functional connectivity analysis functional connectivity refers to a concept presented by darboux et al 2002b and by antoine et al 2009 where a surface runoff model is used to assess the connectivity for this task we utilized the smoderp2d 1 1 the model is provided in the public repository at the github online platform github com storm fsv cvut smoderp2d or on the web of the department of landscape water conservation faculty of civil engineering ctu prague storm fsv cvut cz smoderp physically based episodic distributed hydrological model dostál et al 2000 kavka et al 2022 landa et al 2019 the results of the model were interpreted as the relationship between the runoff coefficient and the soil surface depressions storage the interpretation of this relationship is shown in fig 3 the initial surface depression storage is calculated by subtracting sink less 2 2 sinks in dem are cells surrounded by cells with higher elevation the sink less dem is a raster where such cells are artificially removed dem from the original dem sink less dem is calculated with the fill tool of the spatial analysis extension of esri arcmap 10 7 software it was assumed that the plots have uniform soil hydraulic properties over the plot which does not change in time all plots were modeled with uniform rainfall intensity which corresponded to the rainfall intensity used during the rainfall experiments a more detailed description of the model and its infiltration and flow routing parameters is provided in appendix table 1 2 6 laboratory analysis the undisturbed soil samples were gravimetrically analyzed to obtain the initial soil water content and the bulk density the sediment concentration in the runoff was obtained by filtering the sampled water the paper filters with the trapped soil were oven dried at 105 c to obtain the mass of the eroded soil 2 7 statistical analysis the significance of the wheel track effect on surface runoff and sediment transport was analyzed using the student t test in particular the non zero difference among the plots was tested the test was performed with r software r core team 2018 3 results 3 1 random roughness random roughness rr is shown in fig 4 a for all experimental plots for before and after rainfall soil surface conditions the rr of all the plots varies between 0 015 m and 0 045 m the rr was larger in campaign no 2 than in campaign no 1 for all plots a decline in roughness after rainfall was observed for all experiments although the decrease in rr at the nwt plot in campaign no 1 was only minor the most pronounced drop in rr was observed for the nwt plot in campaign no 1 the cwt plot exhibited the largest rr fig 4b shows the random roughness rr in the wheel track in wt and of the surrounding soil out wt for the swt plot similarly in fig 4a the roughness decreased in all cases after the rainfall the rr in fig 4b shows a more pronounced decrease in campaign no 1 especially in wt although a larger decrease was recorded the overall roughness was lower in campaign no 2 the decrease in rr was more pronounced between the campaigns than between the in wt and the out wt 3 2 structural connectivity histograms of the normalized downslope distance ndd with the before rainfall and after rainfall soil surface conditions and the flow accumulation raster are shown in fig 5 ndd was used to assess the tortuosity of the downslope pathway which serves as a measure of the structural connectivity the flow accumulation rasters are displayed in order to diagnose the shifts in the ndd histograms the before rainfall soil surface conditions of the cwt exhibited the highest ndd pixel count in the interval of 1 5 1 6 on the ntw plots the highest ndd pixel count was observed in the interval 1 3 1 5 fig 5ac plot during both campaigns the swt plots exhibited bimodal ndd distribution before the rainfall fig 5bd the first peak in the pixel count of the histogram lay in the ndd interval of 1 1 1 2 for the first campaign and in the interval of 1 2 1 3 for the second campaign the second peak was observed in the ndd intervals of 1 5 1 7 and 1 5 1 6 during the first and second campaigns the ndd pixel count increased in the interval 1 4 2 while it decreased in intervals 1 1 4 at the cwt plot after rainfall after rainfall the nwt plots exhibited an increase in the ndd pixel count especially in intervals 1 5 1 6 and 1 4 1 6 for campaigns no 1 and no 2 respectively the ndd pixel count showed a different change at the swt plots during each campaign fig 5bd the after rainfall two peak histogram became a single peak histogram due to the higher ndd values in intervals 1 3 1 5 and 1 7 2 0 during campaign no 1 however two peaks in the ndd histogram were preserved after the rainfall during campaign no 2 although the first peak shifted into the ndd interval 1 3 1 4 the flow accumulation showed the main pathways and their complexity fig 5 two peaks of the before rainfall ndd histogram at the swt no 2 plot clearly correspond to two main flow pathways identified in the flow accumulation raster one in wheel tracks and one in the surrounding soil surface fig 5b the same situation applied for the swt plot for the before rainfall conditions as shown in fig 5d the flow accumulation in campaign no 1 showed that the flow paths were diverted from the tilled surface into the wheel track which corresponds to a shift from unimodal to bimodal distribution in the ndd histograms two main flow paths were preserved in the after rainfall conditions in campaign no 2 which again corresponded to bimodal ndd after rainfall distribution the ndd changes in the nwt plot could not be explained by a visual inspection of the flow accumulation raster on the cwt plot fig 5e a change in the flow path can be observed in the lower right corner which was disconnected from the upper right corner of the plot after the rainfall and was shifted to the left part of the plot 3 3 functional connectivity the functional connectivity for before rainfall and after rainfall surface conditions is shown in fig 4 cwt plot no 2 exhibited the largest storage capacity for the before rainfall conditions fig 4a and swt exhibited the lowest storage capacity during both campaigns fig 4ab nwt exhibited almost identical curves for the before rainfall conditions during both campaigns fig 4a however the curves deviated from each other for the after rainfall conditions the depression storage capacity was smaller for the after rainfall conditions than for the before rainfall conditions with the exception of reference plot nwt in campaign no 1 where the storage capacities remained very similar for the before rainfall conditions the swt plots of both campaigns and nwt plot no 2 exhibited a sharp increase in the runoff coefficient when a certain threshold was reached fig 4a for nwt plot no 1 and nwt plot no 2 this increase occurred later when more of the surface depression storage sds was filled this effect was most pronounced for the cwt plot where the runoff coefficient increased more gradually while the sds was being filled threshold behavior was observed to some extent in all the experiments only a small portion of sds had to be filled before runoff was initiated on the swt plots in both before and after rainfall surface conditions up to 0 2 mm of sds had to be filled at the nwt plots before the rainfall soil surface conditions initiated runoff interestingly the cwt plot started to contribute to runoff for smaller filled sds than the nwt plots for before rainfall soil surface conditions fig 4a but the increase in runoff was more gradual on the cwt plot as described above 3 4 runoff and sediment transport a summary of the direct measurements of surface runoff and sediment transport is shown in table 1 the duration of the experiments differed and therefore the total rainfall depth and the total rainfall kinetic also differed the largest rainfall amount was received by swt plot no 2 and the smallest rainfall amount was received by swt plot no 1 during campaign no 1 surface runoff from the swt plot occurred only in the wheel track while the surrounding tilled soil exhibited no runoff at the bottom of the plot the surface runoff from the swt plot during campaign no 2 was drained through both parts of the plot the wheel track and the surrounding tilled surface however the runoff from the surrounding tilled surface exhibited a much longer time lag 102 min an almost 7 5 times lower cumulative runoff and a 31 3 times lower total soil loss compared to the wheel track see table 1 no evidence of rill erosion was observed the runoff and the sediment flow development differed among the wheel track variants as shown in fig 7 and table 2 a neither the surface runoff nor the sediment flow rate reached steady rates during the experiments similar values were reached on the swt plots and on the nwt plot of the second campaign however the time lag was different fig 7a the nwt plots during campaign no 2 exhibited significantly higher surface runoff when the lag time was excluded from the analysis table 2 nwt plot no 1 exhibited similar behavior as the cwt plot in campaign no 2 apart from the runoff time lag the sediment flow rate fig 7b varied during the experiments the swt plots exhibited significantly greater sediment flow rates than the other plots with the peak at about one third of the duration of the experiment table 2b the rising limb of the sediment mass plot increased more gradually during campaign no 1 than during campaign no 2 the sediment flow rate on the nwt plots exhibited similar behavior during both campaigns with the exception of the time lag the sediment flow rate was significantly higher during campaign no 1 table 2b the curves of the sediment flow rate on both nwt plots were generally flat which contrasts with the surface runoff where the rate increased throughout the experiment the cwt plot showed the smallest surface runoff table 2a and the slowest increase in surface runoff fig 7a the surface runoff increased throughout the experiment while the sediment flow stabilized at a constant value fig 7b all experiments where the sediment flow reached a quasi steady value exhibited a decrease in the concentration of the suspended sediment see fig 7c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the wheel track on connectivity the presence of a wheel track can be recognized by the structural connectivity the greatest structural connectivity was observed on both swt plots while the lowest structural connectivity was observed on the cwt plot the reference nwt plot exhibited medium values of structural connectivity these findings indicate more prolonged paths of water and sediment on the cwt plot than on the nwt and swt plots as a consequence water moves more slowly along the plot this results in a decreased erosion rate the two peaks of ndd in the swt plots indicate that the higher connectivity is caused solely by the wheel track while structural connectivity expresses the connectivity among individual surface micro depressions functional connectivity indicates the connectivity between the soil surface and the outlet as expected functional connectivity showed that the swt plots exhibited the highest connectivity while the cwt plots exhibited the lowest connectivity according to antoine et al 2009 the functional connectivity distinguished well between the microrelief composed of isolated craters and the microrelief composed of well connected valleys this suggests that the cwt surface contains more distinct depressions than the nwt and swt plots the swt plot on the other hand consists of better connected pathways ultimately the soil flattened by the wheel tracks the tire patterns are smaller than the roughness of the surrounding soil creates well connected pathways and therefore increases the connectivity in all cases in our study the tillage was in the direction of the contour lines in the case of the swt plot this created an unusual situation of contour tillage and slope wheel tracks which however can occur with conventional soil tillage technology or on headlands kroulík et al 2011 the number of passages affects the depth of the wheel rut it has been shown that the first few passages have the most significant effect and that the wheel rut depth becomes less reduced after 5 passages botta et al 2009 also the soil moisture conditions play a significant role however due to the low soil water content at the beginning of both campaigns we would not expect substantial deepening of the wheel track if more passages were performed the shape and the pattern of the surface depressions would also vary for different tillage types tarolli et al 2019 the length of the plot also affects connectivity a longer plot decreases the runoff due to infiltration and increases sediment transport due to increased velocity of the flow jourgholami and labelle 2020 a longer plot may have a higher effect on swt than other wheel track configurations due to its connectivity and low infiltration capacity 4 2 impact of rainfall and runoff on connectivity the surface runoff evolution mechanism is shown in fig 8 the surface runoff was formed by consecutive filling and spilling of water from the surface depressions once water reaches the wheel track it cannot return to the surrounding soil and is preferentially transported downwards on the swt plot this contrasts with the cwt orientation which acts as a large surface depression that releases runoff only when full during runoff the soil surface depressions gradually become filled with the mobilized sediment this was observed during the experiment and is also indicated by the decrease in rr and by the changes in soil surface storage after rainfall this kind of behavior has been reported in the literature zobeck and onstad 1987 withers et al 2006 peñuela et al 2016 when a surface depression is overtopped a small neck is eroded at the boundary of the depression accelerating both the runoff and the sediment transport in the experiment no rill flow developed similarly to helming et al 1998 small necks acted as short bypasses connecting the depressions with each other and with the wheel track although this effect was clear during the experiment it could only be observed qualitatively in the flow accumulation raster on the cwt plots where several flow paths from the wheel tracks emerged after rainfall fig 5 the random roughness decreased due to the mechanical impact of the rain drops and the subsequent consolidation of the surface which flattened the ridges formed by the tillage bauer et al 2015 zobeck and onstad 1987 laburda et al 2021 it has been shown in the literature that the surface roughness decreases exponentially with increasing rainfall amount or with rainfall kinetic energy zobeck and onstad 1987 this exponential relationship was shown to be consistent among multiple tillage systems guzha 2004 however simulated rainfall usually has an unnatural raindrop distribution and the relation between random roughness and kinetic energy may therefore be altered in this study the same rainfall intensity and the same rainfall simulator and therefore the same drop size distribution was used only the rainfall depth and the kinetic energy differed among individual experiments however the extent to which the rr decreased did not coincide with the total rainfall depth the surface runoff also detached soil particles from ridges and some of the particles later settled into the surface depressions this led to decreasing surface roughness fig 4 and to decreasing depression storage capacity fig 6 smoothing of the surface is clearly visible during all experiments irrespective of the presence or the orientation of the wheel track the roughness also decreased in the wheel track fig 4 which confirms that there are both soil erosion and soil deposition in the compacted wheel tracks as has also been reported by basher and ross 2001 this suggests that the wheel tracks also contribute to the overall changes in connectivity soil swelling may also affect the surface changes however it is hard to distinguish between soil swelling and consolidation even if high temporal resolution microrelief data are available eltner et al 2017 after the rainfall the structural connectivity decreased at all plots this non intuitive surface development was most pronounced on the cwt plot fig 5e the before rainfall soil surface structures created only by tillage and by the passage of the tractor exhibited clear flow paths oriented downslope arrows in fig 5e the impact of rainfall and runoff may create new flow paths via soil erosion causing the water pathways to increase in length the structural connectivity provides valuable information when observing surface changes within the plot this was most visible on the swt plots where the flux between wheel track and surrounding soil was identified even when the wheel track is initially disconnected from the surrounding soil the rainfall and runoff may form a connection in this study this happened in one of the swt scenarios this contrasting behavior may have been caused by the different tire tread for campaigns 1 and 2 since the passage of the tractor was in opposite directions and was followed by the trailed cultivator the rainfall depth was higher during campaign no 2 when the two flow paths remained unchanged and the wheel rut was slightly shallower during the second campaign two reasons can be put forward for the different outcome possibly affecting the ndd i the different tire tread pattern and ii the different lowering of the wheel track below the surrounding soil surface both of these effects potentially made the runoff more prone to create flow paths towards the wheel tracks as seen in fig 5b these flow paths influenced the reorganization of the soil surrounding the wheel tracks an increase in connectivity and a decrease in soil surface storage capacity was observed in the functional connectivity for all plots the surface storage capacity was observed to decrease after successive rainfall events as has also been shown by darboux et al 2002a however the decrease in surface storage capacity cannot alone explain the increase in connectivity a crucial factor is the spatial organization and the connectivity of the depressions similar trends were also observed by peñuela et al 2016 under natural rainfall the storage depression capacity decreased rapidly after rainfall started whereas the shift in the connectivity threshold first rose and then in some cases decreased peñuela et al 2016 the role of a wheel track in increased functional connectivity unlike in the case of structural connectivity is not shown explicitly swt plot no 1 exhibited higher functional connectivity than swt plot no 2 in both before rainfall and after rainfall soil surface conditions however a connection between the wheel track and the surrounding soil may not always be created even after a substantial rainfall 4 3 comparison between connectivity indices and direct measurements the direct measurements of runoff and sediment flow were in agreement with both functional connectivity and structural connectivity both the runoff amount and the sediment transport followed the order swt nwt cwt differences between the plots were more pronounced when comparing the sediment fluxes than when comparing the runoff this is most likely caused by the flow velocity in the wheel track which increased the carrying capacity of the water wheel track compaction in the direction of the slope increased the runoff coefficient and the sediment transport across all studied tillage systems ryken et al 2018 the direction of a passing tractor upslope or downslope and of course the initial moisture conditions alter the surface runoff and the transport of sediments withers et al 2006 an accumulation of eroded soil was observed in wider wheel tracks while narrower wheel tracks exhibited greater transport capacity due to the acceleration of the surface runoff eltner et al 2017 this indicates the importance of the flow velocity the same behavior swt nwt cwt order in surface runoff and sediment transport was observed with structural and functional surface connectivity for the before rainfall soil surface conditions the structural connectivity agreed in terms of the connection of the wheel track and the surrounding soil as shown on the swt plot fig 5bd the bi modal to uni modal shift of the ndd distribution corresponded to the swt measurement where runoff and sediment transport only occurred in the wheel track table 1 the ndd distribution during campaign no 2 remained bimodal for before rainfall and after rainfall soil surface conditions this corresponded to the direct measurements where the runoff was active on both halves of the plot no effect of different tire treads could be observed in the functional connectivity analysis the swc and nwt plots exhibited similar maximum runoff in direct monitoring and also similar functional connectivity during campaign no 2 figs 6 and 7 the nwt in campaign no 2 even exhibited significantly higher runoff compared to all other plots if the lag time was not taken into consideration in the analysis table 2 this was caused by the rapid increase in runoff after it started after some time the runoff reached values similar to those on both swt plots fig 7 this increase may have been caused by the sudden connection of a few larger puddles to the outlet the effect of the prolonged time lag in the nwt plot was not shown by functional connectivity however the largest time lag observed in the nwt plot during campaign no 1 was well reproduced for the after rainfall situation in agreement with functional connectivity the largest sediment flow rate occurred during campaign no 2 but it was not reproduced by functional connectivity however functional connectivity was based on the model where erosion was not implemented and correspondence with the sediment transport was therefore not to be expected 4 4 comparison of structural and functional connectivity metrics structural connectivity allows the soil surface to be observed in greater detail this index was able to identify multiple major flow paths which reached the bottom of the plot via identification of uni modal or bimodal distribution structural connectivity in combination with the flow accumulation algorithm was able to assess which part of the plot was connected to disconnected from the drainage flow paths i e the inter plot connectivity in contrast to the functional connectivity the structural connectivity did not incorporate soil surface depressions in the analysis since sink less rem was used to generate the data functional connectivity takes the dynamics of the processes into consideration the changes in surface depression storage can therefore be incorporated although the functional connectivity used in this study does not require physically based derivation of the parameters or any calibration or validation procedure additional information about soil properties and rainfall data are needed in order to derive the functional connectivity in addition it is much more time demanding to run an overland flow model in 10 mm raster resolution than to compute the structural connectivity 5 conclusion surface runoff sediment transport and hydrological connectivity have been analyzed on freshly tilled topsoil with wheel tracks by means of microrelief dem indices two wheel track orientations were studied slope wise direction swt and contour lines wise direction cwt the experimental setup was supplemented by a reference plot with no wheel track nwt the experimental plots were subjected to artificial rainfall and dems were obtained using the structure from motion method before rainfall and after rainfall the surface microrelief was assessed with random roughness and two measures of connectivity were compared with direct runoff monitoring of surface runoff and sediment transport the slope wise wheel tracks swt increased the sediment and the hydraulic connectivity of the surface the wheel track itself exhibited high structural connectivity and low roughness when oriented slope wise this led to an increase in runoff and sediment transport the soil surface adjacent to swt is connected to the wheel track only to some extent as shown by the direct measurements the plot with a contour line wheel track cwt exhibited even higher roughness and lower connectivity than the plot without wheel tracks a temporal decrease in random roughness and in soil surface storage was observed on all plots as the effect of the kinetic energy of the rainfall and runoff the surface became more connected during the rainfall as shown via the functional connectivity metric the microtopography affects the water and sediment routing on the soil surface the wheel tracks depending on orientation increase or decrease the water and sediment fluxes during runoff events the effect of swt after a rainfall runoff event is pronounced since it becomes more connected to the surrounding soil on the other hand the effect of cwt decreases in time as it becomes filled with deposited sediment the emergent connection of swt to the surrounding soil needs to be further studied however our study has shown that microrelief analysis may be used to identify this process the conditions under which the cwt effect is diminished also need to be further studied sudden connection of parts of fields previously disconnected by cwt increases the runoff and the risk of erosion since the rainfall and runoff process increases the functional connectivity regardless of the wheel track presence or orientation the importance of soil surface treatments is stressed the outcomes of this study may be used for large scale modeling of arable lands where a single computation cell of the large scale model can be represented by the experimental plot in this study the direct link to such models can be found in random roughness rr and functional connectivity different rr can be assigned to cells based on the orientation of the wheel tracks in the cells however this usage of rr may be misleading since the wheel track is a physical feature in the model cell rather than the roughness of the soil surface functional connectivity can be used to represent the surface retention of the cell as suggested by antoine et al 2009 antoine et al 2011 peñuela et al 2016 in this case different functional connectivity will represent the cells in the model with or without wheel tracks as well as the orientation of the wheel tracks this application has the potential to improve runoff generation modeling studies however further study is required to determine usability credit authorship

2925,although wheel tracks cover only a small portion of the surface of agricultural fields their effect on surface runoff and sediment transport is substantial wheel tracks change the microrelief of the soil surface and influence how the surface is further altered by rainfall and runoff this study presents a plot scale microrelief analysis of a tilled surface with wheel tracks under simulated rainfall digital elevation models of the microrelief with 1 cm spatial resolution were obtained using the structure from motion method the random roughness the structural connectivity and functional connectivity were calculated for before rainfall and after rainfall soil surface conditions the experiments were carried out on inclined freshly tilled plots 8 m long 2 m wide the wheel tracks were created by four passages of machinery in the slope direction swt and in the contour line direction cwt the experiments were compared to reference plots without wheel tracks nwt the wheel tracks increase water and sediment connectivity if they are oriented in slope wise direction microrelief analysis shows that swt drains water from the surrounding soil the soil surface adjacent to swt can also become more connected with the wheel track due to changes in microrelief introduced by rainfall and runoff the calculated higher connectivity in the swt plot corresponded to the measured increased sediment loads this suggests faster overland flow and therefore shorter flow pathways on the soil surface microrelief cwt leads to a decrease in the water and sediment connectivity compared to the nwt and swt plots although the surface runoff can overflow the cwt the network of flow paths results in decreased flow velocity and a slower sediment transport rate however the cwt effect is not permanent and declines as the wheel tracks become silted with the deposited sediment it is shown that detailed microrelief data provide relevant information for a study of the changes in flow routing in a tilled agricultural field with the presence of a wheel track swt accelerates the runoff and especially the sediment transport during a rainfall event the hydraulic connection between the wheel track and the surrounding soil increases dramatically cwt reduces the surface runoff and also the sediment transport in the long term rainfall events and surface runoff alter the microrelief connectivity causing the soil surface to be more hydraulically connected irrespective of the wheel track orientation this study demonstrates the effect of wheel tracks on water and sediment transport the results draw attention to the importance of appropriate soil protection measures as a bare unprotected surface microrelief exposed to rainfall leads to increased sediment connectivity keywords

from arable land have a negative impact on soil quality boardman and poesen 2006 and this is nowadays the topic of international strategies such as the eu soil strategy for 2030 ec com 2021 699 european commission 2021 surface runoff and sediment transport also have negative off site effects such as damage to the infrastructure boardman et al 2019 siltation of streams and water reservoirs e g krása et al 2005 loss of nutrients from fields e g probst 1985 and eutrophication of water bodies e g carpenter et al 1998 although water driven nutrient transport can also occur in shallow groundwater flow outram et al 2016 or sometimes via percolation through tile drainage systems deasy et al 2009 surface runoff prevails in agricultural fields e g carpenter et al 1998 direct wheel track compaction has been recognized as a cause of soil degradation because compaction changes the physical and infiltration properties of soils lal 1999 lindstrom et al 1981 topsoil saturated hydraulic conductivity may decrease up to fourfold in the upper soil horizon mainly due to the decrease in macroporosity under direct compaction e g kim et al 2010 the effect of compaction was observed mainly in the top 10 cm of the soil profile where the proportion of elongated pores decreased rapidly pagliai et al 2003 compacted soil in wheel tracks also exhibits reduced near saturated hydraulic conductivity due to the reduction in water conducting pores e g ankeny et al 1990 seehusen et al 2019 daraghmeh et al 2008 pagliai et al 2004 the decrease in porosity and the increase in bulk density is in fact an effect of rearrangements of the soil particles which lead to an increased risk of runoff and erosion events gps tracking shows that most parts of agricultural fields are crossed by a tractor at least once in the course of a single season and some of the wheel tracks remain undisrupted on the soil surface until the harvest kroulík et al 2011 augustin et al 2020 wheel tracks act as preferential pathways for surface runoff and sediment transport if they are oriented in the direction of the slope heathwaite et al 2005 silgram et al 2010 ryken et al 2018 and they act as an obstacle if they are oriented in the contour line direction heathwaite et al 2005 moreover the flow direction introduced by the tillage exceeded the flow direction based on topography on 50 to 100 of the catchment area souchere et al 1998 takken et al 2001 couturier et al 2013 thus wheeltrack induced compaction may affect runoff sediment transport and therefore soil quality on the scale of whole parcels or fields soil surface conditions leys et al 2007 and soil surface microtopography are among key factors in the generation of surface runoff e g jester and klik 2005 prosdocimi et al 2017 the microtopography greatly influences runoff generation since it affects whether and when the water from a local microrelief depression starts to contribute to runoff antoine et al 2009 due to the microtopography the overland flow may become channeled and may therefore gain higher velocity and initiate soil erosion chen et al 2013 gómez and nearing 2005 infiltration is also affected by microtopography soil sealing in a microrelief depression may reduce infiltration while higher soil water content may increase infiltration thompson et al 2010 surface roughness is often used to characterize the conditions of the soil surface taconet and ciarletti 2007 croft et al 2013 moreno et al 2008 luo et al 2018 surface roughness has been investigated to estimate surface depression storage onstad 1984 to partition rainfall water into infiltration and surface runoff zhao et al 2018 and to estimate runoff and sediment flow rates luo et al 2018 the initial roughness affects the runoff and the development of rill flow gómez and nearing 2005 in addition temporal changes in surface roughness have been observed due to the impact of raindrops zobeck and onstad 1987 bauer et al 2015 surface runoff zobeck and onstad 1987 or during infiltration onstad et al 1984 random roughness rr decreases in wheel tracks but this effect is diminished when no till management systems are used lindstrom et al 1981 the principle of hydrological connectivity is often used to explore the linkages of various water pools within the landscape pringle 2003 bracken et al 2013 hydrological connectivity can be divided into concepts of structural topography based connectivity and functional process based connectivity bracken et al 2013 which have been utilized in several studies antoine et al 2009 angermann et al 2017 jackisch et al 2017 rinderer et al 2018 structural connectivity was developed from dem based topographic indices some of the most popular indices are the topography wetness index beven and kirkby 1979 and modifications to it stieglitz et al 2003 hjerdt et al 2004 a combination of indices can also be used to identify the spill and fill runoff behavior on hillslopes hopp and mcdonnell 2009 furthermore the index of connectivity ic was developed to assess the connectivity of water flow and sediment within a landscape borselli et al 2008 although ic was initially created with a focus on steep alpine valleys and alluvial fans it has been successfully used to identify sediment source areas at submeter scales with a digital elevation model dem of 1 cm resolution e g prosdocimi et al 2017 small scale functional connectivity is often studied through observations of the temporal changes in the inter dis connection between soil surface depressions darboux et al 2002a b antoine et al 2009 or roughness organization smith 2014 antoine et al 2009 introduced the relative surface connection function rscf which was a metric of surface depression connectivity rscf was then used in other studies to observe surface runoff connectivity antoine et al 2011 yang and chu 2013 peñuela et al 2016 appels et al 2011 appels et al 2016 rscf expresses how much runoff is generated for a given fullness of the surface depressions storage sds and therefore how well the surface depressions are hydraulically connected at each moment in practical terms the connectivity is assessed with a curve function relating the surface runoff and the actual filled surface depression storage the gradient of the curve expresses how quickly the surface depressions are being connected and surface runoff is being generated a large gradient indicates threshold behavior the abrupt connection of a major surface storage to the outlet a low gradient indicates a more complex surface where e g multiple surface depressions need to be filled and connected with each other to produce runoff a horizontal shift of the curve indicates an increase or a decrease in the surface depression storage during the experiment according to peñuela et al 2016 the soil surface changes during a rainfall event and the subsequent response of the surface runoff are well explained by rscf moreover rscf can be used to improve the simple stepwise surface retention parameter of large scale hydrological models as the runoff is usually observed before all depressions get filled antoine et al 2009 antoine et al 2011 peñuela et al 2016 as has been shown above a vast amount of research has been done on analyzing the microrelief in terms of roughness or connectivity however there is a lack of studies on combinations of macro features and micro features e g wheel tracks and the soil surface microrelief in this study we present a microrelief analysis of soil surfaces with the presence of wheel tracks and we relate the analysis to direct measurements of the surface runoff and the sediment transport during a rainfall simulation the goal is to better understand the dynamics of the initiation of surface runoff soil erosion and rainfall runoff induced surface changes on a bare tilled soil the structure from motion sfm photogrammetric method was used to capture the soil surface changes caused by rainfall and by surface runoff westoby et al 2012 and to calculate the connectivity indices prosdocimi et al 2017 wolstenholme et al 2020 the specific objectives of our investigation are 1 to assess the changes in microtopography caused by a wheel track and by rainfall and surface runoff utilizing high resolution microrelief dems and several indicators surface roughness structural and functional connectivity and 2 to confront the observed changes in microrelief with the measured surface runoff and sediment transport on the plot scale 2 materials and methods a series of artificial rainfall experiments were performed to study the effect of the presence and the orientation of wheel tracks on surface runoff and sediment transport in general we utilized two approaches direct monitoring of surface runoff and sediment transport and microrelief analysis utilizing random roughness and two connectivity indicators in total five experiments were performed in two independent experimental campaigns the first experimental campaign was undertaken in september 2018 referred to as campaign no 1 and the second was undertaken in june 2019 referred to as campaign no 2 two wheel track orientations were examined slope wise direction swt and contour line direction cwt the experimental setup was complemented by reference experiments on plots with no wheel tracks nwt as shown in fig 1 2 1 location the experiments were carried out on experimental plots located on an agricultural site ca 30 km to the north west of prague czech republic at coordinates 50 13 2 0 n 14 1 2 2 e fig 1 the site is at an elevation of 310 315 m a s l the annual mean temperature is 8 c and the mean annual precipitation is 500 mm the climate is characterized as humid continental the site is located at the edge of larger fields on which winter wheat and rapeseed were planted in both experimental years the topsoil is classified as loam with 18 3 of clay 33 8 of silt and 47 9 of sand the soils are developed on sedimentary rocks consisting of claystone sandstone and arkose and are classified as cambisols according to the world reference base for soil resources the content of organic matter is in the range of 1 2 1 5 in the topsoil 2 2 experimental plots all experimental plots had an inclination of approximately 10 and were 8 m long and 2 m wide the size of the plot was adopted from kavka et al 2018 the length of the plot is long enough to study the erosion process while preserving uniform rainfall distribution along the plot the each experimental plot was delineated by metal plates inserted ca 5 cm into the soil the seedbed was prepared and the wheel tracks were created several days before the experiments for both campaigns no precipitation was recorded between the preparation of the topsoil and the experiments 2 2 1 campaign no 1 campaign no 1 was conducted on september 18th and 19th 2018 the soil was stubble tilled to a depth of 12 15 cm using a stubble cultivator one day before the experiment september 17th the wheel tracks were created directly after cultivation by four passages of a new holland t7 185 tractor and a trailed cultivator in non operational state with two axles driving in the uphill direction in the case of the swt plot fig 1 four passages were chosen in order to produce a representative wheel rut without making an unrealistic number of passages it has been shown that most compaction changes occur within the first 4 5 passages botta et al 2009 the pressure in the tires of the tractor was 1 4 bar front wheels and 2 0 bar rear wheels the tire pressure of the stubble cultivator was 3 5 bar the total weight of the machinery was 8 5 t 6 t for the tractor and 2 5 t for the stubble cultivator the axle loads of the tractor were 2 8 t on the front axle and 3 2 t on the rear axle the axle load of the stubble cultivator was 1 25 t the maximum static ground pressure of a single tire was estimated using the soilphysics r package de lima et al 2021 to be 201 kpa for the front axle of the tractor and 272 kpa for the rear axle and 439 kpa for the stubble cultivator the initial topsoil water conditions were very dry with a volumetric water content of 0 10 0 01 cm3 cm 3 the topsoil bulk density was 1 31 0 09 g cm 3 the topsoil bulk density of the soil in the wheel track was 1 40 0 1 g cm 3 the mean wheel rut depth was 3 9 0 9 cm during campaign no 1 only the slope wise wt was set 2 2 2 campaign no 2 experimental campaign no 2 was conducted between july 18th and 20th 2019 the vegetation cover mainly atriplex galium aparine and common grasses that had grown on the experimental plot location during the vegetation season was mulched on june 14th 2019 dry vegetation residues were manually removed from the soil surface one day before the experiment the topsoil was stubble tilled to a depth of 12 15 cm the wheel tracks were prepared after stubble tillage with a new holland t8040 tractor and a full 12 m3 water tank trailer with 4 wheels driving 4 times in downhill direction fig 1 the tire pressure of the tractor was 1 4 bar front wheels and 1 6 bar rear wheels the pressure of each water tanker tire was 3 5 bar the total weight of the machinery was about 22 t 8 t for new holland t8040 2 t for the water tank and 12 t for the water the axle load of the tractor was 3 8 t for the front axle and 4 2 t for the rear axle the axle load of the water tank was approximately 7 t the maximum static single tire ground pressure was estimated to be 206 kpa for the front wheels of the tractor 236 kpa for the rear wheels of the tractor and 455 kpa for the wheels of the water tank also using the soil physics r package de lima et al 2021 the initial soil water conditions were very dry with a volumetric water content around 0 13 0 02 cm3 cm 3 the topsoil bulk density was 1 19 0 37 g cm 3 the topsoil bulk density of the soil in the wheel track was 1 35 0 03 g cm 3 the mean wheel rut depth at the swt plot was 3 5 1 9 cm both slope direction and contour line direction wheel tracks were set up for campaign no 2 2 3 surface microtopography observation the soil surface morphology was monitored by means of the structure from motion close range photogrammetry method images for photogrammetry were taken before and after each experiment using a sony a6000 mirrorless camera with an aps c size sensor with resolution of 24 mpx and equipped with a standard sony 16 50 mm zoom lens fixed on 16 mm each measurement consisted of approximately 40 60 images taken in two rows from a distance of 1 5 m photogrammetry reference targets were installed on the perimeter of each plot at a mutual distance of 1 to 2 m the targets were inserted into the soil with 15 cm long screws which held the targets in a steady position during the experiment a small number of targets were also attached to the collection flume the gps positions of all targets were measured with vertical and horizontal accuracy of 15 mm images with geo referenced targets were processed in agisoft photoscan professional 1 4 2 build 6205 agisoft llc the output was an orthophoto and a digital elevation model dem of the surface with a 1 mm ground sampling distance 10 mm spatial resolution in and y direction was used for all analyses this resolution was optimized in order to maintain high detail in the analysis while providing reasonably low noise in the data and reasonable time for computation the dems were rotated to reorient the plots into the north direction in order to simplify further image processing the coordinates are shown in fig 1 the installed sensors which partially covered the soil surface were clipped off the images and the missing areas were linearly interpolated in the south north direction the raster cells on the sides of the plots were raised by 0 2 m to form a boundary for the drainage area which was in reality maintained by metal sheets during the experiment the raster was further resampled to 10 mm spatial resolution in order to reduce the noise of the initial point clouds and to decrease the size of the data for further processing and computation 2 4 rainfall simulation artificial rainfall with intensity of 27 4 7 8 mm h 1 measured with multiple totalizators throughout the simulation and mean rainfall kinetic energy of 127 j m 2 h 1 measured on site with a disdrometer was set for all experiments the target value of the rainfall was 30 mm h 1 which is the 5 year return period rainfall at the location kašpar et al 2021 the duration of the experiments varied between 290 min and 433 min funnels were installed at the bottom of each experimental plot to collect the surface runoff and sediment for a detailed description of the simulator see kavka et al 2018 on the swt plots two flumes were installed in order to separate the water flowing through the wheel track and the water flowing from the adjacent tilled soil surface fig 1 the runoff sampling interval was prolonged during the experiment starting at 2 5 min and reaching 20 min when the runoff was approaching a steady state 2 5 microrelief analysis 2 5 1 roughness the random roughness rr was calculated from the before and after rainfall dems for each plot in addition the wheel tracks and the adjacent tilled soil surface were analyzed separately for the swt and cwt plots the rr calculation was adopted according to taconet and ciarletti 2007 the dems were leveled in order to exclude the plot slope from the rr calculation subsequently rr was calculated as the standard deviation of the leveled pixel elevations rr 1 n 1 m 1 i n j m z i j z 2 1 where z stands for detrended surface elevation and z stands for the mean of the detrended surface elevation n and m stand for the number of rows and columns in the rotated raster 2 5 2 structural connectivity analysis the normalized downslope distance ndd was used to assess the structural connectivity our approach was inspired by the index of connectivity borselli et al 2008 where the downslope distance is a part of the algorithm the downslope distance algorithm provided by the taudem terrain analysis tool tarboton 2015 was used to perform the analysis as a result of the algorithm a raster was created in which each cell contains a flow path length l d to the bottom of the plot at this stage the downslope distance is dependent on the organization of the surface topography and the position of a given cell along the slope to compensate the cell position along the plot we normalized the pathway length l d by the shortest length to the bottom of the plot l s as is shown in fig 2 ndd is therefore calculated as ndd l d l s the ndd expresses the bulk complexity of the surface topography from the perspective of the moving particle the trajectory of which is being tracked 2 5 3 functional connectivity analysis functional connectivity refers to a concept presented by darboux et al 2002b and by antoine et al 2009 where a surface runoff model is used to assess the connectivity for this task we utilized the smoderp2d 1 1 the model is provided in the public repository at the github online platform github com storm fsv cvut smoderp2d or on the web of the department of landscape water conservation faculty of civil engineering ctu prague storm fsv cvut cz smoderp physically based episodic distributed hydrological model dostál et al 2000 kavka et al 2022 landa et al 2019 the results of the model were interpreted as the relationship between the runoff coefficient and the soil surface depressions storage the interpretation of this relationship is shown in fig 3 the initial surface depression storage is calculated by subtracting sink less 2 2 sinks in dem are cells surrounded by cells with higher elevation the sink less dem is a raster where such cells are artificially removed dem from the original dem sink less dem is calculated with the fill tool of the spatial analysis extension of esri arcmap 10 7 software it was assumed that the plots have uniform soil hydraulic properties over the plot which does not change in time all plots were modeled with uniform rainfall intensity which corresponded to the rainfall intensity used during the rainfall experiments a more detailed description of the model and its infiltration and flow routing parameters is provided in appendix table 1 2 6 laboratory analysis the undisturbed soil samples were gravimetrically analyzed to obtain the initial soil water content and the bulk density the sediment concentration in the runoff was obtained by filtering the sampled water the paper filters with the trapped soil were oven dried at 105 c to obtain the mass of the eroded soil 2 7 statistical analysis the significance of the wheel track effect on surface runoff and sediment transport was analyzed using the student t test in particular the non zero difference among the plots was tested the test was performed with r software r core team 2018 3 results 3 1 random roughness random roughness rr is shown in fig 4 a for all experimental plots for before and after rainfall soil surface conditions the rr of all the plots varies between 0 015 m and 0 045 m the rr was larger in campaign no 2 than in campaign no 1 for all plots a decline in roughness after rainfall was observed for all experiments although the decrease in rr at the nwt plot in campaign no 1 was only minor the most pronounced drop in rr was observed for the nwt plot in campaign no 1 the cwt plot exhibited the largest rr fig 4b shows the random roughness rr in the wheel track in wt and of the surrounding soil out wt for the swt plot similarly in fig 4a the roughness decreased in all cases after the rainfall the rr in fig 4b shows a more pronounced decrease in campaign no 1 especially in wt although a larger decrease was recorded the overall roughness was lower in campaign no 2 the decrease in rr was more pronounced between the campaigns than between the in wt and the out wt 3 2 structural connectivity histograms of the normalized downslope distance ndd with the before rainfall and after rainfall soil surface conditions and the flow accumulation raster are shown in fig 5 ndd was used to assess the tortuosity of the downslope pathway which serves as a measure of the structural connectivity the flow accumulation rasters are displayed in order to diagnose the shifts in the ndd histograms the before rainfall soil surface conditions of the cwt exhibited the highest ndd pixel count in the interval of 1 5 1 6 on the ntw plots the highest ndd pixel count was observed in the interval 1 3 1 5 fig 5ac plot during both campaigns the swt plots exhibited bimodal ndd distribution before the rainfall fig 5bd the first peak in the pixel count of the histogram lay in the ndd interval of 1 1 1 2 for the first campaign and in the interval of 1 2 1 3 for the second campaign the second peak was observed in the ndd intervals of 1 5 1 7 and 1 5 1 6 during the first and second campaigns the ndd pixel count increased in the interval 1 4 2 while it decreased in intervals 1 1 4 at the cwt plot after rainfall after rainfall the nwt plots exhibited an increase in the ndd pixel count especially in intervals 1 5 1 6 and 1 4 1 6 for campaigns no 1 and no 2 respectively the ndd pixel count showed a different change at the swt plots during each campaign fig 5bd the after rainfall two peak histogram became a single peak histogram due to the higher ndd values in intervals 1 3 1 5 and 1 7 2 0 during campaign no 1 however two peaks in the ndd histogram were preserved after the rainfall during campaign no 2 although the first peak shifted into the ndd interval 1 3 1 4 the flow accumulation showed the main pathways and their complexity fig 5 two peaks of the before rainfall ndd histogram at the swt no 2 plot clearly correspond to two main flow pathways identified in the flow accumulation raster one in wheel tracks and one in the surrounding soil surface fig 5b the same situation applied for the swt plot for the before rainfall conditions as shown in fig 5d the flow accumulation in campaign no 1 showed that the flow paths were diverted from the tilled surface into the wheel track which corresponds to a shift from unimodal to bimodal distribution in the ndd histograms two main flow paths were preserved in the after rainfall conditions in campaign no 2 which again corresponded to bimodal ndd after rainfall distribution the ndd changes in the nwt plot could not be explained by a visual inspection of the flow accumulation raster on the cwt plot fig 5e a change in the flow path can be observed in the lower right corner which was disconnected from the upper right corner of the plot after the rainfall and was shifted to the left part of the plot 3 3 functional connectivity the functional connectivity for before rainfall and after rainfall surface conditions is shown in fig 4 cwt plot no 2 exhibited the largest storage capacity for the before rainfall conditions fig 4a and swt exhibited the lowest storage capacity during both campaigns fig 4ab nwt exhibited almost identical curves for the before rainfall conditions during both campaigns fig 4a however the curves deviated from each other for the after rainfall conditions the depression storage capacity was smaller for the after rainfall conditions than for the before rainfall conditions with the exception of reference plot nwt in campaign no 1 where the storage capacities remained very similar for the before rainfall conditions the swt plots of both campaigns and nwt plot no 2 exhibited a sharp increase in the runoff coefficient when a certain threshold was reached fig 4a for nwt plot no 1 and nwt plot no 2 this increase occurred later when more of the surface depression storage sds was filled this effect was most pronounced for the cwt plot where the runoff coefficient increased more gradually while the sds was being filled threshold behavior was observed to some extent in all the experiments only a small portion of sds had to be filled before runoff was initiated on the swt plots in both before and after rainfall surface conditions up to 0 2 mm of sds had to be filled at the nwt plots before the rainfall soil surface conditions initiated runoff interestingly the cwt plot started to contribute to runoff for smaller filled sds than the nwt plots for before rainfall soil surface conditions fig 4a but the increase in runoff was more gradual on the cwt plot as described above 3 4 runoff and sediment transport a summary of the direct measurements of surface runoff and sediment transport is shown in table 1 the duration of the experiments differed and therefore the total rainfall depth and the total rainfall kinetic also differed the largest rainfall amount was received by swt plot no 2 and the smallest rainfall amount was received by swt plot no 1 during campaign no 1 surface runoff from the swt plot occurred only in the wheel track while the surrounding tilled soil exhibited no runoff at the bottom of the plot the surface runoff from the swt plot during campaign no 2 was drained through both parts of the plot the wheel track and the surrounding tilled surface however the runoff from the surrounding tilled surface exhibited a much longer time lag 102 min an almost 7 5 times lower cumulative runoff and a 31 3 times lower total soil loss compared to the wheel track see table 1 no evidence of rill erosion was observed the runoff and the sediment flow development differed among the wheel track variants as shown in fig 7 and table 2 a neither the surface runoff nor the sediment flow rate reached steady rates during the experiments similar values were reached on the swt plots and on the nwt plot of the second campaign however the time lag was different fig 7a the nwt plots during campaign no 2 exhibited significantly higher surface runoff when the lag time was excluded from the analysis table 2 nwt plot no 1 exhibited similar behavior as the cwt plot in campaign no 2 apart from the runoff time lag the sediment flow rate fig 7b varied during the experiments the swt plots exhibited significantly greater sediment flow rates than the other plots with the peak at about one third of the duration of the experiment table 2b the rising limb of the sediment mass plot increased more gradually during campaign no 1 than during campaign no 2 the sediment flow rate on the nwt plots exhibited similar behavior during both campaigns with the exception of the time lag the sediment flow rate was significantly higher during campaign no 1 table 2b the curves of the sediment flow rate on both nwt plots were generally flat which contrasts with the surface runoff where the rate increased throughout the experiment the cwt plot showed the smallest surface runoff table 2a and the slowest increase in surface runoff fig 7a the surface runoff increased throughout the experiment while the sediment flow stabilized at a constant value fig 7b all experiments where the sediment flow reached a quasi steady value exhibited a decrease in the concentration of the suspended sediment see fig 7c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the wheel track on connectivity the presence of a wheel track can be recognized by the structural connectivity the greatest structural connectivity was observed on both swt plots while the lowest structural connectivity was observed on the cwt plot the reference nwt plot exhibited medium values of structural connectivity these findings indicate more prolonged paths of water and sediment on the cwt plot than on the nwt and swt plots as a consequence water moves more slowly along the plot this results in a decreased erosion rate the two peaks of ndd in the swt plots indicate that the higher connectivity is caused solely by the wheel track while structural connectivity expresses the connectivity among individual surface micro depressions functional connectivity indicates the connectivity between the soil surface and the outlet as expected functional connectivity showed that the swt plots exhibited the highest connectivity while the cwt plots exhibited the lowest connectivity according to antoine et al 2009 the functional connectivity distinguished well between the microrelief composed of isolated craters and the microrelief composed of well connected valleys this suggests that the cwt surface contains more distinct depressions than the nwt and swt plots the swt plot on the other hand consists of better connected pathways ultimately the soil flattened by the wheel tracks the tire patterns are smaller than the roughness of the surrounding soil creates well connected pathways and therefore increases the connectivity in all cases in our study the tillage was in the direction of the contour lines in the case of the swt plot this created an unusual situation of contour tillage and slope wheel tracks which however can occur with conventional soil tillage technology or on headlands kroulík et al 2011 the number of passages affects the depth of the wheel rut it has been shown that the first few passages have the most significant effect and that the wheel rut depth becomes less reduced after 5 passages botta et al 2009 also the soil moisture conditions play a significant role however due to the low soil water content at the beginning of both campaigns we would not expect substantial deepening of the wheel track if more passages were performed the shape and the pattern of the surface depressions would also vary for different tillage types tarolli et al 2019 the length of the plot also affects connectivity a longer plot decreases the runoff due to infiltration and increases sediment transport due to increased velocity of the flow jourgholami and labelle 2020 a longer plot may have a higher effect on swt than other wheel track configurations due to its connectivity and low infiltration capacity 4 2 impact of rainfall and runoff on connectivity the surface runoff evolution mechanism is shown in fig 8 the surface runoff was formed by consecutive filling and spilling of water from the surface depressions once water reaches the wheel track it cannot return to the surrounding soil and is preferentially transported downwards on the swt plot this contrasts with the cwt orientation which acts as a large surface depression that releases runoff only when full during runoff the soil surface depressions gradually become filled with the mobilized sediment this was observed during the experiment and is also indicated by the decrease in rr and by the changes in soil surface storage after rainfall this kind of behavior has been reported in the literature zobeck and onstad 1987 withers et al 2006 peñuela et al 2016 when a surface depression is overtopped a small neck is eroded at the boundary of the depression accelerating both the runoff and the sediment transport in the experiment no rill flow developed similarly to helming et al 1998 small necks acted as short bypasses connecting the depressions with each other and with the wheel track although this effect was clear during the experiment it could only be observed qualitatively in the flow accumulation raster on the cwt plots where several flow paths from the wheel tracks emerged after rainfall fig 5 the random roughness decreased due to the mechanical impact of the rain drops and the subsequent consolidation of the surface which flattened the ridges formed by the tillage bauer et al 2015 zobeck and onstad 1987 laburda et al 2021 it has been shown in the literature that the surface roughness decreases exponentially with increasing rainfall amount or with rainfall kinetic energy zobeck and onstad 1987 this exponential relationship was shown to be consistent among multiple tillage systems guzha 2004 however simulated rainfall usually has an unnatural raindrop distribution and the relation between random roughness and kinetic energy may therefore be altered in this study the same rainfall intensity and the same rainfall simulator and therefore the same drop size distribution was used only the rainfall depth and the kinetic energy differed among individual experiments however the extent to which the rr decreased did not coincide with the total rainfall depth the surface runoff also detached soil particles from ridges and some of the particles later settled into the surface depressions this led to decreasing surface roughness fig 4 and to decreasing depression storage capacity fig 6 smoothing of the surface is clearly visible during all experiments irrespective of the presence or the orientation of the wheel track the roughness also decreased in the wheel track fig 4 which confirms that there are both soil erosion and soil deposition in the compacted wheel tracks as has also been reported by basher and ross 2001 this suggests that the wheel tracks also contribute to the overall changes in connectivity soil swelling may also affect the surface changes however it is hard to distinguish between soil swelling and consolidation even if high temporal resolution microrelief data are available eltner et al 2017 after the rainfall the structural connectivity decreased at all plots this non intuitive surface development was most pronounced on the cwt plot fig 5e the before rainfall soil surface structures created only by tillage and by the passage of the tractor exhibited clear flow paths oriented downslope arrows in fig 5e the impact of rainfall and runoff may create new flow paths via soil erosion causing the water pathways to increase in length the structural connectivity provides valuable information when observing surface changes within the plot this was most visible on the swt plots where the flux between wheel track and surrounding soil was identified even when the wheel track is initially disconnected from the surrounding soil the rainfall and runoff may form a connection in this study this happened in one of the swt scenarios this contrasting behavior may have been caused by the different tire tread for campaigns 1 and 2 since the passage of the tractor was in opposite directions and was followed by the trailed cultivator the rainfall depth was higher during campaign no 2 when the two flow paths remained unchanged and the wheel rut was slightly shallower during the second campaign two reasons can be put forward for the different outcome possibly affecting the ndd i the different tire tread pattern and ii the different lowering of the wheel track below the surrounding soil surface both of these effects potentially made the runoff more prone to create flow paths towards the wheel tracks as seen in fig 5b these flow paths influenced the reorganization of the soil surrounding the wheel tracks an increase in connectivity and a decrease in soil surface storage capacity was observed in the functional connectivity for all plots the surface storage capacity was observed to decrease after successive rainfall events as has also been shown by darboux et al 2002a however the decrease in surface storage capacity cannot alone explain the increase in connectivity a crucial factor is the spatial organization and the connectivity of the depressions similar trends were also observed by peñuela et al 2016 under natural rainfall the storage depression capacity decreased rapidly after rainfall started whereas the shift in the connectivity threshold first rose and then in some cases decreased peñuela et al 2016 the role of a wheel track in increased functional connectivity unlike in the case of structural connectivity is not shown explicitly swt plot no 1 exhibited higher functional connectivity than swt plot no 2 in both before rainfall and after rainfall soil surface conditions however a connection between the wheel track and the surrounding soil may not always be created even after a substantial rainfall 4 3 comparison between connectivity indices and direct measurements the direct measurements of runoff and sediment flow were in agreement with both functional connectivity and structural connectivity both the runoff amount and the sediment transport followed the order swt nwt cwt differences between the plots were more pronounced when comparing the sediment fluxes than when comparing the runoff this is most likely caused by the flow velocity in the wheel track which increased the carrying capacity of the water wheel track compaction in the direction of the slope increased the runoff coefficient and the sediment transport across all studied tillage systems ryken et al 2018 the direction of a passing tractor upslope or downslope and of course the initial moisture conditions alter the surface runoff and the transport of sediments withers et al 2006 an accumulation of eroded soil was observed in wider wheel tracks while narrower wheel tracks exhibited greater transport capacity due to the acceleration of the surface runoff eltner et al 2017 this indicates the importance of the flow velocity the same behavior swt nwt cwt order in surface runoff and sediment transport was observed with structural and functional surface connectivity for the before rainfall soil surface conditions the structural connectivity agreed in terms of the connection of the wheel track and the surrounding soil as shown on the swt plot fig 5bd the bi modal to uni modal shift of the ndd distribution corresponded to the swt measurement where runoff and sediment transport only occurred in the wheel track table 1 the ndd distribution during campaign no 2 remained bimodal for before rainfall and after rainfall soil surface conditions this corresponded to the direct measurements where the runoff was active on both halves of the plot no effect of different tire treads could be observed in the functional connectivity analysis the swc and nwt plots exhibited similar maximum runoff in direct monitoring and also similar functional connectivity during campaign no 2 figs 6 and 7 the nwt in campaign no 2 even exhibited significantly higher runoff compared to all other plots if the lag time was not taken into consideration in the analysis table 2 this was caused by the rapid increase in runoff after it started after some time the runoff reached values similar to those on both swt plots fig 7 this increase may have been caused by the sudden connection of a few larger puddles to the outlet the effect of the prolonged time lag in the nwt plot was not shown by functional connectivity however the largest time lag observed in the nwt plot during campaign no 1 was well reproduced for the after rainfall situation in agreement with functional connectivity the largest sediment flow rate occurred during campaign no 2 but it was not reproduced by functional connectivity however functional connectivity was based on the model where erosion was not implemented and correspondence with the sediment transport was therefore not to be expected 4 4 comparison of structural and functional connectivity metrics structural connectivity allows the soil surface to be observed in greater detail this index was able to identify multiple major flow paths which reached the bottom of the plot via identification of uni modal or bimodal distribution structural connectivity in combination with the flow accumulation algorithm was able to assess which part of the plot was connected to disconnected from the drainage flow paths i e the inter plot connectivity in contrast to the functional connectivity the structural connectivity did not incorporate soil surface depressions in the analysis since sink less rem was used to generate the data functional connectivity takes the dynamics of the processes into consideration the changes in surface depression storage can therefore be incorporated although the functional connectivity used in this study does not require physically based derivation of the parameters or any calibration or validation procedure additional information about soil properties and rainfall data are needed in order to derive the functional connectivity in addition it is much more time demanding to run an overland flow model in 10 mm raster resolution than to compute the structural connectivity 5 conclusion surface runoff sediment transport and hydrological connectivity have been analyzed on freshly tilled topsoil with wheel tracks by means of microrelief dem indices two wheel track orientations were studied slope wise direction swt and contour lines wise direction cwt the experimental setup was supplemented by a reference plot with no wheel track nwt the experimental plots were subjected to artificial rainfall and dems were obtained using the structure from motion method before rainfall and after rainfall the surface microrelief was assessed with random roughness and two measures of connectivity were compared with direct runoff monitoring of surface runoff and sediment transport the slope wise wheel tracks swt increased the sediment and the hydraulic connectivity of the surface the wheel track itself exhibited high structural connectivity and low roughness when oriented slope wise this led to an increase in runoff and sediment transport the soil surface adjacent to swt is connected to the wheel track only to some extent as shown by the direct measurements the plot with a contour line wheel track cwt exhibited even higher roughness and lower connectivity than the plot without wheel tracks a temporal decrease in random roughness and in soil surface storage was observed on all plots as the effect of the kinetic energy of the rainfall and runoff the surface became more connected during the rainfall as shown via the functional connectivity metric the microtopography affects the water and sediment routing on the soil surface the wheel tracks depending on orientation increase or decrease the water and sediment fluxes during runoff events the effect of swt after a rainfall runoff event is pronounced since it becomes more connected to the surrounding soil on the other hand the effect of cwt decreases in time as it becomes filled with deposited sediment the emergent connection of swt to the surrounding soil needs to be further studied however our study has shown that microrelief analysis may be used to identify this process the conditions under which the cwt effect is diminished also need to be further studied sudden connection of parts of fields previously disconnected by cwt increases the runoff and the risk of erosion since the rainfall and runoff process increases the functional connectivity regardless of the wheel track presence or orientation the importance of soil surface treatments is stressed the outcomes of this study may be used for large scale modeling of arable lands where a single computation cell of the large scale model can be represented by the experimental plot in this study the direct link to such models can be found in random roughness rr and functional connectivity different rr can be assigned to cells based on the orientation of the wheel tracks in the cells however this usage of rr may be misleading since the wheel track is a physical feature in the model cell rather than the roughness of the soil surface functional connectivity can be used to represent the surface retention of the cell as suggested by antoine et al 2009 antoine et al 2011 peñuela et al 2016 in this case different functional connectivity will represent the cells in the model with or without wheel tracks as well as the orientation of the wheel tracks this application has the potential to improve runoff generation modeling studies however further study is required to determine usability credit authorship

2926,intensive groundwater exploitation has depleted groundwater storage and led to a series of geo environmental problems in beijing plain china managed aquifer recharge mar has been endorsed to mitigate the groundwater storage depletion and achieve groundwater sustainability a pilot mar has been tested in the chaobai river catchment since 2015 an innovative large scale mar consisting of 9 cascade terraced infiltration ponds was proposed and its effectiveness was assessed in this study using an integrated modelling approach the integrated model coupled the regional and local transient flow and transport processes the transient regional flow model simulated historical groundwater level declines and storage depletion in the beijing plain from 1995 to 2018 the coupled regional and local flow model was used to simulate the pilot mar test in the chaobai river from 2015 to 2018 a significant groundwater level increase was observed nearby the pilot mar since 2015 the transport model results indicate that approximately 40 of the infiltrated water was captured by pumping wells in the no 8 well field the models were further used to assess the long term effects of the large scale mar from 2020 to 2050 the simulation results show that the groundwater system will reach a new equilibrium state under the implementation of the large scale mar scheme almost 91 of the abstracted water in the no 8 well field will come from the mar infiltration the proposed large scale mar is very effective in restoring the depleted aquifer storage and maintaining the groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field however with the increase of the groundwater level the infiltration rate of several ponds will decrease therefore it is important to maintain a dynamic balance between artificial recharge and groundwater abstraction in order to achieve a sustainable long term mar operation in the region keywords managed aquifer recharge simulation models infiltration rate

selected yao 2014 zhang et al 2013 the natural dry riverbed of the two main rivers in beijing plain have been recognized as ideal mar sites for surface water infiltration and recharge of the shallow aquifer pilot mar project has been implemented since 2015 cao et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 modelling studies have also been carried out to evaluate the performance of the current mar implementation and the potential of the future mar operation in beijing hao et al 2014 hu et al 2019 ma et al 2020 nan et al 2016 xu et al 2022 zhou et al 2012 however most of these modelling studies were only dedicated to the local scale simulation of mar sites with relatively short simulation period which lack the capability to evaluate the contribution of the mar operation to restoring the groundwater depletion of the entire plain region and support the decision making for an integrated groundwater management of the city in addition the boundary conditions of local modelling studies are normally defined as no flow or constant head boundary based on the groundwater contour map the uncertainty caused by the boundary conditions on the predicted result for the future scenarios has been addressed by different researchers liu et al 2009 rojas et al 2010 wu and zeng 2013 this paper aims at assessing the effectiveness of achieving sustainable groundwater development in the chaobai river area by implementing a large scale mar in the riverbed an innovative mar system consisting of 9 cascade terrace infiltration basins was designed in the 12 km long riverbed for artificial groundwater recharge with the multi scale groundwater flow and solute transport models the local mar system in the chaobai river and the regional groundwater flow in the beijing plain can be simulated simultaneously therefore a unique modelling strategy was carried out in a number of steps firstly a regional transient groundwater flow model was constructed from 1995 to 2018 to assess groundwater depletion in the beijing plain secondly a local groundwater flow model was developed for the pilot mar in the chaobai river coupled with the regional flow model the movement of the infiltrated water was tracked with a tracer transport model thirdly the long term effect of the designed large scale mar was simulated with the coupled model from 2020 to 2050 the findings from the model simulations support the implementation of the large scale mar as an effective measure to achieve sustainable groundwater resources development in the area 2 materials and methods 2 1 a review of groundwater model development in beijing plain the area of beijing has the typical characteristic of a piedmont plain surrounded by mountains in the north and west zhou et al 2013 the long term average annual precipitation and open pan water evaporation are 593 mm and 1728 mm respectively the temporal distribution of the rainfall is very uneven throughout the year 75 of the total rainfall occurs during the raining period from june to september two large rivers chaobai and yongding run dry most time since reservoirs were constructed at upstream in recent years beijing municipality started to rehabilitate these two rivers and implement pilot managed aquifer recharge the aquifer system varies from an unconfined aquifer near the foot of the mountains to multi layered semi confined aquifers downstream of the plain groundwater provides almost two thirds of the water supply for beijing city to manage the groundwater resources of the beijing plain regional groundwater studies began in the 1990s in 1995 an investigation of the groundwater resources in beijing was carried out groundwater storage and water budget components were calculated and analysed which provided solid information for the construction of a regional groundwater model of the beijing plain a three dimensional transient groundwater flow model was built to evaluate the groundwater resources from 1995 to 2005 using modflow 2000 han 2007 this transient flow model was extended to 2010 to analyse options for sustainable groundwater resources development zhou et al 2012 based on the previous modelling study an alternative model was constructed with the so called true layer model approach fig 1 a where model layers were truncated with the actual extension of aquifers and aquitards liu et al 2021a the conceptual model consists of five aquifers and four aquitards nine model layers were used to represent every aquifer and aquitard this regional model was calibrated in the steady state using the recharge and discharge data of the year 1995 in which the total groundwater recharge and discharge are approximately balanced afterwards coupled regional and local scale models with different refining methods were constructed and evaluated for the simulation of the mar scheme in the chaobai river catchment liu et al 2021b 2 2 extension of the regional transient groundwater flow model a new transient regional flow model was developed in this study to simulate groundwater flow changes in beijing plain from the year 1995 to 2018 with a monthly stress period using the modflow 2005 program in gms modelling environment aquaveo 2019 the total model area is 6 642 km2 and was discretised with a uniform grid of 1000 m by 1000 m the model consisted of 9 model layers corresponding to 5 aquifers and 4 aquitards in total 23 300 active cells were included in the model simulation the transient inputs of the old transient model for 1995 to 2010 were adopted and the model was extended to 2018 including recent changes in the reduction of groundwater abstractions since the delivery of the new water source to beijing from the south to north water diversion project by the end of 2014 the main sources and sinks of the flow model are depicted in fig 1 a monthly groundwater recharge series were extended using monthly meteorological data from 2011 to 2018 and simulated by the recharge rch package infiltration coefficients were assigned to recharge zones based on the characteristic of the land surface and soil type map of the infiltration coefficients can be found in supplementary materials a groundwater evaporation was simulated by the evapotranspiration evt package derived from the pan evaporation data abstraction was simulated by the well wel package and categorized into four types industrial use agricultural use township water supply and urban water supply well fields the annual groundwater abstractions for different usages were obtained from the beijing water resource bulletin beijing water authority 2021 the total amount of abstraction was allocated to each district and mapped to the corresponding grid cells in the model irrigation return flow was calculated based on the annual agricultural groundwater use and simulated by rch package pipeline leakage was simulated also by rch package and specified as a constant value in the city centre area since the rivers are dry most time and have water only during raining periods the amount of leakage was computed for raining periods and was simulated as injection rates in wel package lateral boundary flow from the mountainous region was derived from the annual water balance calculation of the beijing plain and simulated as injection wells by wel package the administrative borders in the south and east were specified as head dependent boundary simulated by general head boundary ghb package afterwards these model inputs were examined and adjusted by an inverse modelling process to check the consistency of the computed and observed groundwater level time series the hydraulic conductivities were optimised with pest in the previous model study liu et al 2021b the specific yield and specific storage values were obtained from the previous transient model zhou et al 2012 and manually adjusted for better model fit this calibrated model was used for the evaluation of the groundwater level and storage changes in response to the reductions of groundwater abstraction and to couple a local flow model for the design and simulation of the mar scheme in the chaobai river 2 3 simulation of pilot mar in chaobai river with multi scale transient models to simulate the mar operation in the chaobai river catchment the regional model grid was refined with the conventional grid refining method with variable spacing and the grid lines in each direction extends out to the model boundary chaobai river area into a local model grid and a site model grid in modflow 2005 fig 1 b d the area of the local model is 561 km2 and the uniform model grid size is 100 m the area of the mar site model is 26 6 km2 with a uniform model grid of 20 m by 20 m the determination of the local and site model boundary was tested iteratively which ensures the extents of the refined grid area are sufficient to capture the influence of the mar operation on the local groundwater flow field the mar site of the chaobai river channel is dry most of the time throughout the year because the reservoir upstream captures most of the river discharge the intense groundwater exploitation nearby the no 8 well field has created a large cone of depression in the surrounding area a feasibility study showed that this section of the river channel is an ideal place for the implementation of the mar system the pilot mar test started in 2015 source water from the south to north water diversion project webber et al 2017 was transferred to the niulanshan rubber dam and spread to the 1 5 km river channel fig 2 a it has been verified that the quality of the source water reaches the standard of category ii based on the chinese standard of groundwater quality aqsiq and sac 2017 which is better than the natural groundwater quality thus the risk of clogging problem caused by the artificial recharge is minimal the groundwater flow model was designed to simulate the variation of the groundwater level during and after the pilot mar test the infiltration process was simulated with the river riv package of the modflow program the 1 5 km river channel was divided into three polygons in the conceptual model fig 2 b the required input data include the head stage of the infiltration pond h the elevation of the pond bottom hb and the conductance of the riverbed cb the flow rate of the source water to the infiltration pond was obtained from beijing water authority the water depth of the infiltration pond was obtained from the inflow rate water release duration and the pond area the riverbed conductance was calibrated to match the infiltration rate of the pond equal to the measured rate detailed input data can be found in supplementary materials a in 2015 33 7 million m3 of water were infiltrated from the chaobai riverbed between august and november in 2016 10 3 million m3 of water were infiltrated in 15 days from july 20th in 2017 and 2018 pprox 44 million m3 of source water were infiltrated between may and november the groundwater levels in the monitoring wells nearby showed a significant increase in response to the pilot mar test during the non recharge period the groundwater levels decreased because of the continued abstraction in the no 8 well field the head stage of the riv package was set as the sum of the pond bottom elevation with the pond water depth during the recharge period during the non recharge period the head stage was assigned the same as the pond bottom elevation so that no infiltration takes place the conductance value was estimated based on the empirical value of the riverbed materials and calibrated by matching the computed river leakage with the inflow to the mar site 2 4 design and simulation of a full scale mar in chaobai river the pilot mar test in the chaobai river has shown the feasibility of the implementation of a full scale mar system in this scheme a total of 12 4 km dry riverbed was designed to be converted into nine terraced infiltration ponds with different lengths elevated from south to north zhou et al 2021 as is shown in fig 2 c the total recharge area is approximately 3 03 km2 the layout of the full scale mar scheme is shown in fig 2 d the source water is designed to flow into the mar infiltration ponds from the inlet at the upstream infiltration pond pond 9 the artificial recharge is planned from april to november each year with a 14 m3 s inflow rate of the source water the maintenance of the infiltration ponds will be done during the non recharge period in total 1 121 million m3 of water can be recharged daily to the unconfined aquifer beneath the mar site the estimated annual recharge capacity is about 290 million m3 for the simulation of this full scale mar operation the terraced infiltration ponds were conceptualized into nine polygons the bottom elevation of the pond and the conductance of the pond bottom were assigned to each polygon the water depth in each pond was set as 0 4 m which was derived from the designed inflow rate of the source water the properties of these nine infiltration ponds are specified in table 1 to simulate the long term effect of the full scale mar operation the simulation period was set from the year 2020 to 2050 with the monthly stress period other sources and sinks were kept the same as the current situation 2 5 tracking the movement of infiltrated water with hypothetical tracer using transport model the groundwater flow models of the mar simulation can help to analyse and predict the recovery of the groundwater head and storage the mixing process of the mar infiltrated water with the native groundwater needs to be simulated by a solute transport model ganot et al 2018 lautz and siegel 2006 ronayne et al 2017 in this study we are interested to track water particles from the infiltration pond to arrival at pumping wells in the no 8 well field so the hypothetical tracer representing water particles was simulated only with advective transport using m3tdms zheng and wang 1999 because of the stable and continuous groundwater abstraction of the no 8 well field the infiltrated mar water will partially be captured by the abstraction wells used for the urban water supply and partially stored in the aquifer as storage the groundwater abstracted from the no 8 well field qabs is the summation of the groundwater from two sources a natural groundwater qnatural and b mar infiltration qmar a hypothetical tracer was created to simulate the transport of the infiltrated water by the mt3dms program the tracer concentration in the mar infiltration ponds cmar was set as 100 mg l only advective transport with moc method was considered in this case which means the tracer is conservative and only moves with groundwater flow the concentration of the natural groundwater cnatural was defined as 0 mg l thus the concentration of the tracer at the no 8 well field cabs can be computed by the solute transport model the water balance and mass balance equations of the tracer can be written as follows 1 q natural q mar q abs 2 c natural q natural c mar q mar c abs q abs by dividing both equations with the well yield qabs applying cnatural 0 mg l and cmar 100 mg l into the equation 3 the fractions of the mar infiltrated water to the well fmar can be derived as eq 4 3 c naturral q naturaal q abs c mar q mar q abs c abs 4 f mar q mar q abs c abs c natural q natural q abs c mar c abs 100 thus the tracer concentration at the well field is equivalent to a mixing percentage of the mar water with the natural groundwater with this solute transport model the mixing process was traced and the movement of the mar water was tracked in addition the contribution of the mar water to the groundwater abstraction at the no 8 well field was quantified by checking the mass balance of the solute transport simulation result 3 results 3 1 transient model calibration the transient regional groundwater flow model was calibrated by minimizing the residuals of the computed and observed groundwater head by trial and error detailed model calibration information can be found in supplementary material a the time series of the computed and observed groundwater head in three wells in three typical locations are plotted in fig 3 these fitting curves show that the computed heads mimic long term variations of the observed heads groundwater levels in these 3 observation wells show a similar pattern of changes a long term trend of decrease and reversal of the decline in recent years observation well h01 is located in the shallow aquifer in the eastern plain area fig 3 a the groundwater level in this well dropped about 7 m from 1995 to 2016 seasonal periodic fluctuations indicate groundwater recharge in raining seasons the groundwater level in observation well h02 located near the beijing urban area shows a larger decrease of about 12 m until 2000 there are several drinking water plants surrounding the urban area mainly supplied by groundwater abstraction the rapid decrease of groundwater levels occurred in observation well h03 located in the chaobai river catchment the groundwater level dropped more than 40 m from 1995 to 2014 this large decline in groundwater levels was caused by intensive groundwater abstraction by the no 8 well field and huairou emergency well field the annual abstraction during the continuous drought from 1999 to 2010 was more than 200 million m3 in the no 8 well field to cope with the groundwater shortage huairou emergency well field was installed in 2003 which provided over 240 million m3 of water every year during the drought period in this period an estimated 1 28 billion m3 per year of groundwater was abstracted by these two well fields the arrival of the south water from the south to north water diversion project by the end of 2014 has reversed the trend of decrease since 2015 the huairou emergency well field has stopped operation and the annual groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field has been reduced to approximately 60 compared to the drought period combined with the artificial groundwater recharge in the chaobai river channel the groundwater level has recovered in recent years 3 2 the overexploitation of groundwater resources in beijing plain in general due to the frequent drought and intensive groundwater abstraction the groundwater level has decreased from 1995 until 2015 in most of the area fig 4 a c shows the simulated groundwater head distribution in the shallow aquifer a cone of depression gradually developed at the no 8 well field near the proposed mar site in the last 20 years the maximum drawdown reached 50 m near the no 8 well field in 2014 after the pilot mar operation at the chaobai mar site the cone of depression was reduced in 2018 the simulated groundwater head distribution in a deeper aquifer the third aquifer from the top is shown in fig 4 d f the cone of depression in the deep confined aquifer was caused by the over exploitation for industrial water supply since the leakage of groundwater in the shallow aquifer to the confined aquifer takes time groundwater levels in the confined aquifer are still decreasing the short term mar operation has not yet contributed to restoring the storage depletion in deeper aquifers it will take a longer operation time before the mar water reaches deeper aquifers fig 5 shows changes of major groundwater balance components and the cumulative groundwater storage change of the beijing plain the majority of groundwater recharge comes from precipitation infiltration and inflow from mountainous areas which varies depending on rainfall amounts groundwater abstraction dominates groundwater discharge two major events had marked impacts on groundwater resources in the beijing plain the consecutive drought from 1999 to 2010 reduced natural groundwater recharge and emergency groundwater abstraction to cope with the drought increased total groundwater abstraction these combined effects accelerated groundwater storage depletion since 1999 shown in fig 5 the cumulative storage depletion reached 12 billion m3 in 2014 the arrival of south water to beijing stopped further depletion of groundwater storage with the reduction of groundwater abstraction since 2015 however without increasing groundwater recharge to replenish the aquifer it would be difficult to recover the depleted groundwater storage in beijing plain water balance for all flow components is listed in supplementary 3 3 effects of the pilot mar operation in chaobai river the pilot mar operation was simulated by the local and site groundwater flow model from 2015 2018 fig 6 a c show the computed and observed groundwater head of three observation wells near the chaobai mar site the locations of these three wells are shown in fig 6 d the computed heads show good consistency with the observed groundwater heads the average residuals of the computed and observed values of these three wells are 1 1 m 0 36 m and 1 01 m the groundwater head recovery process after the mar implementation has been well captured by the local groundwater flow model the groundwater level in the shallow aquifer responded quickly to the pilot mar recharge during the artificial recharge period the groundwater level rises up significantly in the observation wells in the vicinity after the end of each recharge period the groundwater head was lowered due to the groundwater abstraction at the no 8 well field but shows an increasing trend in general the decrease in the groundwater level in the chaobai river catchment has been reversed and the groundwater storage has recovered since 2015 both the reduction of the groundwater abstraction and the pilot mar operation had contributions to the groundwater level increase in the chaobai river area the most significant increase in the groundwater level occurred near the huairou emergency well field the head increase surrounding the mar site has reached 10 m in these three years the groundwater head near the mar site increased significantly and formed a groundwater mound near the area under the infiltration pond the subregional water budget of the chaobai river catchment was computed with the zonebudget program zonbud harbaugh 1990 to analyse the monthly storage change fig 7 a and cumulative storage change fig 7 b because of the intensive groundwater exploitation in the chaobai river catchment the groundwater storage was depleted most of the time the aquifer was only replenished during the rainy season during the drought from 1999 to 2010 the aquifer storage barely recovered during the wet season the cumulative groundwater storage depletion in the chaobai river catchment reached more than 3 billion m3 fig 7 b after 2015 the aquifer received more artificial recharge with the mar infiltration the total recharge exceeded the total discharge so that the groundwater storage depletion was reversed in the chaobai river catchment 3 4 effectiveness of the full scale mar operation in the chaobai river the simulation of the full scale mar operation in the chaobai river shows that with the nine terraced infiltration ponds the groundwater level in the chaobai river catchment can be notably recovered fig 8 shows the predicted groundwater level change at the same 3 observation wells well locations shown in fig 6 d near the mar site and the predicted groundwater level distribution in the chaobai river catchment by the year 2050 after a 15 year operation of the full scale mar the groundwater system will approach a new equilibrium state and the groundwater level will be nearly stable over the year the minor variations in each year are caused by the seasonal change of the recharge and the suspension of the mar operation during the winter months generally the groundwater level would increase by 10 m to 20 m near the mar site which is very close to the ground surface with this magnitude of groundwater level increase the depleted aquifer will be replenished and the surface water in the infiltration ponds will have direct hydraulic connection with the groundwater fig 8 d is the predicted contour map of the beijing plain in the year 2050 compared with the current situation the large cone of depression in chaobai river catchment will be recovered the groundwater flow direction in the north part of the plain will return to the natural condition of an alluvial fan the predicted storage change of the chaobai river catchment is shown in fig 9 in the first seven year operation a high mar infiltration rate and large groundwater storage recovery can be obtained the total mar infiltration can reach up to 270 million m3 per year while the groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field remains at approximately 127 million m3 per year the average annual storage recovery in the first seven year operation will be about 180 million m3 year with an increase in groundwater storage in the area the groundwater depletion will be reversed and the cone of depression will be recovered with this large scale artificial groundwater recharge the groundwater discharge to the downstream will increase to 40 million m3 year in 2027 however the storage recovery will slow down sharply afterwards because the mar infiltration rate decreases with the increase of groundwater levels after 2027 by the year 2040 the annual mar infiltration rate will be maintained at around 140 million m3 year and the discharge to the downstream area will be around 27 million m3 every year the system will reach a new equilibrium state in 2050 with the planned full scale mar operation 4 discussion numerical modelling of the groundwater availability is a useful tool for the groundwater management it has been proved that fragmented and piecemeal arrangements are inadequate to meet the water challenge under the future change in climate and the human activities sophocleous 2010 an integrated groundwater model that is continually updated and refined with new data and new groundwater related projects are very important for the decision maker to evaluate the proposed groundwater management strategies and formulate future policy towards the sustainable groundwater development gleeson et al 2010 sophocleous 2010 in beijing modelling studies about the mar implementation are mostly constructed on local scale for the demand of each specific project for example the groundwater modelling study for mar in the yongding river catchment included a model area of 888 km2 and defined the western boundary as no flow boundary and the eastern boundary as the general head boundary ji et al 2021 flow and transport models were constructed in downstream chaobai river in a 255 km2 area to evaluate the impact of infiltrating reclaimed water into the riverbed constant head and general head boundary were applied jiang et al 2022 these assumptions on boundary conditions may be adequate for the short term simulation however groundwater flow dynamics could change dramatically in the region that is highly urbanised and with intensive human activities like beijing plain the assumptions on the boundary conditions on the local model would lead to inaccurate long term prediction results the multi scale groundwater flow model in beijing plain we present in this study can overcome the deficiencies of previous model studies the simulation of the local scale mar project will not be restricted by the boundary of the local model but interlinked with the regional groundwater flow model moreover combining with the solute transport model more insight can be obtained however the accuracy of the tracer transport simulation can be improved with a finer grid we compared the simulation result from a finer grid model with a coarser grid model it turns out that increasing grid resolution can delineate tracer distribution more accurately thus a multi scale model is an optimal choice to balance the computational time and the required accuracy of the solute transport simulation more detailed discussion can be found in supplementary materials c 4 1 the mixing of the infiltrated water with the native groundwater during the pilot mar test fig 10 shows the development of the mixing zone of the mar water in different years represented by the concentration distribution at the beginning of the mar operation in 2015 the infiltrated water started to enter the aquifer shortly but only stayed beneath the infiltration ponds with the formation of groundwater mound under the infiltration ponds the infiltrated water was transported into the aquifer in all directions a large portion of the mar recharged water was captured by groundwater abstraction at the no 8 well field which prevented the mar water to move further to the east of the mar site after the 3 year artificial recharge the mixing zone of mar water reached 3 2 km2 with 500 m to 700 m extent to each direction of the mar site the contributions of the mar infiltrated water to some abstraction wells are presented as breakthrough curves in fig 11 the arrival time and fraction of mar water in the well depend on the location and distance of wells from the mar site the abstracted groundwater in well 01 is 100 mar infiltrated water all the time since the beginning of the mar operation in well 03 and well 05 mar water has become the dominant source during the recharge period during the period without the artificial recharge the proportion of the mar water to the wells was reduced in well 07 only until the third year of the artificial recharge a high percentage of mar water was detected the mar water was not detected in other wells located the north of the infiltration pond further than well 07 the mass balance of the solute transport model has also been analysed the total cumulative mass entering the aquifer from the infiltration ponds and total mass captured by the abstraction wells are plotted in fig 12 the ratio between these two mass volumes indicates the percentage of the mar water abstracted by the no 8 well field the graph shows at the beginning of the artificial recharge the contribution of mar water in the total abstraction is very limited after three years in total approximately 40 of the infiltrated mar water was abstracted by the no 8 well field and directly served for the domestic water supply of beijing city the other 60 of the infiltrated water stayed in the aquifer contributing to the groundwater level recovery and storage restoration 4 2 the long term effect of the full scale mar operation on the chaobai river catchment the mixing process of the full scale mar operation has also been analysed to predict the future trend fig 13 generally with the designed mar scheme the mixing zone of the mar water and the native groundwater will keep increasing in the next 30 years the area of the mixing zone will be developed from 27 64 km2 in 2025 to 57 03 km2 in 2035 however after 2035 the development of the mixing zone becomes slower the area of the mixing zone will be 61 86 km2 63 96 km2 and 65 12 km2 in the years 2040 2045 and 2050 respectively the shape of the mixing zone develops evenly in the west north and south of the mar site the mixing zone has a limited extent in the east due to the continuous abstraction by the no 8 well field the mixing zone can serve as the protection zone of the mar site which is also one of the key elements of the mar project design with the full scale mar operation shallow groundwater levels will occur in the vicinity of the mar site which might cause the hazard of groundwater contamination and threatens the safety of the urban water supply thus the solid waste disposal sites in the mixing zone should be surveyed and evaluated before the full scale implementation to avoid the risk of pollution the mass balance from the mt3dms model fig 14 a shows that at the beginning of the full scale mar operation only 14 3 of the infiltrated mar water was captured by the pumping wells in the no 8 well field with the spreading of the mar water in the aquifer more mar water will be intercepted by the no 8 well field based on the cumulative mass balance result by the year 2050 58 of the infiltrated water will be abstracted for the urban water supply 42 of the infiltrated water will stay in the aquifer formed as groundwater storage in this 30 year operation of the system among the 6 2 billion m3 of water being infiltrated into the aquifer 3 6 billion m3 will be abstracted for the urban water supply which accounts for 91 of the total groundwater abstraction at the no 8 well field thus the water from the mar project will be the major source for groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field the predicted total groundwater budget of the chaobai river catchment is summarised in fig 14 b in the early stages due to the high infiltration from the mar implementation the total groundwater inflow in the chaobai area will be up to 530 million m3 in 2020 and gradually lower to 350 million m3 in 2035 with the groundwater level increase in the vicinity the total outflow of the area will only slightly increase from 285 million m3 to 333 million m3 due to the larger discharge to the downstream aquifer thus with the current groundwater management strategy the groundwater storage will be accumulated rapidly at first and gently level off until asymptotic to the new equilibrium stage the groundwater depletion caused by the over exploitation from the last decades will be gradually compensated up to 2050 the cumulative storage increase in the chaobai area will reach 2 2 billion m3 it is convinced that the sustainable groundwater development of the chaobai river region is achievable with the combination of the mar implementation and groundwater management plan however the impact of the future climate change on the groundwater sustainability of the region still needs to be considered 4 3 the decrease of infiltration rate of long term operation of the full scale mar scheme in the current situation the groundwater level is approximately 30 m lower than the bottom elevation of the infiltration ponds and the surface water is hydraulically disconnected with the groundwater the aquifer will be recharged with the maximum infiltration rate however with the increase of the groundwater level above the infiltration pond bottom the groundwater and surface water will be hydraulically connected and the infiltration rate will gradually decrease by running the long term full scale mar simulation the infiltration rate of each pond can be predicted fig 15 shows the change in the infiltration rate with time for each infiltration pond at the early stage of the full scale mar operation all infiltration ponds can be operated with the maximum infiltration rate because the groundwater levels are below the bottom of the ponds however with the current groundwater abstraction rate and the designed mar recharge plan the decrease of the infiltration rate will start in 2027 when the groundwater level in the south becomes higher than the bottom elevation of the infiltration ponds ponds 7 8 and 9 in the north part of the mar site will maintain a high infiltration rate because groundwater levels remain below the pond bottom in those areas among the nine infiltration ponds the largest decrease in the infiltration rate occurs in the fourth pond which is the pond where the predicted groundwater head reaches the pond bottom earliest the infiltration rate of other ponds in the south ponds 1 2 and 3 will also drop to some extent however because of the existence of the no 8 well field the infiltrated water will be abstracted for urban water supply this groundwater abstraction forces extra infiltration capacity for ponds 1 2 and 3 so that the long term infiltration rate of these ponds can be still maintained between 0 2 m d to 0 3 m d by the year 2050 these results show that in the early stage of the mar operation the most important factor to obtain high infiltration capacity is the volume of the underground space however to design a sustainable long term mar scheme it is vital to optimize the infiltration rate to ensure the infiltrated water can spread to the aquifer to a large extent as groundwater storage or can be directly abstracted for water supply in the recent decade reducing groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field has been advocated and implemented however the reduction of the groundwater abstraction will also limit the infiltration capacity of the mar system for a mega city like beijing increasing water demand is inevitable in the future the implementation of the mar and the groundwater exploitation are complementary on the one hand the mar provides a secure water source for the groundwater abstraction on the other hand a moderate level of groundwater exploitation in the area can stimulate the potential of the mar infiltration capacity 5 conclusions the transient simulation of the regional groundwater flow from 1995 to 2018 revealed large changes in groundwater level and storage in the beijing plain the severe groundwater depletion was exacerbated by the consecutive drought from 1999 to 2010 during which natural groundwater recharge was reduced while groundwater abstraction was intensified the south to north water diversion project was implemented and the south water from the yangtze river arrived in beijing in 2014 to substitute equivalent groundwater abstractions since 2015 the trend of groundwater level decline was reduced in the shallow aquifer the excess of the south water was also used for artificial groundwater recharge in the chaobai river channel starting in 2015 the coupled multi scale model simulation shows that the pilot mar system has recharged approximately 130 million m3 of water during 2015 2018 a water table mound was formed beneath the mar site with a maximum recovery of groundwater levels of more than 10 m about 40 of the infiltrated water was captured by pumping wells in the no 8 well field which contributes directly to the water supply in beijing the effects of the long term operation of the full scale mar were simulated with the coupled multi scale flow and transport models from 2020 to 2050 the simulation results show that the designed mar scheme with 9 cascade terraced infiltration ponds in the chaobai river catchment is very effective in restoring the depleted aquifer storage and maintaining the groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field after about 15 years of operation the cone of the depression and groundwater levels will stabilize as the aquifer system approaches a new equilibrium state by the year 2050 about 91 of the total abstraction in the no 8 well field will come from the infiltrated water sustainable groundwater resources development can be achieved in the chaobai river catchment the model results also show that with the increasing groundwater level beneath the infiltration ponds the infiltration rate of several infiltration ponds will decrease to maintain a high infiltration rate groundwater levels beneath the ponds should be kept below the bottom of the ponds therefore groundwater abstractions in the no 8 well field should be continued with the current capacity other environmental problems associated with the rising water table should be investigated which is beyond the scope of this research this integrated modelling approach with coupled regional and locale flow and transport processes is an effective tool for designing and assessing mar schemes the developed model in this study will be applied to the assess effects of river leakage as a managed aquifer recharge method in the yongding river in the beijing plain the model approach adopted in this study can also be applied to the design and assessment of mar projects in the world credit authorship contribution statement sida liu data curation formal analysis investigation methodology

2926,intensive groundwater exploitation has depleted groundwater storage and led to a series of geo environmental problems in beijing plain china managed aquifer recharge mar has been endorsed to mitigate the groundwater storage depletion and achieve groundwater sustainability a pilot mar has been tested in the chaobai river catchment since 2015 an innovative large scale mar consisting of 9 cascade terraced infiltration ponds was proposed and its effectiveness was assessed in this study using an integrated modelling approach the integrated model coupled the regional and local transient flow and transport processes the transient regional flow model simulated historical groundwater level declines and storage depletion in the beijing plain from 1995 to 2018 the coupled regional and local flow model was used to simulate the pilot mar test in the chaobai river from 2015 to 2018 a significant groundwater level increase was observed nearby the pilot mar since 2015 the transport model results indicate that approximately 40 of the infiltrated water was captured by pumping wells in the no 8 well field the models were further used to assess the long term effects of the large scale mar from 2020 to 2050 the simulation results show that the groundwater system will reach a new equilibrium state under the implementation of the large scale mar scheme almost 91 of the abstracted water in the no 8 well field will come from the mar infiltration the proposed large scale mar is very effective in restoring the depleted aquifer storage and maintaining the groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field however with the increase of the groundwater level the infiltration rate of several ponds will decrease therefore it is important to maintain a dynamic balance

to the local scale simulation of mar sites with relatively short simulation period which lack the capability to evaluate the contribution of the mar operation to restoring the groundwater depletion of the entire plain region and support the decision making for an integrated groundwater management of the city in addition the boundary conditions of local modelling studies are normally defined as no flow or constant head boundary based on the groundwater contour map the uncertainty caused by the boundary conditions on the predicted result for the future scenarios has been addressed by different researchers liu et al 2009 rojas et al 2010 wu and zeng 2013 this paper aims at assessing the effectiveness of achieving sustainable groundwater development in the chaobai river area by implementing a large scale mar in the riverbed an innovative mar system consisting of 9 cascade terrace infiltration basins was designed in the 12 km long riverbed for artificial groundwater recharge with the multi scale groundwater flow and solute transport models the local mar system in the chaobai river and the regional groundwater flow in the beijing plain can be simulated simultaneously therefore a unique modelling strategy was carried out in a number of steps firstly a regional transient groundwater flow model was constructed from 1995 to 2018 to assess groundwater depletion in the beijing plain secondly a local groundwater flow model was developed for the pilot mar in the chaobai river coupled with the regional flow model the movement of the infiltrated water was tracked with a tracer transport model thirdly the long term effect of the designed large scale mar was simulated with the coupled model from 2020 to 2050 the findings from the model simulations support the implementation of the large scale mar as an effective measure to achieve sustainable groundwater resources development in the area 2 materials and methods 2 1 a review of groundwater model development in beijing plain the area of beijing has the typical characteristic of a piedmont plain surrounded by mountains in the north and west zhou et al 2013 the long term average annual precipitation and open pan water evaporation are 593 mm and 1728 mm respectively the temporal distribution of the rainfall is very uneven throughout the year 75 of the total rainfall occurs during the raining period from june to september two large rivers chaobai and yongding run dry most time since reservoirs were constructed at upstream in recent years beijing municipality started to rehabilitate these two rivers and implement pilot managed aquifer recharge the aquifer system varies from an unconfined aquifer near the foot of the mountains to multi layered semi confined aquifers downstream of the plain groundwater provides almost two thirds of the water supply for beijing city to manage the groundwater resources of the beijing plain regional groundwater studies began in the 1990s in 1995 an investigation of the groundwater resources in beijing was carried out groundwater storage and water budget components were calculated and analysed which provided solid information for the construction of a regional groundwater model of the beijing plain a three dimensional transient groundwater flow model was built to evaluate the groundwater resources from 1995 to 2005 using modflow 2000 han 2007 this transient flow model was extended to 2010 to analyse options for sustainable groundwater resources development zhou et al 2012 based on the previous modelling study an alternative model was constructed with the so called true layer model approach fig 1 a where model layers were truncated with the actual extension of aquifers and aquitards liu et al 2021a the conceptual model consists of five aquifers and four aquitards nine model layers were used to represent every aquifer and aquitard this regional model was calibrated in the steady state using the recharge and discharge data of the year 1995 in which the total groundwater recharge and discharge are approximately balanced afterwards coupled regional and local scale models with different refining methods were constructed and evaluated for the simulation of the mar scheme in the chaobai river catchment liu et al 2021b 2 2 extension of the regional transient groundwater flow model a new transient regional flow model was developed in this study to simulate groundwater flow changes in beijing plain from the year 1995 to 2018 with a monthly stress period using the modflow 2005 program in gms modelling environment aquaveo 2019 the total model area is 6 642 km2 and was discretised with a uniform grid of 1000 m by 1000 m the model consisted of 9 model layers corresponding to 5 aquifers and 4 aquitards in total 23 300 active cells were included in the model simulation the transient inputs of the old transient model for 1995 to 2010 were adopted and the model was extended to 2018 including recent changes in the reduction of groundwater abstractions since the delivery of the new water source to beijing from the south to north water diversion project by the end of 2014 the main sources and sinks of the flow model are depicted in fig 1 a monthly groundwater recharge series were extended using monthly meteorological data from 2011 to 2018 and simulated by the recharge rch package infiltration coefficients were assigned to recharge zones based on the characteristic of the land surface and soil type map of the infiltration coefficients can be found in supplementary materials a groundwater evaporation was simulated by the evapotranspiration evt package derived from the pan evaporation data abstraction was simulated by the well wel package and categorized into four types industrial use agricultural use township water supply and urban water supply well fields the annual groundwater abstractions for different usages were obtained from the beijing water resource bulletin beijing water authority 2021 the total amount of abstraction was allocated to each district and mapped to the corresponding grid cells in the model irrigation return flow was calculated based on the annual agricultural groundwater use and simulated by rch package pipeline leakage was simulated also by rch package and specified as a constant value in the city centre area since the rivers are dry most time and have water only during raining periods the amount of leakage was computed for raining periods and was simulated as injection rates in wel package lateral boundary flow from the mountainous region was derived from the annual water balance calculation of the beijing plain and simulated as injection wells by wel package the administrative borders in the south and east were specified as head dependent boundary simulated by general head boundary ghb package afterwards these model inputs were examined and adjusted by an inverse modelling process to check the consistency of the computed and observed groundwater level time series the hydraulic conductivities were optimised with pest in the previous model study liu et al 2021b the specific yield and specific storage values were obtained from the previous transient model zhou et al 2012 and manually adjusted for better model fit this calibrated model was used for the evaluation of the groundwater level and storage changes in response to the reductions of groundwater abstraction and to couple a local flow model for the design and simulation of the mar scheme in the chaobai river 2 3 simulation of pilot mar in chaobai river with multi scale transient models to simulate the mar operation in the chaobai river catchment the regional model grid was refined with the conventional grid refining method with variable spacing and the grid lines in each direction extends out to the model boundary chaobai river area into a local model grid and a site model grid in modflow 2005 fig 1 b d the area of the local model is 561 km2 and the uniform model grid size is 100 m the area of the mar site model is 26 6 km2 with a uniform model grid of 20 m by 20 m the determination of the local and site model boundary was tested iteratively which ensures the extents of the refined grid area are sufficient to capture the influence of the mar operation on the local groundwater flow field the mar site of the chaobai river channel is dry most of the time throughout the year because the reservoir upstream captures most of the river discharge the intense groundwater exploitation nearby the no 8 well field has created a large cone of depression in the surrounding area a feasibility study showed that this section of the river channel is an ideal place for the implementation of the mar system the pilot mar test started in 2015 source water from the south to north water diversion project webber et al 2017 was transferred to the niulanshan rubber dam and spread to the 1 5 km river channel fig 2 a it has been verified that the quality of the source water reaches the standard of category ii based on the chinese standard of groundwater quality aqsiq and sac 2017 which is better than the natural groundwater quality thus the risk of clogging problem caused by the artificial recharge is minimal the groundwater flow model was designed to simulate the variation of the groundwater level during and after the pilot mar test the infiltration process was simulated with the river riv package of the modflow program the 1 5 km river channel was divided into three polygons in the conceptual model fig 2 b the required input data include the head stage of the infiltration pond h the elevation of the pond bottom hb and the conductance of the riverbed cb the flow rate of the source water to the infiltration pond was obtained from beijing water authority the water depth of the infiltration pond was obtained from the inflow rate water release duration and the pond area the riverbed conductance was calibrated to match the infiltration rate of the pond equal to the measured rate detailed input data can be found in supplementary materials a in 2015 33 7 million m3 of water were infiltrated from the chaobai riverbed between august and november in 2016 10 3 million m3 of water were infiltrated in 15 days from july 20th in 2017 and 2018 pprox 44 million m3 of source water were infiltrated between may and november the groundwater levels in the monitoring wells nearby showed a significant increase in response to the pilot mar test during the non recharge period the groundwater levels decreased because of the continued abstraction in the no 8 well field the head stage of the riv package was set as the sum of the pond bottom elevation with the pond water depth during the recharge period during the non recharge period the head stage was assigned the same as the pond bottom elevation so that no infiltration takes place the conductance value was estimated based on the empirical value of the riverbed materials and calibrated by matching the computed river leakage with the inflow to the mar site 2 4 design and simulation of a full scale mar in chaobai river the pilot mar test in the chaobai river has shown the feasibility of the implementation of a full scale mar system in this scheme a total of 12 4 km dry riverbed was designed to be converted into nine terraced infiltration ponds with different lengths elevated from south to north zhou et al 2021 as is shown in fig 2 c the total recharge area is approximately 3 03 km2 the layout of the full scale mar scheme is shown in fig 2 d the source water is designed to flow into the mar infiltration ponds from the inlet at the upstream infiltration pond pond 9 the artificial recharge is planned from april to november each year with a 14 m3 s inflow rate of the source water the maintenance of the infiltration ponds will be done during the non recharge period in total 1 121 million m3 of water can be recharged daily to the unconfined aquifer beneath the mar site the estimated annual recharge capacity is about 290 million m3 for the simulation of this full scale mar operation the terraced infiltration ponds were conceptualized into nine polygons the bottom elevation of the pond and the conductance of the pond bottom were assigned to each polygon the water depth in each pond was set as 0 4 m which was derived from the designed inflow rate of the source water the properties of these nine infiltration ponds are specified in table 1 to simulate the long term effect of the full scale mar operation the simulation period was set from the year 2020 to 2050 with the monthly stress period other sources and sinks were kept the same as the current situation 2 5 tracking the movement of infiltrated water with hypothetical tracer using transport model the groundwater flow models of the mar simulation can help to analyse and predict the recovery of the groundwater head and storage the mixing process of the mar infiltrated water with the native groundwater needs to be simulated by a solute transport model ganot et al 2018 lautz and siegel 2006 ronayne et al 2017 in this study we are interested to track water particles from the infiltration pond to arrival at pumping wells in the no 8 well field so the hypothetical tracer representing water particles was simulated only with advective transport using m3tdms zheng and wang 1999 because of the stable and continuous groundwater abstraction of the no 8 well field the infiltrated mar water will partially be captured by the abstraction wells used for the urban water supply and partially stored in the aquifer as storage the groundwater abstracted from the no 8 well field qabs is the summation of the groundwater from two sources a natural groundwater qnatural and b mar infiltration qmar a hypothetical tracer was created to simulate the transport of the infiltrated water by the mt3dms program the tracer concentration in the mar infiltration ponds cmar was set as 100 mg l only advective transport with moc method was considered in this case which means the tracer is conservative and only moves with groundwater flow the concentration of the natural groundwater cnatural was defined as 0 mg l thus the concentration of the tracer at the no 8 well field cabs can be computed by the solute transport model the water balance and mass balance equations of the tracer can be written as follows 1 q natural q mar q abs 2 c natural q natural c mar q mar c abs q abs by dividing both equations with the well yield qabs applying cnatural 0 mg l and cmar 100 mg l into the equation 3 the fractions of the mar infiltrated water to the well fmar can be derived as eq 4 3 c naturral q naturaal q abs c mar q mar q abs c abs 4 f mar q mar q abs c abs c natural q natural q abs c mar c abs 100 thus the tracer concentration at the well field is equivalent to a mixing percentage of the mar water with the natural groundwater with this solute transport model the mixing process was traced and the movement of the mar water was tracked in addition the contribution of the mar water to the groundwater abstraction at the no 8 well field was quantified by checking the mass balance of the solute transport simulation result 3 results 3 1 transient model calibration the transient regional groundwater flow model was calibrated by minimizing the residuals of the computed and observed groundwater head by trial and error detailed model calibration information can be found in supplementary material a the time series of the computed and observed groundwater head in three wells in three typical locations are plotted in fig 3 these fitting curves show that the computed heads mimic long term variations of the observed heads groundwater levels in these 3 observation wells show a similar pattern of changes a long term trend of decrease and reversal of the decline in recent years observation well h01 is located in the shallow aquifer in the eastern plain area fig 3 a the groundwater level in this well dropped about 7 m from 1995 to 2016 seasonal periodic fluctuations indicate groundwater recharge in raining seasons the groundwater level in observation well h02 located near the beijing urban area shows a larger decrease of about 12 m until 2000 there are several drinking water plants surrounding the urban area mainly supplied by groundwater abstraction the rapid decrease of groundwater levels occurred in observation well h03 located in the chaobai river catchment the groundwater level dropped more than 40 m from 1995 to 2014 this large decline in groundwater levels was caused by intensive groundwater abstraction by the no 8 well field and huairou emergency well field the annual abstraction during the continuous drought from 1999 to 2010 was more than 200 million m3 in the no 8 well field to cope with the groundwater shortage huairou emergency well field was installed in 2003 which provided over 240 million m3 of water every year during the drought period in this period an estimated 1 28 billion m3 per year of groundwater was abstracted by these two well fields the arrival of the south water from the south to north water diversion project by the end of 2014 has reversed the trend of decrease since 2015 the huairou emergency well field has stopped operation and the annual groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field has been reduced to approximately 60 compared to the drought period combined with the artificial groundwater recharge in the chaobai river channel the groundwater level has recovered in recent years 3 2 the overexploitation of groundwater resources in beijing plain in general due to the frequent drought and intensive groundwater abstraction the groundwater level has decreased from 1995 until 2015 in most of the area fig 4 a c shows the simulated groundwater head distribution in the shallow aquifer a cone of depression gradually developed at the no 8 well field near the proposed mar site in the last 20 years the maximum drawdown reached 50 m near the no 8 well field in 2014 after the pilot mar operation at the chaobai mar site the cone of depression was reduced in 2018 the simulated groundwater head distribution in a deeper aquifer the third aquifer from the top is shown in fig 4 d f the cone of depression in the deep confined aquifer was caused by the over exploitation for industrial water supply since the leakage of groundwater in the shallow aquifer to the confined aquifer takes time groundwater levels in the confined aquifer are still decreasing the short term mar operation has not yet contributed to restoring the storage depletion in deeper aquifers it will take a longer operation time before the mar water reaches deeper aquifers fig 5 shows changes of major groundwater balance components and the cumulative groundwater storage change of the beijing plain the majority of groundwater recharge comes from precipitation infiltration and inflow from mountainous areas which varies depending on rainfall amounts groundwater abstraction dominates groundwater discharge two major events had marked impacts on groundwater resources in the beijing plain the consecutive drought from 1999 to 2010 reduced natural groundwater recharge and emergency groundwater abstraction to cope with the drought increased total groundwater abstraction these combined effects accelerated groundwater storage depletion since 1999 shown in fig 5 the cumulative storage depletion reached 12 billion m3 in 2014 the arrival of south water to beijing stopped further depletion of groundwater storage with the reduction of groundwater abstraction since 2015 however without increasing groundwater recharge to replenish the aquifer it would be difficult to recover the depleted groundwater storage in beijing plain water balance for all flow components is listed in supplementary 3 3 effects of the pilot mar operation in chaobai river the pilot mar operation was simulated by the local and site groundwater flow model from 2015 2018 fig 6 a c show the computed and observed groundwater head of three observation wells near the chaobai mar site the locations of these three wells are shown in fig 6 d the computed heads show good consistency with the observed groundwater heads the average residuals of the computed and observed values of these three wells are 1 1 m 0 36 m and 1 01 m the groundwater head recovery process after the mar implementation has been well captured by the local groundwater flow model the groundwater level in the shallow aquifer responded quickly to the pilot mar recharge during the artificial recharge period the groundwater level rises up significantly in the observation wells in the vicinity after the end of each recharge period the groundwater head was lowered due to the groundwater abstraction at the no 8 well field but shows an increasing trend in general the decrease in the groundwater level in the chaobai river catchment has been reversed and the groundwater storage has recovered since 2015 both the reduction of the groundwater abstraction and the pilot mar operation had contributions to the groundwater level increase in the chaobai river area the most significant increase in the groundwater level occurred near the huairou emergency well field the head increase surrounding the mar site has reached 10 m in these three years the groundwater head near the mar site increased significantly and formed a groundwater mound near the area under the infiltration pond the subregional water budget of the chaobai river catchment was computed with the zonebudget program zonbud harbaugh 1990 to analyse the monthly storage change fig 7 a and cumulative storage change fig 7 b because of the intensive groundwater exploitation in the chaobai river catchment the groundwater storage was depleted most of the time the aquifer was only replenished during the rainy season during the drought from 1999 to 2010 the aquifer storage barely recovered during the wet season the cumulative groundwater storage depletion in the chaobai river catchment reached more than 3 billion m3 fig 7 b after 2015 the aquifer received more artificial recharge with the mar infiltration the total recharge exceeded the total discharge so that the groundwater storage depletion was reversed in the chaobai river catchment 3 4 effectiveness of the full scale mar operation in the chaobai river the simulation of the full scale mar operation in the chaobai river shows that with the nine terraced infiltration ponds the groundwater level in the chaobai river catchment can be notably recovered fig 8 shows the predicted groundwater level change at the same 3 observation wells well locations shown in fig 6 d near the mar site and the predicted groundwater level distribution in the chaobai river catchment by the year 2050 after a 15 year operation of the full scale mar the groundwater system will approach a new equilibrium state and the groundwater level will be nearly stable over the year the minor variations in each year are caused by the seasonal change of the recharge and the suspension of the mar operation during the winter months generally the groundwater level would increase by 10 m to 20 m near the mar site which is very close to the ground surface with this magnitude of groundwater level increase the depleted aquifer will be replenished and the surface water in the infiltration ponds will have direct hydraulic connection with the groundwater fig 8 d is the predicted contour map of the beijing plain in the year 2050 compared with the current situation the large cone of depression in chaobai river catchment will be recovered the groundwater flow direction in the north part of the plain will return to the natural condition of an alluvial fan the predicted storage change of the chaobai river catchment is shown in fig 9 in the first seven year operation a high mar infiltration rate and large groundwater storage recovery can be obtained the total mar infiltration can reach up to 270 million m3 per year while the groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field remains at approximately 127 million m3 per year the average annual storage recovery in the first seven year operation will be about 180 million m3 year with an increase in groundwater storage in the area the groundwater depletion will be reversed and the cone of depression will be recovered with this large scale artificial groundwater recharge the groundwater discharge to the downstream will increase to 40 million m3 year in 2027 however the storage recovery will slow down sharply afterwards because the mar infiltration rate decreases with the increase of groundwater levels after 2027 by the year 2040 the annual mar infiltration rate will be maintained at around 140 million m3 year and the discharge to the downstream area will be around 27 million m3 every year the system will reach a new equilibrium state in 2050 with the planned full scale mar operation 4 discussion numerical modelling of the groundwater availability is a useful tool for the groundwater management it has been proved that fragmented and piecemeal arrangements are inadequate to meet the water challenge under the future change in climate and the human activities sophocleous 2010 an integrated groundwater model that is continually updated and refined with new data and new groundwater related projects are very important for the decision maker to evaluate the proposed groundwater management strategies and formulate future policy towards the sustainable groundwater development gleeson et al 2010 sophocleous 2010 in beijing modelling studies about the mar implementation are mostly constructed on local scale for the demand of each specific project for example the groundwater modelling study for mar in the yongding river catchment included a model area of 888 km2 and defined the western boundary as no flow boundary and the eastern boundary as the general head boundary ji et al 2021 flow and transport models were constructed in downstream chaobai river in a 255 km2 area to evaluate the impact of infiltrating reclaimed water into the riverbed constant head and general head boundary were applied jiang et al 2022 these assumptions on boundary conditions may be adequate for the short term simulation however groundwater flow dynamics could change dramatically in the region that is highly urbanised and with intensive human activities like beijing plain the assumptions on the boundary conditions on the local model would lead to inaccurate long term prediction results the multi scale groundwater flow model in beijing plain we present in this study can overcome the deficiencies of previous model studies the simulation of the local scale mar project will not be restricted by the boundary of the local model but interlinked with the regional groundwater flow model moreover combining with the solute transport model more insight can be obtained however the accuracy of the tracer transport simulation can be improved with a finer grid we compared the simulation result from a finer grid model with a coarser grid model it turns out that increasing grid resolution can delineate tracer distribution more accurately thus a multi scale model is an optimal choice to balance the computational time and the required accuracy of the solute transport simulation more detailed discussion can be found in supplementary materials c 4 1 the mixing of the infiltrated water with the native groundwater during the pilot mar test fig 10 shows the development of the mixing zone of the mar water in different years represented by the concentration distribution at the beginning of the mar operation in 2015 the infiltrated water started to enter the aquifer shortly but only stayed beneath the infiltration ponds with the formation of groundwater mound under the infiltration ponds the infiltrated water was transported into the aquifer in all directions a large portion of the mar recharged water was captured by groundwater abstraction at the no 8 well field which prevented the mar water to move further to the east of the mar site after the 3 year artificial recharge the mixing zone of mar water reached 3 2 km2 with 500 m to 700 m extent to each direction of the mar site the contributions of the mar infiltrated water to some abstraction wells are presented as breakthrough curves in fig 11 the arrival time and fraction of mar water in the well depend on the location and distance of wells from the mar site the abstracted groundwater in well 01 is 100 mar infiltrated water all the time since the beginning of the mar operation in well 03 and well 05 mar water has become the dominant source during the recharge period during the period without the artificial recharge the proportion of the mar water to the wells was reduced in well 07 only until the third year of the artificial recharge a high percentage of mar water was detected the mar water was not detected in other wells located the north of the infiltration pond further than well 07 the mass balance of the solute transport model has also been analysed the total cumulative mass entering the aquifer from the infiltration ponds and total mass captured by the abstraction wells are plotted in fig 12 the ratio between these two mass volumes indicates the percentage of the mar water abstracted by the no 8 well field the graph shows at the beginning of the artificial recharge the contribution of mar water in the total abstraction is very limited after three years in total approximately 40 of the infiltrated mar water was abstracted by the no 8 well field and directly served for the domestic water supply of beijing city the other 60 of the infiltrated water stayed in the aquifer contributing to the groundwater level recovery and storage restoration 4 2 the long term effect of the full scale mar operation on the chaobai river catchment the mixing process of the full scale mar operation has also been analysed to predict the future trend fig 13 generally with the designed mar scheme the mixing zone of the mar water and the native groundwater will keep increasing in the next 30 years the area of the mixing zone will be developed from 27 64 km2 in 2025 to 57 03 km2 in 2035 however after 2035 the development of the mixing zone becomes slower the area of the mixing zone will be 61 86 km2 63 96 km2 and 65 12 km2 in the years 2040 2045 and 2050 respectively the shape of the mixing zone develops evenly in the west north and south of the mar site the mixing zone has a limited extent in the east due to the continuous abstraction by the no 8 well field the mixing zone can serve as the protection zone of the mar site which is also one of the key elements of the mar project design with the full scale mar operation shallow groundwater levels will occur in the vicinity of the mar site which might cause the hazard of groundwater contamination and threatens the safety of the urban water supply thus the solid waste disposal sites in the mixing zone should be surveyed and evaluated before the full scale implementation to avoid the risk of pollution the mass balance from the mt3dms model fig 14 a shows that at the beginning of the full scale mar operation only 14 3 of the infiltrated mar water was captured by the pumping wells in the no 8 well field with the spreading of the mar water in the aquifer more mar water will be intercepted by the no 8 well field based on the cumulative mass balance result by the year 2050 58 of the infiltrated water will be abstracted for the urban water supply 42 of the infiltrated water will stay in the aquifer formed as groundwater storage in this 30 year operation of the system among the 6 2 billion m3 of water being infiltrated into the aquifer 3 6 billion m3 will be abstracted for the urban water supply which accounts for 91 of the total groundwater abstraction at the no 8 well field thus the water from the mar project will be the major source for groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field the predicted total groundwater budget of the chaobai river catchment is summarised in fig 14 b in the early stages due to the high infiltration from the mar implementation the total groundwater inflow in the chaobai area will be up to 530 million m3 in 2020 and gradually lower to 350 million m3 in 2035 with the groundwater level increase in the vicinity the total outflow of the area will only slightly increase from 285 million m3 to 333 million m3 due to the larger discharge to the downstream aquifer thus with the current groundwater management strategy the groundwater storage will be accumulated rapidly at first and gently level off until asymptotic to the new equilibrium stage the groundwater depletion caused by the over exploitation from the last decades will be gradually compensated up to 2050 the cumulative storage increase in the chaobai area will reach 2 2 billion m3 it is convinced that the sustainable groundwater development of the chaobai river region is achievable with the combination of the mar implementation and groundwater management plan however the impact of the future climate change on the groundwater sustainability of the region still needs to be considered 4 3 the decrease of infiltration rate of long term operation of the full scale mar scheme in the current situation the groundwater level is approximately 30 m lower than the bottom elevation of the infiltration ponds and the surface water is hydraulically disconnected with the groundwater the aquifer will be recharged with the maximum infiltration rate however with the increase of the groundwater level above the infiltration pond bottom the groundwater and surface water will be hydraulically connected and the infiltration rate will gradually decrease by running the long term full scale mar simulation the infiltration rate of each pond can be predicted fig 15 shows the change in the infiltration rate with time for each infiltration pond at the early stage of the full scale mar operation all infiltration ponds can be operated with the maximum infiltration rate because the groundwater levels are below the bottom of the ponds however with the current groundwater abstraction rate and the designed mar recharge plan the decrease of the infiltration rate will start in 2027 when the groundwater level in the south becomes higher than the bottom elevation of the infiltration ponds ponds 7 8 and 9 in the north part of the mar site will maintain a high infiltration rate because groundwater levels remain below the pond bottom in those areas among the nine infiltration ponds the largest decrease in the infiltration rate occurs in the fourth pond which is the pond where the predicted groundwater head reaches the pond bottom earliest the infiltration rate of other ponds in the south ponds 1 2 and 3 will also drop to some extent however because of the existence of the no 8 well field the infiltrated water will be abstracted for urban water supply this groundwater abstraction forces extra infiltration capacity for ponds 1 2 and 3 so that the long term infiltration rate of these ponds can be still maintained between 0 2 m d to 0 3 m d by the year 2050 these results show that in the early stage of the mar operation the most important factor to obtain high infiltration capacity is the volume of the underground space however to design a sustainable long term mar scheme it is vital to optimize the infiltration rate to ensure the infiltrated water can spread to the aquifer to a large extent as groundwater storage or can be directly abstracted for water supply in the recent decade reducing groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field has been advocated and implemented however the reduction of the groundwater abstraction will also limit the infiltration capacity of the mar system for a mega city like beijing increasing water demand is inevitable in the future the implementation of the mar and the groundwater exploitation are complementary on the one hand the mar provides a secure water source for the groundwater abstraction on the other hand a moderate level of groundwater exploitation in the area can stimulate the potential of the mar infiltration capacity 5 conclusions the transient simulation of the regional groundwater flow from 1995 to 2018 revealed large changes in groundwater level and storage in the beijing plain the severe groundwater depletion was exacerbated by the consecutive drought from 1999 to 2010 during which natural groundwater recharge was reduced while groundwater abstraction was intensified the south to north water diversion project was implemented and the south water from the yangtze river arrived in beijing in 2014 to substitute equivalent groundwater abstractions since 2015 the trend of groundwater level decline was reduced in the shallow aquifer the excess of the south water was also used for artificial groundwater recharge in the chaobai river channel starting in 2015 the coupled multi scale model simulation shows that the pilot mar system has recharged approximately 130 million m3 of water during 2015 2018 a water table mound was formed beneath the mar site with a maximum recovery of groundwater levels of more than 10 m about 40 of the infiltrated water was captured by pumping wells in the no 8 well field which contributes directly to the water supply in beijing the effects of the long term operation of the full scale mar were simulated with the coupled multi scale flow and transport models from 2020 to 2050 the simulation results show that the designed mar scheme with 9 cascade terraced infiltration ponds in the chaobai river catchment is very effective in restoring the depleted aquifer storage and maintaining the groundwater abstraction in the no 8 well field after about 15 years of operation the cone of the depression and groundwater levels will stabilize as the aquifer system approaches a new equilibrium state by the year 2050 about 91 of the total abstraction in the no 8 well field will come from the infiltrated water sustainable groundwater resources development can be achieved in the chaobai river catchment the model results also show that with the increasing groundwater level beneath the infiltration ponds the infiltration rate of several infiltration ponds will decrease to maintain a high infiltration rate groundwater levels beneath the ponds should be kept below the bottom of the ponds therefore groundwater abstractions in the no 8 well field should be continued with the current capacity other environmental problems associated with the rising water table should be investigated which is beyond the scope of this research this integrated modelling approach with coupled regional and locale flow and transport processes is an effective tool for designing and assessing mar schemes the developed model in this study will be applied to the assess effects of river leakage as a managed aquifer recharge method in the yongding river in the beijing plain the model approach adopted in this study can also be applied to the design and assessment of mar projects in the world credit authorship contribution statement sida liu data curation formal analysis investigation methodology

2927,nitrate and hexavalent chromium cr vi cocontamination in groundwater has become a serious challenge for environmental health emulsified vegetable oil in situ technology could simultaneously remediate nitrate and cr vi in groundwater but the remediation pathways and mechanisms are still unclear in this research the biological denitrification processes for nitrate and the reduction and biogenic mineralization processes for cr vi in a cocontaminated aquifer were studied and the remediation mechanisms were speculated the results indicated that the addition of emulsified vegetable oil can directionally stimulate the growth of indigenous functional microorganisms and effectively remediate nitrate and cr vi in groundwater nitrate in groundwater could be completely reduced to nitrogen gas through biological denitrification without a short circuit and the remediation processes of cr vi can be divided into two steps 1 cr vi was reduced to trivalent chromium cr iii by microbial secondary fe ii 2 the reduced cr iii was entrapped into aquifer medium in residuals speciation through biogenic mineralization keywords denitrification biological dissimilatory iron reduction biogenic mineralization indigenous microorganism in situ bioremediation data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction with the unreasonable and substandard discharge of urban and industrial three wastes and the massive use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in agricultural and pastoral areas the cocontamination of nitrate and hexavalent chromium cr vi in soil and aquifers is becoming more prevalent than ever which poses a serious threat to human health and environmental safety mittal et al 2021 cr vi is a kind of poisonous heavy metal and can cause dna damage and gene error expression kang et al 2022 wan et al 2021 however the toxicity of chromium mainly relies on its valence state and the toxicity of trivalent chromium cr iii is much less than that of cr vi shi et al 2020 excessive nitrate in the environment can worsen water quality and cause acute and chronic health problems nitrite the intermediate product during nitrate reduction is listed as a 2a carcinogen by the world health organization zhang et al 2021 adding exogenous organic substrates to aquifers is an effective method for the in situ remediation of nitrate in groundwater smith et al 2001 the ubiquitous indigenous denitrifying bacteria underground can take the added organic substrate as an electron donor with nitrate as an electron acceptor and reduce it to nitrogen gas through a series of intermediate products hu et al 2020b as bioinformatics techniques are currently mature such as high throughput sequencing and functional genomics more in depth research has been carried out on the biological denitrification process cheng et al 2019 with the participation of the associated enzymes and genes nitrate is reduced to nitrite by nitrate reductase narg and napa nitrite is reduced to nitric oxide by nitrite reductase nirs and nirk nitric oxide is reduced to nitrous oxide by nitric oxide reductase norb and nitrous oxide is reduced to nitrogen by nitrous oxide reductase nosz amoako nimako et al 2021 many studies have been conducted to study the remediation of nitrate in groundwater with biological denitrification and most of them have focused on screening the appropriate organic substrate fowdar et al 2015 hellman et al 2021 and investigating the influencing factors hu et al 2020b shen et al 2020 the characteristics of exogenous organic substrates are one of the most critical influences on the heterotrophic denitrification reaction amoako nimako et al 2021 claimed that the community structure of denitrifying bacteria is closely related to the substrate types adouani et al 2010 found that the substrate type significantly affected nitrous oxide emissions during biological denitrification by influencing nitrous oxide reductase activity only a few studies emphasize biological denitrification when multiple contaminants exist especially cr vi and other heavy metals the biotoxicity of heavy metals to microorganisms may limit the remediation efficiency of nitrate with pure bioremediation technologies zhai et al 2017 therefore applying bioremediation technology to sites contaminated with nitrate and heavy metals is among the main directions for researchers the discovery of a biogenic mineralization process based on dissimilatory iron reduction in underground environments made in situ bioremediation technology a promising method to remediate cocontaminated groundwater containing heavy metals with the addition of exogenous organic substrates coincident with biological denitrification ubiquitous dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria underground can take natural fe iii oxide hydroxide minerals as terminal electron acceptors during the fermentation of organic substrates where fe iii is converted to fe ii chi et al 2018 then the microbial secondary fe ii absorbed to the surfaces of the natural minerals catalyzes the reduction of cr vi to cr iii as a result fe ii is again converted to fe iii biogenic mineralization may occur during the fe iii fe ii cycle processes and the formed secondary minerals reprecipitate onto the aquifer medium dong et al 2020 during this process metal ions such as cr3 zn2 and ni2 which have ionic radii similar to those of iron atoms can be packed and immobilized in the crystal lattice of secondary minerals mcallister et al 2015 in this way cr vi in an aquifer can be separated from the environment transformed into more stable speciation and immobilized in aquifer media therefore the toxicity and mobility of cr vi in groundwater can be significantly decreased emulsified vegetable oil in situ technology was proven to be an effective method to remediate nitrate and cr vi in groundwater the authors previous study demonstrated for the first time that adding emulsified vegetable oil to aquifers can simultaneously remove nitrate and cr vi from groundwater and has high remediation threshold values for the two contaminants ding et al 2021b however the remediation pathways and mechanisms for this approach remain unclear therefore this study investigated the biological denitrification processes for nitrate and the reduction and biogenic mineralization processes for cr vi in a cocontaminated aquifer and speculated on the remediation mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials emulsified vegetable oil is synthesized by using commercial vegetable oil food grade arawan soybean oil singapore as the solute and tween 80 analytical reagent tianjin deen china as the surfactant and mixing them in deionized water to prepare a stable microemulsion contaminated solutions were obtained by dissolving sodium nitrate analytical reagent zhengzhou paini china and potassium dichromate analytical reagent tianjin deen china in deionized water natural sand was sieved into fine sand and utilized to simulate porous media in aquifers 2 2 batch experiments seven experiments were implemented to explore the remediation pathways and mechanisms of nitrate and cr vi in groundwater by adding emulsified vegetable oil among them groups 1 2 and 3 were experimental groups and group 4 5 6 and 7 were control groups to study the relationship between cr vi removal and fe ii production four groups groups 8 9 10 and 11 with different initial cr vi concentrations were conducted all the experimental design and system settings are shown in the table s1 first sand and contaminated solution or deionized water were placed in rubber stopper bottles to simulate a polluted aquifer or unpolluted aquifer then emulsified vegetable oil or deionized water was added to simulate agent injection and all bottles were placed in a dark incubator hpx 9162mbe shanghai boxun china and cultivated thermostatically at 30 c 2 3 analytical methods the liquid samples were collected every day and analyzed after filtering through 0 22 µm filter membranes cr vi and ammonia nitrogen were measured by the diphenylcarbazide spectrophotometric method at 540 nm ding et al 2021b and nessler s reagent spectrophotometric method at 420 nm respectively using a spectrophotometer uv 752 n inesa china the total chromium was determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry aa700 pe usa and trivalent chromium was obtained by subtracting cr vi from the total chromium a thermo scientific dionex aquion ic as11 hc column 250 mm 4 mm 30 c was used to determine the concentration of nitrate and nitrite injection volume 25 µl and the mobile phase was a koh solution 20 mmol l at 1 0 ml min the total fe and fe iii were determined by the thiocyanate colorimetric assay method with a spectrophotometer at 480 nm and fe ii was obtained from the difference between the total fe and fe iii ding et al 2021b nitrous oxide emission during the remediation process was detected by a portable gas detector ja1000 dongguan yong qi electronic equipment co ltd china the sand samples were collected before named group 0 and after the experiment the microbial community structure and the relative abundance of microorganisms containing denitrification functional genes narg napa nirs nirk norb and nosz and chromium reduction functional genes chrt in samples were analyzed with 16s rdna high throughput sequencing at sangon biotech shanghai co ltd dong et al 2021 and the primers are shown in the table s2 after vacuum drying at 40 c for 24 h the element speciation distribution of chromium and iron in the samples was analyzed based on the tessier sequential extraction procedure chi et al 2018 tessier et al 1979 and the bioavailability factor baf of an element in the aquifer medium could be calculated according to the ratio of exchangeable and bound carbonates to the total content kidd et al 2007 xps was performed using an x ray photoelectron spectrometer escalab 250xi thermo scientific america the specific experimental processes are shown in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 hexavalent chromium remediation the removal of cr vi in groups is shown in fig 1 the concentration of cr vi in group 4 and group 5 remained relatively high during the experiment fig 1 a which indicated that there was no pure chemical reaction between cr vi and nitrate or emulsified vegetable oil in a control experiment cocontaminated groundwater sand in a previous study ding et al 2021b cr vi also remained relatively high during the experiment explaining that the natural aquifer could not directly degrade cr vi in groundwater but had a slight adsorption effect on cr vi in groups 2 and 3 with the addition of emulsified vegetable oil cr vi could be completely removed and the removal efficiency in group 3 was significantly increased suggesting that the removal of cr vi in the systems was due to the biochemical or biological effects stimulated by adding emulsified vegetable oil rather than the direct physical or chemical effects from emulsified vegetable oil or aquifer media and the presence of nitrate promoted the removal of cr vi the concentration of total chromium tcr in groundwater during the experiment is shown in fig 1 b and the tcr in groundwater had the same changing tendency as cr vi which indicated that the removed cr vi was transferred to the aquifer media rather than continuing to exist in groundwater in other valence states fe ii accumulation can be used as an indicator for the process of microbial dissimilatory iron reduction in aquifers lovley et al 1989 the concentrations of fe ii in the groups are shown in fig 1 c the removal of cr vi in both group 2 and group 3 was directly related to the microbial dissimilatory iron reduction process triggered by adding emulsified vegetable oil first the concentration of cr vi in the two groups declined significantly from the second day while the accumulation of fe ii in the unpolluted system began at exactly the same time ding et al 2021b second the accumulation of fe ii in the polluted groups occurred after the removal of cr vi third no fe ii was detected in group 6 during the experiment explaining that the microbial dissimilatory iron reduction cannot occur spontaneously in the natural aquifer without exogenous organic substrate addition which was consistent with a previous study dong et al 2017 therefore it is speculated that the removal of cr vi in this study was caused by the biochemical reduction of microbial secondary fe ii which was produced by the dissimilatory iron reduction stimulated by adding emulsified vegetable oil to further verify the above speculation groups 8 11 were included according to the results in fig 2 the authors discovered that the removal rate of cr vi was approximately one third that of the production rate of fe ii in all the groups and the cr vi removal rate and fe ii accumulation rate were shown in the table s3 additionally based on a previous study cr vi may be reduced to cr iii by microbial generated fe ii liu et al 2021 and the reaction was as follows cr vi 3fe ii cr iii 3fe iii this further confirmed the authors hypothesis and the removal of cr vi in the remediation system was mainly due to the biochemical effects of microbial secondary fe ii the accumulation rate of fe ii in the system was slightly more than 3 times the cr vi removal rate indicating that complete cr vi removal required the presence of fe ii at a higher concentration than that of the theoretical molar ratio in the emulsified vegetable oil remediation system 3 2 nitrate remediation the degradation of nitrate in groups is shown in fig 3 the concentration of nitrate decreased rapidly only in group 1 and group 3 and remained constant throughout the experiment in groups 4 and 5 indicating that there was no pure chemical reaction between nitrate and cr vi or emulsified vegetable oil according to a previous study the natural aquifer without emulsified vegetable oil addition could not spontaneously degrade nitrate ding et al 2021b therefore the degradation of nitrate in this experiment was mainly caused by the biological effects stimulated by emulsified vegetable oil by comparison the degradation of nitrate in group 3 showed very similar trends to that in group 1 but the degradation rate decreased however although nitrite and ammonia nitrogen were detected as intermediate products in both groups and both could be degraded very quickly the maximum cumulative concentrations of nitrite and ammonia nitrogen were significantly increased in group 3 and the peak time was also delayed for half day 3 3 fe and cr in the aquifer media 3 3 1 speciation the iron speciation distribution in aquifer media of groups 0 2 and 3 is shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b most of the iron elements whether in the natural media or the remediated media by emulsified vegetable oil existed in the form of residual iron followed by bound to fe mn oxides bound organic matter bound to carbonates and exchangeable iron fig 4 a as shown in fig 4 b the proportion of bound to carbonates iron increased significantly in group 2 and group 3 compared with that in group 0 and the increment in group 3 was significantly higher than that in group 2 the chromium speciation distribution in aquifer media of groups 0 2 and 3 is shown in fig 4 d and was dominated by the residual chromium which accounted for 84 11 77 90 and 82 67 respectively the exchangeable and bound to carbonates chromium which could easily be mobilized and utilized by microorganisms kidd et al 2007 accounted for 5 07 2 24 and 1 90 respectively according to the valence state analysis in media chromium mainly existed in the form of trivalent chromium 76 in natural unpolluted media the content of chromium increased significantly in both group 2 and group 3 after the remediation process especially trivalent chromium which increased by almost equal to the theoretical value as shown in fig 4 e the results indicated that the removed cr vi from groundwater was reduced to cr iii and transferred to the media in the form of feo cr2o3 the high resolution xps spectrums were shown in the fig s1 3 3 2 bioavailability the baf of iron in the media before and after remediation was calculated fig 4 c and the results showed that the baf in group 2 and group 3 increased from 1 34 10 3 to 1 55 10 3 and 3 22 10 3 respectively that is the bioavailability of iron in media in the cr vi single polluted system increased 15 77 compared with the natural unpolluted media and 140 58 in the nitrate and cr vi cocontaminated system this illustrated that the addition of emulsified vegetable oil can enhance the bioavailability of iron in the media and the presence of nitrate can further significantly improve the bioavailability of iron thus promoting the dissimilatory iron reduction process and accelerating the removal of cr vi which was in agreement with the experimental results in part 3 1 and that in the nitrobenzene contaminated system in the previous study chi et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 f the baf of chromium in group 2 and group 3 decreased from 5 07 10 2 to 2 24 10 2 and 1 90 10 2 respectively the bioavailability of chromium in media of the cr vi single polluted system decreased 55 84 compared with the natural unpolluted media and 62 57 in the nitrate and cr vi cocontaminated system therefore the addition of emulsified vegetable oil can both reduce cr vi to cr iii and transfer cr iii into the media in forms that are hard to mobilize and utilize whether in a cr vi single polluted system or nitrate and cr vi cocontaminated system the presence of nitrate in aquifers can promote the remediation process and transfer more cr iii into the residual speciation 3 4 indigenous microorganisms in the aquifer media 3 4 1 microbial community structure the microbial community structure in groups at the phylum level is shown in the fig s2 in which phyla with proportions less than 1 were defined as other the dominant phyla in the natural unpolluted aquifer were proteobacteria and actinobacteria and the proportion of firmicutes accounted for only 0 9 the dominant phyla in all the emulsified vegetable oil added systems were proteobacteria and firmicutes which indicated that the addition of emulsified vegetable oil can greatly stimulate the growth of proteobacteria and firmicutes and inhibit actinobacteria the microbial community structure in groups at the genus level is shown in fig 5 the results indicated that both the addition of emulsified vegetable oil and the presence of pollutants had significant impacts on the microbial community structure and could stimulate the directional growth of multiple functional microorganisms for example azospirillum macedo et al 2019 geobacter martinez murillo et al 1999 pseudomonas and herbaspirillum hu et al 2020a have the ability to degrade nitrate and geobacter anaeromyxobacter ding et al 2020 unclassified clostridiales jia et al 2020 and magnetospirillum noguchi et al 1999 are dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria in particular magnetospirillum was also one kind of ancient biomineralizing organism on earth amor et al 2018 syntrophomonas as a typical hydrogen producing acetogenic bacteria has the ability to degrade long chain fatty acids and produce acetic acid he et al 2015 while ornatilinea can ferment amino acids and sugars into acetic acid and small molecule volatile fatty acids wu et al 2020 the proportions of the nine genera in the groups are shown in fig 5 b d analyzing the above results showed that some specific denitrifying bacteria and dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria were both stimulated in the system indicating that emulsified vegetable oil in situ technology was an excellent method for the simultaneous remediation of nitrate and cr vi in groundwater additionally hydrogen producing acetogenic bacteria also grew substantially which provided good conditions for the growth of functional microorganisms and the removal of pollutants in aquifers 3 4 2 functional gene to further clarify the process of cr vi removal in the nitrate and cr vi cocontaminated groundwater chromium reductase t chrt in group 0 and group 3 was determined and it was found that there were no chrt containing microorganisms in the media or their relative abundance was too low to be detected this further confirmed the authors speculation that the removal of cr vi in the emulsified vegetable oil remediation system was a biochemical process that was coupled with dissimilatory iron reduction rather than direct microbial reduction the functional characteristics of indigenous microorganisms in media can be predicted by faprotax funtional annotation of prokaryotic taxa and the growth multiple of microorganisms related to iron reduction compared with the unpolluted medium is shown in fig 6 a after the addition of emulsified vegetable oil the number of iron reducing bacteria increased by 176 times while 332 times in the nitrate single polluted system 4 times in the cr vi single polluted system 267 times in the cocontaminated system the results illustrated that cr vi had obvious biotoxicity to iron reducing bacteria while nitrate can enhance the stimulatory effects of emulsified vegetable oil on iron reducing bacteria when nitrate existed in a cr vi polluted aquifer the biotoxicity of cr vi on iron reducing bacteria could be effectively alleviated therefore when remediating a cr vi single polluted aquifer nitrate could be added as a nitrogen source to emulsified vegetable oil microemulsion to strengthen the process of iron reduction and accelerate the removal of cr vi to further clarify the process of nitrate degradation in the nitrate and cr vi cocontaminated groundwater six functional genes related to denitrification in group 3 were determined and the results are shown in fig 6 b all the functional genes related to denitrification were detected in the medium indicating that the processes of nitrate reduction nitrite reduction nitric oxide reduction and nitrous oxide reduction all occurred in the emulsified vegetable oil remediation system and nitrate in groundwater can be completely reduced to nitrogen gas ammonia nitrogen was also detected in groundwater and nirs as the key enzyme in denitrification can reduce nitrite to ammonia nitrogen stach et al 2000 in addition psedomonas in aquifers can reduce ammonia to nitrous oxide and rapidly degrade it from groundwater he et al 2020 at the end of the experiment a slight accumulation of nitrous oxide was detected in the headspace of the system and did not disappear within 15 days with the highest accumulation ratio of 1 1 this may be because 1 of the organic substrate type ding et al 2021a showed that acetate was the main product of emulsified vegetable oil adouani et al 2010 found that using acetate as the sole electron donor for denitrification may cause the accumulation of nitrous oxide with a generation rate of 74 which was much higher than that in this study this was probably because emulsified vegetable oil is a kind of slow release substrate and can keep acetate at an appropriate concentration tang et al 2013 to reduce the accumulation of nitrous oxide 2 nitrous oxide reductase is sensitive to low ph and results in nitrous oxide production amoako nimako et al 2021 and the fermentation of emulsified vegetable oil could reduce the ph ding et al 2021a 3 toxic substances such as cr vi have biotoxicity and might cause nitrous oxide accumulation richards knowles 1995 4 conclusion this research clarified the removal mechanisms of nitrate and cr vi in groundwater by adding emulsified vegetable oil nitrate can be completely reduced to nitrogen gas with the participation of narg napa nirs nirk norb and nosz genes and no intermediate products accumulate except for a slight release of nitrous oxide cr vi was reduced to cr iii and then wrapped in secondary minerals as stable speciation under the effects of biochemical reduction and biogenic mineralization based on the iron cycle the obtained information from this study can help to clarify the remediation processes in nitrate and cr vi contaminated sites

concentration of nitrate decreased rapidly only in group 1 and group 3 and remained constant throughout the experiment in groups 4 and 5 indicating that there was no pure chemical reaction between nitrate and cr vi or emulsified vegetable oil according to a previous study the natural aquifer without emulsified vegetable oil addition could not spontaneously degrade nitrate ding et al 2021b therefore the degradation of nitrate in this experiment was mainly caused by the biological effects stimulated by emulsified vegetable oil by comparison the degradation of nitrate in group 3 showed very similar trends to that in group 1 but the degradation rate decreased however although nitrite and ammonia nitrogen were detected as intermediate products in both groups and both could be degraded very quickly the maximum cumulative concentrations of nitrite and ammonia nitrogen were significantly increased in group 3 and the peak time was also delayed for half day 3 3 fe and cr in the aquifer media 3 3 1 speciation the iron speciation distribution in aquifer media of groups 0 2 and 3 is shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b most of the iron elements whether in the natural media or the remediated media by emulsified vegetable oil existed in the form of residual iron followed by bound to fe mn oxides bound organic matter bound to carbonates and exchangeable iron fig 4 a as shown in fig 4 b the proportion of bound to carbonates iron increased significantly in group 2 and group 3 compared with that in group 0 and the increment in group 3 was significantly higher than that in group 2 the chromium speciation distribution in aquifer media of groups 0 2 and 3 is shown in fig 4 d and was dominated by the residual chromium which accounted for 84 11 77 90 and 82 67 respectively the exchangeable and bound to carbonates chromium which could easily be mobilized and utilized by microorganisms kidd et al 2007 accounted for 5 07 2 24 and 1 90 respectively according to the valence state analysis in media chromium mainly existed in the form of trivalent chromium 76 in natural unpolluted media the content of chromium increased significantly in both group 2 and group 3 after the remediation process especially trivalent chromium which increased by almost equal to the theoretical value as shown in fig 4 e the results indicated that the removed cr vi from groundwater was reduced to cr iii and transferred to the media in the form of feo cr2o3 the high resolution xps spectrums were shown in the fig s1 3 3 2 bioavailability the baf of iron in the media before and after remediation was calculated fig 4 c and the results showed that the baf in group 2 and group 3 increased from 1 34 10 3 to 1 55 10 3 and 3 22 10 3 respectively that is the bioavailability of iron in media in the cr vi single polluted system increased 15 77 compared with the natural unpolluted media and 140 58 in the nitrate and cr vi cocontaminated system this illustrated that the addition of emulsified vegetable oil can enhance the bioavailability of iron in the media and the presence of nitrate can further significantly improve the bioavailability of iron thus promoting the dissimilatory iron reduction process and accelerating the removal of cr vi which was in agreement with the experimental results in part 3 1 and that in the nitrobenzene contaminated system in the previous study chi et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 f the baf of chromium in group 2 and group 3 decreased from 5 07 10 2 to 2 24 10 2 and 1 90 10 2 respectively the bioavailability of chromium in media of the cr vi single polluted system decreased 55 84 compared with the natural unpolluted media and 62 57 in the nitrate and cr vi cocontaminated system therefore the addition of emulsified vegetable oil can both reduce cr vi to cr iii and transfer cr iii into the media in forms that are hard to mobilize and utilize whether in a cr vi single polluted system or nitrate and cr vi cocontaminated system the presence of nitrate in aquifers can promote the remediation process and transfer more cr iii into the residual speciation 3 4 indigenous microorganisms in the aquifer media 3 4 1 microbial community structure the microbial community structure in groups at the phylum level is shown in the fig s2 in which phyla with proportions less than 1 were defined as other the dominant phyla in the natural unpolluted aquifer were proteobacteria and actinobacteria and the proportion of firmicutes accounted for only 0 9 the dominant phyla in all the emulsified vegetable oil added systems were proteobacteria and firmicutes which indicated that the addition of emulsified vegetable oil can greatly stimulate the growth of proteobacteria and firmicutes and inhibit actinobacteria the microbial community structure in groups at the genus level is shown in fig 5 the results indicated that both the addition of emulsified vegetable oil and the presence of pollutants had significant impacts on the microbial community structure and could stimulate the directional growth of multiple functional microorganisms for example azospirillum macedo et al 2019 geobacter martinez murillo et al 1999 pseudomonas and herbaspirillum hu et al 2020a have the ability to degrade nitrate and geobacter anaeromyxobacter ding et al 2020 unclassified clostridiales jia et al 2020 and magnetospirillum noguchi et al 1999 are dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria in particular magnetospirillum was also one kind of ancient biomineralizing organism on earth amor et al 2018 syntrophomonas as a typical hydrogen producing acetogenic bacteria has the ability to degrade long chain fatty acids and produce acetic acid he et al 2015 while ornatilinea can ferment amino acids and sugars into acetic acid and small molecule volatile fatty acids wu et al 2020 the proportions of the nine genera in the groups are shown in fig 5 b d analyzing the above results showed that some specific denitrifying bacteria and dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria were both stimulated in the system indicating that emulsified vegetable oil in situ technology was an excellent method for the simultaneous remediation of nitrate and cr vi in groundwater additionally hydrogen producing acetogenic bacteria also grew substantially which provided good conditions for the growth of functional microorganisms and the removal of pollutants in aquifers 3 4 2 functional gene to further clarify the process of cr vi removal in the nitrate and cr vi cocontaminated groundwater chromium reductase t chrt in group 0 and group 3 was determined and it was found that there were no chrt containing microorganisms in the media or their relative abundance was too low to be detected this further confirmed the authors speculation that the removal of cr vi in the emulsified vegetable oil remediation system was a biochemical process that was coupled with dissimilatory iron reduction rather than direct microbial reduction the functional characteristics of indigenous microorganisms in media can be predicted by faprotax funtional annotation of prokaryotic taxa and the growth multiple of microorganisms related to iron reduction compared with the unpolluted medium is shown in fig 6 a after the addition of emulsified vegetable oil the number of iron reducing bacteria increased by 176 times while 332 times in the nitrate single polluted system 4 times in the cr vi single polluted system 267 times in the cocontaminated system the results illustrated that cr vi had obvious biotoxicity to iron reducing bacteria while nitrate can enhance the stimulatory effects of emulsified vegetable oil on iron reducing bacteria when nitrate existed in a cr vi polluted aquifer the biotoxicity of cr vi on iron reducing bacteria could be effectively alleviated therefore when remediating a cr vi single polluted aquifer nitrate could be added as a nitrogen source to emulsified vegetable oil microemulsion to strengthen the process of iron reduction and accelerate the removal of cr vi to further clarify the process of nitrate degradation in the nitrate and cr vi cocontaminated groundwater six functional genes related to denitrification in group 3 were determined and the results are shown in fig 6 b all the functional genes related to denitrification were detected in the medium indicating that the processes of nitrate reduction nitrite reduction nitric oxide reduction and nitrous oxide reduction all occurred in the emulsified vegetable oil remediation system and nitrate in groundwater can be completely reduced to nitrogen gas ammonia nitrogen was also detected in groundwater and nirs as the key enzyme in denitrification can reduce nitrite to ammonia nitrogen stach et al 2000 in addition psedomonas in aquifers can reduce ammonia to nitrous oxide and rapidly degrade it from groundwater he et al 2020 at the end of the experiment a slight accumulation of nitrous oxide was detected in the headspace of the system and did not disappear within 15 days with the highest accumulation ratio of 1 1 this may be because 1 of the organic substrate type ding et al 2021a showed that acetate was the main product of emulsified vegetable oil adouani et al 2010 found that using acetate as the sole electron donor for denitrification may cause the accumulation of nitrous oxide with a generation rate of 74 which was much higher than that in this study this was probably because emulsified vegetable oil is a kind of slow release substrate and can keep acetate at an appropriate concentration tang et al 2013 to reduce the accumulation of nitrous oxide 2 nitrous oxide reductase is sensitive to low ph and results in nitrous oxide production amoako nimako et al 2021 and the fermentation of emulsified vegetable oil could reduce the ph ding et al 2021a 3 toxic substances such as cr vi have biotoxicity and might cause nitrous oxide accumulation richards knowles 1995 4 conclusion this research clarified the removal mechanisms of nitrate and cr vi in groundwater by adding emulsified vegetable oil nitrate can be completely reduced to nitrogen gas with the participation of narg napa nirs nirk norb and nosz genes and no intermediate products accumulate except for a slight release of nitrous oxide cr vi was reduced to cr iii and then wrapped in secondary minerals as stable speciation under the effects of biochemical reduction and biogenic mineralization based on the iron cycle the obtained information from this study can help to clarify the remediation processes in nitrate and cr vi contaminated sites

2928,carbon stable isotopic compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic and chemical compositions of groundwater were used to investigate the processes of supply of dic to groundwater in the lowland area of the fukui ohno basin and to examine constraints on the groundwater recharge flow system the groundwater in the basin is dominantly of ca hco3 type with relatively high concentrations of ca2 and hco3 and lower concentrations of mg2 this groundwater chemistry can be attributed to weathering within the aquifer of mainly anorthite and some pyroxene at partial pressures of co2 that are typical of soils the δ13c values of the co2 gas initially equilibrated with dic in the groundwater were calculated to be 28 6 to 22 8 indicating that the groundwater in the lowland basin has two main sources of carbon 1 c3 organic matter δ13c 29 distributed mainly in mountains surrounding much of the basin and in aquicludes within the basin and 2 organic matter in shallow lacustrine deposits within the lowland basin δ13c 20 the results of modeling accounting for these two sources demonstrated that roughly equal proportions 50 20 of dic in the groundwater are sourced from lacustrine deposits and c3 organic matter the distributions of these types of organic matters in and around the lowland basin suggest that there are two major and roughly equal components of groundwater recharge a vertical component of downward percolation of precipitation in the lowland area and a mainly horizontal component of groundwater flow originating in the mountains around the study area and flowing through aquifers into the lowland basin keywords carbon isotopic composition mineral weathering decomposition of organic material lacustrine deposits river water mixing groundwater recharge flow system 1 introduction the use of stable isotope tracers such as sulfur δ34s chlorine δ37cl and strontium 87sr 86sr in numerous hydrological studies has provided valuable information about the supply of dissolved ions containing the isotope tracers to groundwater dogramaci et al 2001 nakano et al 2001 2005 lavastre et al 2005 yamanaka et al 2005 2014 yamanaka and kumagai 2006 cartwright et al 2007 bottrell et al 2008 hosono et al 2010 2011 beekman et al 2011 the use of the carbon stable isotope tracer of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic has clarified several supply processes for instance the dissolution processes of carbonate minerals dogramaci and herczeg 2002 hu and burdige 2007 hori et al 2008 li et al 2010 yamanaka 2012 and those of co2 derived from sedimentary deposits containing organic matter om or from deep magma sources amiotte suchet et al 1999 crossey et al 2009 jirakova et al 2010 sakai et al 2011 yamada et al 2011 yamanaka 2012 however understanding carbon stable isotopic signatures is difficult because of three following characteristics that are seldom observed in other isotopic tracers e g boutton 1991 clark and fritz 1997 schulte et al 2011 clark 2015 1 δ13cdic values can be modified by various processes not only by the processes of dissolution of co2 or carbonate carbon ex caco3 in water but also by removal of carbon from water by precipitation of carbonate or co2 degassing amiotte suchet et al 1999 finlay 2003 yoshimura et al 2004 yamanaka and sakamoto 2016 2 even if dissolved inorganic carbon dic originates solely from soil co2 the δ13cdic values differ from those of co2 this difference is derived from the ph dependency of the relative abundances of carbonic species and from isotopic fractionation between co2 and the species h2co3 i e co2 aq and h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 to evaluate the source of dic in water by using δ13cdic values it is therefore essential to calculate δ13c values of co2 equilibrated with the water e g zhang et al 1995 3 the δ13c values of soil organic matter s om an important source of soil co2 vary considerably according to plant species about 27 for c3 plants and about 12 5 for c4 plants e g deines 1980 vogel et al 1993 in addition organic matter om in eutrophic lakes and lacustrine deposits can have higher δ13c values than those of typical c3 plants stiller and nissenbaum 1999 murase and sakamoto 2000 gu et al 2006 kristen et al 2010 such variations of the δ13c values of s om as a source of dic in water make identification of the source difficult because of these difficulties the effective use of δ13cdic values to evaluate the processes occurring in water requires an ideal hydro geomorphological setting in which there are not too many carbon sources with every distinctive δ13c value in addition to clearly defined groundwater flow paths a sedimentary basin is a relatively simple hydro geomorphological unit with simple groundwater movement groundwater recharge occurs mainly from surrounding uplands the groundwater then migrates basinward according to the hydraulic gradient within aquifers accumulates in the central basin and finally flows from the basin at the point of lowest elevation at the basin perimeter inland basins in which the central area is filled with argillaceous sediments of lacustrine origin provide an ideal setting for groundwater investigations along the flow based on δ13c tracers because the lacustrine basin sediments can have distinctive δ13c values the lowland area of fukui ohno basin in central japan is an example of such a groundwater system fig 1 in this study we used the δ13c values of groundwater and argillaceous sediments and groundwater chemistry to explore the hydrogeochemical controls and recharge flow systems in the groundwater of the lowland area of fukui ohno basin 2 study area the lowland area of fukui ohno basin lfob hereafter covers an area of about 70 km2 about 40 km inland from the sea of japan coast and is surrounded to the east west and south by mountains that rise to 1300 1700 m above sea level fig 1 the geological setting of the lfob has been well described by ohno city and risuisha 2003 and ohno city 2013 and is summarized here as follows basement rocks in the surrounding mountains of the lfob are composed mainly of slate and sandstone of the hida belt of permian to jurassic age which are partially metamorphized including minor marine limestone locally intruded by funatsu granitoids of jurassic age and covered by neogene andesite from a macroscopic viewpoint the hida belt is distributed widely in southern to eastern mountains and neogene andesite is mainly in northern to western mountains the lfob is faulted along its southern and southeastern margins and lies within a tectonic basin that has been filled with clastic sediments deposited by the akane kiyotaki mana and kuzuryu rivers although the stratigraphy of the clastic sediments is ill defined due to their distributional heterogeneity they have been divided into units g3 g2 g1 ag and ac in ascending stratigraphic order ohno city 2013 fig 2 units g3 g1 are mainly sand and gravel with some clay and behave as aquifers because of their high hydraulic conductivity up to 1 0 10 1 m s although the upper part of unit g2 g2u likely has higher clay content and behaves in part as an aquiclude unit g1 10 20 m thick is the main unconfined aquifer in the study area and is overlain by 10 m of holocene alluvium comprising a pebbly sand gravel subunit ag and an argillaceous subunit ac unit ac which is of lacustrine origin is distributed mainly at the surface in the western part of the lfob along the akane river and also seems to be in the central and eastern parts of the lfob however unit ac is discontinuous in several areas of the lfob resulting in that it seldom acts as a confining bed except for a part of the urban area as illustrated in fig 2 the groundwater level is shallowest in the lfob urban area at about 1 m depth from the surface where the groundwater in the g1 aquifer is partially under artesian conditions this indicates that the groundwater level was enough higher than the bottom level of lacustrine deposits being as a confining bed and the bed is likely continuous in this area on the other hand the level in the aquifers is more than 20 m below the surface with seasonal fluctuations in the upper area which is on a gently sloping alluvial fan figs 1 and 2 the groundwater levels in the lfob fig 1 indicate that groundwater flows predominantly from south to north ohno city and risuisha 2003 ohno city 2013 as the lfob land use the most area is the cultivated field except for the urban area where houses are dominant fig 1 while the surrounding mountains are forested 3 methods 3 1 samples in september 2019 we collected three types of water samples groundwater samples from 28 wells whose screens are at g1 aquifer 1 spring sample sample uw27 at the foot of the mountain and river water samples at 4 sites figs 1 2 and table 1 by using the groundwater levels of 165 m and 175 m as classification boundaries the lfob groundwater samples can be classified into three 13 from the upper area 11 from the middle area and 5 from the lower area each of which is subdivided into eastern and western areas by kiyotaki river of these areas the middle western area almost coincides with the urban area temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec horiba co d 54 ph conductivity meter of water were determined in the field at each site two water samples 100 and 500 ml were collected in polyethylene bottles the 100 and 500 ml samples were used to determine chemical and carbon isotopic compositions respectively as described in section 3 2 ohno city office provided us with borehole sediment samples bu1 to bu3 collected from a silty layer at 0 5 2 0 m depth at site bu of the urban area in june 2021 we used a hand auger to collect several clay samples in the southwestern and central parts of the study area at locations bw samples bw4 and bw5 0 3 to 0 5 m depth and bc samples bc6 to bc10 0 3 to 1 5 m depth respectively fig 1 based on their subsurface distribution we consider all of these core samples to be lacustrine deposits of unit ac fig 2 3 2 analytical procedures the ph 4 8 alkalinity of the water samples was determined in the laboratory by titration with n 50 h2so4 after filtering through a 0 20 μm mesh cellulose nitrate filter the samples were analyzed for cation and anion concentrations na k ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 by ion chromatography shimadzu co class lc10 at nihon university the carbon isotopic compositions δ13c of the water and core samples were determined as follows dic in the 500 ml water samples was precipitated as baco3 in the field by adding 1 ml of 10 n naoh and 5 ml of 7 bacl2 solution approximately 30 mg of each of the dried baco3 samples was reacted with 5 ml of 85 dehydrated h3po4 in a vacuum 10 pa to obtain co2 gas the carbon isotopic compositions of the co2 gas samples were measured 12 times with an isoprime mass spectrometer elementar uk ltd at nihon university after oven drying at 105 and grinding of the core samples δ13c values of decomposing matter and hydrocarbons were determined with an elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms thermo fisher scientific co and flash 2000 confloⅳ delta v advantage at rissho university kumagaya japan the results are presented on a conventional permil scale with respect to the vienna peedee belemnite v pdb standard 1 δ13c 13c 12c sample 13c 12c v pbd 1 103 the overall experimental accuracy for δ13c during this study was 0 2 3 3 calculations of dic concentration and co2 partial pressure pco2 dic in water is composed of h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 and is dependent mainly on ph as follows 2 co2 g h2o h2co3 3 h2co3 h hco3 4 hco3 h co3 2 here subscripted g represents the gaseous phase the equilibrium constants for eqs 2 to 4 i e kh k1 and k2 respectively and the relationships between k and temperature t can be expressed as follows clark and fritz 1997 5 kh h2co3 pco2 6 k1 h hco3 h2co3 7 k2 h co3 2 hco3 8 pkh 7 10 5 t2 0 016 t 1 11 9 pk1 1 1 10 4 t2 0 012 t 6 58 10 pk2 9 10 5 t2 0 0137 t 10 62 for t 25 c hco3 accounts for 100 of dic at ph 8 3 according to these equations dic is comprised of h2co3 and hco3 at ph 8 3 whereas it is comprised of hco3 and co3 2 at ph greater than 8 3 because ph in the groundwater and river water is mostly in a narrow range of 7 0 0 5 as described in section 4 1 the dic in these waters is composed dominantly of hco3 with smaller amounts of h2co3 and a little of co3 2 because the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions are quite low at ph 7 the alkalinity alk value obtained by titration at ph 4 8 has the following relationship with carbonate species 11 alk hco3 2 co3 2 by using measured values of alk ph and t of water in eqs 5 to 11 the concentrations of each of the carbonate species e g h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 can be calculated in all water samples alk can be expressed as hco3 with calculated percentages of co3 2 in dic being quite low 0 28 in this case dic concentrations in water samples are calculated as follows 12 dic h2co3 hco3 co3 2 then by using h2co3 concentrations in eq 5 pco2 can be obtained for the water samples 3 4 calculations of carbon isotopic compositions of equilibrium co2 with water samples δ13c equil co2 as shown in eqs 2 and 3 the process of dissolution of co2 in water generates hco3 a species of dic as well as h which frequently enhances weathering processes of the surrounding minerals in aquatic conditions this means that the co2 dissolution process plays an essential role in both the dic supply process and the mineral weathering process in water on the other hand generated co2 has an almost identical δ13c value to that of the original organic matter even through decompositions since co2 eventually attains equilibrium conditions in the co2 dissolution process the carbon isotopic composition of co2 in equilibrium with water δ13c equil co2 hereafter must tell us something not only about the origin of dic but also about mineral weathering processes associated with h consumption in water next we obtained δ13c equil co2 from the groundwater and river water samples as follows if water is in equilibrium with a given co2 gas and because each carbonate species has a different δ13c value δ13c h2co3 δ13c hco3 and δ13c co3 the carbon stable isotopic composition of dic δ13c dic is expressed as a function of the δ13c values of three species as follows 13 δ 13 c dic δ 13 c h 2 co 3 h 2 co 3 δ 13 c hco 3 hco 3 δ 13 c co 3 co 3 2 dic here the δ13c values of the carbonate species are controlled by water temperature and the δ13c values of equilibrated co2 gas isotopic fractionation factors between dissolved carbonate species and co2 gas α13c h2co3 co2 g α13c hco3 co2 g and α13c co3 co2 g can be obtained according to eqs 14 to 16 of vogel et al 1970 mook et al 1974 and deines et al 1974 respectively 14 103 ln α13c h2co3 co2 g 0 373 103 t 1 0 19 15 103 ln α13c hco3 co2 g 9 552 103 t 1 24 10 16 103 ln α13c co3 co2 g 0 87 106 t 2 3 4 in these equations α represents the isotopic fractionation factor if t k is set to the measured water temperature of each water sample the calculated values of 103 ln α13c h2co3 co2 g 103 ln α13c hco3 co2 g and 103 ln α13c co3 co2 g are 1 12 to 1 07 8 26 to 9 37 and 6 58 to 7 28 respectively these values represent the approximate differences between the δ13c values of co2 and those of each of the carbonate species present under the assumption that dic is supplied only by co2 dissolution when dic in water is in equilibrium with co2 eq 13 can be used to determine δ13c equil co2 as follows on the right hand side of eq 13 concentrations of carbonate species of h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 are obtained from eqs 5 to 11 whereas their isotopic compositions δ13c h2co3 δ13c hco3 and δ13c co3 are obtained by using the isotopic fractionation factors α in eqs 14 to 16 and a provisional value of δ13c equil co2 for instance 27 is expected for co2 with c3 om origin e g deines 1980 vogel et al 1993 because the true value of δ13c dic on the left hand side of eq 13 is the measured value of the sample the δ13c equil co2 value is that obtained at the time when the calculated δ13c dic value in the right hand side of eq 13 coincides with the measured true value in the left hand side 4 results 4 1 ec ph and chemical compositions of groundwater and river water the field measurements and analytical results for the groundwater and river water samples from the lfob are listed in table 1 the ec of the groundwater was 61 to 166 μs cm although the range of ec was relatively wide in the upper eastern area it was narrower 110 μs cm in the urban middle west and lower areas of the lfob and ec was low in the upper western area especially adjacent to the mountainous recharge areas where groundwater sample uw27 had the lowest measured ec 61 μs cm the range of ec of the river water was 53 to 82 μs cm clearly lower than that of the groundwater the ph of the groundwater was 5 9 to 7 6 but was mostly within a narrow range of 7 0 0 5 the ph of the river water was slightly higher 6 7 to 7 8 the groundwater and river water samples were mostly of ca hco3 type with generally similar compositions figs 3 and 4 the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in the groundwater were 3 9 to 17 2 mg l and 24 2 to 74 3 mg l respectively and correlated strongly with ec table 2 mg2 concentrations also correlated strongly with ec indicating that the distributions of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the groundwater were similar to that of ec that is lower in the upper western area especially in sample uw27 although the river water samples were ca hco3 type the average concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in the samples were lower than those in the groundwater 4 2 dic pco2 and carbon isotopic compositions δ13c dic and δ13c equil co2 of groundwater and river water the dic concentrations of the groundwater samples were 0 50 to 1 63 mmol l with a distinctive distributional pattern table 1 and fig 4 of high concentrations in the western area where lacustrine deposits crop out at the surface and low concentrations near the recharge area e g sample uw27 δ13c dic values in groundwater samples were low 20 near the southern and northern margins of the lfob with an overall range of 22 0 to 14 5 average values of log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 were 2 26 and 25 1 respectively with ranges of 2 98 to 1 56 and 28 6 to 22 8 respectively table 1 and fig 5 the value of log pco2 in the soil is commonly 2 5 to 1 5 appelo and postma 2007 and the δ13c value of s om derived mostly from c3 plants is expected to be around 27 boutton 1991 farquhar et al 1989 vogel et al 1993 as there is little isotopic fractionation between the original s om and the co2 generated 1 during decomposition hains 1977 fenton and ritz 1988 it appears that the influence of co2 on the lfob groundwater has been to produce a higher δ13c value associated with a slightly lower pco2 value values of log pco2 in groundwater samples were low in the upper areas of the lfob and increased gradually to the west and north fig 5 high δ13c equil co2 values were obtained for groundwater samples from the upper western area and some other locations e g sites le17 ue11 and ue15 accordingly we divided the high δ13c equil co2 groundwater samples into two groups one in the western area where pco2 values were high and the other in the lower and upper eastern areas where pco2 values were lower it is noteworthy that groundwater sample uw27 collected near the recharge area had the lowest δ13c equil co2 value 28 6 which is almost the same as that of organic matter derived from c3 plants 27 on average boutton 1991 farquhar et al 1989 vogel et al 1993 in contrast log pco2 for the river water samples was lower mean of 2 89 and δ13c equil co2 values were higher mean of 17 6 than those of the groundwater samples 4 3 carbon isotopic compositions of borehole samples carbon stable isotopic composition table 3 of borehole samples from the lfob was 19 9 on average in detail silty core samples from the urban area of the lfob returned an average δ13c of 15 1 0 6 sample bu1 3 n 3 whereas clay core samples from the southwestern and central parts returned an average δ13c of 22 4 within a range from 23 9 to 20 2 samples bw4 5 and bc6 10 n 2 and 5 respectively these results imply that the δ13c values of the silty core samples likely of lacustrine origin from depths of 2 m in the urban area have higher δ13c values than typical c3 organic matter about 27 they were 12 higher in the urban area and 5 higher in the southwestern and upper eastern areas these results agree well with previous reports that lacustrine deposits have higher δ13c values than typical c3 plants stiller and nissenbaum 1999 murase and sakamoto 2000 gu et al 2006 kristen et al 2010 5 discussion 5 1 mineral weathering deduced from the chemical composition of groundwater groundwater samples from the lfob are dominant of ca hco3 type fig 3 although their ca2 and hco3 concentrations ranged considerably from 3 9 to 17 2 mg l and 24 2 to 74 3 mg l respectively ca2 concentrations correlated strongly r 0 93 with hco3 concentrations fig 6 and table 2 indicating that both ions likely entered the groundwater by the same process since the clastic sediments in the lfob are derived from the adjacent mountains minerals influencing the lfob groundwater will be the rock forming minerals of granitoids andesites metamorphic rocks and limestone although limestone mainly composed of calcite is distributed minorly in the adjacent mountains there is a possibility that calcite is easily dissolved in carbonate water resulting in ca hco3 type water as following equation 17 caco3 co2 h2o ca2 2hco3 then we investigate the possibility that calcite dissolution has influenced the lfob groundwater by using a saturation index for calcite sic eg appelo and postma 2007 the sic values of the lfob groundwater obtained by calculation with the wateq4f program ball and nordstrom 1991 are remarkably undersaturated for calcite irrespective of ph table 1 and fig 7 indicating that calcite dissolution cannot be the reason for the ca hco3 type groundwater in the lfob the next plausible reason for the ca hco3 type groundwater would be a weathering of ca plagioclase anorthite caal2si2o8 a characteristic mineral of granite andesite and some metamorphic rocks although na plagioclase albite is more common in these rocks it is well known that anorthite is much more susceptible to weathering than albite as following equation e g goldich 1938 faure 1991 18 caal2si2o8 2co2 3h2o ca2 2hco3 al2si2o5 oh 4 which produces al2si2o5 oh 4 kaolinite as a secondary clay mineral eq 18 implies that the weathering of one mole of anorthite releases into solution one mole of ca2 and two moles of hco3 that is one milli equivalent each of both ions the relationship between measured ca2 and hco3 concentrations for all water samples fig 6 shows that the ca hco3 ratios are slightly lower than the theoretical ratio of eq 18 although the relationship is still linear these findings indicate that although there is a strong association between ca2 and hco3 concentrations in lfob water samples it cannot be explained solely by the weathering of anorthite we also identified a strong correlation between mg2 and hco3 concentrations in the lfob water samples r 0 80 table 2 which may indicate that the chemistry of those samples has also been influenced by weathering of pyroxene camgfeal2si3o12 or hornblende na0 5ca2 fe1 3mg2 6al1 1 al1 6si6 4 o22 oh 2 characteristic minerals of andesite and metamorphic rocks found in the mountains adjacent to the lfob weathering of pyroxene is expressed as follows faure 1991 velbel 1989 19 camgfeal2si3o12 0 25o2 4co2 5 5h2o ca2 mg2 4hco3

order to explain ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the lfob groundwater we examine two cases of weathering processes a weathering of anorthite and pyroxene and b weathering of anorthite and hornblende in a stoichiometric way as following procedures assuming that all mg2 was derived from pyroxene case a or hornblende case b as following eq 19 or 20 although ca2 was partially from pyroxene or hornblende weathering in both cases we assumed that the remaining ca2 was attributed to anorthite weathering then we obtained a difference in hco3 concentrations between the actual one in the groundwater sample and the expected one through weathering equations 18 to 20 most of the differences in hco3 concentrations are at around 0 mmol l in both cases of a and b tables 4 and 5 demonstrating that the chemical compositions of the water samples can be explained by both weathering cases of anorthite and pyroxene or anorthite and hornblende from the stoichiometric viewpoint because strontium belongs to alkaline earth metals in periodic tables and it becomes a divalent ion in water as well as calcium 87sr 86sr ratios can be used as a tool to elucidate the source and transport of ca2 in water ikeda 2016 indicated that the lfob groundwaters have relatively low 87sr 86sr ratios 0 70633 0 70946 and their low 87sr 86sr ratios are likely to volcanic rocks origins furthermore arakawa et al 2000 pointed out that amphibolite in the hida belt metamorphic rocks at the eastern adjacent region of the study area has low 87sr 86sr ratios of 0 7056 0 7075 while most hida gneiss and granite in the region have high 87sr 86sr ratios 0 7101 0 7209 and 0 7106 0 7152 arakawa and shinmura 1995 these findings are concordant well with the idea that the lfob groundwater chemistry is controlled by anorthite weathering associated with pyroxene or hornblende amphibole weathering as eqs 18 to 20 5 2 constraints on groundwater movement according to the relationship of carbon stable isotopes to pco2 we have shown in eqs 18 to 20 that weathering of anorthite with pyroxene or with hornblende is driven by the addition of h to water associated with co2 dissolution as described by eqs 2 and 3 and the dissolved co2 is eventually converted to dic in the form of hco3 because the supply of dic is an essential process in aquatic chemistry and is closely related to weathering processes quantitative analysis of dic supply might provide constraints on groundwater movement in the lfob from an aspect of chemical reactions occurring in the flow thus to evaluate the source and supply processes of dic we examined the relationship between log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 in water samples from the lfob fig 8 the river water samples have lower log pco2 values and higher δ13c equil co2 values than the groundwater samples and apart from sample rk lie in a relatively narrow field fig 8 the groundwater samples form two groups group a samples le17 ue11 ue14 and uw21 has lower log pco2 values and group b the remaining groundwater samples has higher log pco2 values than that of sample uw27 log pco2 2 7 which also provided the lowest δ13c equil co2 the similarity of the values of log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 in group a with those of river water can be attributed to direct recharge penetration from the river water into the g1 aquifer in contrast the higher log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 values of group b widely distributed in the lfob can be attributed to the addition of co2 with relatively high δ13c values to recharged groundwater during groundwater flow this co2 with high δ13c could have been supplied from decomposed om in the shallow argillaceous sediments recovered from 2 m depth at the three core sites next we evaluated the processes as described above for groups a and b by using model calculations with carbon isotopic signatures related to pco2 5 3 model calculations with carbon stable isotopes to evaluate river water penetration into an aquifer we undertook model calculations to investigate the possibility that the chemistry of group a groundwater samples was influenced by direct recharge of river water because the log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 values of the river water samples are distinctive we used carbon stable isotopes as an indicator in the mixing model calculations of river water and initial recharged groundwater components we calculated the partial pressure of co2 in theoretical mixed water pco2 mix for a range of river water fractions 0 f riv 1 as follows 21 pco2 mix pco2 riv f riv pco2 gw 1 f riv where the subscripts riv and gw indicate river water and groundwater components respectively we obtained the carbon isotopic compositions of co2 in equilibrium with the theoretical mixed water δ13c equil co2 mix by the following equation 22 δ13c equil co2 mix δ13c equil co 2 riv pco2 riv pco2 mix f riv δ13c equil co2 gw pco2 riv pco2 mix 1 f riv because of the low variability of log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 of the river water samples apart from sample rk which we excluded we used mean values pco2 riv 10 3 1 bar and δ13c equil co2 riv 18 6 and because the lowest value of δ13c equil co2 28 6 was obtained from sample uw27 near the southern recharge area we assumed the initial recharged groundwater initial groundwater hereafter flowing from the mountains into the lfob to have similar log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 values to those of sample uw27 hence we used those values pco2 gw 10 2 7 bar and δ13c equil co2 gw 28 6 for the groundwater component the relationships between log pco2 mix and δ13c equil co2 mix in the mixed water model calculations fig 8 show that most of the group a groundwater samples lie close to the groundwater river water mixing line and are thus well explained by this mixing the mixing model calculations also show that a groundwater sample from the lower area sample le17 includes up to 80 river water whereas those from the upper area samples ue11 ue14 and uw21 contain approximately 30 70 river water ohno city 2013 reported water loss at 0 332 m3 s from the mana river near the le17 sampling site which supports the extensive penetration of river water into the g1 aquifer there as implied by the mixing calculations the upper area of the lfob is on a gently sloping alluvial fan figs 1 and 2 composed mainly of surface clastic sediments which also suggests that river water would easily penetrate into the aquifer in this area as demonstrated in the calculations thus based on our analysis of carbon stable isotopic tracers we presume that river water penetrates into the aquifer mainly in the upper area of the lfob although the resultant penetration cannot be confirmed on the basis of chemical composition alone because the river water and groundwater have similar ca hco3 type chemistries fig 3 we gained a better understanding of this penetration by consideration of the differences in δ13c values in river water and groundwater which is discussed in section 5 6 5 4 model calculations with carbon stable isotopes to evaluate the influence of om decomposition on groundwater as discussed in section 5 2 it is likely that group b groundwater samples with relatively high log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 values have been affected by om decomposition in sediments we performed model calculations which simulate the gradual dissolution of co2 derived from om into the initial groundwater based on four assumptions a groundwater sample uw27 from near the recharge area represents the initial groundwater again b co2 gas equilibrated with the initial groundwater has a log pco2 mod value of 2 7 the lowest pco2 value we obtained from group b groundwater sample uw27 near the southern recharge area c additional co2 is supplied by decomposition of a mixture of om from c3 plants c3 om and lacustrine organic matter l om derived from shallow 2 m depth argillaceous sediments in the lfob the fraction of l om included in decomposed om f l om varies in the range 0 f l om 1 we used δ13c equil co2 values of 28 6 sample uw27 for c3 om and 19 9 the mean δ13c value of om in the lfob argillaceous sediments for l om d under co2 equilibrium conditions and constant f l om log pco2 in this model calculations increases up to 1 5 which is about the maximum value observed in the lfob groundwater i e 2 7 log pco2 mod 1 5 as given log pco2 mod and f l om carbon isotopic compositions of co2 in equilibrium with the model groundwater δ13c equil co2 mod are obtained from the following equation 23 δ13c equil co2 mod 28 6 10 2 7 28 6 1 f l om 19 9 f l om 2pco2 mod 10 2 7 2pco2 mod the relationships between δ13c equil co2 mod and log pco2 mod in the model groundwater influenced by co2 dissolution through om decomposition fig 8 show that most of the group b groundwater samples lie in the region 0 3 f l om 0 7 this outcome indicates that most of the group b groundwater samples are well explained by the model calculations simulating the co2 dissolution process into the initial groundwater and the essential condition is up to 1 5 of log pco2 derived from the decomposition of om containing 30 70 l om it is noteworthy that the spatial distribution of most of the groundwater samples with high pco2 log pco2 2 0 corresponds with that of lacustrine deposits at the surface fig 1 hence the decomposition of the greater amounts of om in the lacustrine sediments would result in the accumulation of greater amounts of co2 in the groundwater of the underlying aquifers in contrast samples ue22 and uw23 from near the southern mountains have lower values of f lom 0 3 and log pco2 2 3 which we attribute to less influence of om decomposition associated with the lower l om fraction there this interpretation is consistent with the location of samples ue22 and uw23 in an area of gently sloping clastic deposits where om rich lacustrine or argillaceous deposits are unlikely to be present the low ca2 and hco3 concentrations of these two samples fig 4 might also be ascribed to such an om distribution less om in overlying sediments would lead to less decomposition of om and less co2 dissolution in groundwater eventually leading to lower ca2 and hco3 concentrations in the groundwater owing to less occurrence of eq 18 many previous hydrological studies involving carbon stable isotopes have reported that isotopic enrichment due to molecular diffusion of co2 gas through soil pores is generally in the range of 1 to 4 maximum reported 4 4 e g craig 1954 dörr and münnich 1980 cerling 1984 hendry et al 1993 nevertheless it appears that there was little fractionation in our study because the δ13c equil co2 value of the initial groundwater sample uw27 was almost identical to the δ13c value of c3 om 28 6 which may reflect the hydrogeological setting of the lfob for instance argillaceous sediments lie closely above groundwater table although co2 diffusion is commonly enhanced in porous sandy sediments as discussed above the model calculations in which the initial recharged groundwater sample uw27 was employed as a groundwater component explained well the relationships between δ13c equil co2 and pco2 in group a groundwater indicating that the influence of om decomposition in the lfob underground is almost negligible for group a except for the sample le17 this indication is consistent in terms of the distributions since the samples are in an area of gently sloping clastic deposits where om rich deposits are unlikely to be present for the remaining sample le17 the high ratio about 80 of river water penetration might hide the om decomposition influence in fig 8 although the sample is from the lowland area likely with om rich deposits 5 5 groundwater recharge flow systems deduced from the model calculation results the model calculations simulating co2 dissolution into the initial groundwater demonstrated that dic in the lfob groundwater is controlled mainly by the dissolution of co2 originated from om of which l om lies in the interval 30 70 thus consideration of the om distributions and groundwater levels in the lfob underground might provide constraints on groundwater movements in the basin l om with higher δ13c in the lfob is dominantly at or near the surface it is present in surface exposures of lacustrine deposits in the western area along the akane river and at sampling sites bw4 to 5 and bc6 to 10 and at 0 5 2 0 m depth at sampling sites bu1 to 3 fig 1 the depth of groundwater in the lfob varies from a few meters to more than 20 m below the surface albeit with seasonal fluctuations thus the lacustrine deposits are mostly shallower than the groundwater and therefore not in direct contact with it over most of the lfob fig 2 according to the model results fig 8 co2 with around 28 6 of δ13c value typical value of c3 om is required to be added to the groundwater along with the flow as a source of such co2 the om in the clayey sediments acting as aquiclude such as the unit g2u is the most likely candidate because there is no other source than it considering such om distributions in the lfob underground the model results might be converted to an interpretation for groundwater recharge flow systems as follows the groundwater influenced by l om is supplied by downward percolation of precipitation from the surface through a discontinuous part of lacustrine deposits in contrast the groundwater influenced by c3 om would be horizontal advected groundwater derived from the mountains that surround the lfob and would be about 30 70 of lfob groundwater these aspects of the results of our model calculations are summarized in fig 9 in which it is shown that the weathering of anorthite with pyroxene or hornblende influences the chemistry of the ca hco3 type lfob groundwater which is associated with decomposition of similar proportions 30 70 of l om and c3 om the proportions of l om and c3 om may reflect the proportions of the downward and horizontal components respectively in the recharge flow system of the lfob groundwater although both may be locally affected by direct penetration of river water it is important to note that our interpretation by using the model calculations is essentially based on the fact that the δ13c values of l om are considerably higher than those of c3 om which is discussed further in the next section 5 6 factors controlling carbon isotopic compositions of river water and lacustrine organic matter model calculations according to eqs 21 to 23 allowed us to discriminate the carbon of c3 om from the carbon of river water and lacustrine deposits based on the higher isotopic compositions of the latter we now discuss the factors that control the higher isotopic compositions of the carbon derived from river water and lacustrine deposits the river water samples have high δ13c equil co2 values around 19 apart from sample rk fig 8 which are higher than those of the groundwater and demonstrate that they are not supplied simply by decomposition of c3 om this interpretation is consistent with the log pco2 values of most of the river water samples 3 0 being lower than that of typical soil co2 these characteristics of the δ13c and pco2 of river water have been reported in numerous studies that have concluded that the global average content of carbon in river water derived from soil om is 67 and the remaining 33 is from atmospheric co2 berner et al 1983 meybeck 1987 amiotte suchet and probst 1995 ludwig et al 1997 amiotte suchet et al 1999 the relationship of δ13c equil co2 to log pco2 fig 8 shows that most of the river water samples of our study lie midway between the compositions of atmospheric co2 and groundwater sample uw27 which was influenced by c3 om our results are therefore consistent with the above referenced studies which showed that dic in river water contains both atmospheric co2 and carbon derived from om on the other hand a lot of previous studies have used carbon isotopic compositions of om in sedimentary archives as indicators in evaluations of both modern and paleo environments castañeda and schouten 2011 leng and henderson 2013 diefendorf and freimuth 2017 andrae et al 2020 according to these works the om in terrestrial sediments such as in lacustrine deposits is generally enriched in 13c likely because most aquatic macrophytes have higher δ13c values 30 to 12 than c3 plants the reasons of the higher δ13c values are not well understood but it has been suggested that there may be several controlling factors e g boutton 1991 tolbot and johannessen 1992 one such factor is the ability of aquatic macrophytes to assimilate carbon from dissolved hco3 during photosynthesis with the source hco3 being more 13c enriched than co2 by 7 11 smith and walker 1980 lazerte and szalados 1982 schidlowski et al 1984 keeley 1990 another possible factor revealed by recent studies is the 13c isotopic enrichment of both dic and om by photosynthesis in a semi closed lake that is similar to the rayleigh distillation process e g faure and mensing 2005 for instance maybo and shapley 2006 reported that epilimnetic δ13c values higher than the corresponding hypolimnetic values in a lake can be attributed to photosynthesis and decomposition by preferential uptake of 12c from the epilimnion and its release into the hypolimnion yamanaka 2017 applied a rayleigh model to similar observations during a period of summer lake stagnancy and concluded that up to 30 of dic was consumed by photosynthesis with an isotopic enrichment factor ε of 16 6 such isotopic enrichment agrees well with the work of hollander and mckenzie 1991 who calculated the δ13c difference between dic and particulate organic matter in a lake in summer which is generally analog to the value of ε indeed by using δ13c dic of 6 in the hypolimnion and ε 16 6 which were reported by yamanaka 2017 the particulate organic matter in the lake is expected to have a δ13c value of 23 6 16 6 which is considerably higher than that of typical c3 om 27 deines 1980 vogel et al 1993 thus the high δ13c values of l om in samples from the lfob could be a result of one or more of the controlling factors described above 6 conclusions in this study we explored the hydrogeochemical controls and recharge flow system of groundwater in the lowland of the fukui ohno basin central japan by using measured carbon isotopic and chemical compositions as hydrogeochemical tracers ca hco3 type groundwater is dominant in the basin lowland the groundwater has high concentrations of ca2 and hco3 and some mg2 we attributed the high ca2 and hco3 concentrations to weathering of anorthite in the aquifer and the mg2 concentrations to weathering of pyroxene or hornblende both at partial co2 pressures that are typically observed in soils we found little or no evidence that the groundwater was affected by the dissolution of calcite on the basis of the partial pressure of co2 log pco2 and carbon isotopic compositions of co2 equilibrated with water we recognized two groups of groundwater samples the first with lower log pco2 and the second with higher log pco2 values than those of the initial recharged groundwater for both groups the isotopic composition of co2 equilibrated with water was higher than that of the initial groundwater model calculations revealed the following controls on the chemistry of the two groups for the first group groundwater in the southern part of the basin included 30 to 70 river water the higher log pco2 values of the second group are likely a result of the addition of co2 with high δ13c to the groundwater during basinward flow from the surrounding mountainous area our model calculations showed that the groundwater contains roughly equal proportions 30 70 of dic sourced from lacustrine sediments and c3 organic matter the spatial distribution of these two types of organic matter in and around the basin suggests that there are two components of groundwater recharge downward percolation of precipitation into the aquifer within the lowland basin and mainly horizontal migration of groundwater originating in the mountains and flowing through aquifers into the lowland basin

2928,carbon stable isotopic compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic and chemical compositions of groundwater were used to investigate the processes of supply of dic to groundwater in the lowland area of the fukui ohno basin and to examine constraints on the groundwater recharge flow system the groundwater in the basin is dominantly of ca hco3 type with relatively high concentrations of ca2 and hco3 and lower concentrations of mg2 this groundwater chemistry can be attributed to weathering within the aquifer of mainly anorthite and some pyroxene at partial pressures of co2 that are typical of soils the δ13c values of the co2 gas initially equilibrated with dic in the groundwater were calculated to be 28 6 to 22 8 indicating that the groundwater in the lowland basin has two main sources of carbon 1 c3 organic matter δ13c 29 distributed mainly in mountains surrounding much of the basin and in aquicludes within the basin and 2 organic matter in shallow lacustrine deposits within the lowland basin δ13c 20 the results of modeling accounting for these two sources demonstrated that roughly equal proportions 50 20 of dic in the groundwater are sourced from lacustrine deposits and c3 organic matter the distributions of these types of organic matters in and around the lowland basin suggest that there are two major and roughly equal components of groundwater recharge a vertical component of downward percolation of precipitation in the lowland area and a mainly horizontal component of groundwater flow originating in the mountains around the study area and flowing through aquifers into the lowland basin keywords carbon isotopic composition mineral weathering decomposition of organic material lacustrine deposits river water mixing groundwater recharge flow system 1 introduction the use of stable isotope tracers such as sulfur δ34s chlorine δ37cl and strontium 87sr 86sr in numerous hydrological studies has provided valuable information about the supply of dissolved ions containing the isotope tracers to groundwater dogramaci et al 2001 nakano et al 2001 2005 lavastre et al 2005 yamanaka et al 2005 2014 yamanaka and kumagai 2006 cartwright et al 2007 bottrell et al 2008 hosono et al 2010 2011 beekman et al 2011 the use of the carbon stable isotope tracer of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic has clarified several supply processes for instance the dissolution processes of carbonate minerals dogramaci and herczeg 2002 hu and burdige 2007 hori et al 2008 li et al 2010 yamanaka 2012 and those of co2 derived from sedimentary deposits containing organic matter om or from deep magma sources amiotte suchet et al 1999 crossey et al 2009 jirakova et al 2010 sakai et al 2011 yamada et al 2011 yamanaka 2012 however understanding carbon stable isotopic signatures is difficult because of three following characteristics that are seldom observed in other isotopic tracers e g boutton 1991 clark and fritz 1997 schulte et al 2011 clark 2015 1 δ13cdic values can be modified by various processes not only by the processes of dissolution of co2 or carbonate carbon ex caco3 in water but also by removal of carbon from water by precipitation of carbonate or co2 degassing amiotte suchet et al 1999 finlay 2003 yoshimura et al 2004 yamanaka and sakamoto 2016 2 even if dissolved inorganic carbon dic originates solely from soil co2 the δ13cdic values differ from those of co2 this difference is derived from the ph dependency of the relative abundances of carbonic species and from isotopic fractionation between co2 and the species h2co3 i e co2 aq and h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 to evaluate the source of dic in water by using δ13cdic values it is therefore essential to calculate δ13c values of co2 equilibrated with the water e g zhang et al 1995 3 the δ13c values of soil organic matter s om an important source of soil co2 vary considerably according to plant species about 27 for c3 plants and about 12 5 for c4 plants e g deines 1980 vogel et al 1993 in addition organic matter om in eutrophic lakes and lacustrine deposits can have higher δ13c values than those of typical c3 plants stiller and nissenbaum 1999 murase and sakamoto 2000 gu et al 2006 kristen et al 2010 such variations of the δ13c values of s om as a source of dic in water make identification of the source difficult because of these difficulties the effective use of δ13cdic values to evaluate the processes occurring in water requires an ideal hydro geomorphological setting in which there are not too many carbon sources with every distinctive δ13c value in addition to clearly defined groundwater flow paths a sedimentary basin is a relatively simple hydro geomorphological unit with simple groundwater movement groundwater recharge occurs mainly from surrounding uplands the groundwater then migrates basinward according to the hydraulic gradient within aquifers accumulates in the central basin and finally flows from the basin at the point of lowest elevation at the basin perimeter inland basins in which the central area is filled with argillaceous sediments of lacustrine origin provide an ideal setting for groundwater investigations along the flow based on δ13c tracers because the lacustrine basin sediments can have distinctive δ13c values the lowland area of fukui ohno basin in central japan is an example of such a groundwater system fig 1 in this study we used the δ13c values of groundwater and argillaceous sediments and groundwater chemistry to explore the hydrogeochemical controls and recharge flow systems in the groundwater of the lowland area of fukui ohno basin 2 study area the lowland area of fukui ohno basin lfob hereafter covers an area of about 70 km2 about 40 km inland from the sea of japan coast and is surrounded to the east west and south by mountains that rise to 1300 1700 m above sea level fig 1 the geological setting of the lfob has been well described by ohno city and risuisha 2003 and ohno city 2013 and is summarized here as follows basement rocks in the surrounding mountains of the lfob are composed mainly of slate and sandstone of the hida belt of permian to jurassic age which are partially metamorphized including minor marine limestone locally intruded by funatsu granitoids of jurassic age and covered by neogene andesite from a macroscopic viewpoint the hida belt is distributed widely in southern to eastern mountains and neogene andesite is mainly in northern to western mountains the lfob is faulted along its southern and southeastern margins and lies within a tectonic basin that has been filled with clastic sediments deposited by the akane kiyotaki mana and kuzuryu rivers although the stratigraphy of the clastic sediments is ill defined due to their distributional heterogeneity they have been divided into units g3 g2 g1 ag and ac in ascending stratigraphic order ohno city 2013 fig 2 units g3 g1 are mainly sand and gravel with some clay and behave as aquifers because of their high hydraulic conductivity up to 1 0 10 1 m s although the upper part of unit g2 g2u likely has higher clay content and behaves in part as an aquiclude unit g1 10 20 m thick is the main unconfined aquifer in the study area and is overlain by 10 m of holocene alluvium comprising a pebbly sand gravel subunit ag and an argillaceous subunit ac unit ac which is of lacustrine origin is distributed mainly at the surface in the western part of the lfob along the akane river and also seems to be in the central and eastern parts of the lfob however unit ac is discontinuous in several areas of the lfob resulting in that it seldom acts as a confining bed except for a part of the urban area as illustrated in fig 2 the groundwater level is shallowest in the lfob urban area at about 1 m depth from the surface where the groundwater in the g1 aquifer is partially under artesian conditions this indicates that the groundwater level was enough higher than the bottom level of lacustrine deposits being as a confining bed and the bed is likely continuous in this area on the other hand the level in the aquifers is more than 20 m below the surface with seasonal fluctuations in the upper area which is on a gently sloping alluvial fan figs 1 and 2 the groundwater levels in the lfob fig 1 indicate that groundwater flows predominantly from south to north ohno city and risuisha 2003 ohno city 2013 as the lfob land use the most area is the cultivated field except for the urban area where houses are dominant fig 1 while the surrounding mountains are forested 3 methods 3 1 samples in september 2019 we collected three types of water samples groundwater samples from 28 wells whose screens are at g1 aquifer 1 spring sample sample uw27 at the foot of the mountain and river water samples at 4 sites figs 1 2 and table 1 by using the groundwater levels of 165 m and 175 m as classification boundaries the lfob groundwater samples can be classified into three 13 from the upper area 11 from the middle area and 5 from the lower area each of which is subdivided into eastern and western areas by kiyotaki river of these areas the middle western area almost coincides with the urban area temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec horiba co d 54 ph conductivity meter of water were determined in the field at each site two water samples 100 and 500 ml were collected in polyethylene bottles the 100 and 500 ml samples were used to determine chemical and carbon isotopic compositions respectively as described in section 3 2 ohno city office provided us with borehole sediment samples bu1 to bu3 collected from a silty layer at 0 5 2 0 m depth at site bu of the urban area in june 2021 we used a hand auger to collect several clay samples in the southwestern and

dependent mainly on ph as follows 2 co2 g h2o h2co3 3 h2co3 h hco3 4 hco3 h co3 2 here subscripted g represents the gaseous phase the equilibrium constants for eqs 2 to 4 i e kh k1 and k2 respectively and the relationships between k and temperature t can be expressed as follows clark and fritz 1997 5 kh h2co3 pco2 6 k1 h hco3 h2co3 7 k2 h co3 2 hco3 8 pkh 7 10 5 t2 0 016 t 1 11 9 pk1 1 1 10 4 t2 0

and co3 2 at ph greater than 8 3 because ph in the groundwater and river water is mostly in a narrow range of 7 0 0 5 as described in section 4 1 the dic in these waters is composed dominantly of hco3 with smaller amounts of h2co3 and a little of co3 2 because the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions are quite low at ph 7 the alkalinity alk value obtained by titration at ph 4 8 has the following relationship with carbonate species 11 alk hco3 2 co3 2 by using measured values of alk ph and t of water in eqs 5 to 11 the concentrations of each of the carbonate species e g h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 can be calculated in all water samples alk can be expressed as hco3 with calculated percentages of co3 2 in dic being quite low 0 28 in this case dic concentrations in water samples are calculated as follows 12 dic h2co3 hco3 co3 2 then by using h2co3 concentrations in eq 5 pco2 can be obtained for the water samples 3 4 calculations of carbon isotopic compositions of equilibrium co2 with water samples δ13c equil co2 as shown in eqs 2 and 3 the process of dissolution of co2 in water generates hco3 a species of dic as well as h which frequently enhances weathering processes of the surrounding minerals in aquatic conditions this means that the co2 dissolution process plays an essential role in both the dic supply process and the mineral weathering process in water on the other hand generated co2 has an almost identical δ13c value to that of the original organic matter even through decompositions since co2 eventually attains equilibrium conditions in the co2 dissolution process the carbon isotopic composition of co2 in equilibrium with water δ13c equil co2 hereafter must tell us something not only about the origin of dic but also about mineral weathering processes associated with h consumption in water next we obtained δ13c equil co2 from the groundwater and river water samples as follows if water is in equilibrium with a given co2 gas and because each carbonate species has a different δ13c value δ13c h2co3 δ13c hco3 and δ13c co3 the carbon stable isotopic composition of dic δ13c dic is expressed as a function of the δ13c values of three species as follows 13 δ 13 c dic δ 13 c h 2 co 3 h 2 co 3 δ 13 c hco 3 hco 3 δ 13 c co 3 co 3 2 dic here the δ13c values of the carbonate species are controlled by water temperature and the δ13c values of equilibrated co2 gas isotopic fractionation factors between dissolved carbonate species and co2 gas α13c h2co3 co2 g α13c hco3 co2 g and α13c co3 co2 g can be obtained according to eqs 14 to 16 of vogel et al 1970 mook et al 1974 and deines et al 1974 respectively 14 103 ln α13c h2co3 co2 g 0 373 103 t 1 0 19 15 103 ln α13c hco3 co2 g 9 552 103 t 1 24 10 16 103 ln α13c co3 co2 g 0 87 106 t 2 3 4 in these equations α represents the isotopic fractionation factor if t k is set to the measured water temperature of each water sample the calculated values of 103 ln α13c h2co3 co2 g 103 ln α13c hco3 co2 g and 103 ln α13c co3 co2 g are 1 12 to 1 07 8 26 to 9 37 and 6 58 to 7 28 respectively these values represent the approximate differences between the δ13c values of co2 and those of each of the carbonate species present under the assumption that dic is supplied only by co2 dissolution when dic in water is in equilibrium with co2 eq 13 can be used to determine δ13c equil co2 as follows on the right hand side of eq 13 concentrations of carbonate species of h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 are obtained from eqs 5 to 11 whereas their isotopic compositions δ13c h2co3 δ13c hco3 and δ13c co3 are obtained by using the isotopic fractionation factors α in eqs 14 to 16 and a provisional value of δ13c equil co2 for instance 27 is expected for co2 with c3 om origin e g deines 1980 vogel et al 1993 because the true value of δ13c dic on the left hand side of eq 13 is the measured value of the sample the δ13c equil co2 value is that obtained at the time when the calculated δ13c dic value in the right hand side of eq 13 coincides with the measured true value in the left hand side 4 results 4 1 ec ph and chemical compositions of groundwater and river water the field measurements and analytical results for the groundwater and river water samples from the lfob are listed in table 1 the ec of the groundwater was 61 to 166 μs cm although the range of ec was relatively wide in the upper eastern area it was narrower 110 μs cm in the urban middle west and lower areas of the lfob and ec was low in the upper western area especially adjacent to the mountainous recharge areas where groundwater sample uw27 had the lowest measured ec 61 μs cm the range of ec of the river water was 53 to 82 μs cm clearly lower than that of the groundwater the ph of the groundwater was 5 9 to 7 6 but was mostly within a narrow range of 7 0 0 5 the ph of the river water was slightly higher 6 7 to 7 8 the groundwater and river water samples were mostly of ca hco3 type with generally similar compositions figs 3 and 4 the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in the groundwater were 3 9 to 17 2 mg l and 24 2 to 74 3 mg l respectively and correlated strongly with ec table 2 mg2 concentrations also correlated strongly with ec indicating that the distributions of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the groundwater were similar to that of ec that is lower in the upper western area especially in sample uw27 although the river water samples were ca hco3 type the average concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in the samples were lower than those in the groundwater 4 2 dic pco2 and carbon isotopic compositions δ13c dic and δ13c equil co2 of groundwater and river water the dic concentrations of the groundwater samples were 0 50 to 1 63 mmol l with a distinctive distributional pattern table 1 and fig 4 of high concentrations in the western area where lacustrine deposits crop out at the surface and low concentrations near the recharge area e g sample uw27 δ13c dic values in groundwater samples were low 20 near the southern and northern margins of the lfob with an overall range of 22 0 to 14 5 average values of log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 were 2 26 and 25 1 respectively with ranges of 2 98 to 1 56 and 28 6 to 22 8 respectively table 1 and fig 5 the value of log pco2 in the soil is commonly 2 5 to 1 5 appelo and postma 2007 and the δ13c value of s om derived mostly from c3 plants is expected to be around 27 boutton 1991 farquhar et al 1989 vogel et al 1993 as there is little isotopic fractionation between the original s om and the co2 generated 1 during decomposition hains 1977 fenton and ritz 1988 it appears that the influence of co2 on the lfob groundwater has been to produce a higher δ13c value associated with a slightly lower pco2 value values of log pco2 in groundwater samples were low in the upper areas of the lfob and increased gradually to the west and north fig 5 high δ13c equil co2 values were obtained for groundwater samples from the upper western area and some other locations e g sites le17 ue11 and ue15 accordingly we divided the high δ13c equil co2 groundwater samples into two groups one in the western area where pco2 values were high and the other in the lower and upper eastern areas where pco2 values were lower it is noteworthy that groundwater sample uw27 collected near the recharge area had the lowest δ13c equil co2 value 28 6 which is almost the same as that of organic matter derived from c3 plants 27 on average boutton 1991 farquhar et al 1989 vogel et al 1993 in contrast log pco2 for the river water samples was lower mean of 2 89 and δ13c equil co2 values were higher mean of 17 6 than those of the groundwater samples 4 3 carbon isotopic compositions of borehole samples carbon stable isotopic composition table 3 of borehole samples from the lfob was 19 9 on average in detail silty core samples from the urban area of the lfob returned an average δ13c of 15 1 0 6 sample bu1 3 n 3 whereas clay core samples from the southwestern and central parts returned an average δ13c of 22 4 within a range from 23 9 to 20 2 samples bw4 5 and bc6 10 n 2 and 5 respectively these results imply that the δ13c values of the silty core samples likely of lacustrine origin from depths of 2 m in the urban area have higher δ13c values than typical c3 organic matter about 27 they were 12 higher in the urban area and 5 higher in the southwestern and upper eastern areas these results agree well with previous reports that lacustrine deposits have higher δ13c values than typical c3 plants stiller and nissenbaum 1999 murase and sakamoto 2000 gu et al 2006 kristen et al 2010 5 discussion 5 1 mineral weathering deduced from the chemical composition of groundwater groundwater samples from the lfob are dominant of ca hco3 type fig 3 although their ca2 and hco3 concentrations ranged considerably from 3 9 to 17 2 mg l and 24 2 to 74 3 mg l respectively ca2 concentrations correlated strongly r 0 93 with hco3 concentrations fig 6 and table 2 indicating that both ions likely entered the groundwater by the same process since the clastic sediments in the lfob are derived from the adjacent mountains minerals influencing the lfob groundwater will be the rock forming minerals of granitoids andesites metamorphic rocks and limestone although limestone mainly composed of calcite is distributed minorly in the adjacent mountains there is a possibility that calcite is easily dissolved in carbonate water resulting in ca hco3 type water as following equation 17 caco3 co2 h2o ca2 2hco3 then we investigate the possibility that calcite dissolution has influenced the lfob groundwater by using a saturation index for calcite sic eg appelo and postma 2007 the sic values of the lfob groundwater obtained by calculation with the wateq4f program ball and nordstrom 1991 are remarkably undersaturated for calcite irrespective of ph table 1 and fig 7 indicating that calcite dissolution cannot be the reason for the ca hco3 type groundwater in the lfob the next plausible reason for the ca hco3 type groundwater would be a weathering of ca plagioclase anorthite caal2si2o8 a characteristic mineral of granite andesite and some metamorphic rocks although na plagioclase albite is more common in these rocks it is well known that anorthite is much more susceptible to weathering than albite as following equation e g goldich 1938 faure 1991 18 caal2si2o8 2co2 3h2o ca2 2hco3 al2si2o5 oh 4 which produces al2si2o5 oh 4 kaolinite as a secondary clay mineral eq 18 implies that the weathering of one mole of anorthite releases into solution one mole of ca2 and two moles of hco3 that is one milli equivalent each of both ions the relationship between measured ca2 and hco3 concentrations for all water samples fig 6 shows that the ca hco3 ratios are slightly lower than the theoretical ratio of eq 18 although the relationship is still linear these findings indicate that although there is a strong association between ca2 and hco3 concentrations in lfob water samples it cannot be explained solely by the weathering of anorthite we also identified a strong correlation between mg2 and hco3 concentrations in the lfob water samples r 0 80 table 2 which may indicate that the chemistry of those samples has also been influenced by weathering of pyroxene camgfeal2si3o12 or hornblende na0 5ca2 fe1 3mg2 6al1 1 al1 6si6 4 o22 oh 2 characteristic minerals of andesite and metamorphic rocks found in the mountains adjacent to the lfob weathering of pyroxene is expressed as follows faure 1991 velbel 1989 19 camgfeal2si3o12 0 25o2 4co2 5 5h2o ca2 mg2 4hco3

order to explain ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the lfob groundwater we examine two cases of weathering processes a weathering of anorthite and pyroxene and b weathering of anorthite and hornblende in a stoichiometric way as following procedures assuming that all mg2 was derived from pyroxene case a or hornblende case b as following eq 19 or 20 although ca2 was partially from pyroxene or hornblende weathering in both cases we assumed that the remaining ca2 was attributed to anorthite weathering then we obtained a difference in hco3 concentrations between the actual one in the groundwater sample and the expected one through weathering equations 18 to 20 most of the differences in hco3 concentrations are at around 0 mmol l in both cases of a and b tables 4 and 5 demonstrating that the chemical compositions of the water samples can be explained by both weathering cases of anorthite and pyroxene or anorthite and hornblende from the stoichiometric viewpoint because strontium belongs to alkaline earth metals in periodic tables and it becomes a divalent ion in water as well as calcium 87sr 86sr ratios can be used as a tool to elucidate the source and transport of ca2 in water ikeda 2016 indicated that the lfob groundwaters have relatively low 87sr 86sr ratios 0 70633 0 70946 and their low 87sr 86sr ratios are likely to volcanic rocks origins furthermore arakawa et al 2000 pointed out that amphibolite in the hida belt metamorphic rocks at the eastern adjacent region of the study area has low 87sr 86sr ratios of 0 7056 0 7075 while most hida gneiss and granite in the region have high 87sr 86sr ratios 0 7101 0 7209 and 0 7106 0 7152 arakawa and shinmura 1995 these findings are concordant well with the idea that the lfob groundwater chemistry is controlled by anorthite weathering associated with pyroxene or hornblende amphibole weathering as eqs 18 to 20 5 2 constraints on groundwater movement according to the relationship of carbon stable isotopes to pco2 we have shown in eqs 18 to 20 that weathering of anorthite with pyroxene or with hornblende is driven by the addition of h to water associated with co2 dissolution as described by eqs 2 and 3 and the dissolved co2 is eventually converted to dic in the form of hco3 because the supply of dic is an essential process in aquatic chemistry and is closely related to weathering processes quantitative analysis of dic supply might provide constraints on groundwater movement in the lfob from an aspect of chemical reactions occurring in the flow thus to evaluate the source and supply processes of dic we examined the relationship between log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 in water samples from the lfob fig 8 the river water samples have lower log pco2 values and higher δ13c equil co2 values than the groundwater samples and apart from sample rk lie in a relatively narrow field fig 8 the groundwater samples form two groups group a samples le17 ue11 ue14 and uw21 has lower log pco2 values and group b the remaining groundwater samples has higher log pco2 values than that of sample uw27 log pco2 2 7 which also provided the lowest δ13c equil co2 the similarity of the values of log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 in group a with those of river water can be attributed to direct recharge penetration from the river water into the g1 aquifer in contrast the higher log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 values of group b widely distributed in the lfob can be attributed to the addition of co2 with relatively high δ13c values to recharged groundwater during groundwater flow this co2 with high δ13c could have been supplied from decomposed om in the shallow argillaceous sediments recovered from 2 m depth at the three core sites next we evaluated the processes as described above for groups a and b by using model calculations with carbon isotopic signatures related to pco2 5 3 model calculations with carbon stable isotopes to evaluate river water penetration into an aquifer we undertook model calculations to investigate the possibility that the chemistry of group a groundwater samples was influenced by direct recharge of river water because the log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 values of the river water samples are distinctive we used carbon stable isotopes as an indicator in the mixing model calculations of river water and initial recharged groundwater components we calculated the partial pressure of co2 in theoretical mixed water pco2 mix for a range of river water fractions 0 f riv 1 as follows 21 pco2 mix pco2 riv f riv pco2 gw 1 f riv where the subscripts riv and gw indicate river water and groundwater components respectively we obtained the carbon isotopic compositions of co2 in equilibrium with the theoretical mixed water δ13c equil co2 mix by the following equation 22 δ13c equil co2 mix δ13c equil co 2 riv pco2 riv pco2 mix f riv δ13c equil co2 gw pco2 riv pco2 mix 1 f riv because of the low variability of log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 of the river water samples apart from sample rk which we excluded we used mean values pco2 riv 10 3 1 bar and δ13c equil co2 riv 18 6 and because the lowest value of δ13c equil co2 28 6 was obtained from sample uw27 near the southern recharge area we assumed the initial recharged groundwater initial groundwater hereafter flowing from the mountains into the lfob to have similar log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 values to those of sample uw27 hence we used those values pco2 gw 10 2 7 bar and δ13c equil co2 gw 28 6 for the groundwater component the relationships between log pco2 mix and δ13c equil co2 mix in the mixed water model calculations fig 8 show that most of the group a groundwater samples lie close to the groundwater river water mixing line and are thus well explained by this mixing the mixing model calculations also show that a groundwater sample from the lower area sample le17 includes up to 80 river water whereas those from the upper area samples ue11 ue14 and uw21 contain approximately 30 70 river water ohno city 2013 reported water loss at 0 332 m3 s from the mana river near the le17 sampling site which supports the extensive penetration of river water into the g1 aquifer there as implied by the mixing calculations the upper area of the lfob is on a gently sloping alluvial fan figs 1 and 2 composed mainly of surface clastic sediments which also suggests that river water would easily penetrate into the aquifer in this area as demonstrated in the calculations thus based on our analysis of carbon stable isotopic tracers we presume that river water penetrates into the aquifer mainly in the upper area of the lfob although the resultant penetration cannot be confirmed on the basis of chemical composition alone because the river water and groundwater have similar ca hco3 type chemistries fig 3 we gained a better understanding of this penetration by consideration of the differences in δ13c values in river water and groundwater which is discussed in section 5 6 5 4 model calculations with carbon stable isotopes to evaluate the influence of om decomposition on groundwater as discussed in section 5 2 it is likely that group b groundwater samples with relatively high log pco2 and δ13c equil co2 values have been affected by om decomposition in sediments we performed model calculations which simulate the gradual dissolution of co2 derived from om into the initial groundwater based on four assumptions a groundwater sample uw27 from near the recharge area represents the initial groundwater again b co2 gas equilibrated with the initial groundwater has a log pco2 mod value of 2 7 the lowest pco2 value we obtained from group b groundwater sample uw27 near the southern recharge area c additional co2 is supplied by decomposition of a mixture of om from c3 plants c3 om and lacustrine organic matter l om derived from shallow 2 m depth argillaceous sediments in the lfob the fraction of l om included in decomposed om f l om varies in the range 0 f l om 1 we used δ13c equil co2 values of 28 6 sample uw27 for c3 om and 19 9 the mean δ13c value of om in the lfob argillaceous sediments for l om d under co2 equilibrium conditions and constant f l om log pco2 in this model calculations increases up to 1 5 which is about the maximum value observed in the lfob groundwater i e 2 7 log pco2 mod 1 5 as given log pco2 mod and f l om carbon isotopic compositions of co2 in equilibrium with the model groundwater δ13c equil co2 mod are obtained from the following equation 23 δ13c equil co2 mod 28 6 10 2 7 28 6 1 f l om 19 9 f l om 2pco2 mod 10 2 7 2pco2 mod the relationships between δ13c equil co2 mod and log pco2 mod in the model groundwater influenced by co2 dissolution through om decomposition fig 8 show that most of the group b groundwater samples lie in the region 0 3 f l om 0 7 this outcome indicates that most of the group b groundwater samples are well explained by the model calculations simulating the co2 dissolution process into the initial groundwater and the essential condition is up to 1 5 of log pco2 derived from the decomposition of om containing 30 70 l om it is noteworthy that the spatial distribution of most of the groundwater samples with high pco2 log pco2 2 0 corresponds with that of lacustrine deposits at the surface fig 1 hence the decomposition of the greater amounts of om in the lacustrine sediments would result in the accumulation of greater amounts of co2 in the groundwater of the underlying aquifers in contrast samples ue22 and uw23 from near the southern mountains have lower values of f lom 0 3 and log pco2 2 3 which we attribute to less influence of om decomposition associated with the lower l om fraction there this interpretation is consistent with the location of samples ue22 and uw23 in an area of gently sloping clastic deposits where om rich lacustrine or argillaceous deposits are unlikely to be present the low ca2 and hco3 concentrations of these two samples fig 4 might also be ascribed to such an om distribution less om in overlying sediments would lead to less decomposition of om and less co2 dissolution in groundwater eventually leading to lower ca2 and hco3 concentrations in the groundwater owing to less occurrence of eq 18 many previous hydrological studies involving carbon stable isotopes have reported that isotopic enrichment due to molecular diffusion of co2 gas through soil pores is generally in the range of 1 to 4 maximum reported 4 4 e g craig 1954 dörr and münnich 1980 cerling 1984 hendry et al 1993 nevertheless it appears that there was little fractionation in our study because the δ13c equil co2 value of the initial groundwater sample uw27 was almost identical to the δ13c value of c3 om 28 6 which may reflect the hydrogeological setting of the lfob for instance argillaceous sediments lie closely above groundwater table although co2 diffusion is commonly enhanced in porous sandy sediments as discussed above the model calculations in which the initial recharged groundwater sample uw27 was employed as a groundwater component explained well the relationships between δ13c equil co2 and pco2 in group a groundwater indicating that the influence of om decomposition in the lfob underground is almost negligible for group a except for the sample le17 this indication is consistent in terms of the distributions since the samples are in an area of gently sloping clastic deposits where om rich deposits are unlikely to be present for the remaining sample le17 the high ratio about 80 of river water penetration might hide the om decomposition influence in fig 8 although the sample is from the lowland area likely with om rich deposits 5 5 groundwater recharge flow systems deduced from the model calculation results the model calculations simulating co2 dissolution into the initial groundwater demonstrated that dic in the lfob groundwater is controlled mainly by the dissolution of co2 originated from om of which l om lies in the interval 30 70 thus consideration of the om distributions and groundwater levels in the lfob underground might provide constraints on groundwater movements in the basin l om with higher δ13c in the lfob is dominantly at or near the surface it is present in surface exposures of lacustrine deposits in the western area along the akane river and at sampling sites bw4 to 5 and bc6 to 10 and at 0 5 2 0 m depth at sampling sites bu1 to 3 fig 1 the depth of groundwater in the lfob varies from a few meters to more than 20 m below the surface albeit with seasonal fluctuations thus the lacustrine deposits are mostly shallower than the groundwater and therefore not in direct contact with it over most of the lfob fig 2 according to the model results fig 8 co2 with around 28 6 of δ13c value typical value of c3 om is required to be added to the groundwater along with the flow as a source of such co2 the om in the clayey sediments acting as aquiclude such as the unit g2u is the most likely candidate because there is no other source than it considering such om distributions in the lfob underground the model results might be converted to an interpretation for groundwater recharge flow systems as follows the groundwater influenced by l om is supplied by downward percolation of precipitation from the surface through a discontinuous part of lacustrine deposits in contrast the groundwater influenced by c3 om would be horizontal advected groundwater derived from the mountains that surround the lfob and would be about 30 70 of lfob groundwater these aspects of the results of our model calculations are summarized in fig 9 in which it is shown that the weathering of anorthite with pyroxene or hornblende influences the chemistry of the ca hco3 type lfob groundwater which is associated with decomposition of similar proportions 30 70 of l om and c3 om the proportions of l om and c3 om may reflect the proportions of the downward and horizontal components respectively in the recharge flow system of the lfob groundwater although both may be locally affected by direct penetration of river water it is important to note that our interpretation by using the model calculations is essentially based on the fact that the δ13c values of l om are considerably higher than those of c3 om which is discussed further in the next section 5 6 factors controlling carbon isotopic compositions of river water and lacustrine organic matter model calculations according to eqs 21 to 23 allowed us to discriminate the carbon of c3 om from the carbon of river water and lacustrine deposits based on the higher isotopic compositions of the latter we now discuss the factors that control the higher isotopic compositions of the carbon derived from river water and lacustrine deposits the river water samples have high δ13c equil co2 values around 19 apart from sample rk fig 8 which are higher than those of the groundwater and demonstrate that they are not supplied simply by decomposition of c3 om this interpretation is consistent with the log pco2 values of most of the river water samples 3 0 being lower than that of typical soil co2 these characteristics of the δ13c and pco2 of river water have been reported in numerous studies that have concluded that the global average content of carbon in river water derived from soil om is 67 and the remaining 33 is from atmospheric co2 berner et al 1983 meybeck 1987 amiotte suchet and probst 1995 ludwig et al 1997 amiotte suchet et al 1999 the relationship of δ13c equil co2 to log pco2 fig 8 shows that most of the river water samples of our study lie midway between the compositions of atmospheric co2 and groundwater sample uw27 which was influenced by c3 om our results are therefore consistent with the above referenced studies which showed that dic in river water contains both atmospheric co2 and carbon derived from om on the other hand a lot of previous studies have used carbon isotopic compositions of om in sedimentary archives as indicators in evaluations of both modern and paleo environments castañeda and schouten 2011 leng and henderson 2013 diefendorf and freimuth 2017 andrae et al 2020 according to these works the om in terrestrial sediments such as in lacustrine deposits is generally enriched in 13c likely because most aquatic macrophytes have higher δ13c values 30 to 12 than c3 plants the reasons of the higher δ13c values are not well understood but it has been suggested that there may be several controlling factors e g boutton 1991 tolbot and johannessen 1992 one such factor is the ability of aquatic macrophytes to assimilate carbon from dissolved hco3 during photosynthesis with the source hco3 being more 13c enriched than co2 by 7 11 smith and walker 1980 lazerte and szalados 1982 schidlowski et al 1984 keeley 1990 another possible factor revealed by recent studies is the 13c isotopic enrichment of both dic and om by photosynthesis in a semi closed lake that is similar to the rayleigh distillation process e g faure and mensing 2005 for instance maybo and shapley 2006 reported that epilimnetic δ13c values higher than the corresponding hypolimnetic values in a lake can be attributed to photosynthesis and decomposition by preferential uptake of 12c from the epilimnion and its release into the hypolimnion yamanaka 2017 applied a rayleigh model to similar observations during a period of summer lake stagnancy and concluded that up to 30 of dic was consumed by photosynthesis with an isotopic enrichment factor ε of 16 6 such isotopic enrichment agrees well with the work of hollander and mckenzie 1991 who calculated the δ13c difference between dic and particulate organic matter in a lake in summer which is generally analog to the value of ε indeed by using δ13c dic of 6 in the hypolimnion and ε 16 6 which were reported by yamanaka 2017 the particulate organic matter in the lake is expected to have a δ13c value of 23 6 16 6 which is considerably higher than that of typical c3 om 27 deines 1980 vogel et al 1993 thus the high δ13c values of l om in samples from the lfob could be a result of one or more of the controlling factors described above 6 conclusions in this study we explored the hydrogeochemical controls and recharge flow system of groundwater in the lowland of the fukui ohno basin central japan by using measured carbon isotopic and chemical compositions as hydrogeochemical tracers ca hco3 type groundwater is dominant in the basin lowland the groundwater has high concentrations of ca2 and hco3 and some mg2 we attributed the high ca2 and hco3 concentrations to weathering of anorthite in the aquifer and the mg2 concentrations to weathering of pyroxene or hornblende both at partial co2 pressures that are typically observed in soils we found little or no evidence that the groundwater was affected by the dissolution of calcite on the basis of the partial pressure of co2 log pco2 and carbon isotopic compositions of co2 equilibrated with water we recognized two groups of groundwater samples the first with lower log pco2 and the second with higher log pco2 values than those of the initial recharged groundwater for both groups the isotopic composition of co2 equilibrated with water was higher than that of the initial groundwater model calculations revealed the following controls on the chemistry of the two groups for the first group groundwater in the southern part of the basin included 30 to 70 river water the higher log pco2 values of the second group are likely a result of the addition of co2 with high δ13c to the groundwater during basinward flow from the surrounding mountainous area our model calculations showed that the groundwater contains roughly equal proportions 30 70 of dic sourced from lacustrine sediments and c3 organic matter the spatial distribution of these two types of organic matter in and around the basin suggests that there are two components of groundwater recharge downward percolation of precipitation into the aquifer within the lowland basin and mainly horizontal migration of groundwater originating in the mountains and flowing through aquifers into the lowland basin

2929,the verlorenvlei catchment on the west coast of south africa is a semi arid region that is growing progressively more reliant on groundwater due to increased variability in precipitation and increasing agricultural productivity the groundwater systems have been put under additional stress given the recent 2015 2017 el ninõ system that led to drought conditions along the west coast of south africa this increased reliance puts the natural environment and human dependence on groundwater into direct conflict groundwater was sampled for δ18o δ 2h δ 13c 14c 3h and 3h 3he ratios in addition to cation and anion concentrations from seventeen production boreholes and two springs in the catchment residence times were estimated using tritium and radiocarbon and in the case of the latter the pearson model has been used to correct for possible carbonate dissolution hydrochemistry and residence times of groundwater in the verlorenvlei catchment have successfully been used to distinguish between the primary porosity alluvial aquifer the secondary porosity malmesbury shale aquifer mg and the fractured rock aquifers associated with the table mountain group tmg groundwater mixing has been identified within the catchment and this plays an important role in the variation in groundwater chemistry and residence time between the aquifer systems the discrepancy between the calculated radiocarbon and 3h 3he ages in the tmg and alluvial aquifers has been evaluated using a lumped parameter model that confirms that the tmg is strongly dominated by young groundwaters young 3h 3he residence times calculated for groundwater in the tmg 34 57 years and alluvial aquifers 34 47 years implies that these systems are most susceptible to reduced groundwater recharge given the interconnected nature of the aquifer systems reduced recharge rates into the tmg aquifer will decrease groundwater flow to both the alluvial and mg aquifer and this will impact the long term sustainability of the ramsar listed verlorenvlei estuarine lake and wetlands at the catchment outlet future residence time studies should consider using a lumped parameter model lpm to calculate the age distribution of groundwater in these aquifers as this would provide additional insight into the sustainability of the groundwater systems keywords groundwater residence times verlorenvlei table mountain group aquifer groundwater mixing tritogenic helium radiocarbon dating 1 introduction the world s climate is in a state of global change as natural and anthropogenic factors drive fluctuations in extreme heat and cold agliardi et al 2019 and consequently significant variation in global precipitation patterns hao et al 2019 nair 2016 these variations affect both the amount of precipitation the type of precipitation short intense precipitation events compared to long light precipitation events as well as the distribution of precipitation eekhout et al 2018 pfahl et al 2017 understanding these changes in precipitation patterns is critical to managing both surface water and groundwater systems since these two systems are invariably interconnected hu et al 2019 meixner et al 2016 however whilst surface water systems visually record the effects of changing precipitation patterns groundwater systems are more opaque in how they respond to changes in precipitation green et al 2011 depending on the type of aquifer system and the distance between the recharge and discharge sites the groundwater system might be resilient to short term changes in precipitation i e drought with longer term impacts i e climate change only manifesting in decades to centuries or longer after these precipitation changes have become normalized doll 2009 tallaksen et al 2009 this scenario is currently playing out in the continental intercalaire aquifer in north africa where dramatic reductions in precipitation that occurred at the end of the pleistocene are still passing through the aquifer system hamed et al 2014 in contrast the fractured rock aquifer around the city of cape town on the south west coast of africa in places has very short groundwater flow paths and residence times and therefore reacts rapidly and dynamically to changes in precipitation patterns as the recent 2015 2017 cape town drought crisis demonstrated miller et al 2017 sousa et al 2018 understanding the groundwater response time to changes in recharge patterns is central to understanding groundwater resilience in the face of climate change gleeson et al 2012 this requires addressing questions regarding the renewability replenishment safe yield and sustainability of groundwater resources safe yield first defined by lee 1914 refers to the limit of the quantity of water that can be withdrawn regularly without dangerous depletion of the storage reserve in contrast sustainable yield reserves a fraction of the safe yield for the benefit of surface waters meaning that safe yield values take into account the ecological reserve the volume and quality required to sustain a surface water ecosystem alley and leake 2004 wyk and sherwill 2006 this may also accommodate replenishment where drought has led to substantial reductions in both surface and sub surface water levels in order to determine safe aquifer yields assess groundwater sustainability and ensure the proper management of groundwater resources a comprehensive understanding of groundwater residence time and how this intersects with groundwater recharge rates is required jyrkama and sykes 2007 most importantly it requires an understanding of the interaction between the surface water and groundwater systems the west coast of south africa is a semi arid region where the mean annual precipitation is typically 400 mm yr fig 1 resulting in a heavy dependence on groundwater resources with large scale abstraction required to support growing agricultural needs műnch et al 2013 this abstraction can come at the expense of the natural environment that exists in a fragile equilibrium with the low rainfall rates much of the coastal vegetation is thought to have adapted to utilize coastal fog and mist to support itself rather than relying solely on rainfall csir 2009a in the future climate change will reduce precipitation rates as well as coastal fog and mist klemm and lin 2016 with the potential to drive ecological adaptations by coastal vegetation to an increasing dependence on groundwater this increased dependence puts the natural environment and human dependence on groundwater in direct conflict nowhere in south africa is this more apparent than in the verlorenvlei ramsar listed estuarine lake and associated wetlands wetlands situated in semi arid settings such as the verlorenvlei are representative of areas strongly affected by decreased water levels due to climate change and agricultural development harvey et al 2006 as a result long term it is thought that permanent wetlands will become highly seasonal and seasonal wetlands may altogether disappear junk et al 2013 sustainable water management is therefore vital for maintaining the ecological system of wetlands in semi arid regions despite the increasing demands on water supply the verlorenvlei catchment contains three main aquifer systems two fractured rock aquifers and one primary porosity alluvial aquifer the quality and quantity of groundwater from each of the aquifers is reasonably distinct implying that it may be possible to track the relative contributions of each watson et al 2019 although previous hydrogeological studies have examined the flow system and recharge mechanisms conrad et al 2004 watson et al 2018 groundwater residence times and the variation in recharge rates between these aquifer bodies have not been determined moreover the three aquifers are thought to be at least partially interconnected watson et al 2018 and groundwater mixing may play an important role in the catchment groundwater evolution the interplay between these aquifers is still poorly constrained though and a more detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between the different groundwater systems is required in order to understand these mixing relationships and the impact they will have on the determination of groundwater residence time this study evaluates the residence time of groundwater in each of the main aquifers in the verlorenvlei catchment using radiocarbon and 3h 3he dating the interpretation of these ages is used to understand the hydrochemical evolution of the groundwater along the catchment extent and to consider the aquifer safe yield in this region the verlorenvlei wetlands continue to be affected by water resource pressure and again dried out over the summer of 2021 through a combination of groundwater abstraction surface water diversion and changing precipitation patterns similar pressures on wetlands are occurring the world over and have been highlighted in the recent update report on sdg6 un water 2021 the results of this study will hopefully shed light on the groundwater resource base available for agricultural use and the future implications for groundwater sustainability in this and other similar agricultural regions world wide 2 study site the verlorenvlei catchment is located along the west coast of south africa in a region known as the sandveld approximately 200 km north of cape town fig 1 the catchment is bounded by the piketberg mountains in the south west and the swartberg and olifantsriver mountains in the east and north east forming the southern portion of the olifants doorn water management area the piketberg mountains have the highest topographic elevation in the area at approximately 1446 m within the catchment the hol krom antonies kruismans and bervallei are the main tributaries of the verloren river which is itself the main contributor of freshwater to the ramsar listed verlorenvlei wetlands fig 1c sinclair et al 1984 the kruismans drains the eendukuil or kruismans basin the low lying area between the olifantsrivier mountains and the piketberg mountains the bergvallei drains south into the kruismans from the swartberge mountains the hol and krom antonies drain from the north side of the piketberg mountains into the kruismans the point after which the hol the furthest downstream of the tributaries joins the kruismans is termed the confluence after which the river is called the verloren river fig 2 the vlei afrikaans for wetlands or marsh which covers approximately 190 km2 and known for its high biodiversity profile is only intermittently open to the ocean as a sandbar blocks the outflow except during times of flooding the majority of the verlorenvlei catchment consists of farmland and as a result agriculture is the predominant water user in the region archer et al 2009 potatoes have been the primary crop grown but recent years have seen an increase in citrus and viticulture rooibos tea is also produced in the region although this arid crop relies on rainfall and therefore does not contribute to groundwater abstraction in the catchment the indigenous vegetation that remains is restricted to the mountainsides where land is difficult to cultivate for agricultural use 2 1 climate the sandveld has a mediterranean climate where the majority of rainfall is received in the winter months between may and august martens et al 1996 the highest rainfall in the area is received in the piketberg mountains where mean annual precipitation map reaches 800 mm year fig 1 mist is also considered to be a significant contributor to the piketberg mountains but is currently unconstrained csir 2009a rainfall declines west of the piketberg mountains reaching a low of 210 mm year at the mouth of the verlorenvlei watson et al 2018 daily temperatures in the area are generally between 8 and 13 c in winter and 17 to 23 c in summer schulze et al 2008 mean reference evaporation in the catchment ranges between 1 5 and 2 3 mm day in winter and 5 5 and 7 4 mm day in summer with an annual average of 4 5 mm day schulze et al 2008 2 2 geology the catchment geology is made up of four lithological packages fig 2 the oldest rocks in the catchment are the late neoproterozoic to cambrian malmesbury group rozendaal and gresse 1994 kisters et al 2015 although the position and significance of the malmesbury group is interpreted differently by different researchers e g frimmel et al 2013 gresse et al 2006 kisters and belcher 2018 there is general consensus that the catchment area is dominated by the piketberg formation consisting of greywacke sericitic schist quartzite conglomerate and limestone rozendaal and gresse 1994 the malmesbury group typically crops out at low elevation in the valley floors but outcrops are sparse and discontinuous this is particularly so towards the vlei itself although in the west around eendekuil outcrops of malmesbury group rocks are more common to the south of the catchment the piketberg formation is separated from other units of the malmesbury group by the piketberg wellington fault frimmel et al 2013 this is a large fault system that has been suggested to be linked to the smaller krom antonies lineament as well as the redelinghuys fault that runs through the ne and central parts of the study area fig 2 rozendaal and gresse 1994 the malmesbury group rocks have been intruded by the cambrian cape granite suite although drilling has indicated their presence at depth outcrops within the catchment are very poor to non existent however strongly weathered and bleached micaceous units in eroded gullies may represent original cape granite outcrops the malmesbury group is uncomformably overlain by the late cambrian klipheuwel group an alluvial deposit that formed during the early stages of rifting that immediately preceded deposition of the cape supergroup belcher and kisters 2003 the klipheuwel is very discontinuous in the study area and is not considered to be an important unit for this study the majority of the cape supergroup 480 550 ma tankard et al 2009 consists of thickly bedded sandstones and quartzites although conglomerates and shales are also present de beer 2003 within the verlorenvlei catchment the dominant formations are from the late cambrian to silurian table mountain group consisting of the piekenierskloof graafwater peninsula cederberg and nardouw formations fig 3 conrad et al 2004 the piekenierskloof formation which consists of sandstone and conglomerate forms the base of the tmg sequence in the catchment and is overlain by the volumetrically small graafwater formation that consists mostly of siltstones and shales the graafwater formation is overlain by the peninsula formation which is the dominant formation that crops out in the catchment consisting of thickly bedded mature sandstones to quartzitic units these rocks form the topographic highs of the piketberg mountains on the south side of the catchment and the swartberge mountains on the north side of the catchment tmg outcrops also occur in the lower parts of the catchment near the coast albeit at lower elevations fig 2 the youngest unit within the catchment is the dominantly cenozoic sandveld deposit a thin bed of shallow marine to terrigenous sediments that covers the coast from false bay to elands bay roberts et al 2006 more recent sedimentary deposits in the catchment consist of aeolian sands that contain little clay and silt the alluvial soils range between 3 and 12 m thick and an underlying clay layer which forms an aquitard ranges from 3 to 25 m thick conrad et al 2004 2 3 hydrogeology of the three aquifer systems present in the verlorenvlei catchment the most significant in terms of water quantity and quality is the tmg aquifer system that extends over much of the western cape province fig 3 and represents one of the largest and most important aquifers in south africa pietersen and parsons 2007 and references therein this is a fractured rock aquifer that exhibits low primary porosity in part because the tmg sandstones are quartzitic in places the fracture network is very heterogeneous and thought to be more interconnected at shallower depths implying restrictions to groundwater flow at deeper levels lin et al 2014 groundwater hosted in these rocks is characterized by very low ec typically 100 μs cm 1 but often 50 μs cm 1 and slightly acidic ph values 4 5 5 5 miller et al 2017 smart and tredoux 2002 rates of recharge vary but existing estimates of the groundwater residence time indicate that precipitation is moved through the system on a 20 50 year timescale at least where groundwater emanates as cold springs on tmg dominated mountains miller et al 2017 groundwater δ18o and δ2h values tend to be characteristic of precipitation at higher elevations implying that the high mountains are the dominant recharge areas diamond and harris 2019 this is consistent with modelling of potential recharge in the verlorenvlei catchment by watson et al 2018 tmg rocks occur at high elevations on both the southern and northern sides of the catchment and it is not clear whether the outcrops on either side of the catchment are hydraulically connected although the hydrochemistry of groundwater is much the same eilers 2018 the tmg aquifer overlies malmesbury group mg shales that form a different aquifer system table 1 with variable but generally poorer water quality than the tmg aquifer groundwater in this aquifer is hosted in secondary porosity structures principally the foliation planes of the shale and through going fault structures and this strongly dictates the direction in which groundwater moves the aquifer is also semi confined to confined due to the presence of the overlying clay layer that acts as an aquitard this aquifer system will be referred to as the mg aquifer and is equivalent to the secondary aquifer referred to by watson et al 2018 the clay layer does not occur at surface but is commonly intersected in augered piezometers where it forms the boundary between the alluvial aquifer and the mg aquifer below boreholes into the mg aquifer are generally high yielding attributed to the presence of this confining clay layer conrad et al 2004 overlying the tmg aquifer and the mg aquifer is the alluvial aquifer system hosted by unconsolidated quaternary sandy sediments of the sandveld formation fig 3 these units typically occur in the channels of the river valleys and along the flanks of the mountain slopes the thickness of the alluvial aquifer and therefore the depth of the confining clay aquitard is thus variable throughout the catchment the alluvial aquifer has primary porosity in this region and is equivalent to the primary aquifer of watson et al 2018 in this aquifer system the water quality is heterogeneous and prone to degradation with the shallow groundwater being very saline in places often 5000 ms cm 1 or more particularly closer to the coast conrad et al 2004 sigidi 2018 2 4 recharge characterisation groundwater recharge in the verlorenvlei catchment has been determined using rainfall runoff modelling watson et al 2018 a natural tracer technique using chloride mass balance cmb watson et al 2020 and a gis based modelling approach conrad et al 2004 recharge dominantly occurs in areas of high elevation such as the piketberg mountains and therefore into the tmg aquifer high potential evaporation in the valleys along with the confining clay layer limits vertical recharge into the alluvial aquifer watson et al 2017 however the three aquifer systems are thought to be connected and groundwater modelling along with hydraulic head gradients support discharge from the tmg aquifer into the alluvial aquifer watson et al 2018 this is also supported by the sustained presence of surface water in the krom antonies tributary past the end of the wet season watson et al 2018 2019 estimates for the rainfall runoff modelling indicate that percolation inputs to the groundwater system are up to 29 of map in the high elevation regions tmg aquifer and around 3 4 of map in the low lying areas alluvial aquifer groundwater modelling suggests that recharge to the mg aquifer is dominantly derived from the tmg aquifer itself rather than direct rainwater watson et al 2019 with the deterioration in groundwater quality the result of residence time and accumulation of ions along flow paths although addition of ions along the flow path and particularly chloride is not consistent with the assumptions of the cmb method watson et al 2020 mapped out where chloride was added to the system and thereafter where the cmb method was valid and where it was not in the catchment on this basis recharge estimates into the tmg and mg aquifers using cmb in the mid to upper elevations of the catchment were determined to be between 20 and 50 mm year and 2 and 8 mm year respectively values that overlap with the rainfall runoff modelling watson et al 2020 in comparison the gis modeling approach determined recharge in the tmg and mg aquifer to be 80 1 mm year and 1 4 mm year respectively conrad et al 2004 stable isotope data suggests that groundwater from both the tmg and mg aquifers contributes to the alluvial aquifer although the connection is spatially variable and likely a function of the continuity and thickness of the clay aquitard eilers 2018 watson et al 2020 3 field work and analytical methods 3 1 sampling nineteen samples including seventeen borehole samples and two spring water samples were taken in the verlorenvlei catchment from the near the top of the piketberg mountains along the catchment and down to the coast fig 1c samples were collected between march and may representing the transition from autumn to winter in south africa selection of groundwater sampling locations was based on 1 accessibility many boreholes have no take off point at the borehole and could only be sampled after a long run of agricultural pipe 2 boreholes with submersible pumps installed as permanent farm infrastructure 3 known geology of the borehole location and 4 distribution of samples within the catchment based on this approach six samples of the tmg groundwater were taken on the southern side of the upper part of the catchment and seven samples of the mg aquifer were taken in the middle part of the catchment an additional six samples were taken in the lower parts of the catchment and were thought to be a mix of groundwater from the tmg and alluvial aquifers however analysis of hydrochemistry using stiff diagrams suggests that all six samples are derived from the alluvial aquifer the tmg aquifer generally does not crop out in the lower parts of the catchment and boreholes in the middle parts of the catchment tend to be deeper and intersect the malmesbury group whilst those near the coast tend to be shallower and sit within the alluvial aquifer of the springs sampled one is interpreted based on hydrochemistry to be sourced from the tmg aquifer and one from the mg aquifer temperature ph and ec were measured in the field using a portable extech ec500 ph conductivity probe calibrated daily ph and ec were also determined in the laboratory immediately after returning from the field along with alkalinity using a 702 sm titrino autotitrator and a jenway 4510 conductivity probe located in the department of soil science at stellenbosch university the error between laboratory and field ph and ec was 4 6 and 13 3 respectively the laboratory values were used in this study at each location samples were taken for major cations and anions trace elements stable isotopes radiocarbon tritium and where possible noble gases for determination of 3h 3he apparent ages all boreholes were purged until the groundwater ec had stabilized prior to sampling screen depths were not known and it is assumed in this study that the groundwater compositions are representative of a single aquifer being intersected and sampled samples for major cations and anions trace elements and stable isotopes were filtered in the field using 0 45 mm cellulose acetate filters all collection bottles were rinsed twice with the sample water prior to filling and filled with no headspace major cation and trace element samples were collected in 15 ml polypropylene pp tubes and acidified to ph 2 prior to analysis anion samples were collected in 50 ml pp tubes and kept refrigerated at 4 c until analysis stable isotopes of o and h were collected in 15 ml pp tubes radiocarbon and tritium samples were collected in 1 l amber pp bottles and filtered at the isotope climatology and enviornmental research centre icer institute for nuclear research debrecen hungary all samples collected in bottles were kept in the dark until analysis noble gas samples were collected in copper tubes connected to boreholes via the existing borehole pipe system and the connections tightened with clamps to seal out atmosphere only boreholes where the copper tube could be connected at the borehole site itself were sampled groundwater was allowed to run through the copper tubes and the tubes were tapped to remove dislodge any air bubbles before sealing of the copper tubes with pinch off clamps 3 2 analytical techniques cation and trace element analyses were performed using an agilent 7700 icp ms and thermo icap 6200 icp oes respectively at the central analytical facility stellenbosch university the relative standard deviation on analyses was between 2 and 5 anion analysis was performed by bemlabs somerset west sulphate analyses were performed by means of icp oes chloride analysis was done using silver nitrate titration with chromate indicator method at the icer all samples except bt18vl10 14 and 16 had charge balances of 10 stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were determined using a los gatos lwia at icer hungary data are reported as δ18o and δ2h in standard per mill notation internal institute water standards were calibrated to the v smow slap and gisp standards and reported relative to v smow analytical uncertainties of the measurements are 0 1 and 1 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively δ13c values were determined using a deltaplus xp stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer the dissolved inorganic carbon was precipitated in baco3 form and the co2 released after adding phosphoric acid to the baco3 using a gasbench ii δ13c values are reported relative to the v pbd vienna pee dee belemnite standard and have an analytical uncertainty of 0 1 further details of the analytical methods for δ13c are available in varsányi et al 2011 tritium was analyzed at the icer debrecen hungary via the 3he ingrowth method with 4he isotope dilution palcsu et al 2010 papp et al 2012 the process can be simplified to four steps 1 the water sample is distilled 2 dissolved gasses are removed from the water through vacuum pumping 3 the sample is stored for some months to allow for the production of 3he atoms through tritium decay and 4 the helium fraction that is created is admitted to the noble gas mass spectrometer to allow for the measurement of 3he the tritium concentration is measured using the abundance of helium isotopes radiocarbon analysis of groundwater samples took place in three major steps 1 extraction of co2 from water dic in a vacuum cell 2 the graphitization and 3 the accelerator mass spectrometric ams analysis of the graphite groundwater samples are treated with phosphoric acid while in a vacuum in order to release dissolved carbon as carbon dioxide water was injected by a sterile plastic syringe into the prevacuumed digestion reactor vessel through a septum sealed cap a 0 45 um pore size membrane filter was attached to each plastic syringe to filter out the particles from water samples during injection the samples are then heated for one hour at 80 c to allow for the release of the majority of the carbon dioxide the released co2 gas is then transferred into a cleaning vacuum line where all other gases are removed molnár et al 2013 in the vacuum line the water is trapped in a dry ice trap the co2 is trapped in a liquid nitrogen trap and all other gases are pumped away the applied technique allows 14c activity analyses of water samples with dic content down to 5 mg l 1 which is relevant to the tmg groundwaters fossil marble as blank standard material iaea c1 0 0 pmc and known age travertine reference material iaea c2 41 14 pmc were also treated as control samples for the co2 extraction step to determine if any modern fossil carbon contamination is introduced during the extraction or graphitisation procedures for 14c 12c ratio analysis by the micadas type ams at the debrecen ams facility icer the graphite from the water dic samples was prepared by a customised sealed tube graphitization method rinyu et al 2013 the overall measurement uncertainty for modern samples is 3 0 including normalization background subtraction and counting statistics the conventional radiocarbon ages were evaluated by the bats software on the enviromicadas ams instrument version 3 66 wacker et al 2010 helium concentrations and other noble gases were analyzed according to papp et al 2012 four components make up the dissolved gases in groundwater 1 dissolved air at solubility equilibrium 2 radioactive decay of 3h 3 excess air and 4 a terrigenic component aeschbach hertig et al 2000 the dissolved gases were extracted from the copper tube on a preparation vacuum line and the gasses with the exception of helium and neon were trapped in a cryogenic trap papp et al 2012 helium and neon were then absorbed onto a charcoal trap where temperature control allowed for the helium and neon to be admitted to the helix sft and vg5400 mass spectrometers separately the heavier noble gasses were then released from the cryogenic trap purified by getters and measured simultaneously in the vg5400 noble gas mass spectrometer papp et al 2012 fast calibrations were performed by both noble gas mass spectrometers between analysis the measurement was calibrated with known air aliquots of 0 12 to 0 25 ccstp for he and ne and 0 4 to 3 3 ccstp of air for the heavier fraction papp et al 2012 the analytical uncertainties are 1 for he and ar concentrations 2 for ne kr and xe and 1 5 for 3he 4he ratios the concentration of helium in groundwater is used to calculate 3h 3he apparent ages to do this the tritiogenic 3h component of the noble gas concentration must be resolved and the total helium must be separated into its different source components based on the other noble gas concentrations e g miller et al 2017 the recharge temperature of the groundwater can also be estimated from concentrations of the noble gases dissolved in the groundwater at equilibrium using the temperature gas relationship of henry s law novotny sanford 2004 for most recharge areas the groundwater temperature reflects the surface soil temperature however in cases where the groundwater infiltration rate is very high temperatures may not correspond urs beyerle 1999 aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 in the semi arid region of south africa we expect low recharge rates which might affect the 3h 3he age determination 4 results hydrochemical results for the groundwater samples collected are largely consistent with the original designation of aquifer host with two exceptions firstly groundwater samples taken in the lower part of the catchment have distinctly different stiff diagram shapes to the tmg groundwater in the upper catchment and hence have all been re classed as alluvial aquifer as previously indicated secondly three mg aquifer samples bt18vl06 08 have different stiff diagram shapes and 14c activities to the other four mg aquifer samples all the mg samples are shown in green with triangles vs circles and the one spring sample as a polygon around the circle differentiating these two different groups hydrochemical data including stable isotopes of o h and c as well as tritium and radiocarbon are reported in table 1 noble gas data is reported in table 2 4 1 major ion concentrations groundwater electrical conductivity ec values range between 60 and 2560 μs cm 1 and ph values vary from 4 4 to 7 2 table 1 fig 4 tmg groundwater from the piketberg mountains records the lowest ec values 60 250 μs cm 1 while the alluvial and mg groundwaters record the highest ec values 500 2560 μs cm 1 fig 3 the tmg groundwater samples have ph values 5 with one exception at 6 68 bt18vl10 this sample was collected downstream from a tmg spring at the base of the piketberg mountains the mg aquifer groundwater has two groups of ph values the first between 6 3 and 7 2 and the second between 5 6 and 6 0 the clear differences in the tmg and mg aquifer groundwaters are bridged by both the alluvial aquifer groundwater that has more variable ec and ph values and the lower ph mg groundwater fig 4 the alluvial aquifer groundwater appears to fall into two groups these are 1 groundwater with ec 500 μs cm 1 and ph 5 5 and 2 groundwater with ec 1000 μs cm 1 and ph 5 5 in spite of the different ec and ph ranges for the alluvial aquifer groundwater these samples plot as a relatively coherent compositional group on a piper diagram and tend towards a na cl composition fig 5 the tmg groundwater is also a chloride dominated groundwater although the cations are not strongly sodium dominated the outlier bt18vl10 indicated above is again distinct with a higher bicarbonate concentration in comparison to the other tmg groundwaters but this sample had a poor charge balance and the ion concentration may not be reflective of its real composition the two groupings of the mg aquifer groundwater show two compositional types that are largely a difference between a ca na cl type and a na cl type which can be clearly seen on stiff diagrams fig 6 where samples bt18vl09 11 13 have different shapes to those of samples bt18vl06 08 importantly these differences appear to manifest geographically with the na cl mg water type being located to the north west of the ca na cl mg water type two other alluvial aquifer samples bt18vl03 and 05 also display elevated cation concentrations that overlap with groundwater from the mg aquifer although with different ratios table 1 the groundwater chemical variation along the flow path in the verlorenvlei catchment can be assessed by plotting various parameters against the estimated distance of groundwater from the recharge source fig 7 ca2 alkalinity tds and sr values are low at the recharge source and highest in the mg aquifer groundwater the concentrations of these parameters furthest from the recharge source in the alluvial aquifer are more variable groundwater in the mg aquifer after the confluence samples bt18vl06 and 07 na cl type records ionic concentrations closer to those of the alluvial aquifer in the lower catchment than of the mg aquifer before the confluence ca na cl type fig 6 other ionic parameters do not show any noticeable trends along the catchment however groundwater samples in the high elevation recharge area have notably lower salinities 4 2 stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h ratios for the groundwater and spring samples table 1 have a fairly narrow range of values varying between 4 01 and 2 56 and between 17 2 and 9 80 respectively fig 8 with average δ18o and δ2h values of 3 32 and 14 1 respectively tmg groundwater has the most negative δ18o and δ2h values while groundwater from the mg aquifer and the alluvial aquifer have comparable but less negative values the alluvial aquifer groundwater has the least negative δ18o values and also lies closest to the global meteoric water line gmwl whilst the tmg groundwater and mg aquifer groundwater lie closer to the local meteoric water line lmwl defined as δ2h 6 2 δ18o 8 4 based on 49 precipitation samples from 2015 and 2016 watson et al 2020 both the tmg and the mg aquifer groundwater are significantly more negative than the weighted average of either the 2015 or the 2016 precipitation samples whilst the alluvial aquifer groundwater is closer to the weighted average deuterium excess defined here as d excess δ2h 8 δ18o ranges between 10 3 to 15 4 d excess values from the mg aquifer show the largest range d excess values closer to the coast from the alluvial aquifer are lower while groundwater closer to the recharge source in the tmg aquifer have higher d excess values despite groundwater from the mg aquifer appearing to have lower d excess values than the tmg aquifer groundwater there is no significant difference in the d excess of the two groups δ13c values were obtained for all groundwater samples in the catchment and range between 8 5 and 24 5 table 1 groundwater from the tmg aquifer have the most negative δ13c values generally less than 20 one value at 19 8 whilst both the mg aquifer and alluvial aquifer systems have variable δ13c values between 19 6 and 8 5 the two different compositional groups for the mg aquifer identified above have similar δ13c values although the na cl type tends towards more negative values examination of δ13c vs alkalinity indicates that groundwater with low alkalinity has more negative δ13c values whilst samples with higher alkalinity record less negative δ13c values fig 9 on this basis tmg groundwater has hco3 50 mg l 1 and δ13c 19 8 whilst the ca na cl mg aquifer groundwater type has hco3 300 mg l 1 and δ13c 13 0 the na cl mg aquifer groundwater type and the alluvial aquifer have similar hco3 and δ13c values that vary between these two end members 4 3 radioactive isotopes 4 3 1 radiocarbon the activity of 14c in groundwater in the verlorenvlei catchment ranges from 98 7 to 31 7 pmc table 1 the highest 14c activity was found in tmg groundwater 95 2 pmc and the lowest 14c activity was found in the ca na cl mg aquifer groundwater type 59 8 pmc the na cl mg aquifer groundwater type has intermediate 14c activities between 65 0 and 72 9 pmc the alluvial aquifer groundwater has relatively high 14c activities above 82 5 pmc similar to but not as high as the tmg groundwater for the ca na cl mg aquifer groundwater type 14c activity decreases from bt18vl11 59 8 pmc down the catchment over a distance of 13 km to bt18vl09 31 7 pmc 4 3 2 tritium tritium activities in groundwater in verlorenvlei vary from 0 05 to 0 623 tu table 2 high tritium activities 0 312 tu correspond to tmg groundwater while low tritium activities 0 05 0 090 tu correspond to the ca na cl mg aquifer groundwater type the alluvial aquifer groundwater and the na cl mg groundwater type have a range of tritium activities between 0 05 and 0 337 tu tritium values correlate with 14c activities such that high 14c activities have high tritium activities whilst low 14c activities have low tritium activities the relationship follows the approximate trend for differential rates of radioactive decay of the two isotopes fig 10 although tritium remains more elevated than it should be for lower 14c activities 4 3 3 noble gas data noble gas data was obtained for three tmg aquifer samples three alluvial aquifer samples and one ca na cl mg aquifer sample table 2 noble gas temperatures ngt were calculated using an elevation above sea level of 400 m for samples bt18vl04 and bt18vl14 both of which are inferred to receive recharge from lower down in the catchment and 1000 m for samples inferred to receive recharge from high elevations on piketberg mountain including bt18vl12 using these elevations noble gas recharge temperatures in the range of 16 1 to 21 1 c have been determined and are considered to be representative of average annual air temperature in the catchment given in csir 2009b noble gas temperature calculations have been tested using a chi square test and found to be significant at the level of p 0 1 helium isotopic data is normalized to the atmosphere and expressed as r ra values where r 3he 4he sample and ra 3he 4he atmosphere 1 382 10 6 sano et al 2013 r ra values are distinct between the different aquifers the tmg groundwater have r ra values 1 whilst the alluvial aquifer groundwater have r ra values of 0 46 0 49 and the r ra value for the single ca na cl mg groundwater sample is 0 062 this sample is highly enriched in he 1 683 10 6 ccstp g and suggests that the 4he is radiogenic in origin and the groundwater is thus older than the datable range of 3h 3he which is consistent with the low 14c activity of 35 1 pmc 5 discussion the above data suggests that the three aquifer systems in the verlorenvlei catchment the alluvial aquifer the mg aquifer and the tmg aquifer are hydrochemically and isotopically distinct suggesting that these three aquifer systems represent separate flow systems in the catchment however there is some overlap in the groundwater chemistry between the three suggesting that there may be interaction between the different systems leading to groundwater mixing taking place three factors are likely contributing to the hydrochemical distinction between the aquifers 1 the composition of the host rocks in the aquifer system 2 the interaction of the groundwater with the host rock dissolution and precipitation of carbonates and sulphides weathering of silicates to clays cation exchange with clay minerals and 3 the mixing between groundwater systems in order to better understand possible groundwater mixing in the catchment the aquifer systems were characterized and groundwater residence times were calculated for each aquifer 5 1 characterisation of groundwater types stiff diagrams plotted along the catchment highlight the variation in hydrochemistry that exists between the alluvial mg and tmg aquifer systems fig 6 low ionic concentrations are present at the recharge site in the tmg aquifer while the highest ionic concentrations are in the upper middle of the catchment from the mg aquifer with the exception of one alluvial aquifer sample bt18vl14 groundwater closest to the coast in the alluvial aquifer displayed more variability in ionic concentrations 5 1 1 tmg aquifer groundwater from the tmg aquifer is differentiated from the other groundwater types by 1 very low ec values 267 μs cm 1 2 weakly acidic character ph values 4 7 and 3 high 14c and 3h activities 95 pmc and 0 3 tu respectively reflecting short flow pathways and close proximity to the main recharge area stiff diagrams are distinctive with narrow na cl shapes fig 6 tmg groundwater also has the lowest δ δ 18o and δ 2h values in the verlorenvlei suggesting that only heavier precipitation events falling on the elevated parts of the piketberg mountains during winter are generating groundwater recharge this is consistent with potential recharge modelling by watson et al 2018 and previous stable isotope work by diamond and harris 2019 this is further supported by high deuterium excess values that likely reflect original precipitation characteristics δ 13c values are also distinctly lower than for the other groundwater types and characteristic of environments dominated by c3 plants consistent with the coastal renosterveld vegetation that is dominantly preserved at higher elevation since cultivated land is predominant at lower elevations 5 1 2 mg aquifer groundwater in the mg aquifer records 1 elevated ph and ec in comparison to the tmg groundwater ec values 478 μs cm 1 and ph values 5 6 2 lower 14c and 3h activities suggesting longer residence times and 3 extremely variable δ 13c values the variability in the δ 13c is to some extent mimicked by the other parameters and supports the division of groundwater from this aquifer system into two sub types before the confluence the 14c activity of the ca na cl mg groundwater ranges from 30 to 60 pmc fig 6 after the confluence the na cl mg groundwater has a higher 14c activity range from 65 to 73 pmc even though this location would theoretically be further along the flow path and thus should have lower 14c activities fig 6 thus the na cl mg groundwater after the confluence is inferred to be a mixed groundwater type this is clearly seen in the relationship between ca2 mg2 molar ratios with 14c activity where aging of the ca2 mg2 molar ratio driven by cation exchange reactions linked to clays present in the aquifer host rocks driving substitution of ca2 for equivalent na shows low ratios in young tmg groundwaters high ratios in older mg groundwaters and intermediate ca2 mg2 molar ratios and 14c activities for both the alluvial aquifer and the mixed na cl mg groundwater type fig 11 a 5 1 3 alluvial aquifer the alluvial aquifer groundwater records variable values for most parameters that fall between the mg groundwater and the tmg groundwater the exception to this is the fairly homogeneous δ 18o and δ 2h values fig 8 the 14c activity of groundwater in the alluvial aquifer is variable but generally more in line with that of the tmg groundwater borehole site bt18vl14 is located outside of the verlorenvlei catchment fig 6 and this low 14c activity indicates an older groundwater component of at least a few thousand years in the alluvial aquifer system see section 5 2 given that groundwater tritium values increase with increasing renewal rates the tritium values in this groundwater type 0 337 to 0 02 tu suggest that there is both a young and old groundwater component and this is likely what accounts for the spread of the data towards higher tritium values for a given 14c activity fig 10 this relationship may also be the result of carbonate dissolution but in the case of the samples from this catchment this does not appear to be related to dissolution of recent palaeocarbonates formed through weathering processes involving marine salt deposition for example such as has been documented in heuweltjie mounds elsewhere in the western cape midgley et al 2012 such processes typically show a consistent sr to ca ratio which correlates to the seawater sr to ca ratio this is not the case with these groundwater samples though as sr ca elemental ratios don t correlate with 14c activity fig 12 b implying that any modification of the 14c is not derived from a single carbonate source the alluvial aquifer groundwater is isotopically enriched in 18o in comparison to other groundwater in the catchment this is likely to be an evaporation signature as a result of secondary evaporation on precipitation falling in the lower catchment area in semi arid environments the isotopic composition of δ2h and δ18o in shallow groundwater can be significantly modified from that of local precipitation as a result of evaporative isotopic enrichment during infiltration into the vadose zone cortecci et al 2008 gonzález trinidad et al 2017 the lower deuterium excess values could indicate the recycling of source waters from surface water systems evaporation as well as variability of infiltration rates in the vadose zone koh et al 2012 this last point is likely to have been an important consideration given the recent severe drought conditions in the region which may have changed the soil surface properties resulting in reduced infiltration consistent with potential recharge modelling indicating very low recharge potential in the alluvial and mg aquifer systems watson et al 2018 irrigation return flows could also potentially be subject to evaporation generating a lower d excess value but irrigation return flow volumes are currently unconstrained and thus the effect on the bulk d excess signal cannot be evaluated moreover there is no change in the general hydrochemistry of the groundwater that would imply a component of return flow 5 2 calculation of residence times due to the fact that recharge is a continuous process and that the origin of water can be from several sources the residence time of groundwater typically describes a mean residence time or a range of time that has passed since a mixture of water from different ages entered the saturated zone strauch 2014 even assuming a borehole is screened into a single aquifer the groundwater in that aquifer may still be representative of various flow paths and this combined with dispersion and diffusion in an aquifer leads to groundwater mixing as a result a groundwater sample taken from any borehole is usually a mixture of groundwater with an age distribution that represents different parcels of water each with a different history and flow path cornaton and perrochet 2006 in order to estimate the transit time distribution for groundwater in the verlorenvlei catchment the residence time for each aquifer system was evaluated using radiocarbon and noble gas data for groundwater ages without any correction applied and assuming a simple piston flow system the residence time of groundwater can be calculated using equation 1 where 5730 is the 14c half life t½ 14c i is the initial activity of 14c in the system 14c m is the measured 14c activity in the groundwater and t is time 1 t t 1 2 ln 2 ln 14 c m 14 c i by convention 14cm is expressed relative to the 14ciactivity of wood from pre industrial times year 1895 and hence the ratio 14cm relative to 14ci is given as a single value in units of percent modern carbon the dilution of this ratio via the addition of 14c free carbon for example by carbonate dissolution can be calculated via several methods see review by cartwright et al 2017 han and wassenaar 2021 but generally introduces the parameter q which is a dilution factor such that equation 1 becomes 2 t t 1 2 ln 2 ln q 14 c m 14 c i one of the most common methods to calculate the value for q is via the pearson δ13c mixing model which uses δ13c to account for 14c dilution and assumes that any change in 14c in groundwater will also be reflected in 13c in groundwater given by δ 13 c dic ingerson and pearson 1964 this model assumes simple mixing between co2 from the soil δ 13 c soil and carbon derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals δ 13 c carbonate and calculates a value for q using equation 3 no other sources or sinks of carbon are taken into consideration 3 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c carbonate δ 13 c soil δ 13 c carbonate despite the geology in the verlorenvlei catchment being dominated by shales and sandstone the radiocarbon correction using equations 2 and 3 is not straightforward however comparison of 14c activities and δ 13c ratios suggests that potential end members are present fig 12 the tmg samples have the lowest δ 13c values indicative of c3 plants whilst 14c activity is highest at 95 pmc in contrast the mg groundwater samples have the lowest 14c activities 60 pmc whilst δ 13c values are amongst the highest and whilst they could be indicative of c4 plants they may also reflect dissolution of carbonate minerals in the host rocks although the small sample set analysed here makes accurate calculation of residence times difficult an indication of residence time range can be made by making some assumptions about the groundwater system for the tmg groundwater extremely limited δ 13c dic values suggests that δ 13c soil would have been 20 25 there is very little carbonate material in the tmg but assuming δ 13c carb values similar to carbonate lenses in the underlying malmesbury group formations with δ 13c carb 1 0 3 4 midgley et al 2012 harris unpublished data equations 2 and 3 suggests very little carbonate dissolution is affecting the tmg groundwater with residence times in the range of 200 1200 years at the other end of the spectrum δ 13c dic values for the ca na cl mg groundwater suggests either that δ 13c soil in that system was derived from equilibration with c4 plants or that there has been substantial dissolution through interaction with carbonate rocks natural vegetation in the study area is uniformly c3 vermonti 2022 with the dominant cultivated crops also considered to be c3 potato citrus and grape vines using the same δ 13c carb values as previously and equations 2 and 3 again q values for the ca na cl mg groundwater samples are in the range 0 5 0 8 assuming a starting δ 13c composition similar to the tmg and yields residence times in the range 5000 9000 years groundwater from the mg aquifer across the region typically has lower 14c activities irrespective of geographical proximity to the tmg aquifer harilall 2020 and this is consistent with hydrogeological interpretations pointing to the mg aquifer being an older groundwater system residence times for the alluvial and na cl mg groundwater system are difficult to estimate because of the wide range of δ 13c dic values that are recorded by these samples table 1 whilst it is possible that some of this variation may be the result of post collection modification of the sample δ 13c dic the na cl mg groundwater compositions typically fall between the compositions of the ca na cl mg groundwater and the tmg groundwater figs 9 and 10 suggesting that they represent mixtures of these two groundwater types this is supported by the hydrochemical results and aligns to the hydrological modelling as pointed out by cartwright et al 2017 and han and wassenaar 2021 because the relationship between the activity of a radioactive isotope tracer and the age derived from that tracer is non linear mean residence times are typically under estimated except in very old groundwater systems where the reverse is true this may well be the case for the na cl mg groundwater samples however additional constraints on the residence time of the tmg groundwater can be made through calculation of 3h 3he apparent ages from the noble gas data 3h 3he apparent ages have been calculated using equation 4 for three tmg groundwater samples in the upper catchment and two alluvial aquifer groundwater samples in the lower catchment table 2 a sixth sample from the mg aquifer was also analysed but had an extremely low r ra value of 0 1 and did not yield a 3h 3he apparent age this sample has the highest helium concentration 1 68 10 8 ccstp g with the lowest 3he 4he ratio indicating a significant crustal component of helium in equation 4 3hmeas represents the measured recent tritium concentration in groundwater while 3hetrit denotes the tritiogenic component of the dissolved 3he in the same groundwater sample 4 t 12 32 ln 2 ln 3 h meas 3 h e trit 3 h meas 5 3 h e meas 3 h e eq 3 h e ex 3 h e terr 3 h e trit in the dissolved phase 3he is present as four different components eq 5 these are 1 solubility equilibrium 3heeq 2 excess air 3heex 3 terrigenic 3heterr and 4 tritiogenic 3hetrit components such that 3hetrit 3hemeasured 3heeq 3heex 3heterr to calculate 3h 3he apparent ages the tritiogenic 3he component has to be isolated from the other components noble gas recharge temperatures as the solubility excess air and terrigenic components were calculated using the closed system equilibration gas water partitioning model of aeschbach hertig et al 2000 a 3he 4he ratio for the terrigenic component of 2 10 8 was assumed using the above methodology 3h 3he ages from 0 to 52 7 years were calculated with no clear differentiation between the tmg and alluvial aquifer systems table 2 sample bt18vl04 alluvial and bt18vl14 tmg provide ages of zero years indicating recent recharge however the age calculation is uncertain due to the elevated helium concentration sample bt18vl04 and the elevated excess air component the water of bt18vl04 might be older as can be seen from the higher helium content combined with a lower 3he 4he ratio more accurate apparent ages can be calculated for the other samples bt18vl15 16 19 ranging from 33 6 to 53 7 years a reliable 3h 3he age could not be calculated for the water in the mg aquifer since the high helium content of crustal origin swamps the tritiogenic component however the high helium concentration indicates that this water has a longer residence time in comparison to the tmg groundwater the calculated age using the noble gas data is equal to the age of the young groundwater component regardless of the proportions of each water mass in the mixture harvey et al 2006 therefore these ages must represent a minimum groundwater age with higher overall tritium activities for the tmg and alluvial aquifers confirming that those two aquifers are being actively recharged on the other hand radiocarbon ages of groundwater may be viewed as a maximum age due to the uncertainty in 14c dissolution from this it is apparent that both the tmg aquifer and the alluvial aquifer in the verlorenvlei are being actively recharged but the groundwater in the aquifers consists of both a younger and older groundwater component as a result of mixing along various flow paths similar arguments can be made for the groundwater in the mg aquifer system 5 3 groundwater mixing based on the hydrochemistry and the above residence time estimates two main mixing relationships have been identified for the first in both the tmg and alluvial aquifer systems the discrepancy between the 14c residence time and the 3h 3he residence time points to recent recharge mixing with groundwater that has already been in the aquifer on the order of decades to hundreds of years this mixing can be evaluated using a tracer abundance curve derived from a lumped parameter model lpm for this mixing relationship we envisage a situation where packets of recharge are continuously added along the flow path this is consistent with recent modelling of recharge indicating that although recharge in the valleys is typically low it nevertheless equates to approximately 1 5 of map or between 2 and 10 mm yr 1 watson et al 2018 watson et al 2020 in the second mixing relationship changes in hydrochemical character combined with residence time constraints point to mixing and thus interaction between different aquifer systems 5 3 1 mixing of young and old groundwaters to investigate the degree of mixing between younger and older groundwaters a lpm decay curve between 3h and 14c was computed to create a decay curve relationship for the region fig 10 the model was built using tracerlpm software jurgens et al 2012 and used a ratio of piston to exponential flow of f 0 6 using an exponential piston flow model epm which represents a typical unconfined to semiconfined aquifer system where q correction values are not yet considered morgenstern et al 2010 stewart 2012 zuber et al 2005 tritium activities of precipitation in the western cape region of south africa are typically between 1 and 2 tu with increasing tritium inland compared to coastal areas and lower activities in winter precipitation van rooyen et al 2021 the measured 3h and 14c activities in groundwater from the tmg aquifer showed the youngest ages with the highest proportion of younger water 40 80 while groundwater from the mg aquifer showed the lowest proportion of younger water 0 8 na cl groundwater samples from the mg aquifer that were predicted to have significant mixing of younger and older waters plot in the mixing region of the lpm curve and have a low proportion of younger water fig 10 suggesting that although modern recharge is occurring it is relatively low when compared to the tmg and alluvial systems 5 3 2 mixing between aquifer systems as has been described previously for the mg aquifer system there are two main groups of samples those before the confluence the ca na cl type bt18vl9 13 and those after the confluence the na cl type bt18vl6 8 fig 6 residence times are distinctly different between the two because of the higher 14c activity in samples after the confluence implying younger residence times and this is interpreted to be the result of mixing between groundwater from the mg aquifer system and either the tmg or the alluvial aquifer as opposed to mixing of different aged packets of water within one aquifer system it is worth noting that in this study the tmg was sampled from the piketberg mountains in the south of the catchment given the distance between this area and the location of the na cl mg samples below the confluence it seems unlikely that tmg groundwater from the piketberg mountains is contributing directly to the mixed groundwater composition however substantial outcrops of tmg occur to the north east of the confluence in the swartberge mountains fig 2 and sigidi 2018 used 87sr 86sr ratios to identify an important source of tmg groundwater entering into the groundwater system above the confluence from this part of the catchment this is also evident from the δ 13c of bt18vl08 which at 19 3 has more in common with the tmg groundwater than groundwater from the alluvial aquifer fig 6 furthermore a decrease in sr and ec in groundwater after the confluence is indicative of dilution the chemistry and residence time of the groundwater at borehole bt18vl08 is similar to that at sites bt18vl06 and 07 located after the confluence one interpretation of this is that the contribution of tmg groundwater from the bergvallei tributary that drains the swartberge mountains is significantly more volumetric than previously considered and hence represents an important unrecognized contributor to groundwater in the verlorenvlei 5 4 implications for groundwater sustainability although this study has focused on a fairly small catchment area the results contribute to the understanding of aquifer systems in the western cape as a whole groundwater throughout the western cape is generally sourced from either 1 similar tmg outcrops 2 underlying malmesbury group aquifers with fractured secondary porosity or 3 shallow alluvial primary porosity aquifers typically groundwater residence times in the tmg aquifer are the youngest due to the nature of the fracture system and the relatively high recharge rates miller et al 2017 diamond and harris 2019 groundwater from the alluvial system has the broadest mix of residence times with precipitation recharging the primary aquifer over wide areas albeit at low to very low rates watson et al 2018 the mg aquifer has the longest groundwater residence time and groundwater in this system increases in age away from the inferred dominant recharge region in verlorenvlei as is the nature of a confined aquifer system climate change models predict reduced precipitation along the west coast of south africa schultz 2011 pohl et al 2017 as groundwater in the tmg aquifer system has young residence times it will likely be impacted quickly by these changed precipitation patterns reduced recharge rates into the tmg aquifer in the verlorenvlei would have knock on impacts for recharge of both the mg and alluvial aquifers however the reduced precipitation across the west coast of southern africa may not change the recharge dynamics depending on how this recharge is received it is hypothesized that in semi arid environments the bulk of recharge is received by less frequent large precipitation events cuthbert et al 2019 similar scenarios are seen in verlorenvlei where large individual rainfall events are critical to overcoming interception and satisfying soil moisture storages in order to drive recharge watson et al 2019 nevertheless modelling of recharge suggests that smaller precipitation events are important for antecedent conditions limiting quickflow and facilitating percolation through the vadose zone if the tmg and mg aquifers are hydraulically connected as has been proposed by rainfall runoff modelling watson et al 2019 then abstraction from either the tmg or mg aquifer will have knock on effects to the other system although the clay layer acts as an impermeable barrier across much of the catchment these knock on effects would further impact the baseflow required to sustain the verlorenvlei estuarine lake system as this is largely supported by the tmg aquifer moreover agricultural diversions from the surface water system may also critically impact baseflow during low flow periods when baseflow is essential to maintain the vlei this was seen during the 2020 2021 dry season where baseflow was not enough to support the low flow ecological reserve requirements of the vlei leading to it drying out addressing these potential issues would require adaptation by farmers to different types of water saving initiatives and in extreme cases possible changes in crop types one critical finding from this study is the importance of combining modelling studies with hydrochemical characterization of the groundwater being modelled conceptual rainfall runoff models need a catchment boundary to be delineated where the boundary defines a system where each aquifer is assumed to behave in a similar way however the hydrochemical data and particularly the radio isotope data from the verlorenvlei catchment have highlighted where there are important changes in the way groundwater is being delivered to one part of an aquifer something that cannot easily be accounted for with regional modelling of recharge estimates this is the case with the mg aquifer system which clearly shows the added contribution of tmg groundwater into the mixed mg type below the confluence without hydrochemical and isotope data to identify this input any type of modelling in this part of the catchment would be biased towards an unrealistic model solution such a point has also been highlighted by watson et al 2021 where the size of the catchment or sub basin was critical for simulating regionally representative proportions of surface runoff interflow and baseflow 6 conclusions this study has shown that a distinction can be made between the groundwater in the tmg alluvial and mg aquifers in the verlorenvlei catchment using hydrochemistry and groundwater residence times the variation in hydrochemistry and groundwater residence time between the aquifer systems indicates that the groundwater chemistry is the result of both extended water rock interactions as well as mixing between older and younger waters this has been demonstrated through discrepancies between the residence times calculated from radiocarbon and 3h 3he and applies to groundwater in the tmg and alluvial aquifer systems residence times in the mg aquifer from this study along with hydrochemical relationships indicated by watson et al 2020 have shown that this aquifer system is linked via recharge pathways to the tmg aquifer in the upper part of the catchment but that after the confluence of the main tributaries into the verloren river there is direct mixing with a younger groundwater component leading to modified radiocarbon ages orographic rainfall leads to groundwater recharge in the tmg aquifer mist may also contribute to recharge in the alluvial aquifer system but this remains unquantified at the current point in time young residence times of groundwater in the tmg and alluvial aquifer imply that this aquifer system is most susceptible to reduced groundwater recharge with climate change predictions indicating reduced rainfall volumes and future drought conditions along south africa s west coast reduced renewal rates are likely to be exacerbated by the possible rise in dependence on groundwater leading to increased withdrawal rates to supply water for domestic and agricultural activity along the west coast future residence time studies should consider calculating the age distribution of groundwater in the three aquifer systems in the verlorenvlei catchment quantifying the mean length of time of groundwater in each aquifer would provide further insight into the sustainability of the groundwater systems credit authorship contribution statement j a miller

2929,the verlorenvlei catchment on the west coast of south africa is a semi arid region that is growing progressively more reliant on groundwater due to increased variability in precipitation and increasing agricultural productivity the groundwater systems have been put under additional stress given the recent 2015 2017 el ninõ system that led to drought conditions along the west coast of south africa this increased reliance puts the natural environment and human dependence on groundwater into direct conflict groundwater was sampled for δ18o δ 2h δ 13c 14c 3h and 3h 3he ratios in addition to cation and anion concentrations from seventeen production boreholes and two springs in the catchment residence times were estimated using tritium and radiocarbon and in the case of the latter the pearson model has been used to correct for possible carbonate dissolution hydrochemistry and residence times of groundwater in the verlorenvlei catchment have successfully been used to distinguish between the primary porosity alluvial aquifer the secondary porosity malmesbury shale aquifer mg and the fractured rock aquifers associated with the table mountain group tmg groundwater mixing has been identified within the catchment and this plays an important role in the variation in groundwater chemistry and residence time between the aquifer systems the discrepancy between the calculated radiocarbon and 3h 3he ages in the tmg and alluvial aquifers has been evaluated using a lumped parameter model that confirms that the tmg is strongly dominated by young groundwaters young 3h 3he residence times calculated for groundwater in the tmg 34 57 years and alluvial aquifers 34 47 years implies that these systems are most susceptible to reduced groundwater recharge given the interconnected nature of the aquifer systems reduced recharge rates into the tmg aquifer will decrease groundwater flow to both the alluvial and mg aquifer and this will impact the long term sustainability of the ramsar listed verlorenvlei estuarine lake and wetlands at the catchment outlet future residence time studies should consider using a lumped parameter model lpm to calculate the

however whilst surface water systems visually record the effects of changing precipitation patterns groundwater systems are more opaque in how they respond to changes in precipitation green et al 2011 depending on the type of aquifer system and the distance between the recharge and discharge sites the groundwater system might be resilient to short term changes in precipitation i e drought with longer term impacts i e climate change only manifesting in decades to centuries or longer after these precipitation changes have become normalized doll 2009 tallaksen et al 2009 this scenario is currently playing out in the continental intercalaire aquifer in north africa where dramatic reductions in precipitation that occurred at the end of the pleistocene are still passing through the aquifer system hamed et al 2014 in contrast the fractured rock aquifer around the city of cape town on the south west coast of africa in places has very short groundwater flow paths and residence times and therefore reacts rapidly and dynamically to changes in precipitation patterns as the recent 2015 2017 cape town drought crisis demonstrated miller et al 2017 sousa et al 2018 understanding the groundwater response time to changes in recharge patterns is central to understanding groundwater resilience in the face of climate change gleeson et al 2012 this requires addressing questions regarding the renewability replenishment safe yield and sustainability of groundwater resources safe yield first defined by lee 1914 refers to the limit of the quantity of water that can be withdrawn regularly without dangerous depletion of the storage reserve in contrast sustainable yield reserves a fraction of the safe yield for the benefit of surface waters meaning that safe yield values take into account the ecological reserve the volume and quality required to sustain a surface water ecosystem alley and leake 2004 wyk and sherwill 2006 this may also accommodate replenishment where drought has led to substantial reductions in both surface and sub surface water levels in order to determine safe aquifer yields assess groundwater sustainability and ensure the proper management of groundwater resources a comprehensive understanding of groundwater residence time and how this intersects with groundwater recharge rates is required jyrkama and sykes 2007 most importantly it requires an understanding of the interaction between the surface water and groundwater systems the west coast of south africa is a semi arid region where the mean annual precipitation is typically 400 mm yr fig 1 resulting in a heavy dependence on groundwater resources with large scale abstraction required to support growing agricultural needs műnch et al 2013 this abstraction can come at the expense of the natural environment that exists in a fragile equilibrium with the low rainfall rates much of the coastal vegetation is thought to have adapted to utilize coastal fog and mist to support itself rather than relying solely on rainfall csir 2009a in the future climate change will reduce precipitation rates as well as coastal fog and mist klemm and lin 2016 with the potential to drive ecological adaptations by coastal vegetation to an increasing dependence on groundwater this increased dependence puts the natural environment and human dependence on groundwater in direct conflict nowhere in south africa is this more apparent than in the verlorenvlei ramsar listed estuarine lake and associated wetlands wetlands situated in semi arid settings such as the verlorenvlei are representative of areas strongly affected by decreased water levels due to climate change and agricultural development harvey et al 2006 as a result long term it is thought that permanent wetlands will become highly seasonal and seasonal wetlands may altogether disappear junk et al 2013 sustainable water management is therefore vital for maintaining the ecological system of wetlands in semi arid regions despite the increasing demands on water supply the verlorenvlei catchment contains three main aquifer systems two fractured rock aquifers and one primary porosity alluvial aquifer the quality and quantity of groundwater from each of the aquifers is reasonably distinct implying that it may be possible to track the relative contributions of each watson et al 2019 although previous hydrogeological studies have examined the flow system and recharge mechanisms conrad et al 2004 watson et al 2018 groundwater residence times and the variation in recharge rates between these aquifer bodies have not been determined moreover the three aquifers are thought to be at least partially interconnected watson et al 2018 and groundwater mixing may play an important role in the catchment groundwater evolution the interplay between these aquifers is still poorly constrained though and a more detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between the different groundwater systems is required in order to understand these mixing relationships and the impact they will have on the determination of groundwater residence time this study evaluates the residence time of groundwater in each of the main aquifers in the verlorenvlei catchment using radiocarbon and 3h 3he dating the interpretation of these ages is used to understand the hydrochemical evolution of the groundwater along the catchment extent and to consider the aquifer safe yield in this region the verlorenvlei wetlands continue to be affected by water resource pressure and again dried out over the summer of 2021 through a combination of groundwater abstraction surface water diversion and changing precipitation patterns similar pressures on wetlands are occurring the world over and have been highlighted in the recent update report on sdg6 un water 2021 the results of this study will hopefully shed light on the groundwater resource base available for agricultural use and the future implications for groundwater sustainability in this and other similar agricultural regions world wide 2 study site the verlorenvlei catchment is located along the west coast of south africa in a region known as the sandveld approximately 200 km north of cape town fig 1 the catchment is bounded by the piketberg mountains in the south west and the swartberg and olifantsriver mountains in the east and north east forming the southern portion of the olifants doorn water management area the piketberg mountains have the highest topographic elevation in the area at approximately 1446 m within the catchment the hol krom antonies kruismans and bervallei are the main tributaries of the verloren river which is itself the main contributor of freshwater to the ramsar listed verlorenvlei wetlands fig 1c sinclair et al 1984 the kruismans drains the eendukuil or kruismans basin the low lying area between the olifantsrivier mountains and the piketberg mountains the bergvallei drains south into the kruismans from the swartberge mountains the hol and krom antonies drain from the north side of the piketberg mountains into the kruismans the point after which the hol the furthest downstream of the tributaries joins the kruismans is termed the confluence after which the river is called the verloren river fig 2 the vlei afrikaans for wetlands or marsh which covers approximately 190 km2 and known for its high biodiversity profile is only intermittently open to the ocean as a sandbar blocks the outflow except during times of flooding the majority of the verlorenvlei catchment consists of farmland and as a result agriculture is the predominant water user in the region archer et al 2009 potatoes have been the primary crop grown but recent years have seen an increase in citrus and viticulture rooibos tea is also produced in the region although this arid crop relies on rainfall and therefore does not contribute to groundwater abstraction in the catchment the indigenous vegetation that remains is restricted to the mountainsides where land is difficult to cultivate for agricultural use 2 1 climate the sandveld has a mediterranean climate where the majority of rainfall is received in the winter months between may and august martens et al 1996 the highest rainfall in the area is received in the piketberg mountains where mean annual precipitation map reaches 800 mm year fig 1 mist is also considered to be a significant contributor to the piketberg mountains but is currently unconstrained csir 2009a rainfall declines west of the piketberg mountains reaching a low of 210 mm year at the mouth of the verlorenvlei watson et al 2018 daily temperatures in the area are generally between 8 and 13 c in winter and 17 to 23 c in summer schulze et al 2008 mean reference evaporation in the catchment ranges between 1 5 and 2 3 mm day in winter and 5 5 and 7 4 mm day in summer with an annual average of 4 5 mm day schulze et al 2008 2 2 geology the catchment geology is made up of four lithological packages fig 2 the oldest rocks in the catchment are the late neoproterozoic to cambrian malmesbury group rozendaal and gresse 1994 kisters et al 2015 although the position and significance of the malmesbury group is interpreted differently by different researchers e g frimmel et al 2013 gresse et al 2006 kisters and belcher 2018 there is general consensus that the catchment area is dominated by the piketberg formation consisting of greywacke sericitic schist quartzite conglomerate and limestone rozendaal and gresse 1994 the malmesbury group typically crops out at low elevation in the valley floors but outcrops are sparse and discontinuous this is particularly so towards the vlei itself although in the west around eendekuil outcrops of malmesbury group rocks are more common to the south of the catchment the piketberg formation is separated from other units of the malmesbury group by the piketberg wellington fault frimmel et al 2013 this is a large fault system that has been suggested to be linked to the smaller krom antonies lineament as well as the redelinghuys fault that runs through the ne and central parts of the study area fig 2 rozendaal and gresse 1994 the malmesbury group rocks have been intruded by the cambrian cape granite suite although drilling has indicated their presence at depth outcrops within the catchment are very poor to non existent however strongly weathered and bleached micaceous units in eroded gullies may represent original cape granite outcrops the malmesbury group is uncomformably overlain by the late cambrian klipheuwel group an alluvial deposit that formed during the early stages of rifting that immediately preceded deposition of the cape supergroup belcher and kisters 2003 the klipheuwel is very discontinuous in the study area and is not considered to be an important unit for this study the majority of the cape supergroup 480 550 ma tankard et al 2009 consists of thickly bedded sandstones and quartzites although conglomerates and shales are also present de beer 2003 within the verlorenvlei catchment the dominant formations are from the late cambrian to silurian table mountain group consisting of the piekenierskloof graafwater peninsula cederberg and nardouw formations fig 3 conrad et al 2004 the piekenierskloof formation which consists of sandstone and conglomerate forms the base of the tmg sequence in the catchment and is overlain by the volumetrically small graafwater formation that consists mostly of siltstones and shales the graafwater formation is overlain by the peninsula formation which is the dominant formation that crops out in the catchment consisting of thickly bedded mature sandstones to quartzitic units these rocks form the topographic highs of the piketberg mountains on the south side of the catchment and the swartberge mountains on the north side of the catchment tmg outcrops also occur in the lower parts of the catchment near the coast albeit at lower elevations fig 2 the youngest unit within the catchment is the dominantly cenozoic sandveld deposit a thin bed of shallow marine to terrigenous sediments that covers the coast from false bay to elands bay roberts et al 2006 more recent sedimentary deposits in the catchment consist of aeolian sands that contain little clay and silt the alluvial soils range between 3 and 12 m thick and an underlying clay layer which forms an aquitard ranges from 3 to 25 m thick conrad et al 2004 2 3 hydrogeology of the three aquifer systems present in the verlorenvlei catchment the most significant in terms of water quantity and quality is the tmg aquifer system that extends over much of the western cape province fig 3 and represents one of the largest and most important aquifers in south africa pietersen and parsons 2007 and references therein this is a fractured rock aquifer that exhibits low primary porosity in part because the tmg sandstones are quartzitic in places the fracture network is very heterogeneous and thought to be more interconnected at shallower depths implying restrictions to groundwater flow at deeper levels lin et al 2014 groundwater hosted in these rocks is characterized by very low ec typically 100 μs cm 1 but often 50 μs cm 1 and slightly acidic ph values 4 5 5 5 miller et al 2017 smart and tredoux 2002 rates of recharge vary but existing estimates of the groundwater residence time indicate that precipitation is moved through the system on a 20 50 year timescale at least where groundwater emanates as cold springs on tmg dominated mountains miller et al 2017 groundwater δ18o and δ2h values tend to be characteristic of precipitation at higher elevations implying that the high mountains are the dominant recharge areas diamond and harris 2019 this is consistent with modelling of potential recharge in the verlorenvlei catchment by watson et al 2018 tmg rocks occur at high elevations on both the southern and northern sides of the catchment and it is not clear whether the outcrops on either side of the catchment are hydraulically connected although the hydrochemistry of groundwater is much the same eilers 2018 the tmg aquifer overlies malmesbury group mg shales that form a different aquifer system table 1 with variable but generally poorer water quality than the tmg aquifer groundwater in this aquifer is hosted in secondary porosity structures principally the foliation planes of the shale and through going fault structures and this strongly dictates the direction in which groundwater moves the aquifer is also semi confined to confined due to the presence of the overlying clay layer that acts as an aquitard this aquifer system will be referred to as the mg aquifer and is equivalent to the secondary aquifer referred to by watson et al 2018 the clay layer does not occur at surface but is commonly intersected in augered piezometers where it forms the boundary between the alluvial aquifer and the mg aquifer below boreholes into the mg aquifer are generally high yielding attributed to the presence of this confining clay layer conrad et al 2004 overlying the tmg aquifer and the mg aquifer is the alluvial aquifer system hosted by unconsolidated quaternary sandy sediments of the sandveld formation fig 3 these units typically occur in the channels of the river valleys and along the flanks of the mountain slopes the thickness of the alluvial aquifer and therefore the depth of the confining clay aquitard is thus variable throughout the catchment the alluvial aquifer has primary porosity in this region and is equivalent to the primary aquifer of watson et al 2018 in this aquifer system the water quality is heterogeneous and prone to degradation with the shallow groundwater being very saline in places often 5000 ms cm 1 or more particularly closer to the coast conrad et al 2004 sigidi 2018 2 4 recharge characterisation groundwater recharge in the verlorenvlei catchment has been determined using rainfall runoff modelling watson et al 2018 a natural tracer technique using chloride mass balance cmb watson et al 2020 and a gis based modelling approach conrad et al 2004 recharge dominantly occurs in areas of high elevation such as the piketberg mountains and therefore into the tmg aquifer high potential evaporation in the valleys along with the confining clay layer limits vertical recharge into the alluvial aquifer watson et al 2017 however the three aquifer systems are thought to be connected and groundwater modelling along with hydraulic head gradients support discharge from the tmg aquifer into the alluvial aquifer watson et al 2018 this is also supported by the sustained presence of surface water in the krom antonies tributary past the end of the wet season watson et al 2018 2019 estimates for the rainfall runoff modelling indicate that percolation inputs to the groundwater system are up to 29 of map in the high elevation regions tmg aquifer and around 3 4 of map in the low lying areas alluvial aquifer groundwater modelling suggests that recharge to the mg aquifer is dominantly derived from the tmg aquifer itself rather than direct rainwater watson et al 2019 with the deterioration in groundwater quality the result of residence time and accumulation of ions along flow paths although addition of ions along the flow path and particularly chloride is not consistent with the assumptions of the cmb method watson et al 2020 mapped out where chloride was added to the system and thereafter where the cmb method was valid and where it was not in the catchment on this basis recharge estimates into the tmg and mg aquifers using cmb in the mid to upper elevations of the catchment were determined to be between 20 and 50 mm year and 2 and 8 mm year respectively values that overlap with the rainfall runoff modelling watson et al 2020 in comparison the gis modeling approach determined recharge in the tmg and mg aquifer to be 80 1 mm year and 1 4 mm year respectively conrad et al 2004 stable isotope data suggests that groundwater from both the tmg and mg aquifers contributes to the alluvial aquifer although the connection is spatially variable and likely a function of the continuity and thickness of the clay aquitard eilers 2018 watson et al 2020 3 field work and analytical methods 3 1 sampling nineteen samples including seventeen borehole samples and two spring water samples were taken in the verlorenvlei catchment from the near the top of the piketberg mountains along the catchment and down to the coast fig 1c samples were collected between march and may representing the transition from autumn to winter in south africa selection of groundwater sampling locations was based on 1 accessibility many boreholes have no take off point at the borehole and could only be sampled after a long run of agricultural pipe 2 boreholes with submersible pumps installed as permanent farm infrastructure 3 known geology of the borehole location and 4 distribution of samples within the catchment based on this approach six samples of the tmg groundwater were taken on the southern side of the upper part of the catchment and seven samples of the mg aquifer were taken in the middle part of the catchment an additional six samples were taken in the lower parts of the catchment and were thought to be a mix of groundwater from the tmg and alluvial aquifers however analysis of hydrochemistry using stiff diagrams suggests that all six samples are derived from the alluvial aquifer the tmg aquifer generally does not crop out in the lower parts of the catchment and boreholes in the middle parts of the catchment tend to be deeper and intersect the malmesbury group whilst those near the coast tend to be shallower and sit within the alluvial aquifer of the springs sampled one is interpreted based on hydrochemistry to be sourced from the tmg aquifer and one from the mg aquifer temperature ph and ec were measured in the field using a portable extech ec500 ph conductivity probe calibrated daily ph and ec were also determined in the laboratory immediately after returning from the field along with alkalinity using a 702 sm titrino autotitrator and a jenway 4510 conductivity probe located in the department of soil science at stellenbosch university the error between laboratory and field ph and ec was 4 6 and 13 3 respectively the laboratory values were used in this study at each location samples were taken for major cations and anions trace elements stable isotopes radiocarbon tritium and where possible noble gases for determination of 3h 3he apparent ages all boreholes were purged until the groundwater ec had stabilized prior to sampling screen depths were not known and it is assumed in this study that the groundwater compositions are representative of a single aquifer being intersected and sampled samples for major cations and anions trace elements and stable isotopes were filtered in the field using 0 45 mm cellulose acetate filters all collection bottles were rinsed twice with the sample water prior to filling and filled with no headspace major cation and trace element samples were collected in 15 ml polypropylene pp tubes and acidified to ph 2 prior to analysis anion samples were collected in 50 ml pp tubes and kept refrigerated at 4 c until analysis stable isotopes of o and h were collected in 15 ml pp tubes radiocarbon and tritium samples were collected in 1 l amber pp bottles and filtered at the isotope climatology and enviornmental research centre icer institute for nuclear research debrecen hungary all samples collected in bottles were kept in the dark until analysis noble gas samples were collected in copper tubes connected to boreholes via the existing borehole pipe system and the connections tightened with clamps to seal out atmosphere only boreholes where the copper tube could be connected at the borehole site itself were sampled groundwater was allowed to run through the copper tubes and the tubes were tapped to remove dislodge any air bubbles before sealing of the copper tubes with pinch off clamps 3 2 analytical techniques cation and trace element analyses were performed using an agilent 7700 icp ms and thermo icap 6200 icp oes respectively at the central analytical facility stellenbosch university the relative standard deviation on analyses was between 2 and 5 anion analysis was performed by bemlabs somerset west sulphate analyses were performed by means of icp oes chloride analysis was done using silver nitrate titration with chromate indicator method at the icer all samples except bt18vl10 14 and 16 had charge balances of 10 stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were determined using a los gatos lwia at icer hungary data are reported as δ18o and δ2h in standard per mill notation internal institute water standards were calibrated to the v smow slap and gisp standards and reported relative to v smow analytical uncertainties of the measurements are 0 1 and 1 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively δ13c values were determined using a deltaplus xp stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer the dissolved inorganic carbon was precipitated in baco3 form and the co2 released after adding phosphoric acid to the baco3 using a gasbench ii δ13c values are reported relative to the v pbd vienna pee dee belemnite standard and have an analytical uncertainty of 0 1 further details of the analytical methods for δ13c are available in varsányi et al 2011 tritium was analyzed at the icer debrecen hungary via the 3he ingrowth method with 4he isotope dilution palcsu et al 2010 papp et al 2012 the process can be simplified to four steps 1 the water sample is distilled 2 dissolved gasses are removed from the water through vacuum pumping 3 the sample is stored for some months to allow for the production of 3he atoms through tritium decay and 4 the helium fraction that is created is admitted to the noble gas mass spectrometer to allow for the measurement of 3he the tritium concentration is measured using the abundance of helium isotopes radiocarbon analysis of groundwater samples took place in three major steps 1 extraction of co2 from water dic in a vacuum cell 2 the graphitization and 3 the accelerator mass spectrometric ams analysis of the graphite groundwater samples are treated with phosphoric acid while in a vacuum in order to release dissolved carbon as carbon dioxide water was injected by a sterile plastic syringe into the prevacuumed digestion reactor vessel through a septum sealed cap a 0 45 um pore size membrane filter was attached to each plastic syringe to filter out the particles from water samples during injection the samples are then heated for one hour at 80 c to allow for the release of the majority of the carbon dioxide the released co2 gas is then transferred into a cleaning vacuum line where all other gases are removed molnár et al 2013 in the vacuum line the water is trapped in a dry ice trap the co2 is trapped in a liquid nitrogen trap and all other gases are pumped away the applied technique allows 14c activity analyses of water samples with dic content down to 5 mg l 1 which is relevant to the tmg groundwaters fossil marble as blank standard material iaea c1 0 0 pmc and known age travertine reference material iaea c2 41 14 pmc were also treated as control samples for the co2 extraction step to determine if any modern fossil carbon contamination is introduced during the extraction or graphitisation procedures for 14c 12c ratio analysis by the micadas type ams at the debrecen ams facility icer the graphite from the water dic samples was prepared by a customised sealed tube graphitization method rinyu et al 2013 the overall measurement uncertainty for modern samples is 3 0 including normalization background subtraction and counting statistics the conventional radiocarbon ages were evaluated by the bats software on the enviromicadas ams instrument version 3 66 wacker et al 2010 helium concentrations and other noble gases were analyzed according to papp et al 2012 four components make up the dissolved gases in groundwater 1 dissolved air at solubility equilibrium 2 radioactive decay of 3h 3 excess air and 4 a terrigenic component aeschbach hertig et al 2000 the dissolved gases were extracted from the copper tube on a preparation vacuum line and the gasses with the exception of helium and neon were trapped in a cryogenic trap papp et al 2012 helium and neon were then absorbed onto a charcoal trap where temperature control allowed for the helium and neon to be admitted to the helix sft and vg5400 mass spectrometers separately the heavier noble gasses were then released from the cryogenic trap purified by getters and measured simultaneously in the vg5400 noble gas mass spectrometer papp et al 2012 fast calibrations were performed by both noble gas mass spectrometers between analysis the measurement was calibrated with known air aliquots of 0 12 to 0 25 ccstp for he and ne and 0 4 to 3 3 ccstp of air for the heavier fraction papp et al 2012 the analytical uncertainties are 1 for he and ar concentrations 2 for ne kr and xe and 1 5 for 3he 4he ratios the concentration of helium in groundwater is used to calculate 3h 3he apparent ages to do this the tritiogenic 3h component of the noble gas concentration must be resolved and the total helium must be separated into its different source components based on the other noble gas concentrations e g miller et al 2017 the recharge temperature of the groundwater can also be estimated from concentrations of the noble gases dissolved in the groundwater at equilibrium using the temperature gas relationship of henry s law novotny sanford 2004 for most recharge areas the groundwater temperature reflects the surface soil temperature however in cases where the groundwater infiltration rate is very high temperatures may not correspond urs beyerle 1999 aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 in the semi arid region of south africa we expect low recharge rates which might affect the 3h 3he age determination 4 results hydrochemical results for the groundwater samples collected are largely consistent with the original designation of aquifer host with two exceptions firstly groundwater samples taken in the lower part of the catchment have distinctly different stiff diagram shapes to the tmg groundwater in the upper catchment and hence have all been re classed as alluvial aquifer as previously indicated secondly three mg aquifer samples bt18vl06 08 have different stiff diagram shapes and 14c activities to the other four mg aquifer samples all the mg samples are shown in green with triangles vs circles and the one spring sample as a polygon around the circle differentiating these two different groups hydrochemical data including stable isotopes of o h and c as well as tritium and radiocarbon are reported in table 1 noble gas data is reported in table 2 4 1 major ion concentrations groundwater electrical conductivity ec values range between 60 and 2560 μs cm 1 and ph values vary from 4 4 to 7 2 table 1 fig 4 tmg groundwater from the piketberg mountains records the lowest ec values 60 250 μs cm 1 while the alluvial and mg groundwaters record the highest ec values 500 2560 μs cm 1 fig 3 the tmg groundwater samples have ph values 5 with one exception at 6 68 bt18vl10 this sample was collected downstream from a tmg spring at the base of the piketberg mountains the mg aquifer groundwater has two groups of ph values the first between 6 3 and 7 2 and the second between 5 6 and 6 0 the clear differences in the tmg and mg aquifer groundwaters are bridged by both the alluvial aquifer groundwater that has more variable ec and ph values and the lower ph mg groundwater fig 4 the alluvial aquifer groundwater appears to fall into two groups these are 1 groundwater with ec 500 μs cm 1 and ph 5 5 and 2 groundwater with ec 1000 μs cm 1 and ph 5 5 in spite of the different ec and ph ranges for the alluvial aquifer groundwater these samples plot as a relatively coherent compositional group on a piper diagram and tend towards a na cl composition fig 5 the tmg groundwater is also a chloride dominated groundwater although the cations are not strongly sodium dominated the outlier bt18vl10 indicated above is again distinct with a higher bicarbonate concentration in comparison to the other tmg groundwaters but this sample had a poor charge balance and the ion concentration may not be reflective of its real composition the two groupings of the mg aquifer groundwater show two compositional types that are largely a difference between a ca na cl type and a na cl type which can be clearly seen on stiff diagrams fig 6 where samples bt18vl09 11 13 have different shapes to those of samples bt18vl06 08 importantly these differences appear to manifest geographically with the na cl mg water type being located to the north west of the ca na cl mg water type two other alluvial aquifer samples bt18vl03 and 05 also display elevated cation concentrations that overlap with groundwater from the mg aquifer although with different ratios table 1 the groundwater chemical variation along the flow path in the verlorenvlei catchment can be assessed by plotting various parameters against the estimated distance of groundwater from the recharge source fig 7 ca2 alkalinity tds and sr values are low at the recharge source and highest in the mg aquifer groundwater the concentrations of these parameters furthest from the recharge source in the alluvial aquifer are more variable groundwater in the mg aquifer after the confluence samples bt18vl06 and 07 na cl type records ionic concentrations closer to those of the alluvial aquifer in the lower catchment than of the mg aquifer before the confluence ca na cl type fig 6 other ionic parameters do not show any noticeable trends along the catchment however groundwater samples in the high elevation recharge area have notably lower salinities 4 2 stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h ratios for the groundwater and spring samples table 1 have a fairly narrow range of values varying between 4 01 and 2 56 and between 17 2 and 9 80 respectively fig 8 with average δ18o and δ2h values of 3 32 and 14 1 respectively tmg groundwater has the most negative δ18o and δ2h values while groundwater from the mg aquifer and the alluvial aquifer have comparable but less negative values the alluvial aquifer groundwater has the least negative δ18o values and also lies closest to the global meteoric water line gmwl whilst the tmg groundwater and mg aquifer groundwater lie closer to the local meteoric water line lmwl defined as δ2h 6 2 δ18o 8 4 based on 49 precipitation samples from 2015 and 2016 watson et al 2020 both the tmg and the mg aquifer groundwater are significantly more negative than the weighted average of either the 2015 or the 2016 precipitation samples whilst the alluvial aquifer groundwater is closer to the weighted average deuterium excess defined here as d excess δ2h 8 δ18o ranges between 10 3 to 15 4 d excess values from the mg aquifer show the largest range d excess values closer to the coast from the alluvial aquifer are lower while groundwater closer to the recharge source in the tmg aquifer have higher d excess values despite groundwater from the mg aquifer appearing to have lower d excess values than the tmg aquifer groundwater there is no significant difference in the d excess of the two groups δ13c values were obtained for all groundwater samples in the catchment and range between 8 5 and 24 5 table 1 groundwater from the tmg aquifer have the most negative δ13c values generally less than 20 one value at 19 8 whilst both the mg aquifer and alluvial aquifer systems have variable δ13c values between 19 6 and 8 5 the two different compositional groups for the mg aquifer identified above have similar δ13c values although the na cl type tends towards more negative values examination of δ13c vs alkalinity indicates that groundwater with low alkalinity has more negative δ13c values whilst samples with higher alkalinity record less negative δ13c values fig 9 on this basis tmg groundwater has hco3 50 mg l 1 and δ13c 19 8 whilst the ca na cl mg aquifer groundwater type has hco3 300 mg l 1 and δ13c 13 0 the na cl mg aquifer groundwater type and the alluvial aquifer have similar hco3 and δ13c values that vary between these two end members 4 3 radioactive isotopes 4 3 1 radiocarbon the activity of 14c in groundwater in the verlorenvlei catchment ranges from 98 7 to 31 7 pmc table 1 the highest 14c activity was found in tmg groundwater 95 2 pmc and the lowest 14c activity was found in the ca na cl mg aquifer groundwater type 59 8 pmc the na cl mg aquifer groundwater type has intermediate 14c activities between 65 0 and 72 9 pmc the alluvial aquifer groundwater has relatively high 14c activities above 82 5 pmc similar to but not as high as the tmg groundwater for the ca na cl mg aquifer groundwater type 14c activity decreases from bt18vl11 59 8 pmc down the catchment over a distance of 13 km to bt18vl09 31 7 pmc 4 3 2 tritium tritium activities in groundwater in verlorenvlei vary from 0 05 to 0 623 tu table 2 high tritium activities 0 312 tu correspond to tmg groundwater while low tritium activities 0 05 0 090 tu correspond to the ca na cl mg aquifer groundwater type the alluvial aquifer groundwater and the na cl mg groundwater type have a range of tritium activities between 0 05 and 0 337 tu tritium values correlate with 14c activities such that high 14c activities have high tritium activities whilst low 14c activities have low tritium activities the relationship follows the approximate trend for differential rates of radioactive decay of the two isotopes fig 10 although tritium remains more elevated than it should be for lower 14c activities 4 3 3 noble gas data noble gas data was obtained for three tmg aquifer samples three alluvial aquifer samples and one ca na cl mg aquifer sample table 2 noble gas temperatures ngt were calculated using an elevation above sea level of 400 m for samples bt18vl04 and bt18vl14 both of which are inferred to receive recharge from lower down in the catchment and 1000 m for samples inferred to receive recharge from high elevations on piketberg mountain including bt18vl12 using these elevations noble gas recharge temperatures in the range of 16 1 to 21 1 c have been determined and are considered to be representative of average annual air temperature in the catchment given in csir 2009b noble gas temperature calculations have been tested using a chi square test and found to be significant at the level of p 0 1 helium isotopic data is normalized to the atmosphere and expressed as r ra values where r 3he 4he sample and ra 3he 4he atmosphere 1 382 10 6 sano et al 2013 r ra values are distinct between the different aquifers the tmg groundwater have r ra values 1 whilst the alluvial aquifer groundwater have r ra values of 0 46 0 49 and the r ra value for the single ca na cl mg groundwater sample is 0 062 this sample is highly enriched in he 1 683 10 6 ccstp g and suggests that the 4he is radiogenic in origin and the groundwater is thus older than the datable range of 3h 3he which is consistent with the low 14c activity of 35 1 pmc 5 discussion the above data suggests that the three aquifer systems in the verlorenvlei catchment the alluvial aquifer the mg aquifer and the tmg aquifer are hydrochemically and isotopically distinct suggesting that these three aquifer systems represent separate flow systems in the catchment however there is some overlap in the groundwater chemistry between the three suggesting that there may be interaction between the different systems leading to groundwater mixing taking place three factors are likely contributing to the hydrochemical distinction between the aquifers 1 the composition of the host rocks in the aquifer system 2 the interaction of the groundwater with the host rock dissolution and precipitation of carbonates and sulphides weathering of silicates to clays cation exchange with clay minerals and 3 the mixing between groundwater systems in order to better understand possible groundwater mixing in the catchment the aquifer systems were characterized and groundwater residence times were calculated for each aquifer 5 1 characterisation of groundwater types stiff diagrams plotted along the catchment highlight the variation in hydrochemistry that exists between the alluvial mg and tmg aquifer systems fig 6 low ionic concentrations are present at the recharge site in the tmg aquifer while the highest ionic concentrations are in the upper middle of the catchment from the mg aquifer with the exception of one alluvial aquifer sample bt18vl14 groundwater closest to the coast in the alluvial aquifer displayed more variability in ionic concentrations 5 1 1 tmg aquifer groundwater from the tmg aquifer is differentiated from the other groundwater types by 1 very low ec values 267 μs cm 1 2 weakly acidic character ph values 4 7 and 3 high 14c and 3h activities 95 pmc and 0 3 tu respectively reflecting short flow pathways and close proximity to the main recharge area stiff diagrams are distinctive with narrow na cl shapes fig 6 tmg groundwater also has the lowest δ δ 18o and δ 2h values in the verlorenvlei suggesting that only heavier precipitation events falling on the elevated parts of the piketberg mountains during winter are generating groundwater recharge this is consistent with potential recharge modelling by watson et al 2018 and previous stable isotope work by diamond and harris 2019 this is further supported by high deuterium excess values that likely reflect original precipitation characteristics δ 13c values are also distinctly lower than for the other groundwater types and characteristic of environments dominated by c3 plants consistent with the coastal renosterveld vegetation that is dominantly preserved at higher elevation since cultivated land is predominant at lower elevations 5 1 2 mg aquifer groundwater in the mg aquifer records 1 elevated ph and ec in comparison to the tmg groundwater ec values 478 μs cm 1 and ph values 5 6 2 lower 14c and 3h activities suggesting longer residence times and 3 extremely variable δ 13c values the variability in the δ 13c is to some extent mimicked by the other parameters and supports the division of groundwater from this aquifer system into two sub types before the confluence the 14c activity of the ca na cl mg groundwater ranges from 30 to 60 pmc fig 6 after the confluence the na cl mg groundwater has a higher 14c activity range from 65 to 73 pmc even though this location would theoretically be further along the flow path and thus should have lower 14c activities fig 6 thus the na cl mg groundwater after the confluence is inferred to be a mixed groundwater type this is clearly seen in the relationship between ca2 mg2 molar ratios with 14c activity where aging of the ca2 mg2 molar ratio driven by cation exchange reactions linked to clays present in the aquifer host rocks driving substitution of ca2 for equivalent na shows low ratios in young tmg groundwaters high ratios in older mg groundwaters and intermediate ca2 mg2 molar ratios and 14c activities for both the alluvial aquifer and the mixed na cl mg groundwater type fig 11 a 5 1 3 alluvial aquifer the alluvial aquifer groundwater records variable values for most parameters that fall between the mg groundwater and the tmg groundwater the exception to this is the fairly homogeneous δ 18o and δ 2h values fig 8 the 14c activity of groundwater in the alluvial aquifer is variable but generally more in line with that of the tmg groundwater borehole site bt18vl14 is located outside of the verlorenvlei catchment fig 6 and this low 14c activity indicates an older groundwater component of at least a few thousand years in the alluvial aquifer system see section 5 2 given that groundwater tritium values increase with increasing renewal rates the tritium values in this groundwater type 0 337 to 0 02 tu suggest that there is both a young and old groundwater component and this is likely what accounts for the spread of the data towards higher tritium values for a given 14c activity fig 10 this relationship may also be the result of carbonate dissolution but in the case of the samples from this catchment this does not appear to be related to dissolution of recent palaeocarbonates formed through weathering processes involving marine salt deposition for example such as has been documented in heuweltjie mounds elsewhere in the western cape midgley et al 2012 such processes typically show a consistent sr to ca ratio which correlates to the seawater sr to ca ratio this is not the case with these groundwater samples though as sr ca elemental ratios don t correlate with 14c activity fig 12 b implying that any modification of the 14c is not derived from a single carbonate source the alluvial aquifer groundwater is isotopically enriched in 18o in comparison to other groundwater in the catchment this is likely to be an evaporation signature as a result of secondary evaporation on precipitation falling in the lower catchment area in semi arid environments the isotopic composition of δ2h and δ18o in shallow groundwater can be significantly modified from that of local precipitation as a result of evaporative isotopic enrichment during infiltration into the vadose zone cortecci et al 2008 gonzález trinidad et al 2017 the lower deuterium excess values could indicate the recycling of source waters from surface water systems evaporation as well as variability of infiltration rates in the vadose zone koh et al 2012 this last point is likely to have been an important consideration given the recent severe drought conditions in the region which may have changed the soil surface properties resulting in reduced infiltration consistent with potential recharge modelling indicating very low recharge potential in the alluvial and mg aquifer systems watson et al 2018 irrigation return flows could also potentially be subject to evaporation generating a lower d excess value but irrigation return flow volumes are currently unconstrained and thus the effect on the bulk d excess signal cannot be evaluated moreover there is no change in the general hydrochemistry of the groundwater that would imply a component of return flow 5 2 calculation of residence times due to the fact that recharge is a continuous process and that the origin of water can be from several sources the residence time of groundwater typically describes a mean residence time or a range of time that has passed since a mixture of water from different ages entered the saturated zone strauch 2014 even assuming a borehole is screened into a single aquifer the groundwater in that aquifer may still be representative of various flow paths and this combined with dispersion and diffusion in an aquifer leads to groundwater mixing as a result a groundwater sample taken from any borehole is usually a mixture of groundwater with an age distribution that represents different parcels of water each with a different history and flow path cornaton and perrochet 2006 in order to estimate the transit time distribution for groundwater in the verlorenvlei catchment the residence time for each aquifer system was evaluated using radiocarbon and noble gas data for groundwater ages without any correction applied and assuming a simple piston flow system the residence time of groundwater can be calculated using equation 1 where 5730 is the 14c half life t½ 14c i is the initial activity of 14c in the system 14c m is the measured 14c activity in the groundwater and t is time 1 t t 1 2 ln 2 ln 14 c m 14 c i by convention 14cm is expressed relative to the 14ciactivity of wood from pre industrial times year 1895 and hence the ratio 14cm relative to 14ci is given as a single value in units of percent modern carbon the dilution of this ratio via the addition of 14c free carbon for example by carbonate dissolution can be calculated via several methods see review by cartwright et al 2017 han and wassenaar 2021 but generally introduces the parameter q which is a dilution factor such that equation 1 becomes 2 t t 1 2 ln 2 ln q 14 c m 14 c i one of the most common methods to calculate the value for q is via the pearson δ13c mixing model which uses δ13c to account for 14c dilution and assumes that any change in 14c in groundwater will also be reflected in 13c in groundwater given by δ 13 c dic ingerson and pearson 1964 this model assumes simple mixing between co2 from the soil δ 13 c soil and carbon derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals δ 13 c carbonate and calculates a value for q using equation 3 no other sources or sinks of carbon are taken into consideration 3 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c carbonate δ 13 c soil δ 13 c carbonate despite the geology in the verlorenvlei catchment being dominated by shales and sandstone the radiocarbon correction using equations 2 and 3 is not straightforward however comparison of 14c activities and δ 13c ratios suggests that potential end members are present fig 12 the tmg samples have the lowest δ 13c values indicative of c3 plants whilst 14c activity is highest at 95 pmc in contrast the mg groundwater samples have the lowest 14c activities 60 pmc whilst δ 13c values are amongst the highest and whilst they could be indicative of c4 plants they may also reflect dissolution of carbonate minerals in the host rocks although the small sample set analysed here makes accurate calculation of residence times difficult an indication of residence time range can be made by making some assumptions about the groundwater system for the tmg groundwater extremely limited δ 13c dic values suggests that δ 13c soil would have been 20 25 there is very little carbonate material in the tmg but assuming δ 13c carb values similar to carbonate lenses in the underlying malmesbury group formations with δ 13c carb 1 0 3 4 midgley et al 2012 harris unpublished data equations 2 and 3 suggests very little carbonate dissolution is affecting the tmg groundwater with residence times in the range of 200 1200 years at the other end of the spectrum δ 13c dic values for the ca na cl mg groundwater suggests either that δ 13c soil in that system was derived from equilibration with c4 plants or that there has been substantial dissolution through interaction with carbonate rocks natural vegetation in the study area is uniformly c3 vermonti 2022 with the dominant cultivated crops also considered to be c3 potato citrus and grape vines using the same δ 13c carb values as previously and equations 2 and 3 again q values for the ca na cl mg groundwater samples are in the range 0 5 0 8 assuming a starting δ 13c composition similar to the tmg and yields residence times in the range 5000 9000 years groundwater from the mg aquifer across the region typically has lower 14c activities irrespective of geographical proximity to the tmg aquifer harilall 2020 and this is consistent with hydrogeological interpretations pointing to the mg aquifer being an older groundwater system residence times for the alluvial and na cl mg groundwater system are difficult to estimate because of the wide range of δ 13c dic values that are recorded by these samples table 1 whilst it is possible that some of this variation may be the result of post collection modification of the sample δ 13c dic the na cl mg groundwater compositions typically fall between the compositions of the ca na cl mg groundwater and the tmg groundwater figs 9 and 10 suggesting that they represent mixtures of these two groundwater types this is supported by the hydrochemical results and aligns to the hydrological modelling as pointed out by cartwright et al 2017 and han and wassenaar 2021 because the relationship between the activity of a radioactive isotope tracer and the age derived from that tracer is non linear mean residence times are typically under estimated except in very old groundwater systems where the reverse is true this may well be the case for the na cl mg groundwater samples however additional constraints on the residence time of the tmg groundwater can be made through calculation of 3h 3he apparent ages from the noble gas data 3h 3he apparent ages have been calculated using equation 4 for three tmg groundwater samples in the upper catchment and two alluvial aquifer groundwater samples in the lower catchment table 2 a sixth sample from the mg aquifer was also analysed but had an extremely low r ra value of 0 1 and did not yield a 3h 3he apparent age this sample has the highest helium concentration 1 68 10 8 ccstp g with the lowest 3he 4he ratio indicating a significant crustal component of helium in equation 4 3hmeas represents the measured recent tritium concentration in groundwater while 3hetrit denotes the tritiogenic component of the dissolved 3he in the same groundwater sample 4 t 12 32 ln 2 ln 3 h meas 3 h e trit 3 h meas 5 3 h e meas 3 h e eq 3 h e ex 3 h e terr 3 h e trit in the dissolved phase 3he is present as four different components eq 5 these are 1 solubility equilibrium 3heeq 2 excess air 3heex 3 terrigenic 3heterr and 4 tritiogenic 3hetrit components such that 3hetrit 3hemeasured 3heeq 3heex 3heterr to calculate 3h 3he apparent ages the tritiogenic 3he component has to be isolated from the other components noble gas recharge temperatures as the solubility excess air and terrigenic components were calculated using the closed system equilibration gas water partitioning model of aeschbach hertig et al 2000 a 3he 4he ratio for the terrigenic component of 2 10 8 was assumed using the above methodology 3h 3he ages from 0 to 52 7 years were calculated with no clear differentiation between the tmg and alluvial aquifer systems table 2 sample bt18vl04 alluvial and bt18vl14 tmg provide ages of zero years indicating recent recharge however the age calculation is uncertain due to the elevated helium concentration sample bt18vl04 and the elevated excess air component the water of bt18vl04 might be older as can be seen from the higher helium content combined with a lower 3he 4he ratio more accurate apparent ages can be calculated for the other samples bt18vl15 16 19 ranging from 33 6 to 53 7 years a reliable 3h 3he age could not be calculated for the water in the mg aquifer since the high helium content of crustal origin swamps the tritiogenic component however the high helium concentration indicates that this water has a longer residence time in comparison to the tmg groundwater the calculated age using the noble gas data is equal to the age of the young groundwater component regardless of the proportions of each water mass in the mixture harvey et al 2006 therefore these ages must represent a minimum groundwater age with higher overall tritium activities for the tmg and alluvial aquifers confirming that those two aquifers are being actively recharged on the other hand radiocarbon ages of groundwater may be viewed as a maximum age due to the uncertainty in 14c dissolution from this it is apparent that both the tmg aquifer and the alluvial aquifer in the verlorenvlei are being actively recharged but the groundwater in the aquifers consists of both a younger and older groundwater component as a result of mixing along various flow paths similar arguments can be made for the groundwater in the mg aquifer system 5 3 groundwater mixing based on the hydrochemistry and the above residence time estimates two main mixing relationships have been identified for the first in both the tmg and alluvial aquifer systems the discrepancy between the 14c residence time and the 3h 3he residence time points to recent recharge mixing with groundwater that has already been in the aquifer on the order of decades to hundreds of years this mixing can be evaluated using a tracer abundance curve derived from a lumped parameter model lpm for this mixing relationship we envisage a situation where packets of recharge are continuously added along the flow path this is consistent with recent modelling of recharge indicating that although recharge in the valleys is typically low it nevertheless equates to approximately 1 5 of map or between 2 and 10 mm yr 1 watson et al 2018 watson et al 2020 in the second mixing relationship changes in hydrochemical character combined with residence time constraints point to mixing and thus interaction between different aquifer systems 5 3 1 mixing of young and old groundwaters to investigate the degree of mixing between younger and older groundwaters a lpm decay curve between 3h and 14c was computed to create a decay curve relationship for the region fig 10 the model was built using tracerlpm software jurgens et al 2012 and used a ratio of piston to exponential flow of f 0 6 using an exponential piston flow model epm which represents a typical unconfined to semiconfined aquifer system where q correction values are not yet considered morgenstern et al 2010 stewart 2012 zuber et al 2005 tritium activities of precipitation in the western cape region of south africa are typically between 1 and 2 tu with increasing tritium inland compared to coastal areas and lower activities in winter precipitation van rooyen et al 2021 the measured 3h and 14c activities in groundwater from the tmg aquifer showed the youngest ages with the highest proportion of younger water 40 80 while groundwater from the mg aquifer showed the lowest proportion of younger water 0 8 na cl groundwater samples from the mg aquifer that were predicted to have significant mixing of younger and older waters plot in the mixing region of the lpm curve and have a low proportion of younger water fig 10 suggesting that although modern recharge is occurring it is relatively low when compared to the tmg and alluvial systems 5 3 2 mixing between aquifer systems as has been described previously for the mg aquifer system there are two main groups of samples those before the confluence the ca na cl type bt18vl9 13 and those after the confluence the na cl type bt18vl6 8 fig 6 residence times are distinctly different between the two because of the higher 14c activity in samples after the confluence implying younger residence times and this is interpreted to be the result of mixing between groundwater from the mg aquifer system and either the tmg or the alluvial aquifer as opposed to mixing of different aged packets of water within one aquifer system it is worth noting that in this study the tmg was sampled from the piketberg mountains in the south of the catchment given the distance between this area and the location of the na cl mg samples below the confluence it seems unlikely that tmg groundwater from the piketberg mountains is contributing directly to the mixed groundwater composition however substantial outcrops of tmg occur to the north east of the confluence in the swartberge mountains fig 2 and sigidi 2018 used 87sr 86sr ratios to identify an important source of tmg groundwater entering into the groundwater system above the confluence from this part of the catchment this is also evident from the δ 13c of bt18vl08 which at 19 3 has more in common with the tmg groundwater than groundwater from the alluvial aquifer fig 6 furthermore a decrease in sr and ec in groundwater after the confluence is indicative of dilution the chemistry and residence time of the groundwater at borehole bt18vl08 is similar to that at sites bt18vl06 and 07 located after the confluence one interpretation of this is that the contribution of tmg groundwater from the bergvallei tributary that drains the swartberge mountains is significantly more volumetric than previously considered and hence represents an important unrecognized contributor to groundwater in the verlorenvlei 5 4 implications for groundwater sustainability although this study has focused on a fairly small catchment area the results contribute to the understanding of aquifer systems in the western cape as a whole groundwater throughout the western cape is generally sourced from either 1 similar tmg outcrops 2 underlying malmesbury group aquifers with fractured secondary porosity or 3 shallow alluvial primary porosity aquifers typically groundwater residence times in the tmg aquifer are the youngest due to the nature of the fracture system and the relatively high recharge rates miller et al 2017 diamond and harris 2019 groundwater from the alluvial system has the broadest mix of residence times with precipitation recharging the primary aquifer over wide areas albeit at low to very low rates watson et al 2018 the mg aquifer has the longest groundwater residence time and groundwater in this system increases in age away from the inferred dominant recharge region in verlorenvlei as is the nature of a confined aquifer system climate change models predict reduced precipitation along the west coast of south africa schultz 2011 pohl et al 2017 as groundwater in the tmg aquifer system has young residence times it will likely be impacted quickly by these changed precipitation patterns reduced recharge rates into the tmg aquifer in the verlorenvlei would have knock on impacts for recharge of both the mg and alluvial aquifers however the reduced precipitation across the west coast of southern africa may not change the recharge dynamics depending on how this recharge is received it is hypothesized that in semi arid environments the bulk of recharge is received by less frequent large precipitation events cuthbert et al 2019 similar scenarios are seen in verlorenvlei where large individual rainfall events are critical to overcoming interception and satisfying soil moisture storages in order to drive recharge watson et al 2019 nevertheless modelling of recharge suggests that smaller precipitation events are important for antecedent conditions limiting quickflow and facilitating percolation through the vadose zone if the tmg and mg aquifers are hydraulically connected as has been proposed by rainfall runoff modelling watson et al 2019 then abstraction from either the tmg or mg aquifer will have knock on effects to the other system although the clay layer acts as an impermeable barrier across much of the catchment these knock on effects would further impact the baseflow required to sustain the verlorenvlei estuarine lake system as this is largely supported by the tmg aquifer moreover agricultural diversions from the surface water system may also critically impact baseflow during low flow periods when baseflow is essential to maintain the vlei this was seen during the 2020 2021 dry season where baseflow was not enough to support the low flow ecological reserve requirements of the vlei leading to it drying out addressing these potential issues would require adaptation by farmers to different types of water saving initiatives and in extreme cases possible changes in crop types one critical finding from this study is the importance of combining modelling studies with hydrochemical characterization of the groundwater being modelled conceptual rainfall runoff models need a catchment boundary to be delineated where the boundary defines a system where each aquifer is assumed to behave in a similar way however the hydrochemical data and particularly the radio isotope data from the verlorenvlei catchment have highlighted where there are important changes in the way groundwater is being delivered to one part of an aquifer something that cannot easily be accounted for with regional modelling of recharge estimates this is the case with the mg aquifer system which clearly shows the added contribution of tmg groundwater into the mixed mg type below the confluence without hydrochemical and isotope data to identify this input any type of modelling in this part of the catchment would be biased towards an unrealistic model solution such a point has also been highlighted by watson et al 2021 where the size of the catchment or sub basin was critical for simulating regionally representative proportions of surface runoff interflow and baseflow 6 conclusions this study has shown that a distinction can be made between the groundwater in the tmg alluvial and mg aquifers in the verlorenvlei catchment using hydrochemistry and groundwater residence times the variation in hydrochemistry and groundwater residence time between the aquifer systems indicates that the groundwater chemistry is the result of both extended water rock interactions as well as mixing between older and younger waters this has been demonstrated through discrepancies between the residence times calculated from radiocarbon and 3h 3he and applies to groundwater in the tmg and alluvial aquifer systems residence times in the mg aquifer from this study along with hydrochemical relationships indicated by watson et al 2020 have shown that this aquifer system is linked via recharge pathways to the tmg aquifer in the upper part of the catchment but that after the confluence of the main tributaries into the verloren river there is direct mixing with a younger groundwater component leading to modified radiocarbon ages orographic rainfall leads to groundwater recharge in the tmg aquifer mist may also contribute to recharge in the alluvial aquifer system but this remains unquantified at the current point in time young residence times of groundwater in the tmg and alluvial aquifer imply that this aquifer system is most susceptible to reduced groundwater recharge with climate change predictions indicating reduced rainfall volumes and future drought conditions along south africa s west coast reduced renewal rates are likely to be exacerbated by the possible rise in dependence on groundwater leading to increased withdrawal rates to supply water for domestic and agricultural activity along the west coast future residence time studies should consider calculating the age distribution of groundwater in the three aquifer systems in the verlorenvlei catchment quantifying the mean length of time of groundwater in each aquifer would provide further insight into the sustainability of the groundwater systems credit authorship contribution statement j a miller
