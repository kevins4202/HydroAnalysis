6695,spatially representative estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks are needed for simulating catchment scale surface runoff and infiltration classical methods for measuring ks are time consuming so sampling campaigns need to be designed economically important insights can be obtained by experiments directed to understand the controls of ks in an agricultural setting and identify the minimum number of samples required for estimating representative plot scale ks in this study a total of 131 double ring infiltrometer measurements were made on 12 plots in a small austrian catchment a statistical analysis of ks across the catchment suggests ks to be only slightly influenced by physical and topographical soil characteristics while land use is the main control the highest values of ks were observed in arable fields with a median of about 3 times and a coefficient of variation cv of about 75 of those in grassland areas an uncertainty analysis aimed at determining the minimum number of ks measurements necessary for estimating the geometric mean of ks over a given area with a specified accuracy suggests that beyond a specific and plot size dependent number of measurements the benefit of any extra measurement is small the confidence interval of the geometric mean of ks decreases with the number of measurements and increases with the size of the plot sampled applications of these findings for designing field campaigns are discussed keywords saturated hydraulic conductivity local measurements spatial variability plot scale estimate 1 introduction the hydraulic conductivity of saturated soils ks is a key parameter controlling various hydrological processes including rainfall partitioning into infiltration and surface runoff accurate estimates of ks are needed for modeling local infiltration into homogeneous parlange et al 1982 and layered soils govindaraju et al 2012 as well as for upscaling infiltration models smith and goodrich 2000 corradini et al 2011 saturated hydraulic conductivity is highly variable in space due to soil structure dexter et al 2004 texture saxton et al 1986 jabro 1992 landscape position mohanty et al 1994 and land cover and management practices alletto and coquet 2009 bonell et al 2010 it also depends on scale sobieraj et al 2004 lai and ren 2007 saturated hydraulic conductivity typically varies even more than two orders of magnitude in space baiamonte et al 2017 performed 150 infiltration measurements in a sicilian basin and observed values of ks that ranged from less than 1 mm h 1 to more than 8000 mm h 1 papanicolaou et al 2015 conducted about 120 infiltration experiments on three hillslopes with different agricultural management practices in iowa and observed ks values that ranged from 0 15 mm h 1 to 360 mm h 1 similarly loague and gander 1990 carried out 157 infiltration measurements in a small rangeland catchment of area 0 1 km2 r 5 oklahoma and obtained values of k s approximately variable by two orders of magnitude in space furthermore sharma et al 1987 performed infiltration experiments in two lateritic australian catchments 0 94 km2 and 0 81 km2 and found ks values in the range 8 33 946 mm h 1 and 237 1646 mm h 1 respectively woolhiser et al 1996 found that runoff hydrographs were strongly affected by variations in saturated hydraulic conductivity at the hillslope scale especially for small runoff events taskinen et al 2008 investigated the effects of spatial variability of ks on overland flow in a small agricultural catchment by analyzing 2000 synthetic rainfall runoff events generated from observed rainfall events with runoff modelled using different spatially variable ks fields they found the greatest differences in the first flow peak and in the rising part of the hydrograph hu et al 2015 analyzed the effects of ks variability on runoff simulations in a small watershed on the chinese loess plateau and found that total and peak discharges were underestimated if the spatial variability of ks was completely ignored or only partially considered assouline and mualem 2002 examined the effects of the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties combined with the formation of a sealing layer at the soil surface they deduced that the hydrological response of arid and semiarid catchments is dominated by these effects assouline and mualem 2006 showed that infiltration into crusted soils experiences substantial changes for the presence of ks spatial heterogeneity particularly for loam soils accounting for ks spatial variability is therefore essential in addition to undisturbed soil core sampling several experimental techniques are available for estimating ks through in situ infiltration measurements the most commonly used devices are tension permeameters e g the csiro disc permeameter perroux and white 1988 single ring infiltrometers lassabatère et al 2006 bagarello et al 2004 2014a ahmed et al 2014 double ring infiltrometers swartzendruber and olson 1961 constant head well permeameters e g the guelph permeameter reynolds and erlick 1985 and rainfall simulators e g the guelph rainfall simulator tossell et al 1987 the device choice conditions the estimated values of ks verbist et al 2013 bagarello et al 2014a due to different factors reynolds et al 2000 such as size of investigated soil sample collection procedure flow geometry and estimate of other soil parameters e g soil sorptivity saturated water content necessary to derive the value of ks applying specific data analysis procedures widely used techniques to determine ks such as the traditional well permeameter and ring infiltrometer rely on the attainment of a steady state flow rate so that the time required to carry out each measurement is usually high other techniques do not require to achieve steady conditions bagarello et al 2004 2014b but in any case their use at the catchment scale represents a challenge speeding up the measurement operations with the purpose of achieving detailed ks maps over large areas is therefore one of the greatest issues to be addressed in spatial infiltration studies pedotransfer functions which estimate ks from more easily measurable soil physical properties bouma 1989 and statistical approaches to extrapolate ks from a small number of measurements to the entire catchment are some of the approaches adopted to reduce the time demand of extensive field measurement campaigns however macropores and other preferential flow paths often dominate the infiltration behavior even more than the characteristics of the soil matrix as quantified by porosity texture etc so it is usually advantageous not to rely only on pedotransfer functions from the literature but to perform at least a few ks measurements in the catchment of interest bouma et al 2011 regarding the number of measurements required vieira et al 1981 studied the spatial variability of 1280 field measured infiltration rates using geostatistical concepts they argued that 128 samples were sufficient to obtain nearly the same information as obtained from 1280 samples ahmed et al 2015 conducted an uncertainty analysis on 722 infiltration measurements in six roadside drainage ditches grassy swales i e shallow open vegetated roadside drainage channels designed to convey stormwater runoff to storm sewers or water receiving bodies and concluded that approximately twenty infiltration measurements were the minimum number to obtain a representative geometric mean of ks of a swale that was less than 350 m long with an acceptable level of uncertainty the identified minimum number was related to the width of the 95 confidence interval that in logscale was about equal to 2 skøien and blöschl 2006 found that the required number of samples depends on the spatial correlation of ks as well as on the measurement setup they investigated the effect of spacing average distance between samples extent size of the domain sampled and support averaging area of one sample i e the scale triplet as termed by blöschl and sivapalan 1995 on the estimates of mean spatial variance and complete range of a variable in a landscape for each of the chosen combinations of spacing support and extent they generated 1000 synthetic random fields and sampled from them according to the selected scale triplet in what they termed single realization case they compared the sample mean and sample variance with the mean and variance of the entire random field of the same realization they found that the estimation uncertainty of the mean increases when the spacing increases for a given number of samples small extents relative to the underlying correlation length imply that the samples are highly correlated and the underlying distribution can be well characterized from a limited number of samples skøien and blöschl 2006 used numerically generated random fields and actual observations of ks may differ in terms of their sampling characteristics also by identifying the controls on ks areal estimates can be improved over random sampling either by stratified sampling or by making use of pedotransfer functions the main objective of this paper is to identify the main elements that control the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in an agricultural setting and on this basis to define the minimum number of samples needed for estimating a value of ks representative at the plot scale this is a crucial element to obtain the first of the two moments of the ks probability density function required to apply areal infiltration modeling flammini et al 2018 the results of ks measurement campaigns performed in a small catchment in austria with double ring infiltrometers dris are used the choice of this equipment was made on the basis of a few practical considerations later specified and mainly of the outcomes earlier obtained by morbidelli et al 2017 in laboratory experiments finalized to compare a double ring infiltrometer a tension permeameter and a constant head well permeameter using controlled rainfall runoff experiments as a benchmark measurements collected in both grasslands and arable lands are selected to deduce the effects of different land management operations on the ks spatial variability a statistical analysis is performed to understand the confidence in the estimate of the areal average value of ks for different land uses plot areas and sample sizes based on this analysis guidance is given for planning measurement campaigns with double ring infiltrometers when time and resources are limited 2 materials 2 1 study area the study area is the hydrological open air laboratory hoal catchment located in petzenkirchen in the western part of lower austria the basin has an area of 0 66 km2 the elevation ranges from 268 to 323 m a s l with a mean slope of 8 landcover consists of arable land 87 pasture 5 forested area with grassland and high stemmed vegetation of low density 6 and paved surfaces 2 blöschl et al 2016 in this study pasture and forested area are collectively denoted as grassland areas because the forested area is really characterized by grassland and not by brushwood as a result of the patchy type of land use that takes place in the catchment the climate is humid with a mean annual temperature of 9 5 c and a mean annual precipitation of 823 mm yr 1 from 1990 to 2014 a soil survey campaign of 300 cores sampled on a 50 50 m grid provided information about organic matter content om clay cl silt si and sand sa percentages at multiple depths according to the usda soil classification the topsoil in the catchment consists of silt loam 75 of the area silty clay loam 20 and silt 5 a high resolution digital terrain model dtm was used to derive elevation el and local slope angles s across the catchment winter wheat winter barley maize rapeseed and soy are the main types of crop cultivated in the catchment crop rotation is associated with green manure in order to ensure natural fertilization of the soil however nitrogen fertilizers and natural fertilizers e g pig manure are also applied before sowing as well as plant protection agents such as plant growth regulators fungicides and broad spectrum insecticides the harvest of the winter crops usually occurs in july allowing the access to the cultivated areas for infiltration measurements until the late august september when field preparation for tillage and seedbed is made 2 2 soil data collection a total of 131 locations on 12 different plots were chosen to sample ks of the soil surface of the hoal catchment fig 1 the measurements were performed with the objective of evenly exploring the grassland areas specifically those without high stemmed vegetation and the areas devoted to agricultural practices depending on the time required to perform a local experiment by the selected procedure described below the measurements in each plot were carried out in a narrow period up to 3 days for the larger plot the measurements in the whole grassland areas were substantially completed in the period march 15 april 7 while in the cultivated areas due to restricted access during the crop growing season and tillage operations the experimental campaign was made in the period between harvest and tillage in the last period between july 20 and september 20 it was possible to investigate different plots at the same condition with respect to agricultural practices even though at different times in any case because of the absence of bare soils subjected to significant temporal changes of ks due to crust formation and disruption the lack of measurements contemporaneity should not have significantly affected the main features of the ks spatial heterogeneity field among the available measurement techniques dris were considered to be appropriate because of the ease of installation and robustness in natural environments where tall grass surface slope or strong wind may preclude the usage of other more sensitive devices due to the equipment low cost simultaneous use up to four instruments was possible to speed up the experiments the technique consists of pushing two concentric steel rings of diameters 0 3 m and 0 6 m about 10 cm into the ground and pouring water inside them until the water level equalizes in the two rings the reduction of the inner ring water level due to infiltration is recorded at regular time steps and the measurement ends when infiltration steady state is obtained in our measurements the latter was considered to occur when an infiltration rate invariant in the last hour was detected the saturated hydraulic conductivity was assumed equal to the last value of infiltration rate typically observed with a ponded depth of water of about one centimeter morbidelli et al 2017 showed that dris tended to overestimate the areal average value of ks as compared to controlled rainfall runoff experiments they also found that when samples were taken with dri in a highly controlled laboratory system characterized by a soil with homogeneous grain size distribution and bare surface the observed values did not significantly change over the repetitions performed in adjacent places this finding highlights that dris allow reliable estimates of ks in terms of repeatability but they are biased compared to the benchmark value in any case considering the measurement repeatability it is expected that the observed bias does not significantly affect the spatial variability analysis of ks even though the possible existence of a bias dependent on the correct ks values cannot be ruled out on the other hand the magnitude of the bias is still an open issue for any available device because of the difficulties related to the identification of an indisputable true reference value of ks on each plot ks measurements were performed with a spatial resolution of 3 m the duration of each run was typically of 3 4 h fig 2 highlights examples of the different environmental conditions present on the plots fig 2a shows the largest plot plot 2 which consists of grassy land and is located close to the forested area with grassland fig 2b represents plot 5 showing the winter wheat stubbles that remains in the field after the harvest and fig 2c shows plots 11 and 12 both located in a naturally vegetated orchard in the choice of the measurement locations slope represented a crucial factor according to philip 1991 in the initial stage of the infiltration process when the capillary forces play a leading role the infiltration rate does not depend on the surface inclination but after a long time when only gravitational forces drive the process the infiltration rate is reduced by the cosine of the slope angle however experimental evidence does not always support this theoretical formulation essig et al 2009 morbidelli et al 2015 in any case it is widely recognized that slope affects the infiltration process in this light to reduce the slope effects morbidelli et al 2016 measurements were only performed at locations with surface slope angles generally less than 10 and in the absence of bare soils at the locations where the infiltration measurements were performed soil textural composition and organic matter content were inferred from the survey data available on the 50 50 m grid in addition slope and elevation across the catchment were obtained from the dtm the physical and topographical soil characteristics displayed in table 1 show little spatial variation between the measurement locations the maximum coefficient of variation cv observed for textural composition and organic matter content is about 15 consistent with the usda soil classification of the catchment according to which only two main soil types are identified in the basin 95 of the topsoil is either silt loam or silty clay loam only the surface slope angle exhibits a significant variation with a cv of about 30 3 method 3 1 statistical analysis and controls on saturated hydraulic conductivity the anova method armstrong et al 2000 has been selected for the analysis of variance of the experimental data associated to the different plots to understand whether the variability of k s across the catchment is linked to specific soil physical characteristics of the measurement locations an application of this method requires that specific assumptions on the experimental data are satisfied in general terms the results obtained for the study variable are subdivided into j groups and the ith observed value i 1 i of a given group j j 1 j can be expressed as a sum of the mean of all the available measurements μ the group effect τ j representing the deviation of the group mean μ j from μ and a random element ε i j reflecting the combined effects of measurement errors and natural variation through observations the basic assumptions involved in the anova method concern the random elements that should be normally distributed with the same variance in all groups while the means μ j can be variable from group to group the available ks data do not satisfy these two conditions while log transformed values of ks have been found appropriate for the anova method application see also snedecor and cochran 1980 the following procedure has been therefore used the entire data set has been divided into j groups and a single transformed observation ln k s i j has been expressed as 1 ln k s i j μ τ j ε i j μ j ε i j j 1 j and i 1 i with τ j μ j μ and with the quantities μ j and ε i j computed on the transformed data set on this basis to highlight a possible absence of group effect the null hypothesis of equality of the j values of the mean has been tested starting from the quantity s s t defined as 2 s s t i j ln k s i j μ 2 that can be rewritten as 3 s s t s s w s s b i j ln k s i j μ j 2 j n j μ j μ 2 where s s w is associated to the variation within each group s s b to the variation between each group and the catchment and n j is the number of observations in each group the sample variance σ t 2 the within variance σ w 2 and the between variance σ b 2 have been then estimated by dividing each term of eq 3 by the corresponding degree of freedom 4 σ t 2 s s t d f t s s t i 1 5 σ w 2 s s w d f w s s w i j 6 σ b 2 s s b d f b s s b j 1 and the variance ratio f has been computed as 7 f j 1 i j σ b 2 σ w 2 for testing the null hypothesis f has been compared to the critical value f c r i t d f b d f w obtained from an f distribution snedecor and cochran 1980 with d f w and d f b degrees of freedom with a significance level of 5 if f is greater than the critical value the null hypothesis of zero group effect has to be rejected and at least one of the μ j values is significantly different from the grand mean the above approach has been applied to different group ensembles 1 ensemble obtained considering the plot locations as sources of variation to understand whether k s variability is substantially linked to the specific physical and topographical characteristics of the measurement areas 2 ensemble identified grouping areas with the same land use considered because the outcomes of step 1 suggested a significant dependency of k s variability on the plot location 3 ensembles of plots characterized by the same land use to understand if a other plot specific properties had a significant influence or b the observations could be considered as different sets sampled from the same population even though collected at different locations in the catchment 3 2 uncertainty analysis and minimum number of samples needed an analysis has been performed with the aim of determining the uncertainty related to the estimate of an average ks value for a specific area the ks geometric mean k s has been chosen as the representative estimator of the areal average saturated hydraulic conductivity obviously the higher the number of measurements used to estimate the geometric mean of ks the higher is the confidence that the estimate is representative of the true value of k s for the considered area however since the measurements are very time consuming understanding whether it is possible to reduce the number of measurements and still obtain a reliable average would enormously improve the planning of measurement campaigns with reduced realization times a well founded uncertainty analysis based on the use of the confidence intervals has been carried out it is rather similar to that used by ahmed et al 2015 with changes directed to improve the interpretation of results the plots 2 11 12 and 7 have been selected because they exhibited the same sampling density about 1 measurement every 10 m2 the same land cover grass but different number of observation points i e 40 20 and 9 respectively for each data set the non parametric bootstrap method carpenter and bithell 2000 has been used to estimate confidence intervals around the geometric mean for different numbers of samples the method is particularly helpful whenever confidence intervals must be calculated for small data sets as in the case of plot 7 where only 9 measurements are available as suggested by carpenter and bithell 2000 information about the value of a population parameter e g the mean μ can be obtained by drawing a random sample y from that population and constructing an estimate μ y of the value of μ from that sample the bootstrap principle is adopted to achieve information about the relationship between μ and μ y by looking at the relationship between μ y o b s and μ y where y is a resample characterized by the sample of the observations y o b s because the method involves a resampling step which can be done assuming a specific distribution for the parameter and sampling from it i e parametric bootstrap or without assuming any distribution for the parameter and sampling with replacement i e non parametric bootstrap it is often used for small data sets in implementing the bootstrap method the observations have been assumed independent sampling has been done with replacement and the process has been repeated 1000 times as suggested for the 95 confidence interval by carpenter and bithell 2000 from each sub sample the geometric mean has been estimated a set of 1000 geometric mean values has been obtained and the 95 confidence interval has been derived by calculating the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles the procedure has been repeated changing the number of observations n for each plot the trend of the confidence interval has been derived varying the number of observations n from 2 to the maximum number of data available the three trends obtained have been then normalized by the geometric mean of k s of each plot to facilitate visual comparisons a further analysis has been performed using plot 2 to determine for different plot areas the minimum number of measurements requested to derive k s this plot was the one with the largest data set six sub areas of 55 110 165 215 280 and 345 m2 have been considered with larger sub areas always containing all the smaller ones in each sub area 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 measurements have been drawn and the 95 confidence intervals have been estimated as above specified for a total of 36 combinations area sample number finally the widths a 95 of the confidence intervals calculated as the difference between the 97 5 and 2 5 percentiles have been plotted against area for different sample numbers the curves describe how the confidence in the estimation of k s decreases when an equal number of measurements are performed on plots of increasing dimensions or how many samples are needed to obtain a given accuracy 4 results and discussion 4 1 controls on the spatial variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 3 suggests that soil physical characteristics do not have a direct effect on k s variability a wider ks variation range seems to be related to lower om fig 3a higher si fig 3c or lower sa fig 3d however this may be caused by the variation of the physical characteristics with land use rather than by a direct dependency of k s on texture most likely considering that arable areas are characterized by lower percentages of om and sa and higher percentage of si the corresponding wider variation range could be an expression of the treatment effect due to land use investigated later instead of a reflection of changes in soil textural composition the weak relationship between ks and soil textural composition is in contrast with experimental evidence of a strong connection between ks and particle size distribution rahmati et al 2018 and is likely related to the small variation of soil characteristics in the catchment on the other hand ks is somewhat dependent on the slope angle fig 3e in particular higher values of ks were observed at close to horizontal areas while the ks range decreases with increasing slope angle s the relationship between slope angles and the textural components is shown in fig 4 no clear dependency of s on any of the considered soil characteristics can be detected therefore the influence of s on ks is not related to changing soil attributes with slope but could be due to variations in soil properties not captured by texture in this context differences in soil packing and presence of macropores both influenced by random components that cannot be objectively quantified should have generally a major role and explain also the k s heterogeneity within each plot on the other hand it is not expected that the significant decrease of ks with increasing s highlighted by morbidelli et al 2015 2016 under conditions of surface water moving downslope can be deduced by measurements of ks performed with classical devices in the absence of overland flow notwithstanding the limited spatial variation of the physical and topographical soil attributes saturated hydraulic conductivity varies substantially with values ranging over two orders of magnitude from a minimum of 1 mm h 1 to a maximum of 130 mm h 1 table 2 the high spatial variability of ks is a well known characteristic of this parameter regardless of the measurement technique applied the geographical location the land use or the soil type baiamonte et al 2017 papanicolaou et al 2015 therefore this parameter is considered as a random variable depending also on random factors that cannot be quantified table 2 further shows the differences in the ks variability between arable and grassy plots the ks minimum and maximum observed in arable lands are significantly larger than those obtained in grassy plots with values increased more than 50 this result can be explained by the fact that after the harvest i e the condition in which the infiltration measurements were performed the whole root system of winter crops including stubbles was present therefore the presence of the root system typically very deep see f i thorup kristensen et al 2009 for winter wheat allowed the establishment of a preferential flow regime more efficient than that of grassy soils where the maximum depth of the root system was much lower with values of a few tens of centimeters see also brown et al 2010 morbidelli et al 2014 in addition the behavior of the arable lands is justified by the regular mixing loosening of the plough layer that takes place twice a year either through ploughing or chiseling with the result that the pore size distribution can be characterized by more medium pores and less fine pores than grassland on the other hand the grassy plots do not exhibit a plough layer but distinct hydromorphic features more or less close to the surface the uniform distribution of the root system that remains in the field coupled with the periodic land management of the investigated soils is also responsible for a more homogeneous distribution of k s across the area the lower variability is reflected by the coefficient of variation that in the arable fields assumes values reduced of about 25 with respect to those associated to the grassland areas land management operations repeated season after season such as tillage or plowing in addition to a uniform land cover of crops having the same growing period and therefore similar depths of the root system appear to reduce spatial variations due to different plant varieties and soil transformation mechanisms affecting the land surface e g soil compaction crust formation or soil swelling a site by site examination reveals very similar minima of saturated hydraulic conductivity on almost every plot table 3 on the other hand the maxima vary greatly between different plots on each plot the coefficient of variation assumes values c v 0 5 that closely reflect the value associated to the entire catchment this indicates that the high ks spatial variability is still traceable when the observation plots are individually considered more information about plot differences and similarities is provided by fig 5 which shows the boxplots of ks on each measurement plot as mentioned before the minima vary little between plots while the maxima vary a lot there are differences related to land use the first quartile in grassy fields except plot 7 is less than or equal to the minima observed on arable plots 5 and 8 indicating that at least 25 of the ks values observed in natural conditions is lower than the minimum values observed when agricultural practices become operative moreover about 50 of the ks values observed on arable plots 5 and 8 are greater than the maximum values excluding values that seem to be possible outliers even if for all the analyses they have been considered because included in the ks observed range measured on grassy plots 1 2 3 6 7 and 9 due to the fact that the median is greater than or equal to the maximum of each mentioned grassy plot the boxplot analysis highlights a significant variability among the different measurement plots but it does not clarify if the detected variation is caused by specific physical and topographical characteristics by different land uses or simply by the random nature of saturated hydraulic conductivity in order to understand whether the variability of ks across the catchment is more related to the random nature of the parameter than to the measurement location or vice versa an analysis of the variance has been carried out the first step of the analysis has been therefore aimed at determining whether the plot characteristics have a significant influence on k s spatial variability the whole set of measurements has been divided into j 12 groups representing the twelve measurement plots table 4 a shows the results of the analysis of variance which has been carried out on the log transformed data the anova assumptions of normally distributed residuals and homoscedasticity have been tested with the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 and the breusch pagan test breusch and pagan 1979 respectively the variance between different plots σ b 2 4 1 is almost three times higher than the variance within each plot σ w 2 1 3 this means that the largest share of variability is traceable to the physical topographical and land cover differences between the plots an additional evidence resides in the fact that the value of f equal to 3 1 is greater than the critical value of 1 9 and therefore the null hypothesis of absence of treatment effect i e the effect of plot location in the present case must be rejected in the interest of further analyzing the origin of the treatment effect the main variability source represented by the land use has been considered the whole set of k s observations has been divided into arable and grassland areas j 2 regardless of the specific type of crop cultivated in the field and the type of natural vegetation table 4b shows the anova results when land use is considered as source of variability the variance associated with the measurement error and the random nature of k s i e σ w 2 is 1 4 and is thus almost negligible compared to σ b 2 23 7 indicating that land use is most likely the main driver for the observed k s variations across the catchment the value of the f ratio of 17 2 is much larger than the critical f of 3 9 associated with a significance level of 5 indicating that the group effect is not negligible and the means of the two groups are significantly different from each other finally since both land use and measurement plot location are responsible for a non negligible treatment or group effect it is interesting to understand if both factors cause saturated hydraulic conductivity to vary in space or rather if the two are related with each other and ks spatial variability is actually due to only one of them in other words we want to understand if ks varies with plot location because of different physical and topographical soil characteristics specific of each plot or only because every plot exhibits a different land use to this end the whole sample of ks observations has been split into two sub samples the first one consisting of measurements performed in grassland areas and the second of measurements performed in arable areas and within each sub sample an analysis of variance has been carried out considering as source of variation the plot location results of the analyses are shown in table 4c and d in both cases variances associated with treatment between and error within have approximately the same values and the f ratio is always lower than the critical value these results indicate that plot location does not explain the spatial variability and that measurements on different plots with the same land use can be considered as sampled from the same population because the null hypothesis of equality of each group mean to the grand mean cannot be rejected the great influence of land use on the observed ks variability is evident when two probability density functions pdfs of ks are associated to observations divided into the two sub samples previously defined saturated hydraulic conductivity that is usually assumed as log normally distributed sharma et al 1987 dagan and bresler 1983 is characterized by the pdfs of both grassy and arable fields which tend to be bimodal but can be in any case well approximated by log normal distributions as tested with the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 on the log transformed data in addition as shown in fig 6 they exhibit different shapes in arable fields the pdf is flatter the peak is lower and less pronounced the variation range is larger and the median is 34 5 mm h 1 as compared to 12 mm h 1 in grassy fields table 2 this means that agricultural practices and a homogeneous land cover influence the random nature of saturated hydraulic conductivity which still varies randomly inside each group clearly land use strongly influences ks in agricultural settings and data collected in arable and grassland areas should not be considered as deriving from the same population 4 2 minimum number of samples for estimating areal average saturated hydraulic conductivity the uncertainty analysis aimed at determining the minimum number of samples required for estimating a reliable ks geometric mean k s for a specific area has been carried out using the data from plots 2 11 12 and 7 these plots had the same land use different areas about 500 m2 200 m2 and 80 m2 respectively and different number of total observations however considering that the measurements were performed with the same spatial resolution the plots approximately had the same measurement density about 1 observation per 10 m2 fig 7 shows the 95 confidence interval of k s normalized by its geometric mean of the specific plots for a specific number of measurements n the plot with smaller area results in a narrower normalized confidence interval for example for n 6 the width of plot 7 normalized confidence interval of 1 2 is much narrower than those of plots 2 and 11 12 2 2 and 2 0 respectively although the normalization influences the width of the confidence interval because of the different values of the geometric mean of the three plots table 3 it does not affect the results in terms of the reliability exhibited by the same value of n with changing areas specifically for n 6 the widths of the confidence intervals without normalization by the geometric mean have different trends 29 7 34 8 and 21 3 mm h 1 for plots 7 11 12 and 2 respectively but the corresponding average relative errors of the geometric means of the three plots 62 107 and 117 respectively confirm a higher reliability of the geometric mean estimates for smaller areas these outcomes are likely related to the lower variability captured in grassy fields when a smaller area is sampled while in larger areas local soil heterogeneities e g macropores wormholes cracks local slope have a higher chance to be encountered furthermore the differences appear to be fairly limited if plots 11 12 and 2 are compared in terms of both the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval fig 7 and the average relative errors this suggests that beyond a certain extent all the local soil heterogeneities characterizing the plot are captured this study does not involve a specific analysis of spatial correlations because of the relatively low number of samples on the smaller plots the hypothesis of independent observations upon which the bootstrap method is based was adopted following ahmed et al 2015 based on the hypothesis of independent data the confidence interval of plot 2 characterized by a sample statistically significant for the analysis of the frequency distribution has been also computed adopting a gaussian distribution for the log transformed k s data its trend is shown in fig 8 together with that provided by the non parametric bootstrap method applied to log transformed k s data as expected no significant differences can be observed fig 9 shows the reduction of the confidence interval with increasing the number of measurements for the three plots the reduction has been obtained as the difference between the width of the non normalized confidence interval associated with n measurements and the width associated with n 1 measurements on each plot the reduction is large for small n for example if 4 measurements are used to calculate the confidence interval instead of 3 the width of the confidence interval decreases by 5 7 and 4 3 mm h 1 for plots 2 11 12 and 7 respectively on the other hand as n increases the reduction decreases and tends asymptotically towards zero this is particularly evident from the interpolated curve of plot 2 even though the same behavior is detected for plots 11 12 and 7 from this it can be deduced that the benefit in terms of width reduction gained by performing one extra measurement on each plot is high for small n and decreases with plot extent up to a point specific for each plot where the average reduction rate becomes almost constant i e the interpolated curve becomes horizontal therefore the n associated with this point can be considered as the minimum number of measurements necessary to enter the zone where the confidence interval is stable for example the interpolated curve of plot 2 is almost constant for n greater than 12 suggesting that the reduction of the confidence interval width for more than 12 measurements is negligible a further remark concerns the possible influence of spatial correlations on the analysis the presence of spatial correlations would have the effect of reducing the width of the confidence interval for a specific n as compared to uncorrelated data single realization case of skøien and blöschl 2006 the same confidence in the estimates of the geometric mean would be therefore achieved with a smaller number of observations consequently the minimum number of measurements would depend on the spatial correlation structure of the investigated plot which would make the application of our results to other areas difficult on the other hand the assumption of independent data allows to transfer the results regardless of the plot correlation structure even though they may represent an upper limit of the density of required measurements if correlations are present in order to gain insight into the relationship between grassy and arable fields in terms of accuracy in the k s estimation the same uncertainty analysis has been carried out on plots 5 and 7 which possess the same number of observations the same area but different land use fig 10 shows that the confidence intervals for the grassland areas are wider than for the arable areas independently of the number of measurements n used for the derivation which is due to the larger variability of ks highlighted in the spatial analysis of section 4 1 for the grassland areas this result justifies the choice of focusing the consecutive analysis only on grassy fields because for the same plot size the minimum number of measurements derived for natural conditions always ensures a greater accuracy in arable environments in planning a field campaign one must decide the number and the location of the measurements in relation to the time required to collect a single observation and the time available the second step of the uncertainty analysis is aimed at assisting in this choice in order to be able to compare the combined effect of plot size and number of measurements on the accuracy of the final areal estimation of k s six sub plots have been derived from plot 2 in an attempt to avoid effects of temporal variation of ks on the investigated spatial variability ideally the only distinguishing aspects of the sub plots are size and total number of measurements available for each sub plot the 95 confidence intervals of k s normalized by the geometric mean of the specific sub plot has been generated through the non parametric bootstrap method the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval a 95 obtained with a specific number of measurements n as a function of the plot size is shown in fig 11 on a plot of specific dimensions a better estimate of the average saturated hydraulic conductivity can be achieved by increasing the number of measurements in the area in accordance with the findings of skøien and blöschl 2006 for example if a plot of 165 m2 is sampled at 5 locations the width of the confidence interval is about twice the average ks but if 8 measurements are made on the same plot the width is halved slightly less than 1 k s i e the reliability associated with the k s estimation is almost doubled on the other hand when the same number of samples is taken in increasing areas the width of the confidence interval increases as well indicating how the samples progressively lose the ability of representing the true value of k s if 7 measurements are performed over an area of 110 m2 the width of the confidence interval is 1 1 k s but the uncertainty almost doubles whenever the same number of samples is taken on a plot of 345 m2 a 95 2 1 k s as mentioned before the confidence intervals are obtained with the non parametric bootstrap method which is based on the hypothesis of independent data although the increase in uncertainty with increasing areas could be partially due to a progressive decorrelation this is not the case because in the derivation of the confidence intervals spatial correlations are not considered one possible explanation may be the increased likelihood of encountering soil local heterogeneities in larger areas additionally if one considers a sub area of plot 2 of 120 m2 the contained measured k s are characterized by a variance of about 170 mm2 h 2 when the sub area is extended up to 300 m2 the variance increases as well and it is equal to 350 mm2 h 2 finally if the sub area is further extended up to 450 m2 the variance reaches the value of 410 mm2 h 2 and for greater areas the variance value fluctuates in the range 350 400 mm2 h 2 this trend confirms that when the sampled area increases more variability is encountered and therefore the uncertainty on the estimation of the ks geometric mean value increases as well fig 11 is also useful to derive a minimum number of samples that have to be taken in an area of specific dimensions for a tradeoff between accuracy or uncertainty and time required for the measurements selection of the accuracy level should consider the typical k s value of the study since the average error is relative to it for example if a 95 is assumed equal to 1 5 for a silty loam soil for which a typical ks value of about 1 6 mm h 1 is expected corradini et al 1997 the estimated value of k s can vary on average between 0 4 and 2 8 mm h 1 however if the same width is chosen for a sandy loam soil for which a typical ks value of about 25 mm h 1 is expected corradini et al 1997 the estimated value of k s will vary on average between 6 25 and 43 75 mm h 1 furthermore the level of accuracy should be selected in relation to the final purpose of the measurement campaign for instance if the peak discharge of a stream has to be estimated by a rainfall runoff model for designing a weir system along the stream the required accuracy of k s could be inferred from the required accuracy of the flood estimate by error propagation the accuracy level suggested by ahmed et al 2015 varies in the range of 1 8 2 2 when the reference value is taken as 1 8 fig 11 suggests that for a plot of 110 m2 at least 5 measurements are needed to obtain a width of the normalized 95 confidence interval equal to or smaller than the reference value similarly on a plot of 280 m2 at least 8 samples should be taken in order to estimate average saturated hydraulic conductivity 5 conclusions in this study 131 saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements were performed in a small austrian watershed with double ring infiltrometers this device was chosen due to the measurement repeatability low cost which allowed parallel measurements and ease of installation and operation in natural environments measurements were carried out on 12 plots with a 3 m spatial resolution trying to avoid local macroporosity and preferential flow paths as well as agricultural machinery tracks observations were collected in both grassland and arable areas to account for land cover effects on the variability of k s while soil texture is not significantly variable in the catchment k s varies by two orders of magnitude with a minimum of 1 mm h 1 and a maximum of 130 mm h 1 the variation range in arable areas is wider than in grassland pasture forest areas the minima are similar but the maximum value of k s in cultivated plots is 50 greater than those in the grassy plots soil management practices and uniform land cover are considered the main causes of the lower spatial variability of k s in the cultivated areas where cv assumes values reduced of about 25 with respect to those obtained in the areas with natural vegetation an analysis of variance has been also carried out with the purpose of understanding the role of plot characteristics including land cover on the variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity the results show that the main control is the land cover and the plot location influences ks only because different plots are characterized by different land uses the great influence of land cover is also reflected by the probability density functions considered separately for grassland and arable areas although both pdfs follow a log normal distribution their shapes are rather different with a median of 12 mm h 1 in grassy fields and 34 5 mm h 1 in arable fields therefore two separate pdfs should be considered to characterize the probability distribution of ks measurements performed with a double ring infiltrometer in natural or agricultural settings finally an uncertainty analysis has been performed aimed at determining the minimum number of measurements necessary for estimating the geometric mean of ks for a specific area from the analysis of three grassy plots with the same measurement density it is clear that the uncertainty expressed in terms of width reduction of the 95 confidence interval decreases rapidly as the number of measurements increases up to a certain value here the reduction stabilizes and after this point the increasing of the number of observations used in the estimate provides little benefit in accuracy compared to the cost in terms of time and resources of each additional measurement the width of the confidence interval obtained with a specific number of measurements increases with plot size most likely because of the higher chance to encounter soil local heterogeneities such as macropores wormholes different root systems or preferential flow paths the increase appears to be limited beyond a certain extent suggesting that all the local soil heterogeneities characterizing the plot are captured even though further analyses on this should be made the chart of the confidence interval width as a function of number of measurements and plot size can be used as a support in sampling design to obtain a reliable k s with the minimum number of samples the chart could be also used for estimating the minimum number of dri measurements in other catchments that exhibit geo morphological characteristics similar to those characterizing this study i e an agricultural setting slope angles less than 10 and silty soils if spatial correlations of k s are present the proposed procedure represents an upper limit of the uncertainty to be expected finally the methodology adopted here could be of interest to develop similar investigations in different areas a limitation of this work is that the ks measurements through the catchment were not performed at the same time therefore a distortion of the spatial pattern of ks cannot be ruled out because of possible changes of the local values this is a problem that cannot be completely solved at least considering the limits of the currently available devices and that in any case should not have significantly affected the

6695,spatially representative estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks are needed for simulating catchment scale surface runoff and infiltration classical methods for measuring ks are time consuming so sampling campaigns need to be designed economically important insights can be obtained by experiments directed to understand the controls of ks in an agricultural setting and identify the minimum number of samples required for estimating representative plot scale ks in this study a total of 131 double ring infiltrometer measurements were made on 12 plots in a small austrian catchment a statistical analysis of ks across the catchment suggests ks to be only slightly influenced by physical and topographical soil characteristics while land use is the main control the highest values of ks were observed in arable fields with a median of about 3 times and a coefficient of variation cv of about 75 of those in grassland areas an uncertainty analysis aimed at determining the minimum number of ks measurements necessary for estimating the geometric mean of ks over a given area with a specified accuracy suggests that beyond a specific and plot size dependent number of measurements the benefit of any extra measurement is small the confidence interval of the geometric mean of ks decreases with the number of measurements and increases with the size of the plot sampled applications of these findings for designing field campaigns are discussed keywords saturated hydraulic conductivity local measurements spatial variability plot scale estimate 1 introduction the hydraulic conductivity of saturated soils ks is a key parameter controlling various hydrological processes including rainfall partitioning into infiltration and surface runoff accurate estimates of ks are needed for modeling local infiltration into homogeneous parlange et al 1982 and layered soils govindaraju et al 2012 as well as for upscaling infiltration models smith and goodrich 2000 corradini et al 2011 saturated hydraulic conductivity is highly variable in space due to soil structure dexter et al 2004 texture saxton et al 1986 jabro 1992 landscape position mohanty et al 1994 and land cover and management practices alletto and coquet 2009 bonell et al 2010 it also depends on scale sobieraj et al 2004 lai and ren 2007 saturated hydraulic conductivity typically varies even more than two orders of magnitude in space baiamonte et al 2017 performed 150 infiltration measurements in a sicilian basin and observed values of ks that ranged from less than 1 mm h 1 to more than 8000 mm h 1 papanicolaou et al 2015 conducted about 120 infiltration experiments on three hillslopes with different agricultural management practices in iowa and observed ks values that ranged from 0 15 mm h 1 to 360 mm h 1 similarly loague and gander 1990 carried out 157 infiltration measurements in a small rangeland catchment of area 0 1 km2 r 5 oklahoma and obtained values of k s approximately variable by two orders of magnitude in space furthermore sharma et al 1987 performed infiltration experiments in two lateritic australian catchments 0 94 km2 and 0 81 km2 and found ks values in the range 8 33 946 mm h 1 and 237 1646 mm h 1 respectively woolhiser et al 1996 found that runoff hydrographs were strongly affected by variations in saturated hydraulic conductivity at the hillslope scale especially for small runoff events taskinen et al 2008 investigated the effects of spatial variability of ks on overland flow in a small agricultural catchment by analyzing 2000 synthetic rainfall runoff events generated from observed rainfall events with runoff modelled using different spatially variable ks fields they found the greatest differences in the first flow peak and in the rising part of the hydrograph hu et al 2015 analyzed the effects of ks variability on runoff simulations in a small watershed on the chinese loess plateau and found that total and peak discharges were underestimated if the spatial variability of ks was completely ignored or only partially considered assouline and mualem 2002 examined the effects of the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties combined with the formation of a sealing layer at the soil surface they deduced that the hydrological response of arid and semiarid catchments is dominated by these effects assouline and mualem 2006 showed that infiltration into crusted soils experiences substantial changes for the presence of ks spatial heterogeneity particularly for loam soils accounting for ks spatial variability is therefore essential in addition to undisturbed soil core sampling several experimental techniques are available for estimating ks through in situ infiltration measurements the most commonly used devices are tension permeameters e g the csiro disc permeameter perroux and white 1988 single ring infiltrometers lassabatère et al 2006 bagarello et al 2004 2014a ahmed et al 2014 double ring infiltrometers swartzendruber and olson 1961 constant head well permeameters e g the guelph permeameter reynolds and erlick 1985 and rainfall simulators e g the guelph rainfall simulator tossell et al 1987 the device choice conditions the estimated values of ks verbist et al 2013 bagarello et al 2014a due to different factors reynolds et al 2000 such as size of investigated soil sample collection procedure flow geometry and estimate of other soil parameters e g soil sorptivity saturated water content necessary to derive the value of ks applying specific data analysis procedures widely used techniques to determine ks such as the traditional well permeameter and ring infiltrometer rely on the attainment of a steady state flow rate so that the time required to carry out each measurement is usually high other techniques do not require to achieve steady conditions bagarello et al 2004 2014b but in any case their use at the catchment scale represents a challenge speeding up the measurement operations with the purpose of achieving detailed ks maps over large areas is therefore one of the greatest issues to be addressed in spatial infiltration studies pedotransfer functions which estimate ks from more easily measurable soil physical properties bouma 1989 and statistical approaches to extrapolate ks from a small number of measurements to the entire catchment are some of the approaches adopted to reduce the time demand of extensive field measurement campaigns however macropores and other preferential flow paths often dominate the infiltration behavior even more than the characteristics of the soil matrix as quantified by porosity texture etc so it is usually advantageous not to rely only on pedotransfer functions from the literature but to perform at least a few ks measurements in the catchment of interest bouma et al 2011 regarding the number of measurements required vieira et al 1981 studied the spatial variability of 1280 field measured infiltration rates using geostatistical concepts they argued that 128 samples were sufficient to obtain nearly the same information as obtained from 1280 samples ahmed et al 2015 conducted an uncertainty analysis on 722 infiltration measurements in six roadside drainage ditches grassy swales i e shallow open vegetated roadside drainage channels designed to convey stormwater runoff to storm sewers or water receiving bodies and concluded that approximately twenty infiltration measurements were the minimum number to obtain a representative geometric mean of ks of a swale that was less than 350 m long with an acceptable level of uncertainty the identified minimum number was related to the width of the 95 confidence interval that in logscale was about equal to 2 skøien and blöschl 2006 found that the required number of samples depends on the spatial correlation of ks as well as on the measurement setup they investigated the effect of spacing average distance between samples extent size of the domain sampled and support averaging area of one sample i e the scale triplet as termed by blöschl and sivapalan 1995 on the estimates of mean spatial variance and complete range of a variable in a landscape for each of the chosen combinations of spacing support and extent they generated 1000 synthetic random fields and sampled from them according to the selected scale triplet in what they termed single realization case they compared the sample mean and sample variance with the mean and variance of the entire random field of the same realization they found that the estimation uncertainty of the mean increases when the spacing increases for a given number of samples small extents relative to the underlying correlation length imply that the samples are highly correlated and the underlying distribution can be well characterized from a limited number of samples skøien and blöschl 2006 used numerically generated random fields and actual observations of ks may differ in terms of their sampling characteristics also by identifying the controls on ks areal estimates can be improved over random sampling either by stratified sampling or by making use of pedotransfer functions the main objective of this paper is to identify the main elements that control the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in an agricultural setting and on this basis to define the minimum number of samples needed for estimating a value of ks representative at the plot scale this is a crucial element to obtain the first of the two moments of the ks probability density function required to apply areal infiltration modeling flammini et al 2018 the results of ks measurement campaigns performed in a small catchment in austria with double ring infiltrometers dris are used the choice of this equipment was made on the basis of a few practical considerations later specified and mainly of the outcomes earlier obtained by morbidelli et al 2017 in laboratory experiments finalized to compare a double ring infiltrometer a tension permeameter and a constant head well permeameter using controlled rainfall runoff experiments as a benchmark measurements collected in both grasslands and arable lands are selected to deduce the effects of different land management operations on the ks spatial variability a statistical analysis is performed to understand the confidence in the estimate of the areal average value of ks for different land uses plot areas and sample sizes based on this analysis guidance is given for planning measurement campaigns with double ring infiltrometers when time and resources are limited 2 materials 2 1 study area the study area is the hydrological open air laboratory hoal catchment located in petzenkirchen in the western part of lower austria the basin has an area of 0 66 km2 the elevation ranges from 268 to 323 m a s l with a mean slope of 8 landcover consists of arable land 87 pasture 5 forested area with grassland and high stemmed vegetation of low density 6 and paved surfaces 2 blöschl et al 2016 in this study pasture and forested area are collectively denoted as grassland areas because the forested area is really characterized by grassland and not by brushwood as a result of the patchy type of land use that takes place in the catchment the climate is humid with a mean annual temperature of 9 5 c and a mean annual precipitation of 823 mm yr 1 from 1990 to 2014 a soil survey campaign of 300 cores sampled on a 50 50 m grid provided information about organic matter content om clay cl silt si and sand sa percentages at multiple depths according to the usda soil classification the topsoil in the catchment consists of silt loam 75 of the area silty clay loam 20 and silt 5 a high resolution digital terrain model dtm was used to derive elevation el and local slope angles s across the catchment winter wheat winter barley maize rapeseed and soy are the main types of crop cultivated in the catchment crop rotation is associated with green manure in order to ensure natural fertilization of the soil however nitrogen fertilizers and natural fertilizers e g pig manure are also applied before sowing as well as plant protection agents such as plant growth regulators fungicides and broad spectrum insecticides the harvest of the winter crops usually occurs in july allowing the access to the cultivated areas for infiltration measurements until the late august september when field preparation for tillage and seedbed is made 2 2 soil data collection a total of 131 locations on 12 different plots were chosen to sample ks of the soil surface of the hoal catchment fig 1 the measurements were performed with the objective of evenly exploring the grassland areas specifically those without high stemmed vegetation and the areas devoted to agricultural practices depending on the time required to perform a local experiment by the selected procedure described below the measurements in each plot were carried out in a narrow period up to 3 days for the larger plot the measurements in the whole grassland areas were substantially completed in the period march 15 april 7 while in the cultivated areas due to restricted access during the crop growing season and tillage operations the experimental campaign was made in the period between harvest and tillage in the last period between july 20 and september 20 it was possible to investigate different plots at the same condition with respect to agricultural practices even though at different times in any case because of the absence of bare soils subjected to significant temporal changes of ks due to crust formation and disruption the lack of measurements contemporaneity should not have significantly affected the main features of the ks spatial heterogeneity field among the available measurement techniques dris were considered to be appropriate because of the ease of installation and robustness in natural environments where tall grass surface slope or strong wind may preclude the usage of other more sensitive devices due to the equipment low cost simultaneous use up to four instruments was possible to speed up the experiments the technique consists of pushing two concentric steel rings of diameters 0 3 m and 0 6 m about 10 cm into the ground and pouring water inside them until the water level equalizes in the two rings the reduction of the inner ring water level due to infiltration is recorded at regular time steps and the measurement ends when infiltration steady state is obtained in our measurements the latter was considered to occur when an infiltration rate invariant in the last hour was detected the saturated hydraulic conductivity was assumed equal to the last value of infiltration rate typically observed with a ponded depth of water of about one centimeter morbidelli et al 2017 showed that dris tended to overestimate the areal average value of ks as compared to controlled rainfall runoff experiments they also found that when samples were taken with dri in a highly controlled laboratory system characterized by a soil with homogeneous grain size distribution and bare surface the observed values did not significantly change over the repetitions performed in adjacent places this finding highlights that dris allow reliable estimates of ks in terms of repeatability but they are biased compared to the benchmark value in any case considering the measurement repeatability it is expected that the observed bias does not significantly affect the spatial variability analysis of ks even though the possible existence of a bias dependent on the correct ks values cannot be ruled out on the other hand the magnitude of the bias is still an open issue for any available device because of the difficulties related to the identification of an indisputable true reference value of ks on each plot ks measurements were performed with a spatial resolution of 3 m the duration of each run was typically of 3 4 h fig 2 highlights examples of the different environmental conditions present on the plots fig 2a shows the largest plot plot 2 which consists of grassy land and is located close to the forested area with grassland fig 2b represents plot 5 showing the winter wheat stubbles that remains in the field after the harvest and fig 2c shows plots 11 and 12 both located in a naturally vegetated orchard in the choice of the measurement locations slope represented a crucial factor according to philip 1991 in the initial stage of the infiltration process when the capillary forces play a leading role the infiltration rate does not depend on the surface inclination but after a long time when only gravitational forces drive the process the infiltration rate is reduced by the cosine of the slope angle however experimental evidence does not always support this theoretical formulation essig et al 2009 morbidelli et al 2015 in any case it is widely recognized that slope affects the infiltration process in this light to reduce the slope effects morbidelli et al 2016 measurements were only performed at locations with surface slope angles generally less than 10 and in the absence of bare soils at the locations where the infiltration measurements were performed soil textural composition and organic matter content were inferred from the survey data available on the 50 50 m grid in addition slope and elevation across the catchment were obtained from the dtm the physical and topographical soil characteristics displayed in table 1 show little spatial variation between the measurement locations the maximum coefficient of variation cv observed for textural composition and organic matter content is about 15 consistent with the usda soil classification of the catchment according to which only two main soil types are identified in the basin 95 of the topsoil is either silt loam or silty clay loam only the surface slope angle exhibits a significant variation with a cv of about 30 3 method 3 1 statistical analysis and controls on saturated hydraulic conductivity the anova method armstrong et al 2000 has been selected for the analysis of variance of the experimental data associated to the different plots to understand whether the variability of k s across the catchment is linked to specific soil physical characteristics of the measurement locations an application of this method requires that specific assumptions on the experimental data are satisfied in general terms the results obtained for the study variable are subdivided into j groups and the ith observed value i 1 i of a given group j j 1 j can be expressed as a sum of the mean of all the available measurements μ the group effect τ j representing the deviation of the group mean μ j from μ and a random element ε i j reflecting the combined effects of measurement errors and natural variation through observations the basic assumptions involved in the anova method concern the random elements that should be normally distributed with the same variance in all groups while the means μ j can be variable from group to group the available ks data do not satisfy these two conditions while log transformed values of ks have been found appropriate for the anova method application see also snedecor and cochran 1980 the following procedure has been therefore used the entire data set has been divided into j groups and a single transformed observation ln k s i j has been expressed as 1 ln k s i j μ τ j ε i j μ j ε i j j 1 j and i 1 i with τ j μ j μ and with the quantities μ j and ε i j computed on the transformed data set on this basis to highlight a possible absence of group effect the null hypothesis of equality of the j values of the mean has been tested starting from the quantity s s t defined as 2 s s t i j ln k s i j μ 2 that can be rewritten as 3 s s t s s w s s b i j ln k s i j μ j 2 j n j μ j μ 2 where s s w is associated to the variation within each group s s b to the variation between each group and the catchment and n j is the number of observations in each group the sample variance σ t 2 the within variance σ w 2 and the between variance σ b 2 have been then estimated by dividing each term of eq 3 by the corresponding degree of freedom 4 σ t 2 s s t d f t s s t i 1 5 σ w 2 s s w d f w s s w i j 6 σ b 2 s s b d f b s s b j 1 and the variance ratio f has been computed as 7 f j 1 i j σ b 2 σ w 2 for testing the null hypothesis f has been compared to the critical value f c r i t d f b d f w obtained from an f distribution snedecor and cochran 1980 with d f w and d f b degrees of freedom with a significance level of 5 if f is greater than the critical value the null hypothesis of zero group effect has to be rejected and at least one of the μ j values is significantly different from the grand mean the above approach has been applied to different group ensembles 1 ensemble obtained considering the plot locations as sources of variation to understand whether k s variability is substantially linked to the specific physical and topographical characteristics of the measurement areas 2 ensemble identified grouping areas with the same land use considered because the outcomes of step 1 suggested a significant dependency of k s variability on the plot location 3 ensembles of plots characterized by the same land use to understand if a other plot specific properties had a significant influence or b the observations could be considered as different sets sampled from the same population even though collected at different locations in the catchment 3 2 uncertainty analysis and minimum number of samples needed an analysis has been performed with the aim of determining the uncertainty related to the estimate of an average ks value for a specific area the ks geometric mean k s has been chosen as the representative estimator of the areal average saturated hydraulic conductivity obviously the higher the number of measurements used to estimate the geometric mean of ks the higher is the confidence that the estimate is representative of the true value of k s for the considered area however since the measurements are very time consuming understanding whether it is possible to reduce the number of measurements and still obtain a reliable average would enormously improve the planning of measurement campaigns with reduced realization times a well founded uncertainty analysis based on the use of the confidence intervals has been carried out it is rather similar to that used by ahmed et al 2015 with changes directed to improve the interpretation of results the plots 2 11 12 and 7 have been selected because they exhibited the same sampling density about 1 measurement every 10 m2 the same land cover grass but different number of observation points i e 40 20 and 9 respectively for each data set the non parametric bootstrap method carpenter and bithell 2000 has been used to estimate confidence intervals around the geometric mean for different numbers of samples the method is particularly helpful whenever confidence intervals must be calculated for small data sets as in the case of plot 7 where only 9 measurements are available as suggested by carpenter and bithell 2000 information about the value of a population parameter e g the mean μ can be obtained by drawing a random sample y from that population and constructing an estimate μ y of the value of μ from that sample the bootstrap principle is adopted to achieve information about the relationship between μ and μ y by looking at the relationship between μ y o b s and μ y where y is a resample characterized by the sample of the observations y o b s because the method involves a resampling step which can be done assuming a specific distribution for the parameter and sampling from it i e parametric bootstrap or without assuming any distribution for the parameter and sampling with replacement i e non parametric bootstrap it is often used for small data sets in implementing the bootstrap method the observations have been assumed independent sampling has been done with replacement and the process has been repeated 1000 times as suggested for the 95 confidence interval by carpenter and bithell 2000 from each sub sample the geometric mean has been estimated a set of 1000 geometric mean values has been obtained and the 95 confidence interval has been derived by calculating the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles the procedure has been repeated changing the number of observations n for each plot the trend of the confidence interval has been derived varying the number of observations n from 2 to the maximum number of data available the three trends obtained have been then normalized by the geometric mean of k s of each plot to facilitate visual comparisons a further analysis has been performed using plot 2 to determine for different plot areas the minimum number of measurements requested to derive k s this plot was the one with the largest data set six sub areas of 55 110 165 215 280 and 345 m2 have been considered with larger sub areas always containing all the smaller ones in each sub area 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 measurements have been drawn and the 95 confidence intervals have been estimated as above specified for a total of 36 combinations area sample number finally the widths a 95 of the confidence intervals calculated as the difference between the 97 5 and 2 5 percentiles have been plotted against area for different sample numbers the curves describe how the confidence in the estimation of k s decreases when an equal number of measurements are performed on plots of increasing dimensions or how many samples are needed to obtain a given accuracy 4 results and discussion 4 1 controls on the spatial variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 3 suggests that soil physical characteristics do not have a direct effect on k s variability a wider ks variation range seems to be related to lower om fig 3a higher si fig 3c or lower sa fig 3d however this may be caused by the variation of the physical characteristics with land use rather than by a direct dependency of k s on texture most likely considering that arable areas are characterized by lower percentages of om and sa and higher percentage of si the corresponding wider variation range could be an expression of the treatment effect due to land use investigated later instead of a reflection of changes in soil textural composition the weak relationship between ks and soil textural composition is in contrast with experimental evidence of a strong connection between ks and particle size distribution rahmati et al 2018 and is likely related to the small variation of soil characteristics in the catchment on the other hand ks is somewhat dependent on the slope angle fig 3e in particular higher values of ks were observed at close to horizontal areas while the ks range decreases with increasing slope angle s the relationship between slope angles and the textural components is shown in fig 4 no clear dependency of s on any of the considered soil characteristics can be detected therefore the influence of s on ks is not related to changing soil attributes with slope but could be due to variations in soil properties not captured by texture in this context differences in soil packing and presence of macropores both influenced by random components that cannot be objectively quantified should have generally a major role and explain also the k s heterogeneity within each plot on the other hand it is not expected that the significant decrease of ks with increasing s highlighted by morbidelli et al 2015 2016 under conditions of surface water moving downslope can be deduced by measurements of ks performed with classical devices in the absence of overland flow notwithstanding the limited spatial variation of the physical and topographical soil attributes saturated hydraulic conductivity varies substantially with values ranging over two orders of magnitude from a minimum of 1 mm h 1 to a maximum of 130 mm h 1 table 2 the high spatial variability of ks is a well known characteristic of this parameter regardless of the measurement technique applied the geographical location the land use or the soil type baiamonte et al 2017 papanicolaou et al 2015 therefore this parameter is considered as a random variable depending also on random factors that cannot be quantified table 2 further shows the differences in the ks variability between arable and grassy plots the ks minimum and maximum observed in arable lands are significantly larger than those obtained in grassy plots with values increased more than 50 this result can be explained by the fact that after the harvest i e the condition in which the infiltration measurements were performed the whole root system of winter crops including stubbles was present therefore the presence of the root system typically very deep see f i thorup kristensen et al 2009 for winter wheat allowed the establishment of a preferential flow regime more efficient than that of grassy soils where the maximum depth of the root system was much lower with values of a few tens of centimeters see also brown et al 2010 morbidelli et al 2014 in addition the behavior of the arable lands is justified by the regular mixing loosening of the plough layer that takes place twice a year either through ploughing or chiseling with the result that the pore size distribution can be characterized by more medium pores and less fine pores than grassland on the other hand the grassy plots do not exhibit a plough layer but distinct hydromorphic features more or less close to the surface the uniform distribution of the root system that remains in the field coupled with the periodic land management of the investigated soils is also responsible for a more homogeneous distribution of k s across the area the lower variability is reflected by the coefficient of variation that in the arable fields assumes values reduced of about 25 with respect to those associated to the grassland areas land management operations repeated season after season such as tillage or plowing in addition to a uniform land cover of crops having the same growing period and therefore similar depths of the root system appear to reduce spatial variations due to different plant varieties and soil transformation mechanisms affecting the land surface e g soil compaction crust formation or soil swelling a site by site examination reveals very similar minima of saturated hydraulic conductivity on almost every plot table 3 on the other hand the maxima vary greatly between different plots on each plot the coefficient of variation assumes values c v 0 5 that closely reflect the value associated to the entire catchment this indicates that the high ks spatial variability is still traceable when the observation plots are individually considered more information about plot differences and similarities is provided by fig 5 which shows the boxplots of ks on each measurement plot as mentioned before the minima vary little between plots while the maxima vary a lot there are differences related to land use the first quartile in grassy fields except plot 7 is less than or equal to the minima observed on arable plots 5 and 8 indicating that at least 25 of the ks values observed in natural conditions is lower than the minimum values observed when agricultural practices become operative moreover about 50 of the ks values observed on arable plots 5 and 8 are greater than the maximum values excluding values that seem to be possible outliers even if for all the analyses they have been considered because included in the ks observed range measured on grassy plots 1 2 3 6 7 and 9 due to the fact that the median is greater than or equal to the maximum of each mentioned grassy plot the boxplot analysis highlights a significant variability among the different measurement plots but it does not clarify if the detected variation is caused by specific physical and topographical characteristics by different land uses or simply by the random nature of saturated hydraulic conductivity in order to understand whether the variability of ks across the catchment is more related to the random nature of the parameter than to the measurement location or vice versa an analysis of the variance has been carried out the first step of the analysis has been therefore aimed at determining whether the plot characteristics have a significant influence on k s spatial variability the whole set of measurements has been divided into j 12 groups representing the twelve measurement plots table 4 a shows the results of the analysis of variance which has been carried out on the log transformed data the anova assumptions of normally distributed residuals and homoscedasticity have been tested with the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 and the breusch pagan test breusch and pagan 1979 respectively the variance between different plots σ b 2 4 1 is almost three times higher than the variance within each plot σ w 2 1 3 this means that the largest share of variability is traceable to the physical topographical and land cover differences between the plots an additional evidence resides in the fact that the value of f equal to 3 1 is greater than the critical value of 1 9 and therefore the null hypothesis of absence of treatment effect i e the effect of plot location in the present case must be rejected in the interest of further analyzing the origin of the treatment effect the main variability source represented by the land use has been considered the whole set of k s observations has been divided into arable and grassland areas j 2 regardless of the specific type of crop cultivated in the field and the type of natural vegetation table 4b shows the anova results when land use is considered as source of variability the variance associated with the measurement error and the random nature of k s i e σ w 2 is 1 4 and is thus almost negligible compared to σ b 2 23 7 indicating that land use is most likely the main driver for the observed k s variations across the catchment the value of the f ratio of 17 2 is much larger than the critical f of 3 9 associated with a significance level of 5 indicating that the group effect is not negligible and the means of the two groups are significantly different from each other finally since both land use and measurement plot location are responsible for a non negligible treatment or group effect it is interesting to understand if both factors cause saturated hydraulic conductivity to vary in space or rather if the two are related with each other and ks spatial variability is actually due to only one of them in other words we want to understand if ks varies with plot location because of different physical and topographical soil characteristics specific of each plot or only because every plot exhibits a different land use to this end the whole sample of ks observations has been split into two sub samples the first one consisting of measurements performed in grassland areas and the second of measurements performed in arable areas and within each sub sample an analysis of variance has been carried out considering as source of variation the plot location results of the analyses are shown in table 4c and d in both cases variances associated with treatment between and error within have approximately the same values and the f ratio is always lower than the critical value these results indicate that plot location does not explain the spatial variability and that measurements on different plots with the same land use can be considered as sampled from the same population because the null hypothesis of equality of each group mean to the grand mean cannot be rejected the great influence of land use on the observed ks variability is evident when two probability density functions pdfs of ks are associated to observations divided into the two sub samples previously defined saturated hydraulic conductivity that is usually assumed as log normally distributed sharma et al 1987 dagan and bresler 1983 is characterized by the pdfs of both grassy and arable fields which tend to be bimodal but can be in any case well approximated by log normal distributions as tested with the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 on the log transformed data in addition as shown in fig 6 they exhibit different shapes in arable fields the pdf is flatter the peak is lower and less pronounced the variation range is larger and the median is 34 5 mm h 1 as compared to 12 mm h 1 in grassy fields table 2 this means that agricultural practices and a homogeneous land cover influence the random nature of saturated hydraulic conductivity which still varies randomly inside each group clearly land use strongly influences ks in agricultural settings and data collected in arable and grassland areas should not be considered as deriving from the same population 4 2 minimum number of samples for estimating areal average saturated hydraulic conductivity the uncertainty analysis aimed at determining the minimum number of samples required for estimating a reliable ks geometric mean k s for a specific area has been carried out using the data from plots 2 11 12 and 7 these plots had the same land use different areas about 500 m2 200 m2 and 80 m2 respectively and different number of total observations however considering that the measurements were performed with the same spatial resolution the plots approximately had the same measurement density about 1 observation per 10 m2 fig 7 shows the 95 confidence interval of k s normalized by its geometric mean of the specific plots for a specific number of measurements n the plot with smaller area results in a narrower normalized confidence interval for example for n 6 the width of plot 7 normalized confidence interval of 1 2 is much narrower than those of plots 2 and 11 12 2 2 and 2 0 respectively although the normalization influences the width of the confidence interval because of the different values of the geometric mean of the three plots table 3 it does not affect the results in terms of the reliability exhibited by the same value of n with changing areas specifically for n 6 the widths of the confidence intervals without normalization by the geometric mean have different trends 29 7 34 8 and 21 3 mm h 1 for plots 7 11 12 and 2 respectively but the corresponding average relative errors of the geometric means of the three plots 62 107 and 117 respectively confirm a higher reliability of the geometric mean estimates for smaller areas these outcomes are likely related to the lower variability captured in grassy fields when a smaller area is sampled while in larger areas local soil heterogeneities e g macropores wormholes cracks local slope have a higher chance to be encountered furthermore the differences appear to be fairly limited if plots 11 12 and 2 are compared in terms of both the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval fig 7 and the average relative errors this suggests that beyond a certain extent all the local soil heterogeneities characterizing the plot are captured this study does not involve a specific analysis of spatial correlations because of the relatively low number of samples on the smaller plots the hypothesis of independent observations upon which the bootstrap method is based was adopted following ahmed et al 2015 based on the hypothesis of independent data the confidence interval of plot 2 characterized by a sample statistically significant for the analysis of the frequency distribution has been also computed adopting a gaussian distribution for the log transformed k s data its trend is shown in fig 8 together with that provided by the non parametric bootstrap method applied to log transformed k s data as expected no significant differences can be observed fig 9 shows the reduction of the confidence interval with increasing the number of measurements for the three plots the reduction has been obtained as the difference between the width of the non normalized confidence interval associated with n measurements and the width associated with n 1 measurements on each plot the reduction is large for small n for example if 4 measurements are used to calculate the confidence interval instead of 3 the width of the confidence interval decreases by 5 7 and 4 3 mm h 1 for plots 2 11 12 and 7 respectively on the other hand as n increases the reduction decreases and tends asymptotically towards zero this is particularly evident from the interpolated curve of plot 2 even though the same behavior is detected for plots 11 12 and 7 from this it can be deduced that the benefit in terms of width reduction gained by performing one extra measurement on each plot is high for small n and decreases with plot extent up to a point specific for each plot where the average reduction rate becomes almost constant i e the interpolated curve becomes horizontal therefore the n associated with this point can be considered as the minimum number of measurements necessary to enter the zone where the confidence interval is stable for example the interpolated curve of plot 2 is almost constant for n greater than 12 suggesting that the reduction of the confidence interval width for more than 12 measurements is negligible a further remark concerns the possible influence of spatial correlations on the analysis the presence of spatial correlations would have the effect of reducing the width of the confidence interval for a specific n as compared to uncorrelated data single realization case of skøien and blöschl 2006 the same confidence in the estimates of the geometric mean would be therefore achieved with a smaller number of observations consequently the minimum number of measurements would depend on the spatial correlation structure of the investigated plot which would make the application of our results to other areas difficult on the other hand the assumption of independent data allows to transfer the results regardless of the plot correlation structure even though they may represent an upper limit of the density of required measurements if correlations are present in order to gain insight into the relationship between grassy and arable fields in terms of accuracy in the k s estimation the same uncertainty analysis has been carried out on plots 5 and 7 which possess the same number of observations the same area but different land use fig 10 shows that the confidence intervals for the grassland areas are wider than for the arable areas independently of the number of measurements n used for the derivation which is due to the larger variability of ks highlighted in the spatial analysis of section 4 1 for the grassland areas this result justifies the choice of focusing the consecutive analysis only on grassy fields because for the same plot size the minimum number of measurements derived for natural conditions always ensures a greater accuracy in arable environments in planning a field campaign one must decide the number and the location of the measurements in relation to the time required to collect a single observation and the time available the second step of the uncertainty analysis is aimed at assisting in this choice in order to be able to compare the combined effect of plot size and number of measurements on the accuracy of the final areal estimation of k s six sub plots have been derived from plot 2 in an attempt to avoid effects of temporal variation of ks on the investigated spatial variability ideally the only distinguishing aspects of the sub plots are size and total number of measurements available for each sub plot the 95 confidence intervals of k s normalized by the geometric mean of the specific sub plot has been generated through the non parametric bootstrap method the width of the normalized 95 confidence interval a 95 obtained with a specific number of measurements n as a function of the plot size is shown in fig 11 on a plot of specific dimensions a better estimate of the average saturated hydraulic conductivity can be achieved by increasing the number of measurements in the area in accordance with the findings of skøien and blöschl 2006 for example if a plot of 165 m2 is sampled at 5 locations the width of the confidence interval is about twice the average ks but if 8 measurements are made on the same plot the width is halved slightly less than 1 k s i e the reliability associated with the k s estimation is almost doubled on the other hand when the same number of samples is taken in increasing areas the width of the confidence interval increases as well indicating how the samples progressively lose the ability of representing the true value of k s if 7 measurements are performed over an area of 110 m2 the width of the confidence interval is 1 1 k s but the uncertainty almost doubles whenever the same number of samples is taken on a plot of 345 m2 a 95 2 1 k s as mentioned before the confidence intervals are obtained with the non parametric bootstrap method which is based on the hypothesis of independent data although the increase in uncertainty with increasing areas could be partially due to a progressive decorrelation this is not the case because in the derivation of the confidence intervals spatial correlations are not considered one possible explanation may be the increased likelihood of encountering soil local heterogeneities in larger areas additionally if one considers a sub area of plot 2 of 120 m2 the contained measured k s are characterized by a variance of about 170 mm2 h 2 when the sub area is extended up to 300 m2 the variance increases as well and it is equal to 350 mm2 h 2 finally if the sub area is further extended up to 450 m2 the variance reaches the value of 410 mm2 h 2 and for greater areas the variance value fluctuates in the range 350 400 mm2 h 2 this trend confirms that when the sampled area increases more variability is encountered and therefore the uncertainty on the estimation of the ks geometric mean value increases as well fig 11 is also useful to derive a minimum number of samples that have to be taken in an area of specific dimensions for a tradeoff between accuracy or uncertainty and time required for the measurements selection of the accuracy level should consider the typical k s value of the study since the average error is relative to it for example if a 95 is assumed equal to 1 5 for a silty loam soil for which a typical ks value of about 1 6 mm h 1 is expected corradini et al 1997 the estimated value of k s can vary on average between 0 4 and 2 8 mm h 1 however if the same width is chosen for a sandy loam soil for which a typical ks value of about 25 mm h 1 is expected corradini et al 1997 the estimated value of k s will vary on average between 6 25 and 43 75 mm h 1 furthermore the level of accuracy should be selected in relation to the final purpose of the measurement campaign for instance if the peak discharge of a stream has to be estimated by a rainfall runoff model for designing a weir system along the stream the required accuracy of k s could be inferred from the required accuracy of the flood estimate by error propagation the accuracy level suggested by ahmed et al 2015 varies in the range of 1 8 2 2 when the reference value is taken as 1 8 fig 11 suggests that for a plot of 110 m2 at least 5 measurements are needed to obtain a width of the normalized 95 confidence interval equal to or smaller than the reference value similarly on a plot of 280 m2 at least 8 samples should be taken in order to estimate average saturated hydraulic conductivity 5 conclusions in this study 131 saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements were performed in a small austrian watershed with double ring infiltrometers this device was chosen due to the measurement repeatability low cost which allowed parallel measurements and ease of installation and operation in natural environments measurements were carried out on 12 plots with a 3 m spatial resolution trying to avoid local macroporosity and preferential flow paths as well as agricultural machinery tracks observations were collected in both grassland and arable areas to account for land cover effects on the variability of k s while soil texture is not significantly variable in the catchment k s varies by two orders of magnitude with a minimum of 1 mm h 1 and a maximum of 130 mm h 1 the variation range in arable areas is wider than in grassland pasture forest areas the minima are similar but the maximum value of k s in cultivated plots is 50 greater than those in the grassy plots soil management practices and uniform land cover are considered the main causes of the lower spatial variability of k s in the cultivated areas where cv assumes values reduced of about 25 with respect to those obtained in the areas with natural vegetation an analysis of variance has been also carried out with the purpose of understanding the role of plot characteristics including land cover on the variability of saturated hydraulic conductivity the results show that the main control is the land cover and the plot location influences ks only because different plots are characterized by different land uses the great influence of land cover is also reflected by the probability density functions considered separately for grassland and arable areas although both pdfs follow a log normal distribution their shapes are rather different with a median of 12 mm h 1 in grassy fields and 34 5 mm h 1 in arable fields therefore two separate pdfs should be considered to characterize the probability distribution of ks measurements performed with a double ring infiltrometer in natural or agricultural settings finally an uncertainty analysis has been performed aimed at determining the minimum number of measurements necessary for estimating the geometric mean of ks for a specific area from the analysis of three grassy plots with the same measurement density it is clear that the uncertainty expressed in terms of width reduction of the 95 confidence interval decreases rapidly as the number of measurements increases up to a certain value here the reduction stabilizes and after this point the increasing of the number of observations used in the estimate provides little benefit in accuracy compared to the cost in terms of time and resources of each additional measurement the width of the confidence interval obtained with a specific number of measurements increases with plot size most likely because of the higher chance to encounter soil local heterogeneities such as macropores wormholes different root systems or preferential flow paths the increase appears to be limited beyond a certain extent suggesting that all the local soil heterogeneities characterizing the plot are captured even though further analyses on this should be made the chart of the confidence interval width as a function of number of measurements and plot size can be used as a support in sampling design to obtain a reliable k s with the minimum number of samples the chart could be also used for estimating the minimum number of dri measurements in other catchments that exhibit geo morphological characteristics similar to those characterizing this study i e an agricultural setting slope angles less than 10 and silty soils if spatial correlations of k s are present the proposed procedure represents an upper limit of the uncertainty to be expected finally the methodology adopted here could be of interest to develop similar investigations in different areas a limitation of this work is that the ks measurements through the catchment were not performed at the same time therefore a distortion of the spatial pattern of ks cannot be ruled out because of possible changes of the local values this is a problem that cannot be completely solved at least considering the limits of the currently available devices and that in any case should not have significantly affected the main features of the ks spatial variability field obtained in this study acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge financial support provided by the austrian science funds fwf as part of

6696,quantifying uncertainty in projecting climate change impact on flood frequency analysis is particularly relevant for long term water resources planning and management this study examines uncertainties arising from 1 a climate model with and without accounting of intermodel similarities 2 a hydrological model with two different error model definitions which have previously received less attention in studies propagating uncertainty through climate change impacts on flood response through a bayesian modeling framework a proposed statistical framework is utilized to explore various definitions of sources of uncertainty and to develop a series of nested formulations that can evaluate the leverage of specific uncertainty sources in quantiles of future streamflow to be specific climate model similarity hydrologic prediction error and frequency analysis are formally modeled with an appropriate likelihood function the quantiles inferred by each formulation are compared in a case study of the yongdam basin in korea results indicate that variance in hydrologic response is underestimated if climate model similarities are ignored and in many cases the inferred quantiles of streamflow projection are biased accordingly furthermore a simple error model used in defining hydrologic uncertainty may create incorrect information in determining the quantiles in streamflow projection the approach presented here of quantifying uncertainty has the potential to better depict overall multi source uncertainties in projections of climate change impacts on hydrologic response finally our results also indicate that careful flood planning management may be required for the yongdam basin in future summers keywords quantifying uncertainty climate change hydrologic response 1 introduction the possible impacts of climate change have been increasingly examined to project the long term needs of local water resources management franco et al 2011 zhuang et al 2018 in particular many studies have shown that flood risk can be significantly affected by climate change arnell and gosling 2016 qi et al 2016 assessing the impacts of climate change entails a large degree of uncertainty when appraising its projected impact on floods chen et al 2011 in projecting climate change impacts various sources of uncertainty have been identified and diverse methodologies have been developed to quantify respective contributions nguyen et al 2016 shen et al 2018 zhuang et al 2018 however this diversity rather hinders a straightforward evaluation of water resource infrastructure and may lead to misinterpretation of overall uncertainty understanding changes in uncertainties corresponding to the formulations of a contribution helps to design climate impact analysis with a more robust uncertainty assessment this is the primary contribution of this work by proposing a statistical framework in which the uncertainties are accounted for and propagated through analysis most studies evaluate the frequency of flooding to climate change by relying on future climate scenarios e g simulated by global climate models gcms statistically or dynamically downscaled and or bias corrected and fed into hydrological models the simulated flood response is then compared to a baseline response estimated on historic climate data e g karlsson et al 2016 van huijgevoort et al 2014 in the process quantifying individual contributions from future climate conditions to flood response is required for full analysis of uncertainty under climate change bosshard et al 2013 so that decision makers can consider adaptation strategies contextualized by the uncertainty in design statistics significant research attention has been gained with multiple uncertainty sources including those related to gcm structure greenhouse gas emission scenarios fang et al 2015 ficklin et al 2016 the choice of downscaling method etemadi et al 2014 li et al 2015 hydrologic modeling i e model structure bae et al 2011 poulin et al 2011 troin et al 2017 and uncertain parameterization brigode et al 2013 dobler et al 2012 and frequency analysis model quintero et al 2018 viglione et al 2013 the most common approach to defining climate conditions is developing a multi model ensemble prediction by considering a number of simulations from a range of different gcms christierson et al 2012 hall et al 2012 lee et al 2017 qi et al 2016 xu et al 2010 this approach generally assumes that each individual climate model is considered as an independent representation of the earth system implying that there are not too many similarities that would bias output from each gcm however the gcms are often similarly performed in many cases for various reasons e g coarse resolution knutti et al 2013 calibration data sets abramowitz and bishop 2015 and shared code components pennell and reichler 2011 for instance climate models that are fundamentally different with respect to certain underlying processes can show similar climate representations if the models have been particularly developed based on the same observational data sets to calibrate and evaluate present day climate conditions abramowitz and bishop 2015 also if scientists make a number of simplifications in model resolutions climatic deviations from the models will be similarly performed in the extreme case a model run at two resolutions provides very little additional information about averaged climatic projection masson and knutti 2011 to address this dependence recent studies have proposed a method to combine the gcms for the multi model ensemble predictions applying less weight to gcms which are similar haughton et al 2015 sanderson et al 2015 as presented by haughton et al 2015 dependence based ensemble prediction is substantially beneficial both to long term planning and uncertainty quantification that are relevant for assessing climate change impact although very important the similarities have received less emphasis in studies investigating uncertainty analysis of hydrologic alteration under climate change in addition to the uncertainty in future climate simulations there is also significant uncertainty surrounding the ability of the hydrologic model there are many studies exploring the impact of hydrologic model uncertainty on the assessment of climate impact but they often focus on parameters structural errors or a combination of both chen et al 2011 dobler et al 2012 kay et al 2009 lee et al 2017 poulin et al 2011 qi et al 2016 however these uncertainties may not provide reliable bounds for streamflow estimates steinschneider et al 2012 because flood responses may be difficult to simulate only with an ensemble of model structures or parameterization considering that the hydrological processes in most watersheds are known to exhibit highly nonlinear behavior sivakumar and singh 2012 renard et al 2011 also concluded that predictive error models improve the reliability of the integrated uncertainty estimates in hydrologic modeling to generate reliable predictive bounds of flood estimates formal quantification of predicted errors inherent in a hydrologic model is needed through climate change impact analyses the predictive error model is generally built based on a statistical description of the differences between the model predictions and observed data properly characterizing the form of the errors is required to provide reliable and precise hydrologic predictions smith et al 2010 if an inadequate model is used for the properties of predictive errors unreliable parameter estimates and inadequate predictions are obtained evin et al 2014 it is particularly important when hydrologic models are applied in forecasting periods similar to climate change impact analyses zhang et al 2008 because of the benefits of explicitly stated assumptions it is often the case that the predictive errors are independent and identically distributed i e iid according to a normal distribution with mean zero and a constant variance e g sun and bertrand krajewski 2013 zhang et al 2016 however this simple assumption has been criticized by its many applications beven et al 2008 in many hydrological applications the errors are autocorrelated nonstationary and non normal sun et al 2017 a common form of nonstationarity is heteroscedasticity especially in the form of an increase in error variance with streamflow discharge recent studies have proposed methodologies to deal with these features in a hydrologic model evin et al 2014 honti et al 2013 mcinerney et al 2017 in particular schoups and vrugt 2010 model the prediction errors by using the first order autocorrelation ar1 process a time variant function linearly related with predicted flow and a random noise component described by a skew exponential power distribution these flexible parameterizations allow the structure of prediction errors to capture the salient features in the errors which have received less attention in studies propagating uncertainty through climate impact assessments of hydrologic alteration to the authors knowledge few studies have attempted to simultaneously propagate uncertainty using the errors features zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 employed a bayesian framework to evaluate uncertainty in parameters for the impact of climate change on streamflow in that study ar1 transformed prediction errors have been employed despite the errors in a hydrologic model exhibiting more complex features this study presents a bayesian framework in which climate model similarity and hydrologic error uncertainty are formally characterized and examined to better quantify the integrated propagated uncertainty of hydrologic alterations under future climates this framework allows a comparison of the range of projected changes in streamflow with several variants of modeling formulations to test specific uncertainty considerations highlighting the complex interactions between variously defined sources of uncertainty and their effects on future estimates of design flow statistics used in decision making climate model similarity and hydrologic prediction error are formally structured with an appropriate likelihood function and combined with priors of model parameters using bayes theorem then uncertainty bounds expressed as the variability of the design value under consideration are extended for assessment of their impact on climate change summing up we seek to answer the following questions in a case study of daily streamflow in the yongdam basin located in south korea by utilizing the proposed uncertainty assessment framework 1 how can projected probabilistic changes in streamflow differ with and without accounting for intermodel correlations in climate models 2 how can projected probabilistic changes in streamflow be affected by the formulation of predictive error models in a hydrologic model 3 what probabilistic changes in future streamflow are expected if climate model similarity and a probabilistic error model are considered simultaneously when they are compared with historical streamflow the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the data and study area are described in section 2 section 3 presents a statistical framework for quantifying the integrated uncertainty of hydrologic alteration under the effects of climate model similarity and hydrologic uncertainty the proposed framework is applied and the propagated uncertainties presented in section 4 finally the paper concludes in section 5 with a discussion of the limitations of our approach and future research needs 2 study areas and data the geum river basin drains the geum river estuary into the yellow sea and is located in midwest korea with a drainage area of about 9810 km2 jeong et al 2014 because the basin is located in a transitional zone with climate influenced by northeastern asia and the western pacific ocean climate in winters is influenced mainly by the siberian high whereas summers are affected by hot and humid conditions generated by the maritime pacific high vieux et al 2009 transitional seasons between winter and summer are generally dry which periodically bring droughts interannual precipitation is rather variable in the last 50 years average annual precipitation has been 1290 mm with high and low of 1783 mm and 754 mm respectively approximately two thirds of annual precipitation is concentrated in the summer spanning from late june to early september while precipitation in winter represents less than 10 of annual precipitation summers are also affected by the generation of extraordinarily high rainfall and corresponding floods by monsoonal moisture that encroaches on the korean peninsula from the intertropical convergence zone yan et al 2015 in addition to the complexity of regional climate systems the basin has also faced many water related issues including water quality control fish flow requirements eutrophication from rising water temperatures and drastically increased water demand due to regional population growth ryu et al 2011 over the last decade the region has experienced several severe droughts resulting in decreased availability of water resource seo et al 2018 these challenges highlight the need to build better adaptive water resources management plans integrating an uncertain future climate to analyze hydrologic alteration within climate change we selected the yongdam basin one of the sub basins in the geum river basin fig 1 while most parts of the geum river basin are regulated by reservoirs the yongdam basin located upstream is relatively free from artificial diversions and human adjustments the basin draining northward to the yongdam multipurpose dam is characterized by steep mountain terrain with flat gradient river networks particularly in the lower reaches the terrain slope is moderately steep averaging 17 6 with a maximum grade of 68 and a minimum channel slope of 0 06 historic daily climate data including precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures were gathered from 63 of the korea meteorological administration s automated surface observing system asos gauges the data was interpolated onto a 1 8 degree resolution 140 km2 by using the thiessen polygons thiessen 1911 the final daily data set was obtained for the period of 1 january 1975 to 31 december 2004 by averaging the values within each grid cell overlapping our study basin area the location of the grid points are presented in fig 1 daily observed streamflow data were gathered from the water resources management information system webpage http www wamis go kr for the period of 1 january 2001 to 31 december 2010 note that the streamflow data are available only beginning in the year 2001 upon completion of the yongdam reservoir finally three climate variables monthly precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures were gathered from thirty seven climate models of the world climate research programme s coupled model intercomparison project phase5 cmip5 multi model data sets taylor et al 2012 with the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 and historical scenarios meinshausen et al 2011 only a single run based on a single set of initial conditions is considered in the analysis table s1 presents a list of the gcms employed in this study historical simulations and future projections are developed using 30 year windows 1971 2000 baseline and 2051 2080 2060 target year respectively chen and brissette 2017 reported that to eliminate the risk of grid point numerical effect in climate model outputs averaging more than a few grid points even in the case of small watersheds is necessary accordingly we first interpolated model outputs bilinearly to a resolution of 1 2 degree and then averaged final outputs from nine grid points near our study basin 3 methodology the methodology to explore how climate model similarity and hydrologic uncertainty influence integrated uncertainty is comprised of four major components the first modifies the approach of steinschneider et al 2015 to consider the effects of climate model similarities accommodating changes in climate variables section 3 1 the second component utilizes the method of evin et al 2014 to characterize parametric and predictive uncertainty using a bayesian calibration framework section 3 2 the third component presents a frequency analysis theory to estimate values of the given probabilities for a flow time series section 3 3 section 3 4 presents the overall framework proposed to propagate uncertainty of each contribution the framework is briefly presented in fig 2 and a detailed description of each step is further provided in the following sections 3 1 future climate projections 3 1 1 probability model for climate change in accordance with knutti et al 2013 we define model similarity as similarity in the model outputs to account for the similarity of climate models probability distributions for changes in midcentury minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation are estimated in a bayesian framework through eq 1 1 1 c a n μ a σ a 1 2 c m n μ m τ m c a μ a σ m 1 3 c p n μ p τ p c a c m μ a μ m σ p 1 4 c a n μ a β a c a μ a θ a σ a 1 5 c m n μ m β m c m μ m τ m c m μ m θ m σ m 1 6 c p n μ p β a c a μ a β m c m μ m τ p c a c m μ a μ m θ p σ p where c a c m and c p are the vectors of historical monthly minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation respectively simulated by climate models similarly c a c m and c p are the vectors of future monthly minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation respectively the historical means μ a μ m and μ p and future means μ a μ m and μ p are assumed to be the true mean values represented by the climate models changes of interest are quantified by the difference between expected future and historical outputs i e n μ θ σ n μ σ developed with 800 random samples the coefficients τ capture linear correlations between two covariates whereas the coefficients β link historical and future simulations the covariance matrices are designed to account for model similarities and allow covariance to vary from the historical σ to the future matrix σ the diagonal terms in both matrices are identical λ i i the off diagonal terms capture the historical and future correlation between climate models ρ i i and ρ i i respectively for example the i t h and i t h off diagonal terms for the historical and future covariance matrices are set to be ρ i i λ i 1 2 λ i 1 2 and ρ i i λ i 1 2 λ i 1 2 respectively the coefficients θ then capture changes in the historical and future variance parameters note that we utilize the individualized correlations in historical future scenarios for all models whereas steinschneider et al 2015 design the correlations to be constant across the same model family members e g the single correlation is provided for all the ccsm cesm models within the national center for atmospheric research ncar the bayesian framework is applied independently for each of the twelve months separately and is coded for full bayesian inference using the slice sampler in the jags programming language plummer 2003 two chains are run with overdispersed initial values for posterior exploration after running 10 000 burn in simulations the posterior distributions are defined with 8000 iterations thinned to every twentieth draw to reduce sampling dependence convergence is evaluated based on chain mixing using a gelman and rubin convergence threshold of 1 1 gelman et al 2014 all parameters are estimated with vague prior distributions whereas intermodel correlations are calculated in data from a defined period described in section 2 if no correlation structures between the climate models are used historical and future simulations in climate models are assumed to follow univariate gaussian distributions with correlations and hence off diagonals set to zero and each variance parameter estimated independently this approach is quite comparable to the concept of those used for the purpose of uncertainty analysis of hydrologic alteration under climate change christierson et al 2012 hall et al 2012 lee et al 2017 qi et al 2016 although they do the inference for each model separately without creating an explicit matrix structure we employ the matrix structure approach to evaluate the effects of model similarity in this study 3 1 2 daily climate scenarios generation to generate an ensemble of daily climate scenarios with changes n μ θ σ n μ σ estimated by two approaches with or without accounting for intermodel correlations a weather generator developed by cordano and eccel 2016 is employed for precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures the weather generator adopts a vector autoregressive var model to maintain temporal correlations among generated daily precipitation and temperature data the auto regression order must be determined prior to scenario generation and is decided based on the akaike information criterion aic eq 2 akaike 1981 calculated from the observed data 2 a i c 2 χ 2 l n l where χ is the number of estimated parameters in the model and l is the likelihood function for the model a more detailed description of the information about the weather generator can be found in cordano and eccel 2016 the simulated scenarios obtained by the weather generator enable us to examine the effects of changes in climate variability because they exhibit identical statistical changes while being independently generated 3 2 hydrologic modeling this study uses a parsimonious daily lumped rainfall runoff model with quick and slow flow components the gr4j mod e le du g e â nie rural a 4 param e tres journalier model perrin et al 2003 which is a modified version of the gr3j model originally proposed by edijatno et al 1999 the gr4j model has a simple structure representing interception infiltration and percolation using four parameters table 1 and requires two types of inputs precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet time series note that spatial averaging of inputs is used because gr4j is a hydrological lumped model the gr4j model first calculates net rainfall or evapotranspiration by subtracting pet from precipitation if there is net rainfall a portion enters the production store in which the actual evaporation is calculated and percolation occurs the percolated water reaches the flow routing through leakage another portion of precipitation goes directly to the flow routing the total quantity of water that reaches routing is then split into two flow components 90 of the water is routed by a unit hydrograph and then a non linear routing store and the remaining 10 is routed by a single unit hydrograph total streamflow is finally obtained by adding these two parts together here the first parameter ω 1 determines the size of the production store the second parameter ω 2 controls the flux to groundwater the third parameter ω 3 manages the size of the routing store and the last parameter ω 4 controls the recession of the unit hydrograph if there is net evaporation actual evaporation is calculated based on the level of water in the production store for more details on gr4j a more thorough description of the theory can be found in perrin et al 2003 this study also uses the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1982 for estimating pet from maximum and minimum temperatures radiation values for the hargreaves method are estimated by the method proposed by allen et al 1998 to account for autocorrelated heteroscedastic and non normal residuals the error term ε is modified similar to approaches in steinschneider et al 2015b assume that streamflow q is modeled as the model m e t estimates q c p c p e t ω and the error term ε eq 3 then the error term is modified using eqs 4 7 3 q t q c p c p e t ω ε t 4 δ t ε t ξ t 5 ξ t ϑ 0 ϑ 1 q t 6 ϱ t δ t ϑ 2 δ t 1 7 ϱ t s e p 0 1 ζ 1 ζ 2 where ω is a parameter set of the hydrologic model δ t is a normalized error term ξ t is a time varying standard deviation ϑ 0 and ϑ 1 are the coefficients of a linear regression as a function of the predicted flow ϑ 2 is the autoregression coefficient and ϱ t is assumed to follow a skew exponential power sep distribution with mean 0 standard deviation 1 skew ζ 1 and kurtosis ζ 2 respectively as applied in evin et al 2013 the standard deviation of ϱ t is set to 1 ϑ 2 in this study all parameters of the gr4j model and the error model parameters are calibrated validated by using the observed data from january 2001 to december 2008 january 2009 to december 2010 here vague uniform distributions presented in table 1 are used in a bayesian framework to investigate parametric uncertainties we also calibrate the gr4j model with a normal likelihood function with a mean of 0 and a constant variance σ 2 m e to compare with the error model accounting for autocorrelated heteroscedastic and non normality in hydrologic response the likelihood functions for m e t and m e for the observed streamflow q can then be computed as follows 8 l m e t q 1 t ω ζ 1 ζ 2 c p c p e t t 1 t 1 ξ t 2 ξ ζ ζ 1 ζ 1 1 ω ζ 2 e x p c ζ 2 α ζ 1 t 2 1 ζ 2 9 l m e q 1 t ω σ 2 c p c p e t 2 π σ 2 t 2 t 1 t e x p q t q t 2 2 σ 2 where ω ζ 2 and c ζ 2 are equal to γ 1 2 3 1 ζ 2 2 1 ζ 2 γ 3 2 1 ζ 2 2 and γ 3 1 ζ 2 2 γ 1 ζ 2 2 1 1 ζ 2 respectively the values of α ζ 1 t and ξ ζ are computed as a function of two parameters ζ 1 and ζ 2 as detailed in schoups and vrugt 2010 3 3 frequency analysis modeling fitting of a pdf is required to estimate the frequency of projected flow and leads to a systematic procedure for extrapolation to frequencies beyond the range of the data set appropriate selection of the distribution is important this study determines a reasonable distribution using three goodness of fit tests kolmogorov smirnov anderson darling and upper tail anderson darling when the distribution is selected the parameter set ψ of that distribution is estimated so that required quantiles can be estimated with the fitted model to consider uncertainty of the parameter set in the frequency analysis the estimation of the parameter set is performed in a bayesian framework using vague uniform distributions as priors 3 4 framework to quantify climate change impact on hydrologic response a flowchart of the proposed statistical framework is presented in fig 2 note that this study does not investigate all related uncertainties in future hydrologic projections for instance we do not address the uncertainty of emission scenarios which has been considered one of the main uncertainty sources fang et al 2015 ficklin et al 2016 rather the framework aims to demonstrate how future hydrologic response is affected to describe robust future integrated uncertainty by the different definitions of the climate ensemble and hydrologic error model we aim to quantify the effect of three main sources namely climate projections cp hydrologic modeling hm and frequency analysis fa uncertainties in inferred quantiles of future streamflow in total four models m s e m s o e m s e t and m s o e t are developed the subscripts s and s o denote estimates without and with inclusion of intermodal similarities respectively the subscripts e and e t indicate a normal likelihood function and probabilistic error models respectively therefore the first model m s e estimates future streamflow based on a climate model without accounting for intermodel similarities as well as the hydrologic model with a normal likelihood function in the second model m s o e future streamflow is estimated by a climate model while accounting for intermodel similarities and the hydrologic model with a normal likelihood function the third model m s e t adopts a hydrologic model with a probabilistic error model but does not consider intermodel similarities in a climate model lastly the fourth model m s o e t includes both a climate model with accounting for intermodel similarities and a hydrologic model along with a probabilistic error model the framework for all models is as follows 1 after future climate changes m s o and m s are identified using eq 1 with the definitions in the covariance matrix g climate scenarios g 800 in this study are generated for a climate sequence time length t t 30 y e a r s 365 d a y s for this study using the weather generator as stated in section 3 1 2 the hydrologic models m e t and m e are calibrated evaluated using historical data and then k parameter sets k 800 for each model are obtained from the posterior distributions here the hydrologic error models are constructed by the definitions eq 3 3 projected streamflows q t are independently developed using the gth scenario of future climate and kth hydrologic parameter set ω k g r 4 j ω 1 k ω 2 k ω 3 k ω 4 k for m e t and m e independently 4 to develop the final streamflow projections samples of t perturbations ε ε 1 ε 2 ε t from each model m e t or m e are generated using kth error model parameter set ω k ε ϑ 0 k ϑ 1 k ζ 1 k ζ 2 k or σ k 2 5 streamflow statistics y p i e the pth percentile are calculated through the optimal probability distribution to account for sampling error draw w estimates w 600 in this study of probability model parameters ψ w this study estimates the frequency of monthly maxima flow using the generalized extreme value gev distribution i e ψ w ψ location w ψ scale w ψ shape w the gev was selected after various alternatives generalized extreme value generalized pareto gp normal lognormal exponential and weibull distributions were considered 6 rather than running steps 3 5 for all g k w simulations we minimize computation time by selecting a random sample of n simulations n 3000 in this study with climate projection g g hydrologic model parameter sets k k and frequency analysis sets w w we also note that the values of k w and n are sufficiently large compared to those of previous studies qi et al 2016 wilby and harris 2006 7 the expected value of streamflow statistics y w p can be calculated by taking the mean y p similarly predictive intervals y p α 2 y p 1 α 2 can be developed using the α 2 and 1 α 2 percentiles of the ensemble estimates note that uncertainty of the various sources is not independent from each other and thus not necessarily additive montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 sikorska and renard 2017 indicating that integrated uncertainty is usually not equal to the sum of its contributing sources therefore this study directly compares individual uncertainties that are involved and propagated in integrated uncertainty after considering all sources of uncertainty 4 results 4 1 monthly climate simulations from expected changes probability density functions pdfs are fitted to the monthly climate data generated by the rcp 8 5 scenarios with and without accounting for the intermodel correlations fig 3 shows pdfs of monthly precipitation change for the study area figs s1 and s2 in the supporting information present monthly change for maximum and minimum temperatures respectively the histograms of monthly change computed directly from the climate model output are also presented to highlight that our probability models used to represent climate change provide similar results with the empirical changes including intermodel correlations reduces the effective number of data points and accentuates differences between models such that an increase in variance is prevalent across all months and variables for example the variance of a precipitation increase in march significantly is increased from 1430 to 3220 after intermodel correlations are included similarly the variance without accounting for model similarities is 1960 in may whereas precipitation is more uncertain variance 5320 after intermodel correlations are considered temperature uncertainties are also increased since temperature data are substantially correlated beyond the increased variance of projected changes the mean estimates are also shifted due to intermodel correlations for instance the mean of precipitation change in february increases by 7 8 mm without considering model similarities while precipitation decreases by 7 2 mm on average when intermodel correlations are considered this is because the entire data are no longer regarded as an independent data set allowing that a model showing less correlation is provided more weight in the calculation in particular this is seen in the precipitation for winter months i e january and february the pdfs of climate change can be used to evaluate changes in hydrologic response in the study area in which a stochastic weather generator is used to generate an ensemble of daily climate time series before generating a climate time series the capability of the stochastic weather generator is evaluated by reproducing historic climate conditions in this evaluation 800 simulations with no changes imposed are compared against observed statistics fig 4 the average standard deviation skew of daily precipitation and the average lengths of wet spells for each month are presented in fig 4a d similarly the average and standard deviation of maximum minimum temperatures are shown in fig 4e f in general the results suggest good performance using all variables and statistics but the simulations slightly underestimate the average lengths of wet spells for some months e g july august and september also the model exhibits bias with regards to standard deviations of maximum minimum temperatures for some months e g january and september we also confirm that the cross correlations of all variables for each month are fairly preserved in the simulations not shown overall the performance suggests that the model is appropriate to reproduce climate scenarios for the study area finally using the weather generator 800 different 30 year climate daily simulations are developed with different changes imposed 4 2 hydrologic model calibration and evaluation the simulated streamflow in the yongdam basin was not significantly autocorrelated see fig s3a so ϑ 2 was excluded and our model was calibrated by δ t s e p 0 1 ζ 1 ζ 2 fig 5 shows the simulated daily streamflow for a portion of the calibration and validation periods by gr4j incorporating the two predictive error models m e and m e t note that negative predictions are set to zero table 1 presents summaries of the prior and posterior distributions of m e t for the yongdam basin figs s3b and s3c present diagnostic plots to demonstrate the usefulness of the fitted error model over the validation period the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse r2 and mean error me for simulated streamflow using the median parameter set of m e t equal 0 76 0 78 and 0 47 mm for the calibration period and 0 88 0 90 and 0 71 mm for the validation period these performances are considered either good or acceptable based on performance criteria suggested by martinez and gupta 2010 note that because none of these statistics are adopted for the calibration objective they are not significantly decreased from the calibration to the validation period rather the statistics are improved in the validation period fig 5a presents 90 credible bounds for simulated streamflow credible intervals include observed values 87 6 91 33 in the calibration validation period indicating that the error model of m e t is appropriate to represent residual error uncertainty also when the two residual models m e and m e t are compared there are only negligible differences in terms of mean predictive performance fig 5b and c with slight improvement under m e t however the quantification of predictive uncertainty of m e may not be realistic while the credible bounds of high flow may be underestimated in m e the intervals of low flow seem to be overestimated see fig 5b the credible bounds in m e provide significant bias in the frequency analysis presented in section 4 3 fig s3b shows the fitted and empirical density functions in m e t which support our inference the fitted density function captures the skewness of the errors although it has some bias in the peakedness fig s3c presents the relationship between predicted streamflow and residual errors in both models while the variance of the residuals in m e increases significantly with the magnitude of predicted flow heteroscedasticity is apparently removed in the residuals of m e t 4 3 inter model comparison in quantifying future projections streamflow changes in each month are investigated with and without accounting for intermodel correlations fig 6 each box has 720 000 daily streamflow simulations based on each climate change definition m s and m s o here hydrologic uncertainty is not considered to emphasize differences in accordance with climate change definitions the results clearly show changes particularly for mean estimates in jas when intermodel correlations are included for example the mean of daily streamflow in august is 4 01 mm without considering model similarities while streamflow is 3 54 mm on average when intermodel correlations are considered also mean streamflow in july is decreased by 0 5 mm after intermodel correlations are included streamflow changes in summer months are further analyzed in section 4 3 overall analysis indicates that streamflow projections can vary with and without accounting for intermodel correlations next integrated 95 predictive intervals for quantiles of maximum daily streamflow are investigated future daily maximum statistics y for february and august are selected since they experience a widespread range of alterations under climate change the statistics for these months are selected fig 7 shows the integrated uncertainties of climate projections hydrologic modeling and frequency analysis uncertainty for the quantiles of august streamflow based on four models m s e m s o e m s e t and m s o e t the values in the pth percentile of daily maximum streamflow are estimated following the gev distribution cp uncertainties are developed by the ensemble of climate scenarios run over the median parameter sets of hydrologic and frequency models without adding residual noise integration of cp and hm is made by simultaneously considering ensemble climate scenarios and residual uncertainty in the hydrologic model integrated uncertainty cp hm and fa is developed by incorporating frequency analysis uncertainty as well table 2 presents the median quantiles estimated for the main percentiles of august maximum streamflow then fig 8 presents the relative contributions among three contributing sources each contribution is estimated by the ratio of differences calculated with the standard deviations of the three sources several insights emerge from figs 7 8 and table 2 first cp uncertainty is the largest in low and medium percentiles indicating that the projected value of future streamflow is mainly determined for those percentiles by climate information however its relative contribution is decreased in high percentiles whereas the importance of hm and fa uncertainty is increased this is a particularly important point the hydrologic modeling and frequency processes are nonlinear so different parameterizations of those models and their combinations will result in various responses to a given climate when uncertainty quantification analysis is conducted the investigators must be careful with the nonlinearity the intermodel correlations shift the mean estimates in the projected inferred quantiles of august maximum flows the mean values in all quantiles are increased up to 8 1 after intermodel correlations are considered m s e vs m s o e in table 2 also accounting for intermodel correlation provides changes in predictive bounds cp uncertainty in m s o e is significantly increased when compared to m s e for instance relative cp uncertainties in m s e are 0 85 and 0 65 at 30 and 90 probabilities whereas the uncertainties in m s o e are 0 93 and 0 75 respectively both differences are due mainly to an increase in the variances and mean changes in the pdfs of august precipitation as seen in fig 3 this finding indicates that cp uncertainty may be too narrow if intermodel similarities are not considered in defining climate scenarios third hm uncertainty in m s x e is significantly more underestimated than that in m s x e t underestimation is also prevalent in m s o e highlighting that the simple error model used in quantifying uncertainty through climate impact assessments of hydrologic response may be limited to representing precise hydrologic uncertainty many studies have concluded that hydrologic uncertainty represents just a small portion less than5 of integrated uncertainty for all percentiles lee et al 2017 teng et al 2012 which is the same conclusion when m e is used however relative hm uncertainty is significantly increased up to 18 when m e t is applied as we noted in section 4 2 the credible bounds of high flow in m e are underestimated while the credible bounds of high flow in m e t may be realistic accordingly when the medians in percentiles are estimated in table 2 values of the m e are substantially less than m e t we also confirm another limitation when m e is utilized in the lower percentiles fig 9 shows the integrated uncertainties of climate projections hydrologic and frequency analysis for quantiles of february streamflow here the lower bounds of the integrated predictive intervals for integrated uncertainty cp hm and fa in fig 9b and 9d are almost equivalent to those for the others cp and cp and hm in fig 9a and c the cp uncertainties show a completely different pattern when compared to other uncertainty sources which is not realistic the cp uncertainties are developed by running the ensemble of climate scenarios through the median parameter sets of hydrologic and frequency models without adding any residual noise while february is generally a low flow period see yellow boxes presented in fig 5 maximum flow in that month is determined mainly by the hydrologic modeling process in particular the residual model plays a crucial role in determining extremes by adding errors adopting a simple error model provides biased predictive intervals for low flow with extreme overestimations highlighting the importance in the choice of a residual model 4 4 comparison between m s o e t projections and baseline response after investigating changes in the cumulative uncertainties by the comparing four models m s e m s o e m s e t and m s o e t developed in this study we determine the predictive bounds in quantiles of future streamflow by considering climate model similarity and hydrologic error uncertainty then the cumulative uncertainties of quantile estimates are directly compared on historic and future streamflow based on m s o e t fig 10 presents the cumulative uncertainty in the yongdam basin for three months february july and october to highlight differences between historic and future bounds the cumulative 95 predictive intervals of integrated uncertainty are employed to compare two periods here historical cumulative uncertainty is built using observed climate conditions 1975 2004 so it includes hydrologic and frequency analysis uncertainties if two predictive intervals of flow quantiles are less overlaid it indicates that flow quantiles will differ under future climate conditions fig 10a presents the cumulative estimates for february maximum streamflow the range of future projections differs little from historical streamflow although the spread in future periods for most quantiles extends both below and above those of historical periods these results suggest that no significant change in most february flow quantiles is projected in the set of cmip5 fig 10b presents results for july maximum streamflow the projections may show july flows increasing in a lower quantile while flows in a higher quantile may be decreased although they are still in predictive bounds results indicate that lower flows are expected in the future than in the present likely due to changes reflecting the extraordinarily high rainfall in summer over most july quantiles approximately 47 of the bounds for future uncertainties lie outside the range of historical uncertainty fig 10c shows that there are meaningful differences between the distribution of october maximum streamflow in the historical and future periods fig 10c presents results for october maximum streamflow the projections show october flows increasing in a higher quantile while flows in a lower quantile may be unchanged this suggests that this region requires more careful planning of water management for this month in the future 5 summary and conclusions using a proposed framework this study explores the magnitude and sources of uncertainty in future hydrologic projections the framework allows propagating uncertainty among future climate hydrologic modeling and frequency analysis and determining integrated uncertainty bounds based on defined uncertainty sources a series of nested formulations m s e m s o e m s e t and m s o e t is developed to examine uncertainties arising from 1 climate models with and without accounting of intermodel similarities and 2 a hydrological model with two different error model definitions which have previously received less attention in studies propagating uncertainty through climate change impacts on hydrologic alteration results from a case study of the yongdam basin demonstrate how comprehensive uncertainty can be affected by defining each uncertainty source variance in hydrologic response can be underestimated if similarities in climate models are not considered furthermore accounting for intermodel correlations offers different results in climate change analysis for the region these findings may suggest there is biased information in the approaches of multi model climate ensembles which have been commonly used in previous studies when compared to the simple error model for the hydrologic predictive errors the residual model adopting autocorrelation heteroscedasticity and non normality incorporates significantly more of the integrated uncertainty of future streamflow frequency although climate information and frequency analysis represent the most influential sources of uncertainty our results indicate that hydrologic uncertainty should not be ignored in studies investigating uncertainty analysis of hydrologic alteration under climate change lastly we find that the simple definition of the hydrologic error model can provide critical bias in determining the inferred quantiles of future streamflow our definitions of the uncertainty sources could be very valuable in facilitating decisions of water resource planners by providing possible hydrologic changes to future climate while these results are important there are a number of issues requiring further discussion our study does not purport to investigate completely integrated uncertainties in climate change assessment indicating that the uncertainty of each component adopted here could be altered when full analysis is considered for instance sharma et al 2018 and teutschbein et al 2011 demonstrate that downscaling approaches are comparable to or more important than the gcms themselves also only one hydrological model structure is used in this study even though model structure is also an important source of hydrologic uncertainty mockler et al 2016 poulin et al 2011 lastly chen and brissette 2017 report that uncertainty is substantially increased when a simple interpolation method is adopted in manipulating climate outputs as was also used in this study perhaps a larger limitation of this study is linked to the formulation and concept of a probability model for defining climate change the probability model determines changes in climate variables by considering intermodel correlations which means that the model provides extra weight to a model which has a very different response to other models this could be a limitation if there is a poorly performing model it may be desirable to apply a model selection method prior to propagating climate model uncertainty the framework presented here underscores the importance of the definitions of each component adopted here for climate change assessment future work will examine in detail some of the components used in this study model similarity of individual climatic variables e g precipitation or temperature can provide a different level of uncertainty also individual components in hydrologic uncertainty e g model structure parameters and error model contribute differentially to integrated uncertainty future work will also require applying the methodology presented here to other watersheds uncertainty of climate change impacts may vary among regions due to various hydro climatologic conditions and combinations between climate simulations and regional conditions ahn et al 2016 it would be worthwhile to work towards drawing more generalized conclusions acknowledgments the authors are grateful to three anonymous reviewers and

6696,quantifying uncertainty in projecting climate change impact on flood frequency analysis is particularly relevant for long term water resources planning and management this study examines uncertainties arising from 1 a climate model with and without accounting of intermodel similarities 2 a hydrological model with two different error model definitions which have previously received less attention in studies propagating uncertainty through climate change impacts on flood response through a bayesian modeling framework a proposed statistical framework is utilized to explore various definitions of sources of uncertainty and to develop a series of nested formulations that can evaluate the leverage of specific uncertainty sources in quantiles of future streamflow to be specific climate model similarity hydrologic prediction error and frequency analysis are formally modeled with an appropriate likelihood function the quantiles inferred by each formulation are compared in a case study of the yongdam basin in korea results indicate that variance in hydrologic response is underestimated if climate model similarities are ignored and in many cases the inferred quantiles of streamflow projection are biased accordingly furthermore a simple error model used in defining hydrologic uncertainty may create incorrect information in determining the quantiles in streamflow projection the approach presented here of quantifying uncertainty has the potential to better depict overall multi source uncertainties in projections of climate change impacts on hydrologic response finally our results also indicate that careful flood planning management may be required for the yongdam basin in future summers keywords quantifying uncertainty climate change hydrologic response 1 introduction the possible impacts of climate change have been increasingly examined to project the long term needs of local water resources management franco et al 2011 zhuang et al 2018 in particular many studies have shown that flood risk can be significantly affected by climate change arnell and gosling 2016 qi et al 2016 assessing the impacts of climate change entails a large degree of uncertainty when appraising its projected impact on floods chen et al 2011 in projecting climate change impacts various sources of uncertainty have been identified and diverse methodologies have been developed to quantify respective contributions nguyen et al 2016 shen et al 2018 zhuang et al 2018 however this diversity rather hinders a straightforward evaluation of water resource infrastructure and may lead to misinterpretation of overall uncertainty understanding changes in uncertainties corresponding to the formulations of a contribution helps to design climate impact analysis with a more robust uncertainty assessment this is the primary contribution of this work by proposing a statistical framework in which the uncertainties are accounted for and propagated through analysis most studies evaluate the frequency of flooding to climate change by relying on future climate scenarios e g simulated by global climate models gcms statistically or dynamically downscaled and or bias corrected and fed into hydrological models the simulated flood response is then compared to a baseline response estimated on historic climate data e g karlsson et al 2016 van huijgevoort et al 2014 in the process quantifying individual contributions from future climate conditions to flood response is required for full analysis of uncertainty under climate change bosshard et al 2013 so that decision makers can consider adaptation strategies contextualized by the uncertainty in design statistics significant research attention has been gained with multiple uncertainty sources including those related to gcm structure greenhouse gas emission scenarios fang et al 2015 ficklin et al 2016 the choice of downscaling method etemadi et al 2014 li et al 2015 hydrologic modeling i e model structure bae et al 2011 poulin et al 2011 troin et al 2017 and uncertain parameterization brigode et al 2013 dobler et al 2012 and frequency analysis model quintero et al 2018 viglione et al 2013 the most common approach to defining climate conditions is developing a multi model ensemble prediction by considering a number of simulations from a range of different gcms christierson et al 2012 hall et al 2012 lee et al 2017 qi et al 2016 xu et al 2010 this approach generally assumes that each individual climate model is considered as an independent representation of the earth system implying that there are not too many similarities that would bias output from each gcm however the gcms are often similarly performed in many cases for various reasons e g coarse resolution knutti et al 2013 calibration data sets abramowitz and bishop 2015 and shared code components pennell and reichler 2011 for instance climate models that are fundamentally different with respect to certain underlying processes can show similar climate representations if the models have been particularly developed based on the same observational data sets to calibrate and evaluate present day climate conditions abramowitz and bishop 2015 also if scientists make a number of simplifications in model resolutions climatic deviations from the models will be similarly performed in the extreme case a model run at two resolutions provides very little additional information about averaged climatic projection masson and knutti 2011 to address this dependence recent studies have proposed a method to combine the gcms for the multi model ensemble predictions applying less weight to gcms which are similar haughton et al 2015 sanderson et al 2015 as presented by haughton et al 2015 dependence based ensemble prediction is substantially beneficial both to long term planning and uncertainty quantification that are relevant for assessing climate change impact although very important the similarities have received less emphasis in studies investigating uncertainty analysis of hydrologic alteration under climate change in addition to the uncertainty in future climate simulations there is also significant uncertainty surrounding the ability of the hydrologic model there are many studies exploring the impact of hydrologic model uncertainty on the assessment of climate impact but they often focus on parameters structural errors or a combination of both chen et al 2011 dobler et al 2012 kay et al 2009 lee et al 2017 poulin et al 2011 qi et al 2016 however these uncertainties may not provide reliable bounds for streamflow estimates steinschneider et al 2012 because flood responses may be difficult to simulate only with an ensemble of model structures or parameterization considering that the hydrological processes in most watersheds are known to exhibit highly nonlinear behavior sivakumar and singh 2012 renard et al 2011 also concluded that predictive error models improve the reliability of the integrated uncertainty estimates in hydrologic modeling to generate reliable predictive bounds of flood estimates formal quantification of predicted errors inherent in a hydrologic model is needed through climate change impact analyses the predictive error model is generally built based on a statistical description of the differences between the model predictions and observed data properly characterizing the form of the errors is required to provide reliable and precise hydrologic predictions smith et al 2010 if an inadequate model is used for the properties of predictive errors unreliable parameter estimates and inadequate predictions are obtained evin et al 2014 it is particularly important when hydrologic models are applied in forecasting periods similar to climate change impact analyses zhang et al 2008 because of the benefits of explicitly stated assumptions it is often the case that the predictive errors are independent and identically distributed i e iid according to a normal distribution with mean zero and a constant variance e g sun and bertrand krajewski 2013 zhang et al 2016 however this simple assumption has been criticized by its many applications beven et al 2008 in many hydrological applications the errors are autocorrelated nonstationary and non normal sun et al 2017 a common form of nonstationarity is heteroscedasticity especially in the form of an increase in error variance with streamflow discharge recent studies have proposed methodologies to deal with these features in a hydrologic model evin et al 2014 honti et al 2013 mcinerney et al 2017 in particular schoups and vrugt 2010 model the prediction errors by using the first order autocorrelation ar1 process a time variant function linearly related with predicted flow and a random noise component described by a skew exponential power distribution these flexible parameterizations allow the structure of prediction errors to capture the salient features in the errors which have received less attention in studies propagating uncertainty through climate impact assessments of hydrologic alteration to the authors knowledge few studies have attempted to simultaneously propagate uncertainty using the errors features zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 employed a bayesian framework to evaluate uncertainty in parameters for the impact of climate change on streamflow in that study ar1 transformed prediction errors have been employed despite the errors in a hydrologic model exhibiting more complex features this study presents a bayesian framework in which climate model similarity and hydrologic error uncertainty are formally characterized and examined to better quantify the integrated propagated uncertainty of hydrologic alterations under future climates this framework allows a comparison of the range of projected changes in streamflow with several variants of modeling formulations to test specific uncertainty considerations highlighting the complex interactions between variously defined sources of uncertainty and their effects on future estimates of design flow statistics used in decision making climate model similarity and hydrologic prediction error are formally structured with an appropriate likelihood function and combined with priors of model parameters using bayes theorem then uncertainty bounds expressed as the variability of the design value under consideration are extended for assessment of their impact on climate change summing up we seek to answer the following questions in a case study of daily streamflow in the yongdam basin located in south korea by utilizing the proposed uncertainty assessment framework 1 how can projected probabilistic changes in streamflow differ with and without accounting for intermodel correlations in climate models 2 how can projected probabilistic changes in streamflow be affected by the formulation of predictive error models in a hydrologic model 3 what probabilistic changes in future streamflow are expected if climate model similarity and a probabilistic error model are considered simultaneously when they are compared with historical streamflow the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the data and study area are described in section 2 section 3 presents a statistical framework for quantifying the integrated uncertainty of hydrologic alteration under the effects of climate model similarity and hydrologic uncertainty the proposed framework is applied and the propagated uncertainties presented in section 4 finally the paper concludes in section 5 with a discussion of the limitations of our approach and future research needs 2 study areas and data the geum river basin drains the geum river estuary into the yellow sea and is located in midwest korea with a drainage area of about 9810 km2 jeong et al 2014 because the basin is located in a transitional zone with climate influenced by northeastern asia and the western pacific ocean climate in winters is influenced mainly by the siberian high whereas summers are affected by hot and humid conditions generated by the maritime pacific high vieux et al 2009 transitional seasons between winter and summer are generally dry which periodically bring droughts interannual precipitation is rather variable in the last 50 years average annual precipitation has been 1290 mm with high and low of 1783 mm and 754 mm respectively approximately two thirds of annual precipitation is concentrated in the summer spanning from late june to early september while precipitation in winter represents less than 10 of annual precipitation summers are also affected by the generation of extraordinarily high rainfall and corresponding floods by monsoonal moisture that encroaches on the korean peninsula from the intertropical convergence zone yan et al 2015 in addition to the complexity of regional climate systems the basin has also faced many water related issues including water quality control fish flow requirements eutrophication from rising water temperatures and drastically increased water demand due to regional population growth ryu et al 2011 over the last decade the region has experienced several severe droughts resulting in decreased availability of water resource seo et al 2018 these challenges highlight the need to build better adaptive water resources management plans integrating an uncertain future climate to analyze hydrologic alteration within climate change we selected the yongdam basin one of the sub basins in the geum river basin fig 1 while most parts of the geum river basin are regulated by reservoirs the yongdam basin located upstream is relatively free from artificial diversions and human adjustments the basin draining northward to the yongdam multipurpose dam is characterized by steep mountain terrain with flat gradient river networks particularly in the lower reaches the terrain slope is moderately steep averaging 17 6 with a maximum grade of 68 and a minimum channel slope of 0 06 historic daily climate data including precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures were gathered from 63 of the korea meteorological administration s automated surface observing system asos gauges the data was interpolated onto a 1 8 degree resolution 140 km2 by using the thiessen polygons thiessen 1911 the final daily data set was obtained for the period of 1 january 1975 to 31 december 2004 by averaging the values within each grid cell overlapping our study basin area the location of the grid points are presented in fig 1 daily observed streamflow data were gathered from the water resources management information system webpage http www wamis go kr for the period of 1 january 2001 to 31 december 2010 note that the streamflow data are available only beginning in the year 2001 upon completion of the yongdam reservoir finally three climate variables monthly precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures were gathered from thirty seven climate models of the world climate research programme s coupled model intercomparison project phase5 cmip5 multi model data sets taylor et al 2012 with the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 and historical scenarios meinshausen et al 2011 only a single run based on a single set of initial conditions is considered in the analysis table s1 presents a list of the gcms employed in this study historical simulations and future projections are developed using 30 year windows 1971 2000 baseline and 2051 2080 2060 target year respectively chen and brissette 2017 reported that to eliminate the risk of grid point numerical effect in climate model outputs averaging more than a few grid points even in the case of small watersheds is necessary accordingly we first interpolated model outputs bilinearly to a resolution of 1 2 degree and then averaged final outputs from nine grid points near our study basin 3 methodology the methodology to explore how climate model similarity and hydrologic uncertainty influence integrated uncertainty is comprised of four major components the first modifies the approach of steinschneider et al 2015 to consider the effects of climate model similarities accommodating changes in climate variables section 3 1 the second component utilizes the method of evin et al 2014 to characterize parametric and predictive uncertainty using a bayesian calibration framework section 3 2 the third component presents a frequency analysis theory to estimate values of the given probabilities for a flow time series section 3 3 section 3 4 presents the overall framework proposed to propagate uncertainty of each contribution the framework is briefly presented in fig 2 and a detailed description of each step is further provided in the following sections 3 1 future climate projections 3 1 1 probability model for climate change in accordance with knutti et al 2013 we define model similarity as similarity in the model outputs to account for the similarity of climate models probability distributions for changes in midcentury minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation are estimated in a bayesian framework through eq 1 1 1 c a n μ a σ a 1 2 c m n μ m τ m c a μ a σ m 1 3 c p n μ p τ p c a c m μ a μ m σ p 1 4 c a n μ a β a c a μ a θ a σ a 1 5 c m n μ m β m c m μ m τ m c m μ m θ m σ m 1 6 c p n μ p β a c a μ a β m c m μ m τ p c a c m μ a μ m θ p σ p where c a c m and c p are the vectors of historical monthly minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation respectively simulated by climate models similarly c a c m and c p are the vectors of future monthly minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation respectively the historical means μ a μ m and μ p and future means μ a μ m and μ p are assumed to be the true mean values represented by the climate models changes of interest are quantified by the difference between expected future and historical outputs i e n μ θ σ n μ σ developed with 800 random samples the coefficients τ capture linear correlations between two covariates whereas the coefficients β link historical and future simulations the covariance matrices are designed to account for model similarities and allow covariance to vary from the historical σ to the future matrix σ the diagonal terms in both matrices are identical λ i i the off diagonal terms capture the historical and future correlation between climate models ρ i i and ρ i i respectively for example the i t h and i t h off diagonal terms for the historical and future covariance matrices are set to be ρ i i λ i 1 2 λ i 1 2 and ρ i i λ i 1 2 λ i 1 2 respectively the coefficients θ then capture changes in the historical and future variance parameters note that we utilize the individualized correlations in historical future scenarios for all models whereas steinschneider et al 2015 design the correlations to be constant across the same model family members e g the single correlation is provided for all the ccsm cesm models within the national center for atmospheric research ncar the bayesian framework is applied independently for each of the twelve months separately and is coded for full bayesian inference using the slice sampler in the jags programming language plummer 2003 two chains are run with overdispersed initial values for posterior exploration after running 10 000 burn in simulations the posterior distributions are defined with 8000 iterations thinned to every twentieth draw to reduce sampling dependence convergence is evaluated based on chain mixing using a gelman and rubin convergence threshold of 1 1 gelman et al 2014 all parameters are estimated with vague prior distributions whereas intermodel correlations are calculated in data from a defined period described in section 2 if no correlation structures between the climate models are used historical and future simulations in climate models are assumed to follow univariate gaussian distributions with correlations and hence off diagonals set to zero and each variance parameter estimated independently this approach is quite comparable to the concept of those used for the purpose of uncertainty analysis of hydrologic alteration under climate change christierson et al 2012 hall et al 2012 lee et al 2017 qi et al 2016 although they do the inference for each model separately without creating an explicit matrix structure we employ the matrix structure approach to evaluate the effects of model similarity in this study 3 1 2 daily climate scenarios generation to generate an ensemble of daily climate scenarios with changes n μ θ σ n μ σ estimated by two approaches with or without accounting for intermodel correlations a weather generator developed by cordano and eccel 2016 is employed for precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures the weather generator adopts a vector autoregressive var model to maintain temporal correlations among generated daily precipitation and temperature data the auto regression order must be determined prior to scenario generation and is decided based on the akaike information criterion aic eq 2 akaike 1981 calculated from the observed data 2 a i c 2 χ 2 l n l where χ is the number of estimated parameters in the model and l is the likelihood function for the model a more detailed description of the information about the weather generator can be found in cordano and eccel 2016 the simulated scenarios obtained by the weather generator enable us to examine the effects of changes in climate variability because they exhibit identical statistical changes while being independently generated 3 2 hydrologic modeling this study uses a parsimonious daily lumped rainfall runoff model with quick and slow flow components the gr4j mod e le du g e â nie rural a 4 param e tres journalier model perrin et al 2003 which is a modified version of the gr3j model originally proposed by edijatno et al 1999 the gr4j model has a simple structure representing interception infiltration and percolation using four parameters table 1 and requires two types of inputs precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet time series note that spatial averaging of inputs is used because gr4j is a hydrological lumped model the gr4j model first calculates net rainfall or evapotranspiration by subtracting pet from precipitation if there is net rainfall a portion enters the production store in which the actual evaporation is calculated and percolation occurs the percolated water reaches the flow routing through leakage another portion of precipitation goes directly to the flow routing the total quantity of water that reaches routing is then split into two flow components 90 of the water is routed by a unit hydrograph and then a non linear routing store and the remaining 10 is routed by a single unit hydrograph total streamflow is finally obtained by adding these two parts together here the first parameter ω 1 determines the size of the production store the second parameter ω 2 controls the flux to groundwater the third parameter ω 3 manages the size of the routing store and the last parameter ω 4 controls the recession of the unit hydrograph if there is net evaporation actual evaporation is calculated based on the level of water in the production store for more details on gr4j a more thorough description of the theory can be found in perrin et al 2003 this study also uses the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1982 for estimating pet from maximum and minimum temperatures radiation values for the hargreaves method are estimated by the method proposed by allen et al 1998 to account for autocorrelated heteroscedastic and non normal residuals the error term ε is modified similar to approaches in steinschneider et al 2015b assume that streamflow q is modeled as the model m e t estimates q c p c p e t ω and the error term ε eq 3 then the error term is modified using eqs 4 7 3 q t q c p c p e t ω ε t 4 δ t ε t ξ t 5 ξ t ϑ 0 ϑ 1 q t 6 ϱ t δ t ϑ 2 δ t 1 7 ϱ t s e p 0 1 ζ 1 ζ 2 where ω is a parameter set of the hydrologic model δ t is a normalized error term ξ t is a time varying standard deviation ϑ 0 and ϑ 1 are the coefficients of a linear regression as a function of the predicted flow ϑ 2 is the autoregression coefficient and ϱ t is assumed to follow a skew exponential power sep distribution with mean 0 standard deviation 1 skew ζ 1 and kurtosis ζ 2 respectively as applied in evin et al 2013 the standard deviation of ϱ t is set to 1 ϑ 2 in this study all parameters of the gr4j model and the error model parameters are calibrated validated by using the observed data from january 2001 to december 2008 january 2009 to december 2010 here vague uniform distributions presented in table 1 are used in a bayesian framework to investigate parametric uncertainties we also calibrate the gr4j model with a normal likelihood function with a mean of 0 and a constant variance σ 2 m e to compare with the error model accounting for autocorrelated heteroscedastic and non normality in hydrologic response the likelihood functions for m e t and m e for the observed streamflow q can then be computed as follows 8 l m e t q 1 t ω ζ 1 ζ 2 c p c p e t t 1 t 1 ξ t 2 ξ ζ ζ 1 ζ 1 1 ω ζ 2 e x p c ζ 2 α ζ 1 t 2 1 ζ 2 9 l m e q 1 t ω σ 2 c p c p e t 2 π σ 2 t 2 t 1 t e x p q t q t 2 2 σ 2 where ω ζ 2 and c ζ 2 are equal to γ 1 2 3 1 ζ 2 2 1 ζ 2 γ 3 2 1 ζ 2 2 and γ 3 1 ζ 2 2 γ 1 ζ 2 2 1 1 ζ 2 respectively the values of α ζ 1 t and ξ ζ are computed as a function of two parameters ζ 1 and ζ 2 as detailed in schoups and vrugt 2010 3 3 frequency analysis modeling fitting of a pdf is required to estimate the frequency of projected flow and leads to a systematic procedure for extrapolation to frequencies beyond the range of the data set appropriate selection of the distribution is important this study determines a reasonable distribution using three goodness of fit tests kolmogorov smirnov anderson darling and upper tail anderson darling when the distribution is selected the parameter set ψ of that distribution is estimated so that required quantiles can be estimated with the fitted model to consider uncertainty of the parameter set in the frequency analysis the estimation of the parameter set is performed in a bayesian framework using vague uniform distributions as priors 3 4 framework to quantify climate change impact on hydrologic response a flowchart of the proposed statistical framework is presented in fig 2 note that this study does not investigate all related uncertainties in future hydrologic projections for instance we do not address the uncertainty of emission scenarios which has been considered one of the main uncertainty sources fang et al 2015 ficklin et al 2016 rather the framework aims to demonstrate how future hydrologic response is affected to describe robust future integrated uncertainty by the different definitions of the climate ensemble and hydrologic error model we aim to quantify the effect of three main sources namely climate projections cp hydrologic modeling hm and frequency analysis fa uncertainties in inferred quantiles of future streamflow in total four models m s e m s o e m s e t and m s o e t are developed the subscripts s and s o denote estimates without and with inclusion of intermodal similarities respectively the subscripts e and e t indicate a normal likelihood function and probabilistic error models respectively therefore the first model m s e estimates future streamflow based on a climate model without accounting for intermodel similarities as well as the hydrologic model with a normal likelihood function in the second model m s o e future streamflow is estimated by a climate model while accounting for intermodel similarities and the hydrologic model with a normal likelihood function the third model m s e t adopts a hydrologic model with a probabilistic error model but does not consider intermodel similarities in a climate model lastly the fourth model m s o e t includes both a climate model with accounting for intermodel similarities and a hydrologic model along with a probabilistic error model the framework for all models is as follows 1 after future climate changes m s o and m s are identified using eq 1 with the definitions in the covariance matrix g climate scenarios g 800 in this study are generated for a climate sequence time length t t 30 y e a r s 365 d a y s for this study using the weather generator as stated in section 3 1 2 the hydrologic models m e t and m e are calibrated evaluated using historical data and then k parameter sets k 800 for each model are obtained from the posterior distributions here the hydrologic error models are constructed by the definitions eq 3 3 projected streamflows q t are independently developed using the gth scenario of future climate and kth hydrologic parameter set ω k g r 4 j ω 1 k ω 2 k ω 3 k ω 4 k for m e t and m e independently 4 to develop the final streamflow projections samples of t perturbations ε ε 1 ε 2 ε t from each model m e t or m e are generated using kth error model parameter set ω k ε ϑ 0 k ϑ 1 k ζ 1 k ζ 2 k or σ k 2 5 streamflow statistics y p i e the pth percentile are calculated through the optimal probability distribution to account for sampling error draw w estimates w 600 in this study of probability model parameters ψ w this study estimates the frequency of monthly maxima flow using the generalized extreme value gev distribution i e ψ w ψ location w ψ scale w ψ shape w the gev was selected after various alternatives generalized extreme value generalized pareto gp normal lognormal exponential and weibull distributions were considered 6 rather than running steps 3 5 for all g k w simulations we minimize computation time by selecting a random sample of n simulations n 3000 in this study with climate projection g g hydrologic model parameter sets k k and frequency analysis sets w w we also note that the values of k w and n are sufficiently large compared to those of previous studies qi et al 2016 wilby and harris 2006 7 the expected value of streamflow statistics y w p can be calculated by taking the mean y p similarly predictive intervals y p α 2 y p 1 α 2 can be developed using the α 2 and 1 α 2 percentiles of the ensemble estimates note that uncertainty of the various sources is not independent from each other and thus not necessarily additive montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 sikorska and renard 2017 indicating that integrated uncertainty is usually not equal to the sum of its contributing sources therefore this study directly compares individual uncertainties that are involved and propagated in integrated uncertainty after considering all sources of uncertainty 4 results 4 1 monthly climate simulations from expected changes probability density functions pdfs are fitted to the monthly climate data generated by the rcp 8 5 scenarios with and without accounting for the intermodel correlations fig 3 shows pdfs of monthly precipitation change for the study area figs s1 and s2 in the supporting information present monthly change for maximum and minimum temperatures respectively the histograms of monthly change computed directly from the climate model output are also presented to highlight that our probability models used to represent climate change provide similar results with the empirical changes including intermodel correlations reduces the effective number of data points and accentuates differences between models such that an increase in variance is prevalent across all months and variables for example the variance of a precipitation increase in march significantly is increased from 1430 to 3220 after intermodel correlations are included similarly the variance without accounting for model similarities is 1960 in may whereas precipitation is more uncertain variance 5320 after intermodel correlations are considered temperature uncertainties are also increased since temperature data are substantially correlated beyond the increased variance of projected changes the mean estimates are also shifted due to intermodel correlations for instance the mean of precipitation change in february increases by 7 8 mm without considering model similarities while precipitation decreases by 7 2 mm on average when intermodel correlations are considered this is because the entire data are no longer regarded as an independent data set allowing that a model showing less correlation is provided more weight in the calculation in particular this is seen in the precipitation for winter months i e january and february the pdfs of climate change can be used to evaluate changes in hydrologic response in the study area in which a stochastic weather generator is used to generate an ensemble of daily climate time series before generating a climate time series the capability of the stochastic weather generator is evaluated by reproducing historic climate conditions in this evaluation 800 simulations with no changes imposed are compared against observed statistics fig 4 the average standard deviation skew of daily precipitation and the average lengths of wet spells for each month are presented in fig 4a d similarly the average and standard deviation of maximum minimum temperatures are shown in fig 4e f in general the results suggest good performance using all variables and statistics but the simulations slightly underestimate the average lengths of wet spells for some months e g july august and september also the model exhibits bias with regards to standard deviations of maximum minimum temperatures for some months e g january and september we also confirm that the cross correlations of all variables for each month are fairly preserved in the simulations not shown overall the performance suggests that the model is appropriate to reproduce climate scenarios for the study area finally using the weather generator 800 different 30 year climate daily simulations are developed with different changes imposed 4 2 hydrologic model calibration and evaluation the simulated streamflow in the yongdam basin was not significantly autocorrelated see fig s3a so ϑ 2 was excluded and our model was calibrated by δ t s e p 0 1 ζ 1 ζ 2 fig 5 shows the simulated daily streamflow for a portion of the calibration and validation periods by gr4j incorporating the two predictive error models m e and m e t note that negative predictions are set to zero table 1 presents summaries of the prior and posterior distributions of m e t for the yongdam basin figs s3b and s3c present diagnostic plots to demonstrate the usefulness of the fitted error model over the validation period the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse r2 and mean error me for simulated streamflow using the median parameter set of m e t equal 0 76 0 78 and 0 47 mm for the calibration period and 0 88 0 90 and 0 71 mm for the validation period these performances are considered either good or acceptable based on performance criteria suggested by martinez and gupta 2010 note that because none of these statistics are adopted for the calibration objective they are not significantly decreased from the calibration to the validation period rather the statistics are improved in the validation period fig 5a presents 90 credible bounds for simulated streamflow credible intervals include observed values 87 6 91 33 in the calibration validation period indicating that the error model of m e t is appropriate to represent residual error uncertainty also when the two residual models m e and m e t are compared there are only negligible differences in terms of mean predictive performance fig 5b and c with slight improvement under m e t however the quantification of predictive uncertainty of m e may not be realistic while the credible bounds of high flow may be underestimated in m e the intervals of low flow seem to be overestimated see fig 5b the credible bounds in m e provide significant bias in the frequency analysis presented in section 4 3 fig s3b shows the fitted and empirical density functions in m e t which support our inference the fitted density function captures the skewness of the errors although it has some bias in the peakedness fig s3c presents the relationship between predicted streamflow and residual errors in both models while the variance of the residuals in m e increases significantly with the magnitude of predicted flow heteroscedasticity is apparently removed in the residuals of m e t 4 3 inter model comparison in quantifying future projections streamflow changes in each month are investigated with and without accounting for intermodel correlations fig 6 each box has 720 000 daily streamflow simulations based on each climate change definition m s and m s o here hydrologic uncertainty is not considered to emphasize differences in accordance with climate change definitions the results clearly show changes particularly for mean estimates in jas when intermodel correlations are included for example the mean of daily streamflow in august is 4 01 mm without considering model similarities while streamflow is 3 54 mm on average when intermodel correlations are considered also mean streamflow in july is decreased by 0 5 mm after intermodel correlations are included streamflow changes in summer months are further analyzed in section 4 3 overall analysis indicates that streamflow projections can vary with and without accounting for intermodel correlations next integrated 95 predictive intervals for quantiles of maximum daily streamflow are investigated future daily maximum statistics y for february and august are selected since they experience a widespread range of alterations under climate change the statistics for these months are selected fig 7 shows the integrated uncertainties of climate projections hydrologic modeling and frequency analysis uncertainty for the quantiles of august streamflow based on four models m s e m s o e m s e t and m s o e t the values in the pth percentile of daily maximum streamflow are estimated following the gev distribution cp uncertainties are developed by the ensemble of climate scenarios run over the median parameter sets of hydrologic and frequency models without adding residual noise integration of cp and hm is made by simultaneously considering ensemble climate scenarios and residual uncertainty in the hydrologic model integrated uncertainty cp hm and fa is developed by incorporating frequency analysis uncertainty as well table 2 presents the median quantiles estimated for the main percentiles of august maximum streamflow then fig 8 presents the relative contributions among three contributing sources each contribution is estimated by the ratio of differences calculated with the standard deviations of the three sources several insights emerge from figs 7 8 and table 2 first cp uncertainty is the largest in low and medium percentiles indicating that the projected value of future streamflow is mainly determined for those percentiles by climate information however its relative contribution is decreased in high percentiles whereas the importance of hm and fa uncertainty is increased this is a particularly important point the hydrologic modeling and frequency processes are nonlinear so different parameterizations of those models and their combinations will result in various responses to a given climate when uncertainty quantification analysis is conducted the investigators must be careful with the nonlinearity the intermodel correlations shift the mean estimates in the projected inferred quantiles of august maximum flows the mean values in all quantiles are increased up to 8 1 after intermodel correlations are considered m s e vs m s o e in table 2 also accounting for intermodel correlation provides changes in predictive bounds cp uncertainty in m s o e is significantly increased when compared to m s e for instance relative cp uncertainties in m s e are 0 85 and 0 65 at 30 and 90 probabilities whereas the uncertainties in m s o e are 0 93 and 0 75 respectively both differences are due mainly to an increase in the variances and mean changes in the pdfs of august precipitation as seen in fig 3 this finding indicates that cp uncertainty may be too narrow if intermodel similarities are not considered in defining climate scenarios third hm uncertainty in m s x e is significantly more underestimated than that in m s x e t underestimation is also prevalent in m s o e highlighting that the simple error model used in quantifying uncertainty through climate impact assessments of hydrologic response may be limited to representing precise hydrologic uncertainty many studies have concluded that hydrologic uncertainty represents just a small portion less than5 of integrated uncertainty for all percentiles lee et al 2017 teng et al 2012 which is the same conclusion when m e is used however relative hm uncertainty is significantly increased up to 18 when m e t is applied as we noted in section 4 2 the credible bounds of high flow in m e are underestimated while the credible bounds of high flow in m e t may be realistic accordingly when the medians in percentiles are estimated in table 2 values of the m e are substantially less than m e t we also confirm another limitation when m e is utilized in the lower percentiles fig 9 shows the integrated uncertainties of climate projections hydrologic and frequency analysis for quantiles of february streamflow here the lower bounds of the integrated predictive intervals for integrated uncertainty cp hm and fa in fig 9b and 9d are almost equivalent to those for the others cp and cp and hm in fig 9a and c the cp uncertainties show a completely different pattern when compared to other uncertainty sources which is not realistic the cp uncertainties are developed by running the ensemble of climate scenarios through the median parameter sets of hydrologic and frequency models without adding any residual noise while february is generally a low flow period see yellow boxes presented in fig 5 maximum flow in that month is determined mainly by the hydrologic modeling process in particular the residual model plays a crucial role in determining extremes by adding errors adopting a simple error model provides biased predictive intervals for low flow with extreme overestimations highlighting the importance in the choice of a residual model 4 4 comparison between m s o e t projections and baseline response after investigating changes in the cumulative uncertainties by the comparing four models m s e m s o e m s e t and m s o e t developed in this study we determine the predictive bounds in quantiles of future streamflow by considering climate model similarity and hydrologic error uncertainty then the cumulative uncertainties of quantile estimates are directly compared on historic and future streamflow based on m s o e t fig 10 presents the cumulative uncertainty in the yongdam basin for three months february july and october to highlight differences between historic and future bounds the cumulative 95 predictive intervals of integrated uncertainty are employed to compare two periods here historical cumulative uncertainty is built using observed climate conditions 1975 2004 so it includes hydrologic and frequency analysis uncertainties if two predictive intervals of flow quantiles are less overlaid it indicates that flow quantiles will differ under future climate conditions fig 10a presents the cumulative estimates for february maximum streamflow the range of future projections differs little from historical streamflow although the spread in future periods for most quantiles extends both below and above those of historical periods these results suggest that no significant change in most february flow quantiles is projected in the set of cmip5 fig 10b presents results for july maximum streamflow the projections may show july flows increasing in a lower quantile while flows in a higher quantile may be decreased although they are still in predictive bounds results indicate that lower flows are expected in the future than in the present likely due to changes reflecting the extraordinarily high rainfall in summer over most july quantiles approximately 47 of the bounds for future uncertainties lie outside the range of historical uncertainty fig 10c shows that there are meaningful differences between the distribution of october maximum streamflow in the historical and future periods fig 10c presents results for october maximum streamflow the projections show october flows increasing in a higher quantile while flows in a lower quantile may be unchanged this suggests that this region requires more careful planning of water management for this month in the future 5 summary and conclusions using a proposed framework this study explores the magnitude and sources of uncertainty in future hydrologic projections the framework allows propagating uncertainty among future climate hydrologic modeling and frequency analysis and determining integrated uncertainty bounds based on defined uncertainty sources a series of nested formulations m s e m s o e m s e t and m s o e t is developed to examine uncertainties arising from 1 climate models with and without accounting of intermodel similarities and 2 a hydrological model with two different error model definitions which have previously received less attention in studies propagating uncertainty through climate change impacts on hydrologic alteration results from a case study of the yongdam basin demonstrate how comprehensive uncertainty can be affected by defining each uncertainty source variance in hydrologic response can be underestimated if similarities in climate models are not considered furthermore accounting for intermodel correlations offers different results in climate change analysis for the region these findings may suggest there is biased information in the approaches of multi model climate ensembles which have been commonly used in previous studies when compared to the simple error model for the hydrologic predictive errors the residual model adopting autocorrelation heteroscedasticity and non normality incorporates significantly more of the integrated uncertainty of future streamflow frequency although climate information and frequency analysis represent the most influential sources of uncertainty our results indicate that hydrologic uncertainty should not be ignored in studies investigating uncertainty analysis of hydrologic alteration under climate change lastly we find that the simple definition of the hydrologic error model can provide critical bias in determining the inferred quantiles of future streamflow our definitions of the uncertainty sources could be very valuable in facilitating decisions of water resource planners by providing possible hydrologic changes to future climate while these results are important there are a number of issues requiring further discussion our study does not purport to investigate completely integrated uncertainties in climate change assessment indicating that the uncertainty of each component adopted here could be altered when full analysis is considered for instance sharma et al 2018 and teutschbein et al 2011 demonstrate that downscaling approaches are comparable to or more important than the gcms themselves also only one hydrological model structure is used in this study even though model structure is also an important source of hydrologic uncertainty mockler et al 2016 poulin et al 2011 lastly chen and brissette 2017 report that uncertainty is substantially increased when a simple interpolation method is adopted in manipulating climate outputs as was also used in this study perhaps a larger limitation of this study is linked to the formulation and concept of a probability model for defining climate change the probability model determines changes in climate variables by considering intermodel correlations which means that the model provides extra weight to a model which has a very different response to other models this could be a limitation if there is a poorly performing model it may be desirable to apply a model selection method prior to propagating climate model uncertainty the framework presented here underscores the importance of the definitions of each component adopted here for climate change assessment future work will examine in detail some of the components used in this study model similarity of individual climatic variables e g precipitation or temperature can provide a different level of uncertainty also individual components in hydrologic uncertainty e g model structure parameters and error model contribute differentially to integrated uncertainty future work will also require applying the methodology presented here to other watersheds uncertainty of climate change impacts may vary among regions due to various hydro climatologic conditions and combinations between climate simulations and regional conditions ahn et al 2016 it would be worthwhile to work towards drawing more generalized conclusions acknowledgments the authors are grateful to three anonymous reviewers and

6697,forest stony soils have rock fragments and many macropores the latter arising mainly from the activity of soil fauna and plant root decay we still lack knowledge about the hydraulic properties of this type of soil especially when considering the influence of both factors rock fragments and macropores on the saturated hydraulic conductivity this research aims to supplement the method we proposed before to test the hydraulic conductivity of undisturbed soil samples ilek and kucza 2014 kucza and ilek 2016 we propose to enhance the method by taking into account the impact of rock fragments and macropores on the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils particularly on the hydraulic conductivity of the medium conducting water in the soil that is soil matrix we studied using artificial samples how rock fragments influence hydraulic conductivity to test the enhanced method we used 33 undisturbed samples taken from the top layers 0 12 cm of forest stony soils the results show that rock fragments in the soil can both increase and decrease the infiltration of water by the soil matrix rock fragments with diameters close to 20 mm had the least influence on water infiltration soil macropores in the samples always increased water infiltration empty macropores increased it from two to twenty four times while filled macropores from three to five times our method gives the opportunity to study the hydraulic conductivity of macropores and their physical and chemical properties keywords forest hydrology stony forest soils saturated hydraulic conductivity rock fragment fraction macropores 1 introduction saturated hydraulic conductivity affects surface runoff and water infiltration through the soil profile thus hydraulic conductivity is one of the most important hydraulic properties of soil but at the same time it is one of the most difficult ones to measure jačka et al 2014 many indirect and direct methods for measuring hydraulic conductivity have been proposed for homogeneous soils e g ankeny et al 1991 bagarello et al 2004 meadows et al 2005 schindler and müller 2006 ghanbarian alavijeh et al 2010 di prima 2015 di prima et al 2016 and different methods often give different values of hydraulic conductivity lee et al 1985 mohanty et al 1994 jačka et al 2014 measuring hydraulic conductivity is difficult in forest stony soils due to the presence of rock fragments and soil macropores in the soil hendrayanto et al 1998 ma et al 2010 it is because of rock fragments that the hydraulic properties of stony soils differ from non stony ones sharma et al 1993 depending on the type fraction size and porosity rock fragments can either enhance or worsen soil hydraulic and retention properties since rock fragments have in general a low ability to retain water stony soils usually have low water holding capacity hanson and blevins 1979 cousin et al 2003 parajuli et al 2017 thereby decreasing the volume of water available for plants moustakas et al 1995 usually they also hinder water infiltration by reducing the cross section through which water infiltrates down the soil profile ma and shao 2008 novák and kňava 2012 and increasing the tortuosity of water flow paths childs and flint 1990 zhou et al 2011 under certain conditions however rock fragments reduce surface runoff increasing the infiltration rate by creating new pores at the boundary between rock fragments and soil matrix grant and struchtemeyer 1959 jung 1960 poesen and ingelmo sanchez 1992 tokunaga et al 2003 rock fragments pose many problems in soil hydrology research from sampling to measuring water content in soil by indirect methods coppola et al 2013 it is likely for these difficulties that rock fragments and their influence on the water content measurement are often ignored when describing the hydraulic properties of soils water flows through the soil in principal through the soil matrix and macropores weiler and naef 2003 or other preferential pathways macropores are free spaces in the soil created due to soil fauna activity plant root decay wetting and drying as well as freezing and thawing of the soil and erosive processes beven and germann 1982 many authors distinguish macropores from non macropores based on commonly accepted diameter limits e g chen and wagenet 1992 lin 2010 and according to greco 2002 the diameter of macropores is orders of magnitude larger than that of soil matrix textural pores vegetation strongly influences what types of macropores are formed in the soil shrub areas create large open macropores leading to deep soil layers archer et al 2002 and decaying grass roots form systems of macropores of even size beven and germann 1982 petersson et al 1987 showed a strong positive relationship between hydraulic conductivity and the root mass of trees this relationship however was more apparent in older stands with a greater share of dead roots and soil macropores formed after their death the bark of tree roots usually decays longer than xylem does so plant derived macropores are often filled with material originating from the decay of the root itself beven and germann 1982 such macropores can account for about 35 of the volume of forest soils and the number of macropores decreases with the depth of the soil profile aubertin 1971 difficult quantification of macropores allaire et al 2009 dohnal et al 2009 and large variability of macropore flow are among the reasons for hydrological rainfall runoff models to seldom include water flow through macropores weiler and naef 2003 vareecken et al 2016 although macropores account for a small share of the total soil porosity they may disproportionately influence soil infiltration properties buttle and house 1997 especially under heavy rainfall that exceeds the soil s ability to conduct water lee and foster 1991 mando et al 1996 methods of testing the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils and soils containing soil macropores are constantly being developed ma et al 2010 novák et al 2011 ilek and kucza 2014 germer and braun 2015 knowledge on hydraulic properties of such soils however is still limited particularly in terms of the influence of rock fragments and soil macropores on hydraulic conductivity the most important reason being a lack of simple methods for determining it in this type of soil to estimate hydraulic conductivity in situ tests make it possible to take into account all soil factors acting on it but such an estimate is subject to errors related to the disadvantages of the methods used to take into account heterogeneity of soils it is recommended to take either many samples iwanek 2005 or samples of large volume buchter et al 1984 according to novák et al 2011 determining hydraulic conductivity requires 1 m3 soil samples neither many samples nor large samples however may be enough to avoid errors altogether even sampling itself and the transport of samples may cause laboratory errors in various ways fodor et al 2011 thus taking undisturbed soil samples is a prerequisite for determining the impact of both rock fragments and soil macropores on hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils this paper thus supplements the method for estimating hydraulic conductivity using undisturbed soil samples ilek and kucza 2014 kucza and ilek 2016 we propose here how to enhance the method by taking into account the impact of rock fragments and soil macropores on the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils and in particular on the hydraulic conductivity of the medium conducting water in the soil that is soil matrix 2 material and methods 2 1 research area and sampling we evaluated the proposed method on 33 undisturbed samples taken from the humus a 19 samples and mineral b 14 samples soil layers from selected stands of the myślenice forest district located in south central poland a detailed description of the sampling method and the location of the research area can be found in ilek and kucza 2014 2 2 methodological assumptions of the research the laboratory method for determining hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils under steady saturated conditions proposed by ilek and kucza 2014 uses undisturbed samples since soil samples can have irregular shape depending on the sampling method the method estimates hydraulic conductivity based on the following formula 1 k k w k where k is the hydraulic conductivity m h 1 that would have been obtained if the sample had the shape of a regular cylinder k is the approximate value of hydraulic conductivity m h 1 obtained from direct measurements of undisturbed and irregularly shaped samples and wk is a conversion coefficient that takes into account the influence of irregular shape of the sample on the volume of water flowing through it in this work in addition to taking undisturbed samples we adopted an additional methodological assumption when estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity one should consider the hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix 2 mm which is the medium conducting water in the soil when calculating it one should consider how rock fragments soil macropores and the irregular shape of a sample affect the volume of water flowing through the sample therefore to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix of a forest stony soil we adopted the following formula 2 k fe k rc w r w k where kfe is the hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix m h 1 k rc the approximate value of hydraulic conductivity reduced by the influence of soil macropore s m h 1 and wr is a reduction coefficient that takes into account the impact of rock fragments on hydraulic conductivity since ilek and kucza 2014 and kucza and ilek 2016 described the influence of irregular shape of samples on hydraulic conductivity and the method of calculating the coefficient wk in the following sections we will describe only the method of measuring the coefficient k rc and the reduction coefficient wr 2 3 hydraulic conductivity k rc the first step in determining the kfe coefficient for individual soil samples is to determine the approximate coefficient k under steady saturated conditions in accordance with the procedures presented by ilek and kucza 2014 the value of k obtained from direct measurements on an undisturbed sample includes the influence of rock fragments soil macropores and the irregular shape of the sample on the volume of water flowing through the given sample if after determining k the sample contains at least one soil macropore the next step is to determine the hydraulic conductivity k rc a coefficient that takes into account the influence of the soil macropore s during the research we distinguished two main types of macropores 1 empty macropores fig 1 2 macropores filled with a material with a reduced bulk density relative to the rest of the sample fig 2 a in the case of filled macropores we removed their contents fig 2b and filled the resulting space with molten plasticine fig 2c the relatively small diameter and volume of empty macropores make it difficult to apply quick drying molten plasticine therefore they were usually filled with silicone using a thin dispensing tip next the sample was remeasured and the coefficient k rc was recalculated at the cross sectional area of the sample which was reduced by the average cross sectional area occupied in the sample by the medium filling the macropore ac the area ac m2 was calculated with the following formula 3 a c v c l where vc is the volume of the medium filling the macropore determined by the method of instantaneous displacement of water in a measuring cylinder m3 and l is the sample height m the hydraulic conductivity of individual macropores kc was determined from the difference between k and k rc coefficients in the case of samples with no soil macropores k rc was equal to k 2 4 the conversion coefficient wr the conversion coefficient wr which takes into account the influence of rock fragments on hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix was estimated with the following formula 4 w r 1 l rc 100 where lrc is the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix due to the presence of rock fragments with a given volume and average diameter in this medium to determine the wr coefficient for individual undisturbed soil samples we conducted experiments on artificial samples to analyse how the volume fraction of rock fragments rv and their average diameter d affect lrc figs 3 and 4 we assumed that the volume of water flowing in a given time through a sample of a homogeneous soil matrix with a given volume and porosity can be related to a volume of water flowing through a soil matrix of the same porosity but located in a sample containing a defined volume of rock fragments with a given diameter these relationships are as follows 5 q 1 q 0 v v r v or 6 q 1 q 0 v v r v where q 1 is the volume of water flowing through the soil matrix of a sample that contains rock fragments cm3 s 1 q 0 is the volume of water flowing through a sample of a homogeneous soil matrix cm3 s 1 v is a sample volume cm3 and vr is a volume of rock fragments cm3 if the equality 5 holds i there is a balance between factors that increase and decrease water infiltration through the soil matrix because of rock fragments ii rock fragments do not affect the volume of water flowing through the soil matrix and iii the differences between q 0 and q 1 are related only to the volume of rock fragments in the sample which is why the percentage reduction in the volume of water flowing through the sample can be considered directly proportional to the volume fraction of rock fragments rv under 6 so when the equality 5 does not hold rock fragments affect the volume of water flowing through the soil matrix either positively by enlarging water flow e g through lacunar pores or negatively e g rock fragments with different size causing different curvatures of water flow pathways thus the loss of water flow through a soil sample containing rock fragments lq is as follows 7 l q q 1 q 0 q 0 100 while the actual impact of rock fragments on the decrease in water flow through a soil matrix is as follows 8 l rc l q r v where lrc is the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix that is due to rock fragments lq the loss of water flow through a soil sample containing rock fragments and rv is the volume fraction of rock fragments of the given diameter the experiments on the influence of rock fragments on loss of water flow through a soil sample containing rock fragments lq eq 7 and lrc eq 8 was conducted using artificial samples prepared in a cylinder with a diameter of 125 mm and a height of 60 mm the soil matrix was calibrated sand with an average diameter of 0 17 mm to ensure good contact between the cylinder walls and the side surface of a sample and to prevent the formation of wall leakage during testing the inner wall of the cylinder was covered with a thin layer of aerosol silicone and then a layer of sand when the silicone dried the cylinder was placed in the apparatus for testing the hydraulic conductivity of undisturbed samples ilek and kucza 2014 the experiment started off by determining the hydraulic conductivity of five samples of pure sand these samples were prepared by gradually pouring sand into the cylinder while raising and lowering the water level in the outer cylinder of the apparatus such inducing of artificial variation in the water level resembled conditions of sand compaction and protected the samples against aeration as a constant value of sand s hydraulic conductivity we took the mean of five measurements 0 485 0 499 m h 1 which was 0 492 m h 1 the volume of water flow q 0 that corresponded to this mean value was assumed as a constant used to estimate the influence of rock fragments on hydraulic conductivity this effect was determined at six different volume fractions of rock fragments rv 31 7 21 2 15 1 10 3 7 1 and 2 9 for a given rv 7 8 replications were used varying in the mean diameter of rock fragments d these rv fractions were determined based on the volume occupied in the sample by the largest rock fragment in a given series of the experiment determined using the method of instantaneous displacement of water in a measuring cylinder the very same volumes of rock fragments with smaller diameters d were measured in the same way in the experiments with the other values of rv for this we used rock fragments of a roughly spherical shape sampled from the research area magura sandstone first we used sieves of 2 5 10 12 25 32 and 75 mm to divide the rock fragments into fractions and then immersed them in water for 14 days for individual rv fractions the rock fragments with the largest diameters were selected in the diameter range from 25 to 75 mm and the mean diameter of rock fragments d in the sample was calculated based on the following formulas 9 v d v r n and 10 d v d 1 33 π 3 5 where vd is the volume of an average rock fragment cm3 vr is the total volume of rock fragments in a sample cm3 n is the number of rock fragments in the sample d is the diameter of an individual rock fragment equal to the average diameter of rock fragments in the sample mm to study how rock fragments influence hydraulic conductivity we conducted an experiment on 44 artificial samples they were prepared under artificial fluctuations in the water level in the external cylinder of the apparatus the rock fragments being distributed uniformly throughout the sample this experiment led us to formulate the following relationship between the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix that is due to rock fragments lrc the volume fraction of rock fragments rv and their average diameter d mm 11 l rc b 0 b 1 r v b 2 r v d b 3 d b 4 d b 4 where b 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 are non linear regression coefficients estimated using statistica 13 1 pl software derived based on the artificial samples eq 11 was used to determine lrc and wr eq 4 for 33 undisturbed samples to this aim each sample was washed through a 2 mm sieve and the rock fragments separated that way were then sieved through 5 10 12 25 and 32 mm sieves next for each sample we determined the volume fraction of rock fragments of a given fraction the total volume fraction of rock fragments rv and their average diameter d the diameter d was calculated as the weighted mean volume of a given rock fragment fraction measured by the method of instantaneous displacement of water in a measuring cylinder to the total volume of rock fragments in the sample we estimated bulk density bd as dry mass of the sample per unit of volume and soil matrix bulk density bdfe as dry mass of the sample per unit of volume excluding the volume of rock fragments for samples containing filled macropores we also estimated the bulk density of a macropore bdc organic matter content in the material filling the macropore omc and organic matter content in the remaining part of the sample om the organic matter contents were determined by the loss on ignition method at a temperature of 550 c 3 results 3 1 the influence of rock fragments on the loss of water flow rate the percentage loss of water flow through samples containing rock fragments lq ranged from 24 8 to 1 6 the mean loss increasing with the increase in rock fragment fraction rv fig 5 and reaching the maximum loss for rv of 31 7 the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix lrc ranged from 5 0 to 24 4 under rv of 10 3 the average lrc loss was close to zero fig 6 which may indicate a neutral influence of rock fragments on water infiltration through soil matrix negative lrc losses under rv below 10 3 indicate rock fragments negative inhibitory effect only under rv over 10 3 rock fragments accelerate water flow through soil matrix and the largest positive lrc values occurred under rv of 31 7 fig 6 in addition to the fraction of rock fragments their mean diameter affected lrc too fig 7 regardless of the fraction the highest positive effect on the hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix occurred under the smallest diameters of rock fragments regardless of the diameter d under rv of 15 1 21 2 and 31 7 rock fragments usually enhanced water infiltration through the soil matrix when diameters d were close to 20 mm the lowest impact was 6 9 under rv of 31 7 under rv of 15 1 and 21 2 the impact was below 0 5 under rv of 2 9 7 1 and 10 3 the positive influence of rock fragments on the water permeability of the soil matrix was observed only at the smallest diameters d while the largest negative effect was observed under the 18 20 mm diameters where the lrc loss was in the range from 9 0 to 5 0 under the lowest rv fractions the neutral influence of rock fragments on the permeability of the soil matrix was observed for both the largest diameters and those close to 10 mm fig 7 table 1 shows the estimates along with their statistical significance of the parameters of eq 11 which represents the dependence of the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix lrc on the volume fraction of rock fragments rv and their average diameter d the model explained over 95 of the variability in lrc 3 2 hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils table 2 summarises various properties and other coefficients necessary to determine hydraulic conductivity of 33 samples and their soil matrix obtained from the top layers of forest stony soils the mean bulk density of samples containing rock fragments was 0 665 0 053 g cm 3 standard error of the mean in layer a and 1 184 0 036 g cm 3 in layer b soil matrix bulk density in layer a ranged from 0 217 to 0 856 g cm 3 mean of 0 592 0 048 g cm 3 while of layer b from 0 859 to 1 298 g cm 3 mean of 1 095 0 034 g cm 3 the volume fraction of rock fragments rv in the samples tested ranged from 0 2 to 21 7 in layer a mean rv was 4 7 1 1 while in layer b 8 5 1 3 the mean diameters of rock fragments d in layers a and b were similar 11 6 1 0 mm in layer a and 12 4 0 7 mm in layer b the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix lrc estimated with the model 11 showed both positive and negative impacts on hydraulic conductivity table 2 in layer a the mean lrc loss was 3 5 0 5 while in layer b 1 7 0 9 the mean reduction coefficient wr was 1 035 0 005 in layer a and 1 017 0 009 in layer b among nine samples that contained soil macropores six contained empty table 3 and three filled table 4 macropores most of the macropores including all the filled ones were found in layer a usually filled macropores occupied a much larger volume in the samples tested than empty ones did and their bulk density was on average 0 248 g cm 3 lower than that of the rest of the sample table 4 the hydraulic conductivity of the empty macropores ranged from 0 161 to 3 354 m h 1 while that of the filled macropores from 0 651 to 0 976 m h 1 meaning that the soil macropores significantly increased the hydraulic conductivity of the samples fig 8 a empty macropores increased the k value from two to nearly twenty four times while filled macropores from three to five times the hydraulic conductivity kfe which takes into account the influence of macropores rock fragments and irregular sample shape showed a clear relationship to the bulk density of soil matrix bdfe fig 8b the highest kfe values occurring under bdfe below 0 300 g cm 3 according to the mann whitney u test soil layers a and b differed in terms of the kfe coefficient p 0 0001 α 0 05 the mean hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix of layer a 0 541 0 078 m h 1 was almost three times higher than that of layer b 0 191 0 031 m h 1 4 discussion arising as a result of soil fauna activity and plant root death macropores determine the main route of water infiltration in the soil and influence hydraulic conductivity mbagwu 1995 kodešová et al 2006 fig 8a and tables 3 and 4 confirm these claims léonard and rajot 2001 showed that the activity of termites increases by two or three times water infiltration in the soil and that the presence of macropores of biological origin causes water to flow mainly through these macropores weiler and naef 2003 found that during extreme rainfall water flow is dominated by macropores formed by soil macrofauna earthworms but the flow uses only some of the macropores the remaining ones being either dry or reached by only a small amount of water the quantification of a macropore effect requires two values of hydraulic conductivity one that includes macropores and one that excludes them thus reducing hydraulic conductivity by considering its dependence on soil macropore s seems to be justified the loss of water flow through a soil sample containing rock fragments lq suggests that rock fragments reduce the water flow rate in the soil fig 5 and that the size of this reduction largely depends on the volume fraction of rock fragments ma and shao 2008 and novák et al 2011 also reported the decrease in infiltration due to the increase in rock fragment fraction yang et al 2013 showed the greatest decrease in infiltration at the 50 fraction of rock fragments and mao et al 2011 reported the lowest infiltration under the 20 30 fraction above which it again increased in zhou et al 2009 however the lowest infiltration was under the 40 fraction an increase in the rock fragment fraction in the soil on the one hand causes the area available for infiltrating water to decrease and the tortuosity of the flow to increase mehuys et al 1975 sauer and logsdon 2002 this increase in the rock fragment fraction on the other hand causes the bulk density of soil matrix the water conducting medium to decrease a process related to new pores being formed at the boundary between rock fragments and soil matrix poesen and lavee 1994 torri et al 1994 under rv over 10 water infiltration through the soil matrix accelerates fig 6 which is probably related to the increase in the contact area between rock fragments and soil matrix under rv over 10 the influence of factors inhibiting the flow through the soil matrix is lower that of the factors enhancing it it is under rv below 10 that the inhibiting factors gain dominance a mean lrc of 0 1 1 3 obtained for samples containing 10 3 of rock fragments indicates that under this fraction the effects of factors inhibiting water flow through the soil matrix and the effects of factors enhancing it balance each other in addition to rv the mean diameter of rock fragments affects hydraulic conductivity too diameters close to 20 mm have the least influence but the effect may be positive negative or neutral depending on rv fig 7 diameters below 10 mm speed up water infiltration through the soil increasing hydraulic conductivity up to about 25 under rv of 31 7 beckers et al 2016 showed that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a loamy soil increases with the rock fragment fraction but under some fractions the resistance to flowing water is greater for smaller stones than for larger ones yang et al 2013 found an increase in hydraulic conductivity with an increasing rock fragment diameter but novák et al 2011 reported an opposite effect hydraulic conductivity decreased with an increasing rock fragment diameter eq 11 describing the dependence of actual loss of water flow through soil matrix on rock fragments and their average diameter was developed using artificial samples taking into account only one type of soil matrix calibrated sand the equation was then applied for undisturbed samples characterised by natural particle packing and probably different hydraulic properties at the border between soil matrix and rock fragments than those of artificial samples direct contact between rock fragments and soil matrix leads to a change in porosity at the border between these two components grant and struchtemeyer 1959 jung 1960 causing local acceleration of water flow such a change can depend on differences in the bulk densities of rock fragments and soil matrix for example the processes of swelling and shrinkage of organic matter contained in forest soils may contribute to the formation of temporary voids along the soil stone interface lacunar pores and cause a preferential flow thereby increasing hydraulic conductivity hlaváčiková et al 2016 ma and shao 2008 and hlaváčiková et al 2016 claimed that the shape distribution and orientation of rock fragments affect hydraulic conductivity therefore to draw stronger conclusions about the effects of rock fragments on shaping the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils future studies should consider the shape and position of rock fragments and use homogenised soil matrix of forest soil along with another contrasting soil matrix such as silt clay and organic matter to prepare different artificial samples 5 summary and conclusions the present research on the effect of rock fragments on hydraulic conductivity in forest stony soils showed that rock fragments can either inhibit or accelerate water infiltration through a soil matrix depending on the volume fraction and mean diameter of rock fragments further studies should analyse how the type of soil matrix and the shape and position of rock fragments affect hydraulic conductivity we found that soil macropores play an important role in increasing the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils hydraulic conductivity strongly depends on soil matrix bulk density it is thus justified to take into account the influence of soil macropores and rock fragments on hydraulic conductivity in laboratory tests the proposed method for sampling and sample testing as well as for testing and taking into account the influence of soil fragments and soil macropores on hydraulic conductivity has disadvantages work time consumption and unsuitability for stony soils with large rock fragments stones and boulders these disadvantages however are outweighed by an important advantage the method ensures the preservation of the natural structure of samples as confirmed by the presence of empty and filled macropores in the collected samples thus the method gives the opportunity to study the hydraulic conductivity of the macropores themselves and to reach reliable results for the hydraulic conductivity of heterogeneous soils with a relatively small sample size although in some situations a material filling macropores can be difficult to remove e g when a filled macropore is located in the middle of an undisturbed sample the method proposed gives the possibility to study biological activity and physical and chemical properties of macropores which can be important not only for the field of hydrology but also for other fields conflict of interest none declared acknowledgements this research was financed by the ministry of science and higher education of the republic of poland the results presented in this paper have been partly referenced at the v international forest and water conference in supraśl poland 2017 the authors would like to thank three anonymous reviewers for the thorough assessment of the present paper and for their many valuable and helpful suggestions

new pores at the boundary between rock fragments and soil matrix grant and struchtemeyer 1959 jung 1960 poesen and ingelmo sanchez 1992 tokunaga et al 2003 rock fragments pose many problems in soil hydrology research from sampling to measuring water content in soil by indirect methods coppola et al 2013 it is likely for these difficulties that rock fragments and their influence on the water content measurement are often ignored when describing the hydraulic properties of soils water flows through the soil in principal through the soil matrix and macropores weiler and naef 2003 or other preferential pathways macropores are free spaces in the soil created due to soil fauna activity plant root decay wetting and drying as well as freezing and thawing of the soil and erosive processes beven and germann 1982 many authors distinguish macropores from non macropores based on commonly accepted diameter limits e g chen and wagenet 1992 lin 2010 and according to greco 2002 the diameter of macropores is orders of magnitude larger than that of soil matrix textural pores vegetation strongly influences what types of macropores are formed in the soil shrub areas create large open macropores leading to deep soil layers archer et al 2002 and decaying grass roots form systems of macropores of even size beven and germann 1982 petersson et al 1987 showed a strong positive relationship between hydraulic conductivity and the root mass of trees this relationship however was more apparent in older stands with a greater share of dead roots and soil macropores formed after their death the bark of tree roots usually decays longer than xylem does so plant derived macropores are often filled with material originating from the decay of the root itself beven and germann 1982 such macropores can account for about 35 of the volume of forest soils and the number of macropores decreases with the depth of the soil profile aubertin 1971 difficult quantification of macropores allaire et al 2009 dohnal et al 2009 and large variability of macropore flow are among the reasons for hydrological rainfall runoff models to seldom include water flow through macropores weiler and naef 2003 vareecken et al 2016 although macropores account for a small share of the total soil porosity they may disproportionately influence soil infiltration properties buttle and house 1997 especially under heavy rainfall that exceeds the soil s ability to conduct water lee and foster 1991 mando et al 1996 methods of testing the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils and soils containing soil macropores are constantly being developed ma et al 2010 novák et al 2011 ilek and kucza 2014 germer and braun 2015 knowledge on hydraulic properties of such soils however is still limited particularly in terms of the influence of rock fragments and soil macropores on hydraulic conductivity the most important reason being a lack of simple methods for determining it in this type of soil to estimate hydraulic conductivity in situ tests make it possible to take into account all soil factors acting on it but such an estimate is subject to errors related to the disadvantages of the methods used to take into account heterogeneity of soils it is recommended to take either many samples iwanek 2005 or samples of large volume buchter et al 1984 according to novák et al 2011 determining hydraulic conductivity requires 1 m3 soil samples neither many samples nor large samples however may be enough to avoid errors altogether even sampling itself and the transport of samples may cause laboratory errors in various ways fodor et al 2011 thus taking undisturbed soil samples is a prerequisite for determining the impact of both rock fragments and soil macropores on hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils this paper thus supplements the method for estimating hydraulic conductivity using undisturbed soil samples ilek and kucza 2014 kucza and ilek 2016 we propose here how to enhance the method by taking into account the impact of rock fragments and soil macropores on the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils and in particular on the hydraulic conductivity of the medium conducting water in the soil that is soil matrix 2 material and methods 2 1 research area and sampling we evaluated the proposed method on 33 undisturbed samples taken from the humus a 19 samples and mineral b 14 samples soil layers from selected stands of the myślenice forest district located in south central poland a detailed description of the sampling method and the location of the research area can be found in ilek and kucza 2014 2 2 methodological assumptions of the research the laboratory method for determining hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils under steady saturated conditions proposed by ilek and kucza 2014 uses undisturbed samples since soil samples can have irregular shape depending on the sampling method the method estimates hydraulic conductivity based on the following formula 1 k k w k where k is the hydraulic conductivity m h 1 that would have been obtained if the sample had the shape of a regular cylinder k is the approximate value of hydraulic conductivity m h 1 obtained from direct measurements of undisturbed and irregularly shaped samples and wk is a conversion coefficient that takes into account the influence of irregular shape of the sample on the volume of water flowing through it in this work in addition to taking undisturbed samples we adopted an additional methodological assumption when estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity one should consider the hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix 2 mm which is the medium conducting water in the soil when calculating it one should consider how rock fragments soil macropores and the irregular shape of a sample affect the volume of water flowing through the sample therefore to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix of a forest stony soil we adopted the following formula 2 k fe k rc w r w k where kfe is the hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix m h 1 k rc the approximate value of hydraulic conductivity reduced by the influence of soil macropore s m h 1 and wr is a reduction coefficient that takes into account the impact of rock fragments on hydraulic conductivity since ilek and kucza 2014 and kucza and ilek 2016 described the influence of irregular shape of samples on hydraulic conductivity and the method of calculating the coefficient wk in the following sections we will describe only the method of measuring the coefficient k rc and the reduction coefficient wr 2 3 hydraulic conductivity k rc the first step in determining the kfe coefficient for individual soil samples is to determine the approximate coefficient k under steady saturated conditions in accordance with the procedures presented by ilek and kucza 2014 the value of k obtained from direct measurements on an undisturbed sample includes the influence of rock fragments soil macropores and the irregular shape of the sample on the volume of water flowing through the given sample if after determining k the sample contains at least one soil macropore the next step is to determine the hydraulic conductivity k rc a coefficient that takes into account the influence of the soil macropore s during the research we distinguished two main types of macropores 1 empty macropores fig 1 2 macropores filled with a material with a reduced bulk density relative to the rest of the sample fig 2 a in the case of filled macropores we removed their contents fig 2b and filled the resulting space with molten plasticine fig 2c the relatively small diameter and volume of empty macropores make it difficult to apply quick drying molten plasticine therefore they were usually filled with silicone using a thin dispensing tip next the sample was remeasured and the coefficient k rc was recalculated at the cross sectional area of the sample which was reduced by the average cross sectional area occupied in the sample by the medium filling the macropore ac the area ac m2 was calculated with the following formula 3 a c v c l where vc is the volume of the medium filling the macropore determined by the method of instantaneous displacement of water in a measuring cylinder m3 and l is the sample height m the hydraulic conductivity of individual macropores kc was determined from the difference between k and k rc coefficients in the case of samples with no soil macropores k rc was equal to k 2 4 the conversion coefficient wr the conversion coefficient wr which takes into account the influence of rock fragments on hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix was estimated with the following formula 4 w r 1 l rc 100 where lrc is the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix due to the presence of rock fragments with a given volume and average diameter in this medium to determine the wr coefficient for individual undisturbed soil samples we conducted experiments on artificial samples to analyse how the volume fraction of rock fragments rv and their average diameter d affect lrc figs 3 and 4 we assumed that the volume of water flowing in a given time through a sample of a homogeneous soil matrix with a given volume and porosity can be related to a volume of water flowing through a soil matrix of the same porosity but located in a sample containing a defined volume of rock fragments with a given diameter these relationships are as follows 5 q 1 q 0 v v r v or 6 q 1 q 0 v v r v where q 1 is the volume of water flowing through the soil matrix of a sample that contains rock fragments cm3 s 1 q 0 is the volume of water flowing through a sample of a homogeneous soil matrix cm3 s 1 v is a sample volume cm3 and vr is a volume of rock fragments cm3 if the equality 5 holds i there is a balance between factors that increase and decrease water infiltration through the soil matrix because of rock fragments ii rock fragments do not affect the volume of water flowing through the soil matrix and iii the differences between q 0 and q 1 are related only to the volume of rock fragments in the sample which is why the percentage reduction in the volume of water flowing through the sample can be considered directly proportional to the volume fraction of rock fragments rv under 6 so when the equality 5 does not hold rock fragments affect the volume of water flowing through the soil matrix either positively by enlarging water flow e g through lacunar pores or negatively e g rock fragments with different size causing different curvatures of water flow pathways thus the loss of water flow through a soil sample containing rock fragments lq is as follows 7 l q q 1 q 0 q 0 100 while the actual impact of rock fragments on the decrease in water flow through a soil matrix is as follows 8 l rc l q r v where lrc is the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix that is due to rock fragments lq the loss of water flow through a soil sample containing rock fragments and rv is the volume fraction of rock fragments of the given diameter the experiments on the influence of rock fragments on loss of water flow through a soil sample containing rock fragments lq eq 7 and lrc eq 8 was conducted using artificial samples prepared in a cylinder with a diameter of 125 mm and a height of 60 mm the soil matrix was calibrated sand with an average diameter of 0 17 mm to ensure good contact between the cylinder walls and the side surface of a sample and to prevent the formation of wall leakage during testing the inner wall of the cylinder was covered with a thin layer of aerosol silicone and then a layer of sand when the silicone dried the cylinder was placed in the apparatus for testing the hydraulic conductivity of undisturbed samples ilek and kucza 2014 the experiment started off by determining the hydraulic conductivity of five samples of pure sand these samples were prepared by gradually pouring sand into the cylinder while raising and lowering the water level in the outer cylinder of the apparatus such inducing of artificial variation in the water level resembled conditions of sand compaction and protected the samples against aeration as a constant value of sand s hydraulic conductivity we took the mean of five measurements 0 485 0 499 m h 1 which was 0 492 m h 1 the volume of water flow q 0 that corresponded to this mean value was assumed as a constant used to estimate the influence of rock fragments on hydraulic conductivity this effect was determined at six different volume fractions of rock fragments rv 31 7 21 2 15 1 10 3 7 1 and 2 9 for a given rv 7 8 replications were used varying in the mean diameter of rock fragments d these rv fractions were determined based on the volume occupied in the sample by the largest rock fragment in a given series of the experiment determined using the method of instantaneous displacement of water in a measuring cylinder the very same volumes of rock fragments with smaller diameters d were measured in the same way in the experiments with the other values of rv for this we used rock fragments of a roughly spherical shape sampled from the research area magura sandstone first we used sieves of 2 5 10 12 25 32 and 75 mm to divide the rock fragments into fractions and then immersed them in water for 14 days for individual rv fractions the rock fragments with the largest diameters were selected in the diameter range from 25 to 75 mm and the mean diameter of rock fragments d in the sample was calculated based on the following formulas 9 v d v r n and 10 d v d 1 33 π 3 5 where vd is the volume of an average rock fragment cm3 vr is the total volume of rock fragments in a sample cm3 n is the number of rock fragments in the sample d is the diameter of an individual rock fragment equal to the average diameter of rock fragments in the sample mm to study how rock fragments influence hydraulic conductivity we conducted an experiment on 44 artificial samples they were prepared under artificial fluctuations in the water level in the external cylinder of the apparatus the rock fragments being distributed uniformly throughout the sample this experiment led us to formulate the following relationship between the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix that is due to rock fragments lrc the volume fraction of rock fragments rv and their average diameter d mm 11 l rc b 0 b 1 r v b 2 r v d b 3 d b 4 d b 4 where b 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 are non linear regression coefficients estimated using statistica 13 1 pl software derived based on the artificial samples eq 11 was used to determine lrc and wr eq 4 for 33 undisturbed samples to this aim each sample was washed through a 2 mm sieve and the rock fragments separated that way were then sieved through 5 10 12 25 and 32 mm sieves next for each sample we determined the volume fraction of rock fragments of a given fraction the total volume fraction of rock fragments rv and their average diameter d the diameter d was calculated as the weighted mean volume of a given rock fragment fraction measured by the method of instantaneous displacement of water in a measuring cylinder to the total volume of rock fragments in the sample we estimated bulk density bd as dry mass of the sample per unit of volume and soil matrix bulk density bdfe as dry mass of the sample per unit of volume excluding the volume of rock fragments for samples containing filled macropores we also estimated the bulk density of a macropore bdc organic matter content in the material filling the macropore omc and organic matter content in the remaining part of the sample om the organic matter contents were determined by the loss on ignition method at a temperature of 550 c 3 results 3 1 the influence of rock fragments on the loss of water flow rate the percentage loss of water flow through samples containing rock fragments lq ranged from 24 8 to 1 6 the mean loss increasing with the increase in rock fragment fraction rv fig 5 and reaching the maximum loss for rv of 31 7 the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix lrc ranged from 5 0 to 24 4 under rv of 10 3 the average lrc loss was close to zero fig 6 which may indicate a neutral influence of rock fragments on water infiltration through soil matrix negative lrc losses under rv below 10 3 indicate rock fragments negative inhibitory effect only under rv over 10 3 rock fragments accelerate water flow through soil matrix and the largest positive lrc values occurred under rv of 31 7 fig 6 in addition to the fraction of rock fragments their mean diameter affected lrc too fig 7 regardless of the fraction the highest positive effect on the hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix occurred under the smallest diameters of rock fragments regardless of the diameter d under rv of 15 1 21 2 and 31 7 rock fragments usually enhanced water infiltration through the soil matrix when diameters d were close to 20 mm the lowest impact was 6 9 under rv of 31 7 under rv of 15 1 and 21 2 the impact was below 0 5 under rv of 2 9 7 1 and 10 3 the positive influence of rock fragments on the water permeability of the soil matrix was observed only at the smallest diameters d while the largest negative effect was observed under the 18 20 mm diameters where the lrc loss was in the range from 9 0 to 5 0 under the lowest rv fractions the neutral influence of rock fragments on the permeability of the soil matrix was observed for both the largest diameters and those close to 10 mm fig 7 table 1 shows the estimates along with their statistical significance of the parameters of eq 11 which represents the dependence of the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix lrc on the volume fraction of rock fragments rv and their average diameter d the model explained over 95 of the variability in lrc 3 2 hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils table 2 summarises various properties and other coefficients necessary to determine hydraulic conductivity of 33 samples and their soil matrix obtained from the top layers of forest stony soils the mean bulk density of samples containing rock fragments was 0 665 0 053 g cm 3 standard error of the mean in layer a and 1 184 0 036 g cm 3 in layer b soil matrix bulk density in layer a ranged from 0 217 to 0 856 g cm 3 mean of 0 592 0 048 g cm 3 while of layer b from 0 859 to 1 298 g cm 3 mean of 1 095 0 034 g cm 3 the volume fraction of rock fragments rv in the samples tested ranged from 0 2 to 21 7 in layer a mean rv was 4 7 1 1 while in layer b 8 5 1 3 the mean diameters of rock fragments d in layers a and b were similar 11 6 1 0 mm in layer a and 12 4 0 7 mm in layer b the actual loss of water flow through soil matrix lrc estimated with the model 11 showed both positive and negative impacts on hydraulic conductivity table 2 in layer a the mean lrc loss was 3 5 0 5 while in layer b 1 7 0 9 the mean reduction coefficient wr was 1 035 0 005 in layer a and 1 017 0 009 in layer b among nine samples that contained soil macropores six contained empty table 3 and three filled table 4 macropores most of the macropores including all the filled ones were found in layer a usually filled macropores occupied a much larger volume in the samples tested than empty ones did and their bulk density was on average 0 248 g cm 3 lower than that of the rest of the sample table 4 the hydraulic conductivity of the empty macropores ranged from 0 161 to 3 354 m h 1 while that of the filled macropores from 0 651 to 0 976 m h 1 meaning that the soil macropores significantly increased the hydraulic conductivity of the samples fig 8 a empty macropores increased the k value from two to nearly twenty four times while filled macropores from three to five times the hydraulic conductivity kfe which takes into account the influence of macropores rock fragments and irregular sample shape showed a clear relationship to the bulk density of soil matrix bdfe fig 8b the highest kfe values occurring under bdfe below 0 300 g cm 3 according to the mann whitney u test soil layers a and b differed in terms of the kfe coefficient p 0 0001 α 0 05 the mean hydraulic conductivity of soil matrix of layer a 0 541 0 078 m h 1 was almost three times higher than that of layer b 0 191 0 031 m h 1 4 discussion arising as a result of soil fauna activity and plant root death macropores determine the main route of water infiltration in the soil and influence hydraulic conductivity mbagwu 1995 kodešová et al 2006 fig 8a and tables 3 and 4 confirm these claims léonard and rajot 2001 showed that the activity of termites increases by two or three times water infiltration in the soil and that the presence of macropores of biological origin causes water to flow mainly through these macropores weiler and naef 2003 found that during extreme rainfall water flow is dominated by macropores formed by soil macrofauna earthworms but the flow uses only some of the macropores the remaining ones being either dry or reached by only a small amount of water the quantification of a macropore effect requires two values of hydraulic conductivity one that includes macropores and one that excludes them thus reducing hydraulic conductivity by considering its dependence on soil macropore s seems to be justified the loss of water flow through a soil sample containing rock fragments lq suggests that rock fragments reduce the water flow rate in the soil fig 5 and that the size of this reduction largely depends on the volume fraction of rock fragments ma and shao 2008 and novák et al 2011 also reported the decrease in infiltration due to the increase in rock fragment fraction yang et al 2013 showed the greatest decrease in infiltration at the 50 fraction of rock fragments and mao et al 2011 reported the lowest infiltration under the 20 30 fraction above which it again increased in zhou et al 2009 however the lowest infiltration was under the 40 fraction an increase in the rock fragment fraction in the soil on the one hand causes the area available for infiltrating water to decrease and the tortuosity of the flow to increase mehuys et al 1975 sauer and logsdon 2002 this increase in the rock fragment fraction on the other hand causes the bulk density of soil matrix the water conducting medium to decrease a process related to new pores being formed at the boundary between rock fragments and soil matrix poesen and lavee 1994 torri et al 1994 under rv over 10 water infiltration through the soil matrix accelerates fig 6 which is probably related to the increase in the contact area between rock fragments and soil matrix under rv over 10 the influence of factors inhibiting the flow through the soil matrix is lower that of the factors enhancing it it is under rv below 10 that the inhibiting factors gain dominance a mean lrc of 0 1 1 3 obtained for samples containing 10 3 of rock fragments indicates that under this fraction the effects of factors inhibiting water flow through the soil matrix and the effects of factors enhancing it balance each other in addition to rv the mean diameter of rock fragments affects hydraulic conductivity too diameters close to 20 mm have the least influence but the effect may be positive negative or neutral depending on rv fig 7 diameters below 10 mm speed up water infiltration through the soil increasing hydraulic conductivity up to about 25 under rv of 31 7 beckers et al 2016 showed that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a loamy soil increases with the rock fragment fraction but under some fractions the resistance to flowing water is greater for smaller stones than for larger ones yang et al 2013 found an increase in hydraulic conductivity with an increasing rock fragment diameter but novák et al 2011 reported an opposite effect hydraulic conductivity decreased with an increasing rock fragment diameter eq 11 describing the dependence of actual loss of water flow through soil matrix on rock fragments and their average diameter was developed using artificial samples taking into account only one type of soil matrix calibrated sand the equation was then applied for undisturbed samples characterised by natural particle packing and probably different hydraulic properties at the border between soil matrix and rock fragments than those of artificial samples direct contact between rock fragments and soil matrix leads to a change in porosity at the border between these two components grant and struchtemeyer 1959 jung 1960 causing local acceleration of water flow such a change can depend on differences in the bulk densities of rock fragments and soil matrix for example the processes of swelling and shrinkage of organic matter contained in forest soils may contribute to the formation of temporary voids along the soil stone interface lacunar pores and cause a preferential flow thereby increasing hydraulic conductivity hlaváčiková et al 2016 ma and shao 2008 and hlaváčiková et al 2016 claimed that the shape distribution and orientation of rock fragments affect hydraulic conductivity therefore to draw stronger conclusions about the effects of rock fragments on shaping the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils future studies should consider the shape and position of rock fragments and use homogenised soil matrix of forest soil along with another contrasting soil matrix such as silt clay and organic matter to prepare different artificial samples 5 summary and conclusions the present research on the effect of rock fragments on hydraulic conductivity in forest stony soils showed that rock fragments can either inhibit or accelerate water infiltration through a soil matrix depending on the volume fraction and mean diameter of rock fragments further studies should analyse how the type of soil matrix and the shape and position of rock fragments affect hydraulic conductivity we found that soil macropores play an important role in increasing the hydraulic conductivity of forest stony soils hydraulic conductivity strongly depends on soil matrix bulk density it is thus justified to take into account the influence of soil macropores and rock fragments on hydraulic conductivity in laboratory tests the proposed method for sampling and sample testing as well as for testing and taking into account the influence of soil fragments and soil macropores on hydraulic conductivity has disadvantages work time consumption and unsuitability for stony soils with large rock fragments stones and boulders these disadvantages however are outweighed by an important advantage the method ensures the preservation of the natural structure of samples as confirmed by the presence of empty and filled macropores in the collected samples thus the method gives the opportunity to study the hydraulic conductivity of the macropores themselves and to reach reliable results for the hydraulic conductivity of heterogeneous soils with a relatively small sample size although in some situations a material filling macropores can be difficult to remove e g when a filled macropore is located in the middle of an undisturbed sample the method proposed gives the possibility to study biological activity and physical and chemical properties of macropores which can be important not only for the field of hydrology but also for other fields conflict of interest none declared acknowledgements this research was financed by the ministry of science and higher education of the republic of poland the results presented in this paper have

6698,information on vertical soil moisture content smc profile is important for several hydro meteorological processes this study borrows the idea of coupling the memory and forcing from a previous study and develops a spatially varying statistical soil moisture profile ssmp model to estimate the vertical smc profile it uses only surface soil moisture 0 5 cm values and hydrological soil groups hsgs information of the location the focus of the study is incorporation of the hsg information to ensure the spatial transferability of the proposed model by capturing the spatial variations of soil moisture profile with the change in soil hydraulic properties the wide range of soil moisture data for model development as well as for spatial validation is obtained from 171 stations from different networks of international soil moisture network ismn at five different depths i e 5 10 20 51 and 102 cm the hsg information at the locations are extracted from the web soil survey wss database the potential of spatial transferability of the ssmp model is assessed by applying it to the new stations within the corresponding hsg model performances are promising for all four depth pairs 5 10 10 20 20 51 and 51 102 cm of all four hsgs during both model development and spatial validation given the model complexity hence the spatially varying ssmp model is suitable at the ungauged locations by incorporating the hsg information the potential application of the proposed model shows the future scope to assimilate the satellite based surface smc data into the model to develop a vertical soil moisture profile map over a large area keywords soil moisture content smc statistical model spatial transferability soil moisture profile hydrological soil group hsg 1 introduction soil moisture content smc of the unsaturated zone i e the vertical soil moisture profile plays a significant role in determining the water and energy fluxes between soil and atmosphere famiglietti et al 1998 as well as vegetation growth yang et al 2012 recently the retrieval of surface smc from remote sensing data is in the research interest due to its large scale and fine resolution estimation bertoldi et al 2014 however the remote sensing is capable of retrieving the soil moisture information only for the top few centimeters 5 10 cm of surface layer kerr et al 2010 the surface smc is associated with the root zone smc and it is possible to obtain soil moisture profile assessment using the surface soil moisture information calvet and noilhan 2000 albergel et al 2008 singh 2010 since it is coupled to root zone smc through diffusion processes singh 2010 utilizing this concept many studies have attempted to estimate the root zone soil moisture by extrapolating the surface soil moisture wagner et al 1999 manfreda et al 2014 manfreda et al 2014 renzullo et al 2014 dumedah et al 2015 the data assimilation techniques and the exponential filter proposed by wagner et al 1999 are the most extensively used methods among these the exponential filter needs the wilting level field capacity and porosity information and can be applied to the regions with same climatic and crop conditions these pre requisites limit the application of exponential filter as the information may not be available for the other ungauged locations its application is based on the assumption of a constant hydraulic conductivity of soil whereas in practical scenario it can vary by several degrees of magnitude soil moisture profile estimation from remote sensing data has focused on data assimilation into land surface models lsms based on the association of near surface soil moisture and the root zone soil moisture through diffusion processes lsms use the soil hydraulic property information derived from the pedotransfer function by cosby et al 1984 and a set of default or spatially uniform model parameters li et al 2011 these simplified and empirically derived default soil hydraulic parameters are inadequate to describe the soil moisture variability in spatially heterogeneous landscapes thus the uncertainties due to the inaccurate physical description of the water and energy balance hinder the application of such techniques sabater et al 2007 it is established that the mutual association of smc values decreases with the increase in the gap between two soil layers mahmood et al 2012 however the mutual association between smc at different soil depths and the stochastic features of soil moisture dynamics can be evaluated through statistical methods such as cross correlation method and vector auto regression var method kim and kim 2007 kim 2009 kim et al 2011 mahmood et al 2012 pal et al 2016 this study borrows the idea of coupling the memory temporal persistence and forcing input from overlying layers from pal et al 2016 the memory of smc is a measure of the time length when a moisture anomaly caused by wet or dry conditions is identifiable and impacts the atmosphere the importance of soil moisture memory has been investigated in many studies with autocorrelation based approaches markov chain chaos theory along with studying from observations integrations with lsms and atmospheric general circulation models agcms sridhar et al 2002 seneviratne et al 2006 yan et al 2015 sivakumar 2017 the autocorrelation based approaches used in agcms represent the variability of soil moisture memory component seneviratne et al 2006 using this soil moisture memory concept many studies have used the coupling in a particular region or season with meteorological forcings such as evapotranspiration precipitation or net radiation ghannam et al 2016 sörensson and menéndez 2011 seneviratne et al 2006 pal et al 2016 used the concept of coupling the soil moisture memory with the soil moisture information of the overlying layer which is considered the forcing to assess the root zone soil moisture by autocorrelation based approach however the spatial transferability was not investigated which is important so as to apply the developed model at ungauged locations the spatial variation of soil moisture is controlled by its association with soil texture vegetation topography precipitation and other hydroclimatic variables each of these interdependent controlling factors impacts the spatial distribution of smc depending on the characteristics of heterogeneity present in the area and varies with time and scale however the water holding capacity in the unsaturated zone and the variability of soil moisture distribution is directly influenced by the soil hydraulic properties price et al 2010 kim and barros 2002 and soil texture jawson and niemann 2007 the hydraulic properties of soil determine the hydraulic conductivity matric potentials affecting the flow of water through soil moisture available to plants gaur and mohanty 2013 and quantity of precipitation inflowing and retained in subsurface storage farres 1987 rawls et al 1993 cerda 1996 hence the incorporation of soil hydraulic properties in estimation of vertical soil moisture profile is beneficial the hydrological soil groups hsgs are categorized based on their infiltration characteristics which in turn mainly depend on the soil hydraulic properties especially the hydraulic conductivity the classification of various soil types based on these soil hydrologic factors is defined in the us national engineering handbook as four major hsgs viz a b c and d originally the soils were assigned to the four hsgs based on measured precipitation runoff and infiltration data musgrave 1955 simply the water transmitting soil layer with the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity depth to any layers that is more or less water impermeable and depth to a water table if present determines the hsg the rate of infiltration decreases from hsg a to hsg d usda 2009 a brief description on different hsgs is provided in table 1 the web soil survey wss operated by the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs suggests that the soils are allotted to one of the four hsgs according to the infiltration rate when the soils are not protected by vegetation thoroughly wet and get rainfall from long duration storms however the proposed approach utilizes the surface smc that already bears the signature of the above mentioned factors summarizing the aforementioned discussion the consideration of the hsgs implies the integration of the effects of the physical controls into the smc profile estimation and may provide a potential information to develop spatially varying statistical model to estimate vertical smc profile in brief based on the research gaps the objective of the study is to develop a spatially varying statistical approach linking the surface soil moisture to the deeper layers to estimate vertical smc profile borrowing the already established concept of coupling memory temporal persistence and forcing input from overlying layers the developed model is named as statistical soil moisture profile ssmp model the spatial transferability of the proposed statistical approach is explored through incorporating the hsg information since it demonstrates the effect of the physical controls viz soil texture hydraulic conductivity runoff and infiltration 2 data and study area the soil moisture time series data is obtained from the

develop the ssmp model as well as for the spatial validation which are described in the previous sections the daily time series of smc data is used from soil climate analysis network scan u s climate reference network uscrn and snowpack telemetry snotel networks the snotel system measures the soil moisture with the hydra probe sensor the temperature range of the probes is from 10 c to 65 c and these are able to measure water only in the liquid state therefore the studies using the soil moisture at different depths uses the soil moisture values corresponding to soil temperatures 0 c the hourly smc data is collected from total 171 monitoring stations from these three different networks at five different depths of 5 10 20 51 and 102 cm and converted to daily smc data the observed smc data from at least 20 stations with good quality data from each hsg hsg a 21 hsg b 28 hsg c 33 and hsg d 21 is used for the model development to incorporate the properties of vast range of smc variability into the proposed models henceforth these stations are called as model development stations it may be noted that the model testing is also carried out with these stations but for different time period remaining stations are used for spatial validation henceforth called spatial validation stations numbers of such stations from each hsg are as follows hsg a 17 hsg b 22 hsg c 17 and hsg d 17 the hsg of each monitoring stations are determined from the web soil survey wss https websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov app homepage htm it provides soil data and information produced by the national cooperative soil survey and operated by the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs 3 methodology 3 1 data preprocessing 3 1 1 missing value treatment missing data periods may be present in observed daily soil moisture data extensive periods 20 days of missing data are discarded since it cannot be filled up with reasonable accuracy moreover some time steps consist of the complete time series for deeper layers except the surface layer information such time steps are also discarded since the study attempts to obtain the complete vertical smc profile using only surface soil moisture information however shorter periods of missing values 20 days or less are substituted by simple linear interpolation from its preceding and successive soil moisture values pal et al 2016 fig 1 3 1 2 data transformation the transformation of data to a common probability distribution form is another important step since the soil moisture data at any two locations mostly do not follow the same range and distribution keeping spatial transferability as a focus of the developed model the data transformation to a common distribution is necessary secondly the proposed ssmp model is motivated by concept of the box jenkins approach to couple memory and forcing as established in an earlier study pal et al 2016 however with an additional consideration of spatial transferability as a requirement of any box jenkins approach the data should follow normal distribution which is the requirement of the proposed ssmp model as well box et al 2015 however the smc data may deviate sometime significantly from normal distribution choi and jacobs 2007 thus the data is transformed to follow an approximate normal distribution kernel density approach is used to transform the observed smc data to follow a normal distribution since any parametric distribution could not describe the observed smc data for any layers to develop the ssmp model the steps to transform the data x are as follows these steps can be read along with the fig 2 for an easy understanding step 1 non parametric kernel density approach is applied to obtain a non parametric probability density function pdf which is converted to cumulative distribution function cdf step 2 non exceedence probability of each data point is obtained using this cdf these values are also known as reduced variate shown as u in fig 2 step 3 the reduced variates are transformed through an inverse to standard normal distribution these values are shown as u in fig 2 step 4 the transformed standard normal variates are used for model development details are discussed in the subsequent sections step 5 the model estimated values are back transformed through a reverse process described in step 3 these values are shown as û in fig 2 step 6 the û values are back transformed through the inverse cdf developed in step 1 to obtain the corresponding estimated smc values x as shown in fig 2 it may be noted that the non parametric distribution using kernel density can be estimated as zambom and dias 2012 1 f x x 1 nh i 1 n k x x i h where n is the sample size k is the kernel smoothing function which defines the curve used to generate the pdf and h is the bandwidth which is a function of number of data points and vary accordingly for each station of each hsg normal kernel function is used in the present study to estimate the density of the observed smc data for all the depths the normal kernel function is represented by the following equation 2 k x 1 2 π e 1 2 x 2 after the data transformation the coupling approach is applied to the transformed data obtained from the observed data of each model development station of all four hsgs the following sub section describes the coupling equation to estimate the soil moisture at deeper layers which is based on the approach proposed by pal et al 2016 3 2 ssmp model firstly all the available stations both for model development stations and spatial validation stations are categorized into four groups according to the hsgs where the stations belong to at a particular model development station the estimation of soil moisture at deeper layers is based on the concept of coupling the memory and forcing as proposed by pal et al 2016 in the context of ssmp the memory may be defined as the previous values of soil moisture in the same layer underlying layer and the forcing may be defined as the current and previous values of the soil moisture of the overlying layer 3 2 1 model at a location adapted from pal et al 2016 the basic formulation of ssmp model at a location is represented by the following form of equation which is applied on the transformed data 3 s m k t i 1 p a i s m k t i j d q d 1 b j s m k 1 t j e t where s m k t is the transformed standard normal variate of soil moisture at the target depth k at time step t the s m k t i are the transformed standard normal variates of soil moisture at the target depth at preceding time steps where i 1 2 p the s m k 1 t j are the soil moisture of the overlying layer at preceding time steps where j 0 1 q 1 the weighting function coefficients for s m k t i and s m k 1 t j are represented as a i and b j the orders of the memory and forcing components are represented as p and q respectively and e t represents the white noise the relative delay between the input soil moisture time series s m k t i and the output soil moisture time series s m k t is shown as d the output is delayed with respect to the input if the values of d 0 however at daily scale this delay factor can be considered to be zero parameters of this model are the orders p and q and the corresponding coefficients a 1 a 2 a p and b 0 b 1 b q 1 of the memory and forcing components the orders of memory and forcing components show the number of days for a daily time series of the contribution of memory and forcing respectively the estimation of model order is based on a few statistical measures such as model fit mf mean square error mse and akaike s final prediction error fpe and the coefficients are estimated using the least square method which minimizes the summation of the square of the residuals as also used in pal et al 2016 the details of the parameter estimation criteria and methods are described in appendix a using this approach individual models at each station are developed for four depth pairs the adjoining layers i e 5 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 51 cm and 51 102 cm the next step is to define the specific model order and coefficient values for each hsg from the individual models developed to impart spatial transferability which is discussed in the next section 3 2 2 model with spatial transferability individual models developed at model development stations are grouped according to the hsgs the median value of the model orders corresponding to each depth pairs across all the stations within a particular hsg is computed these values are used as the final model orders for that particular depth pair and hsg this is repeated for all the depth pairs and hsgs subsequently the model coefficients are re computed with the final model orders at each station within a particular hsg used for model development next the mean values of the coefficients are computed these values are used as the final coefficients for that particular depth pair and hsg subject to the validity of stationarity assumption generally averaging the coefficients of different box jenkins models may lead to non stationarity of the resulting model hence the stationarity is checked before finalizing the set of ssmp model 3 3 spatial validation spatial validation of the developed ssmp model should be carried out at new locations having daily time series of only surface smc values and known hsg for this purpose the spatial validation stations are used the step wise description of the spatial validation is described as follows step 1 for a new location firstly the hsg information is noted and the observed surface smc values are transformed to standard normal variates using non parametric kernel density approach as explained in data transformation section steps 1 3 step 2 a cumulative distribution function cdf of smc values at each depth from all the model development stations within a particular hsg is generated using non parametric kernel density approach as explained in data transformation section steps 1 2 this is denoted as reference cdf since at ungauged stations the smc data at deeper layers is not available the reference cdf is assumed to be valid for the same depth within the same hsg step 3 according to the hsg of the new station the ssmp model is applied and the estimates values are obtained these are back transformed using standard normal distribution step 5 in data transformation section and then using the reference cdf for corresponding depth and hsg which is similar to the method explained in step 6 in data transformation section fig 2 step 4 the back transformed values for all the depths are finally corrected by adding the deviation in mean dm between the soil moisture regimes of the new locations and the model development stations the dm is computed by taking the difference between the mean of the surface smc values of the model development stations for the particular hsg and the target station this is due the fact that the soil moisture regimes of the new station may differ from the soil moisture regime of the model development stations the estimated smc values before and after dm correction are compared to the observed smc values 4 results and discussions 4 1 model orders and coefficients to determine the model orders the ssmp models for individual stations with the corresponding observed smc data from each hsg are developed during model development at each station the ranges of p and q are varied between 1 and 10 from which a parsimonious choice of the model order is identified using three criteria i e mf mse and fpe figs 3a and 3b shows the box plots of orders of memory and forcing of all the four depth pairs of these individual models the median values of the model orders observed in this step from each station corresponding to each hsg and each depth pair are finally assigned as the memory and forcing orders for that particular hsg the selected values of the model orders for all the depth pairs for each hsg are shown in table 2 with these selected model orders data from the model development stations are used to determine the model coefficients the obtained coefficients are averaged across all the stations within a hsg the mean values obtained for each depth pairs for a hsg are specified as the set of final coefficients of the ssmp model these values of the coefficients are shown in table 3 a close inspection of tables 2 and 3 reveals a few points the total number of model orders decreases from hsg a to hsg d i e with the decreasing infiltration capacity of the hsg it indicates that the total number of model orders decreases with the decrease in infiltration capacity of the hsgs a few more detailed observations especially the values of the model coefficients indicate some physical interpretation firstly it can be noted that the memory coefficients tend to be low to high from hsg a to hsg d in general indicating the dominating role of memory at deeper layers for the soils having low infiltration rate e g hsg d on contrast the forcing coefficients are distinctly noted to decrease from hsg a to hsg d for all the four depth pairs except a few aberrations it indicates that the forcing varies directly with the infiltration rate of the soil layer as the infiltration rate decreases from hsg a to hsg d hence it can be expected that the values of forcing coefficients for a particular depth accurately capture the infiltration trend across the four hsgs it is also noted that first few coefficients are much higher than the rest however these are not discarded because the model fitting criteria were already fixed and whatever small these coefficients may have some contribution to the model performance moreover it is observed that the memory coefficient of immediate previous time step a 1 increases in general with the increase in depth for all the four hsgs inversely the forcing coefficients of same and immediate previous time steps and b 1 decrease with the increase in depth for all the hsgs it is established in the literature that the memory dominates over the forcing component at the deeper layers whereas the forcing dominates over memory components at near surface layers pal et al 2016 mahmood et al 2012 this hypothesis is reinforced by the estimated coefficients of the proposed spatially varying ssmp model 4 2 model performance four different performance metrics are used in this study namely correlation of coefficient cc refined degree of agreement dr root mean square error rmse and unbiased root mean square error urmse the performance of the ssmp model is evaluated at each station ssmp performance this performance is compared with the performance of the model developed individually at each station individual performance the ssmp performance is expected to be bit inferior as compared to individual performance the model performances are carried out in terms of the average values of the performance metrics across the stations for each depth pair of each hsg the complete range of performance metrics i e the minimum maximum and average values of the performance metrics for all four depth pairs of all hsgs for the two cases mentioned are represented in tables s1 to s4 in the supplementary document it has been observed for all the depth pairs of all four hsgs that the model performances are almost comparable between two cases ssmp performance being a bit inferior for model development and testing periods further it is noticed that for both the cases and for all four hsgs the model performances decrease with increase in depth at some depths the model performance is better with the ssmp model for that particular hsg than the model developed with the observed data this implies that the hsg driven spatial transferability of the ssmp model is beneficial as reflected through the comparable ssmp and individual performance for rest of the manuscript model performance refers to ssmp performance the model performance at each station for all the hsgs at all four depths during development and testing periods is assessed through rmse figs 4a and 4b at 10 cm depth for other depths refer to figs s1 s4 in the supplementary document and other performance metrics not shown in these figures different tones are used to depict the variation of the model performance the stations with deeper tones indicate even better performance lower rmse as compared to lighter tones comparing the performance for all the depths it is noticed that for each hsg more number of stations are showing better performance towards the near surface layers compared to deeper layers a typical time series plots of observed and estimated smc using the ssmp model at one station from each hsg at all four depths are shown in fig 5 for hsg a and figs s5 s7 in the supplementary document for hsg b to hsg d from the figures it is noticed that the model is able to capture almost all the peaks of smc variation for the upper layers i e 10 and 20 cm depths for all four hsgs however for the deeper layers i e 51 and 102 cm higher deviation of estimated smc from the observed smc is noted the performance of ssmp model is also checked in terms of the variation of mean and standard deviation values of the estimated smc values for each depth pair and each hsg which are shown in fig 6 for hsg a and figs s8 s10 in the supplementary document for hsg b to hsg d in these figures the average value of these mean and the standard deviation values of observed and estimated smc are shown by the white diamonds in the boxes it has been investigated that these average values for observed and estimated smc vary insignificantly within the order of 0 001 both during model development and testing periods indicating a good model performance 4 3 spatial validation 4 3 1 reference cumulative distribution function cdf for spatial validation of the developed ssmp model the reference cdfs for all the depths except the surface layer of all hsgs are prepared as discussed in methodology the depth wise cdfs obtained from the smc time series of all the model development stations are shown in fig 7 for hsg a and figs s11 s13 in the supplementary document for hsg b to hsg d respectively it is noted that the smc values mostly vary from 0 to 0 65 for almost all the depths of all hsgs this general tendency is violated only for two cases i e the smc varies from 0 to 0 98 at 10 cm depth for hsg b and at 20 cm depth for hsg d we assume that the mean soil moisture at a real location may change but the distribution shape will remain same 4 3 2 model performance during the spatial validation firstly the developed ssmp model for each hsg is applied with the observed surface smc 5 cm at new locations to estimate the smc at 10 20 51 and 102 cm depths however the systematic bias i e the difference between the mean of observed smc and estimated smc at deeper layers are noted to be high for each hsg it can be attributed to the diverse regime of smc values of the model development stations than the smc values of spatial validation stations therefore as discussed in the methodology of spatial validation the regimes of observed surface smc values for the model development and the target station are matched by computing the deviation in mean dm for the surface layer the mean values of the surface smc time series of all the model developing stations are found to be 0 141 0 171 0 198 and 0 239 for hsg a b c and d respectively the dm for each station for a particular hsg is obtained by subtracting the mean smc of surface layer of the target station from the mean value of the surface layer from the model development stations for that particular hsg the dm is added to the estimated smc values for the deeper layers of the target stations to obtain the final dm corrected smc of the deeper layers this helps to correct the model bias to some extent and maintain the soil moisture regime for the target station in this process possible occurrences of negative smc values if any are replaced by zero a typical example of the complete process of obtaining the dm corrected smc values at deeper layers for hsg a similar for all four hsgs can be described as following the ssmp model for hsg a is obtained from tables 2 and 3 respectively for implementing the ssmp model for spatial validation a new station belonging to hsg a is selected of which surface smc information would be utilized however the smc distribution information of the deeper layers of the newly selected station is unavailable which is required to back transform the reduced variates to attain the corresponding smc the unavailability demands the use of the reference cdfs obtained from the model developing stations as shown in fig 7 and figs s13 s15 in the supplementary document for each depth after estimating the smc at each layer using the ssmp model the dm correction is performed to attain the final estimates of the smc values as discussed the mean of surface smc values of all model development stations from hsg a is 0 141and the mean value of surface smc of the target station pauakala is computed as 0 337 subsequently the dm i e the difference between the mean of surface layer smc of model development stations and the target station is found to be 0 1968 lastly the dm corrected final smc values are obtained after subtracting the dm from the values estimated from ssmp model table s5 in the supplementary document shows the estimated smc values of first 10 steps after removing the initial values pal et al 2016 to check whether the dm can be beneficially used in spatial transferability the following analysis is carried out systematic bias i e the difference in the mean of estimated smc and the mean of observed smc for each deeper layer for the target station is computed it has been noticed that the dm successfully indicates the biases both magnitude and direction for the deeper layers for almost all the stations since in almost all the cases the biases vary within 10 of the surface dm however there are some stations for each depth from each hsg which do not follow the trend and number of such stations is shown in table 4 exception of this fact for some cases as seen in table 4 can be ignored keeping the possibility of uncertainty in the data in mind the comparison of the model performances during spatial validation for the two cases i e i case 1 the model performance without the dm corrected estimated smc for deeper layers and ii case 2 the model performance with the dm corrected values are presented to show the requirement of dm correction in tables s6 s9 in the supplementary document it clearly shows that the superiority of the model performance during the second case i e after dm correction the performance metrics values i e cc dr rmse and urmse shows that the differences of cc of all the four depths from all four hsgs between the two cases range from 0 006 to 0 012 which is quite low however the values of dr rmse and urmse of all the four depths from all four hsgs are observed to be significantly improved in the second case where dm corrected values are used fig 8 represents a time series plot of observed estimated smc values with and without dm correction for all four depths of a station from hsg a where the improvement of smc estimation after dm correction at each depth is evident other such plots from remaining hsgs are also prepared and similar outcome is observed hence in the manuscript only one such example is shown to avoid repetition therefore the comparative analyses discussed above suggests the dm correction of the ssmp model estimated values is essential for ungauged locations and hence is the final step of spatial validation the performances of the ssmp model for each hsg during spatial validation are also shown by the comparison of the mean and the standard deviation values of each station for all hsgs of the observed and estimated smc in figs 9a and 9b respectively for each depth pair the difference in average values of the mean and standard deviation of observed smc and dm corrected estimated smc for all four hsgs vary from 0 02 to 0 077 and 0 022 0 085 respectively for all four depth pairs hence it can be concluded that the proposed statistical approach can almost correctly characterize the mean of smc for all depths of all four hsgs although the characterization of standard deviation is comparatively poor however the values of performance metrics during spatial validation show a reasonably acceptable model performance given the possibility of uncertainty present due to various unaccounted physical controls of the ungauged location finally the theory of using only the surface smc information to estimate the vertical smc profile for different hsgs in proposed spatially varying ssmp model shows the efficient applicability to the locations where the smc information for deeper layers is not available 5 summary and conclusions in this study a spatially varying statistical soil moisture profile ssmp model is developed the key features of the ssmp model are 1 estimating the vertical smc profile using only the surface smc and 2 imparting the spatial transferability by incorporating the hsg information the smc data are obtained from 171 monitoring stations from scan uscrn and snotel network scattered over entire usa from ismn database at 5 10 20 51 and 102 cm depths and the hsg information of each monitoring stations are determined from the wss during the model development the forcing components show the trend of decreasing in the direction of hsg a to hsg d i e the forcing coefficients are higher for high infiltration hsg a and low for low infiltration hsg d of the soil this specific feature of the forcing components for different hsgs having different infiltration characteristics including the effects of the of soil hydraulic properties on the smc dynamics justifies the applicability of the spatially varying ssmp model for each hsg group to new locations the potential of spatially varying ssmp model developed are investigated by comparison of the model performances of the station wise observed data specific models and the proposed spatially varying models the efficacy of the developed spatially varying ssmp model in terms of spatial transferability is also investigated by applying the models to new monitoring stations of each hsg the difference in smc regimes of the model development stations and the target stations drives the study to compute the deviation in mean dm of the model developing stations and stations selected for spatial validation for surface layers the dm corrected estimated smc values of deeper layers obtained during the spatial validation gives better model performances for all four hsgs for both the cases model development and spatial validation the model performances illustrated indicate that the developed spatially varying ssmp model are able to characterize the smc at deeper layers from only the surface smc information for all hsg and all depths however it has also been studied that the model performance consistently decreases with increase in depths for all the four hsgs but still acceptable given the complexity of the model considering the key features of the developed model future scope lies in the integration of remotely sensed surface soil moisture content 0 5 cm in the estimation of large scale fine resolution vertical soil moisture profile up to root zone it is expected to be useful

orders of the memory and forcing components are represented as p and q respectively the optimum values of model order of each soil moisture time series are selected based on the desired model order

values of the aforementioned model order identification criteria the next step of the ssmp model development is to determine the model coefficients the methodology to estimate the model coefficients is described in the following section a2 model coefficients the coefficients of the ssmp model are estimated by the least square method which minimizes the summation of the square of the residuals

6698,information on vertical soil moisture content smc profile is important for several hydro meteorological processes this study borrows the idea of coupling the memory and forcing from a previous study and develops a spatially varying statistical soil moisture profile ssmp model to estimate the vertical smc profile it uses only surface soil moisture 0 5 cm values and hydrological soil groups hsgs information of the location the focus of the study is incorporation of the hsg information to ensure the spatial transferability of the proposed model by capturing the spatial variations of soil moisture profile with the change in soil hydraulic properties the wide range of soil moisture data for model development as well as for spatial validation is obtained from 171 stations from different networks of international soil moisture network ismn at five different depths i e 5 10 20 51 and 102 cm the hsg information at the locations are extracted from the web soil survey wss database the potential of spatial transferability of the ssmp model is assessed by applying it to the new stations within the corresponding hsg model performances are promising for all four depth pairs 5 10 10 20 20 51 and 51 102 cm of all four hsgs during both model development and spatial validation given the model complexity hence the spatially varying ssmp model is suitable at the ungauged locations by incorporating the hsg information the potential application of the proposed model shows the future scope to assimilate the satellite based surface smc data into the model to develop a vertical soil moisture profile map over a large area keywords soil moisture content smc statistical model spatial transferability soil moisture profile hydrological soil group hsg 1 introduction soil moisture content smc of the unsaturated zone i e the vertical soil moisture profile plays a significant role in determining the water and energy fluxes between soil and atmosphere famiglietti et al 1998 as well as vegetation growth yang et al 2012 recently the retrieval of surface smc from remote sensing data is in the research interest due to its large scale and fine resolution estimation bertoldi et al 2014 however the remote sensing is capable of retrieving the soil moisture information only for the top few centimeters 5 10 cm of surface layer kerr et al 2010 the surface smc is associated with the root zone smc and it is possible to obtain soil moisture profile assessment using the surface soil moisture information calvet and noilhan 2000 albergel et al 2008 singh 2010 since it is coupled to root zone smc through diffusion processes singh 2010 utilizing this concept many studies have attempted to estimate the root zone soil moisture by extrapolating the surface soil moisture wagner et al 1999 manfreda et al 2014 manfreda et al 2014 renzullo et al 2014 dumedah et al 2015 the data assimilation techniques and the exponential filter proposed by wagner et al 1999 are the most extensively used methods among these the exponential filter needs the wilting level field capacity and porosity information and can be applied to the regions with same climatic and crop conditions these pre requisites limit the application of exponential filter as the information may not be available for the other ungauged locations its application is based on the assumption of a constant hydraulic conductivity of soil whereas in practical scenario it can vary by several degrees of magnitude soil moisture profile estimation from remote sensing data has focused on data assimilation into land surface models lsms based on the association of near surface soil moisture and the root zone soil moisture through diffusion processes lsms use the soil hydraulic property information derived from the pedotransfer function by cosby et al 1984 and a set of default or spatially uniform model parameters li et al 2011 these simplified and empirically derived default soil hydraulic parameters are inadequate to describe the soil moisture variability in spatially heterogeneous landscapes thus the uncertainties due to the inaccurate physical description of the water and energy balance hinder the application of such techniques sabater et al 2007 it is established that the mutual association of smc values decreases with the increase in the gap between two soil layers mahmood et al 2012 however the mutual association between smc at different soil depths and the stochastic features of soil moisture dynamics can be evaluated through statistical methods such as cross correlation method and vector auto regression var method kim and kim 2007 kim 2009 kim et al 2011 mahmood et al 2012 pal et al 2016 this study borrows the idea of coupling the memory temporal persistence and forcing input from overlying layers from pal et al 2016 the memory of smc is a measure of the time length when a moisture anomaly caused by wet or dry conditions is identifiable and impacts the atmosphere the importance of soil moisture memory has been investigated in many studies with autocorrelation based approaches markov chain chaos theory along with studying from observations integrations with lsms and atmospheric general circulation models agcms sridhar et al 2002 seneviratne et al 2006 yan et al 2015 sivakumar 2017 the autocorrelation based approaches used in agcms represent the variability of soil moisture memory component seneviratne et al 2006 using this soil moisture memory concept many studies have used the coupling in a particular region or season with meteorological forcings such as evapotranspiration precipitation or net radiation ghannam et al 2016 sörensson and menéndez 2011 seneviratne et al 2006 pal et al 2016 used the concept of coupling the soil moisture memory with the soil moisture information of the overlying layer which is considered the forcing to assess the root zone soil moisture by autocorrelation based approach however the spatial transferability was not investigated which is important so as to apply the developed model at ungauged locations the spatial variation of soil moisture is controlled by its association with soil texture vegetation topography precipitation and other hydroclimatic variables each of these interdependent controlling factors impacts the spatial distribution of smc depending on the characteristics of heterogeneity present in the area and varies with time and scale however the water holding capacity in the unsaturated zone and the variability of soil moisture distribution is directly influenced by the soil hydraulic properties price et al 2010 kim and barros 2002 and soil texture jawson and niemann 2007 the hydraulic properties of soil determine the hydraulic conductivity matric potentials affecting the flow of water through soil moisture available to plants gaur and mohanty 2013 and quantity of precipitation inflowing and retained in subsurface storage farres 1987 rawls et al 1993 cerda 1996 hence the incorporation of soil hydraulic properties in estimation of vertical soil moisture profile is beneficial the hydrological soil groups hsgs are categorized based on their infiltration characteristics which in turn mainly depend on the soil hydraulic properties especially the hydraulic conductivity the classification of various soil types based on these soil hydrologic factors is defined in the us national engineering handbook as four major hsgs viz a b c and d originally the soils were assigned to the four hsgs based on measured precipitation runoff and infiltration data musgrave 1955 simply the water transmitting soil layer with the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity depth to any layers that is more or less water impermeable and depth to a water table if present determines the hsg the rate of infiltration decreases from hsg a to hsg d usda 2009 a brief description on different hsgs is provided in table 1 the web soil survey wss operated by the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs suggests that the soils are allotted to one of the four hsgs according to the infiltration rate when the soils are not protected by vegetation thoroughly wet and get rainfall from long duration storms however the proposed approach utilizes the surface smc that already bears the signature of the above mentioned factors summarizing the aforementioned discussion the consideration of the hsgs implies the integration of the effects of the physical controls into the smc profile estimation and may provide a potential information to develop spatially varying statistical model to estimate vertical smc profile in brief based on the research gaps the objective of the study is to develop a spatially varying statistical approach linking the surface soil moisture to the deeper layers to estimate vertical smc profile borrowing the already established concept of coupling memory temporal persistence and forcing input from overlying layers the developed model is named as statistical soil moisture profile ssmp model the spatial transferability of the proposed statistical approach is explored through incorporating the hsg information since it demonstrates the effect of the physical controls viz soil texture hydraulic conductivity runoff and infiltration 2 data and study area the soil moisture time series data is obtained from the international soil moisture network ismn website dorigo et al 2011 http www wcc nrcs usda gov scan initiated by vienna university of technology austria the worldwide in situ soil moisture measurements from different networks and validation operations are collected synchronized and made accessible to users through the ismn this study utilizes the soil moisture data from three different networks to develop the ssmp model as well as for the spatial validation which are described in the previous sections the daily time series of smc data is used from soil climate analysis network scan u s climate reference network uscrn and snowpack telemetry snotel networks the snotel system measures the soil moisture with the hydra probe sensor the temperature range of the probes is from 10 c to 65 c and these are able to measure water only in the liquid state therefore the studies using the soil moisture at different depths uses the soil moisture values corresponding to soil temperatures 0 c the hourly smc data is collected from total 171 monitoring stations from these three different networks at five different depths of 5 10 20 51 and 102 cm and converted to daily smc data the observed smc data from at least 20 stations with good quality data from each hsg hsg a 21 hsg b 28 hsg c 33 and hsg d 21 is used for the model development to incorporate the properties of vast range of smc variability into the proposed models henceforth these stations are called as model development stations it may be noted that the model testing is also carried out with these stations but for different time period remaining stations are used for spatial validation henceforth called spatial validation stations numbers of such stations from each hsg are as follows hsg a 17 hsg b 22 hsg c 17 and hsg d 17 the hsg of each monitoring stations are determined from the web soil survey wss https websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov app homepage htm it provides soil data and information produced by the national cooperative soil survey and operated by the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs 3 methodology 3 1 data preprocessing 3 1 1 missing value treatment missing data periods may be present in observed daily soil moisture data extensive periods 20 days of missing data are discarded since it cannot be filled up with reasonable accuracy moreover some time steps consist of the complete time series for deeper layers except the surface layer information such time steps are also discarded since the study attempts to obtain the complete vertical smc profile using only surface soil moisture information however shorter periods of missing values 20 days or less are substituted by simple linear interpolation from its preceding and successive soil moisture values pal et al 2016 fig 1 3 1 2 data transformation the transformation of data to a common probability distribution form is another important step since the soil moisture data at any two locations mostly do not follow the same range and distribution keeping spatial transferability as a focus of the developed model the data transformation to a common distribution is necessary secondly the proposed ssmp model is motivated by concept of the box jenkins approach to couple memory and forcing as established in an earlier study pal et al 2016 however with an additional consideration of spatial transferability as a requirement of any box jenkins approach the data should follow normal distribution which is the requirement of the proposed ssmp model as well box et al 2015 however the smc data may deviate sometime significantly from normal distribution choi and jacobs 2007 thus the data is transformed to follow an approximate normal distribution kernel density approach is used to transform the observed smc data to follow a normal distribution since any parametric distribution could not describe the observed smc data for any layers to develop the ssmp model the steps to transform the data x are as follows these steps can be read along with the fig 2 for an easy understanding step 1 non parametric kernel density approach is applied to obtain a non parametric probability density function pdf which is converted to cumulative distribution function cdf step 2 non exceedence probability of each data point is obtained using this cdf these values are also known as reduced variate shown as u in fig 2 step 3 the reduced variates are transformed through an inverse to standard normal distribution these values are shown as u in fig 2 step 4 the transformed standard normal variates are used for model development details are discussed in the subsequent sections step 5 the model estimated values are back transformed through a reverse process described in step 3 these values are shown as û in fig 2 step 6 the û values are back transformed through the inverse cdf developed in step 1 to obtain the corresponding estimated smc values x as shown in fig 2 it may be noted that the non parametric distribution using kernel density can be estimated as zambom and dias 2012 1 f x x 1 nh i 1 n k x x i h where n is the sample size k is the kernel smoothing function which defines the curve used to generate the pdf and h is the bandwidth which is a function of number of data points and vary accordingly for each station of each hsg normal kernel function is used in the present study to estimate the density of the observed smc data for all the depths the normal kernel function is represented by the following equation 2 k x 1 2 π e 1 2 x 2 after the data transformation the coupling approach is applied to the transformed data obtained from the observed data of each model development station of all four hsgs the following sub section describes the coupling equation to estimate the soil moisture at deeper layers which is based on the approach proposed by pal et al 2016 3 2 ssmp model firstly all the available stations both for model development stations and spatial validation stations are categorized into four groups according to the hsgs where the stations belong to at a particular model development station the estimation of soil moisture at deeper layers is based on the concept of coupling the memory and forcing as proposed by pal et al 2016 in the context of ssmp the memory may be defined as the previous values of soil moisture in the same layer underlying layer and the forcing may be defined as the current and previous values of the soil moisture of the overlying layer 3 2 1 model at a location adapted from pal et al 2016 the basic formulation of ssmp model at a location is represented by the following form of equation which is applied on the transformed data 3 s m k t i 1 p a i s m k t i j d q d 1 b j s m k 1 t j e t where s m k t is the transformed standard normal variate of soil moisture at the target depth k at time step t the s m k t i are the transformed standard normal variates of soil moisture at the target depth at preceding time steps where i 1 2 p the s m k 1 t j are the soil moisture of the overlying layer at preceding time steps where j 0 1 q 1 the weighting function coefficients for s m k t i and s m k 1 t j are represented as a i and b j the orders of the memory and forcing components are represented as p and q respectively and e t represents the white noise the relative delay between the input soil moisture time series s m k t i and the output soil moisture time series s m k t is shown as d the output is delayed with respect to the input if the values of d 0 however at daily scale this delay factor can be considered to be zero parameters of this model are the orders p and q and the corresponding coefficients a 1 a 2 a p and b 0 b 1 b q 1 of the memory and forcing components the orders of memory and forcing components show the number of days for a daily time series of the contribution of memory and forcing respectively the estimation of model order is based on a few statistical measures such as model fit mf mean square error mse and akaike s final prediction error fpe and the coefficients are estimated using the least square method which minimizes the summation of the square of the residuals as also used in pal et al 2016 the details of the parameter estimation criteria and methods are described in appendix a using this approach individual models at each station are developed for four depth pairs the adjoining layers i e 5 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 51 cm and 51 102 cm the next step is to define the specific model order and coefficient values for each hsg from the individual models developed to impart spatial transferability which is discussed in the next section 3 2 2 model with spatial transferability individual models developed at model development stations are grouped according to the hsgs the median value of the model orders corresponding to each depth pairs across all the stations within a particular hsg is computed these values are used as the final model orders for that particular depth pair and hsg this is repeated for all the depth pairs and hsgs subsequently the model coefficients are re computed with the final model orders at each station within a particular hsg used for model development next the mean values of the coefficients are computed these values are used as the final coefficients for that particular depth pair and hsg subject to the validity of stationarity assumption generally averaging the coefficients of different box jenkins models may lead to non stationarity of the resulting model hence the stationarity is checked before finalizing the set of ssmp model 3 3 spatial validation spatial validation of the developed ssmp model should be carried out at new locations having daily time series of only surface smc values and known hsg for this purpose the spatial validation stations are used the step wise description of the spatial validation is described as follows step 1 for a new location firstly the hsg information is noted and the observed surface smc values are transformed to standard normal variates using non parametric kernel density approach as explained in data transformation section steps 1 3 step 2 a cumulative distribution function cdf of smc values at each depth from all the model development stations within a particular hsg is generated using non parametric kernel density approach as explained in data transformation section steps 1 2 this is denoted as reference cdf since at ungauged stations the smc data at deeper layers is not available the reference cdf is assumed to be valid for the same depth within the same hsg step 3 according to the hsg of the new station the ssmp model is applied and the estimates values are obtained these are back transformed using standard normal distribution step 5 in data transformation section and then using the reference cdf for corresponding depth and hsg which is similar to the method explained in step 6 in data transformation section fig 2 step 4 the back transformed values for all the depths are finally corrected by adding the deviation in mean dm between the soil moisture regimes of the new locations and the model development stations the dm is computed by taking the difference between the mean of the surface smc values of the model development stations for the particular hsg and the target station this is due the fact that the soil moisture regimes of the new station may differ from the soil moisture regime of the model development stations the estimated smc values before and after dm correction are compared to the observed smc values 4 results and discussions 4 1 model orders and coefficients to determine the model orders the ssmp models for individual stations with the corresponding observed smc data from each hsg are developed during model development at each station the ranges of p and q are varied between 1 and 10 from which a parsimonious choice of the model order is identified using three criteria i e mf mse and fpe figs 3a and 3b shows the box plots of orders of memory and forcing of all the four depth pairs of these individual models the median values of the model orders observed in this step from each station corresponding to each hsg and each depth pair are finally assigned as the memory and forcing orders for that particular hsg the selected values of the model orders for all the depth pairs for each hsg are shown in table 2 with these selected model orders data from the model development stations are used to determine the model coefficients the obtained coefficients are averaged across all the stations within a hsg the mean values obtained for each depth pairs for a hsg are specified as the set of final coefficients of the ssmp model these values of the coefficients are shown in table 3 a close inspection of tables 2 and 3 reveals a few points the total number of model orders decreases from hsg a to hsg d i e with the decreasing infiltration capacity of the hsg it indicates that the total number of model orders decreases with the decrease in infiltration capacity of the hsgs a few more detailed observations especially the values of the model coefficients indicate some physical interpretation firstly it can be noted that the memory coefficients tend to be low to high from hsg a to hsg d in general indicating the dominating role of memory at deeper layers for the soils having low infiltration rate e g hsg d on contrast the forcing coefficients are distinctly noted to decrease from hsg a to hsg d for all the four depth pairs except a few aberrations it indicates that the forcing varies directly with the infiltration rate of the soil layer as the infiltration rate decreases from hsg a to hsg d hence it can be expected that the values of forcing coefficients for a particular depth accurately capture the infiltration trend across the four hsgs it is also noted that first few coefficients are much higher than the rest however these are not discarded because the model fitting criteria were already fixed and whatever small these coefficients may have some contribution to the model performance moreover it is observed that the memory coefficient of immediate previous time step a 1 increases in general with the increase in depth for all the four hsgs inversely the forcing coefficients of same and immediate previous time steps and b 1 decrease with the increase in depth for all the hsgs it is established in the literature that the memory dominates over the forcing component at the deeper layers whereas the forcing dominates over memory components at near surface layers pal et al 2016 mahmood et al 2012 this hypothesis is reinforced by the estimated coefficients of the proposed spatially varying ssmp model 4 2 model performance four different performance metrics are used in this study namely correlation of coefficient cc refined degree of agreement dr root mean square error rmse and unbiased root mean square error urmse the performance of the ssmp model is evaluated at each station ssmp performance this performance is compared with the performance of the model developed individually at each station individual performance the ssmp performance is expected to be bit inferior as compared to individual performance the model performances are carried out in terms of the average values of the performance metrics across the stations for each depth pair of each hsg the complete range of performance metrics i e the minimum maximum and average values of the performance metrics for all four depth pairs of all hsgs for the two cases mentioned are represented in tables s1 to s4 in the supplementary document it has been observed for all the depth pairs of all four hsgs that the model performances are almost comparable between two cases ssmp performance being a bit inferior for model development and testing periods further it is noticed that for both the cases and for all four hsgs the model performances decrease with increase in depth at some depths the model performance is better with the ssmp model for that particular hsg than the model developed with the observed data this implies that the hsg driven spatial transferability of the ssmp model is beneficial as reflected through the comparable ssmp and individual performance for rest of the manuscript model performance refers to ssmp performance the model performance at each station for all the hsgs at all four depths during development and testing periods is assessed through rmse figs 4a and 4b at 10 cm depth for other depths refer to figs s1 s4 in the supplementary document and other performance metrics not shown in these figures different tones are used to depict the variation of the model performance the stations with deeper tones indicate even better performance lower rmse as compared to lighter tones comparing the performance for all the depths it is noticed that for each hsg more number of stations are showing better performance towards the near surface layers compared to deeper layers a typical time series plots of observed and estimated smc using the ssmp model at one station from each hsg at all four depths are shown in fig 5 for hsg a and figs s5 s7 in the supplementary document for hsg b to hsg d from the figures it is noticed that the model is able to capture almost all the peaks of smc variation for the upper layers i e 10 and 20 cm depths for all four hsgs however for the deeper layers i e 51 and 102 cm higher deviation of estimated smc from the observed smc is noted the performance of ssmp model is also checked in terms of the variation of mean and standard deviation values of the estimated smc values for each depth pair and each hsg which are shown in fig 6 for hsg a and figs s8 s10 in the supplementary document for hsg b to hsg d in these figures the average value of these mean and the standard deviation values of observed and estimated smc are shown by the white diamonds in the boxes it has been investigated that these average values for observed and estimated smc vary insignificantly within the order of 0 001 both during model development and testing periods indicating a good model performance 4 3 spatial validation 4 3 1 reference cumulative distribution function cdf for spatial validation of the developed ssmp model the reference cdfs for all the depths except the surface layer of all hsgs are prepared as discussed in methodology the depth wise cdfs obtained from the smc time series of all the model development stations are shown in fig 7 for hsg a and figs s11 s13 in the supplementary document for hsg b to hsg d respectively it is noted that the smc values mostly vary from 0 to 0 65 for almost all the depths of all hsgs this general tendency is violated only for two cases i e the smc varies from 0 to 0 98 at 10 cm depth for hsg b and at 20 cm depth for hsg d we assume that the mean soil moisture at a real location may change but the distribution shape will remain same 4 3 2 model performance during the spatial validation firstly the developed ssmp model for each hsg is applied with the observed surface smc 5 cm at new locations to estimate the smc at 10 20 51 and 102 cm depths however the systematic bias i e the difference between the mean of observed smc and estimated smc at deeper layers are noted to be high for each hsg it can be attributed to the diverse regime of smc values of the model development stations than the smc values of spatial validation stations therefore as discussed in the methodology of spatial validation the regimes of observed surface smc values for the model development and the target station are matched by computing the deviation in mean dm for the surface layer the mean values of the surface smc time series of all the model developing stations are found to be 0 141 0 171 0 198 and 0 239 for hsg a b c and d respectively the dm for each station for a particular hsg is obtained by subtracting the mean smc of surface layer of the target station from the mean value of the surface layer from the model development stations for that particular hsg the dm is added to the estimated smc values for the deeper layers of the target stations to obtain the final dm corrected smc of the deeper layers this helps to correct the model bias to some extent and maintain the soil moisture regime for the target station in this process possible occurrences of negative smc values if any are replaced by zero a typical example of the complete process of obtaining the dm corrected smc values at deeper layers for hsg a similar for all four hsgs can be described as following the ssmp model for hsg a is obtained from tables 2 and 3 respectively for implementing the ssmp model for spatial validation a new station belonging to hsg a is selected of which surface smc information would be utilized however the smc distribution information of the deeper layers of the newly selected station is unavailable which is required to back transform the reduced variates to attain the corresponding smc the unavailability demands the use of the reference cdfs obtained from the model developing stations as shown in fig 7 and figs s13 s15 in the supplementary document for each depth after estimating the smc at each layer using the ssmp model the dm correction is performed to attain the final estimates of the smc values as discussed the mean of surface smc values of all model development stations from hsg a is 0 141and the mean value of surface smc of the target station pauakala is computed as 0 337 subsequently the dm i e the difference between the mean of surface layer smc of model development stations and the target station is found to be 0 1968 lastly the dm corrected final smc values are obtained after subtracting the dm from the values estimated from ssmp model table s5 in the supplementary document shows the estimated smc values of first 10 steps after removing the initial values pal et al 2016 to check whether the dm can be beneficially used in spatial transferability the following analysis is carried out systematic bias i e the difference in the mean of estimated smc and the mean of observed smc for each deeper layer for the target station is computed it has been noticed that the dm successfully indicates the biases both magnitude and direction for the deeper layers for almost all the stations since in almost all the cases the biases vary within 10 of the surface dm however there are some stations for each depth from each hsg which do not follow the trend and number of such stations is shown in table 4 exception of this fact for some cases as seen in table 4 can be ignored keeping the possibility of uncertainty in the data in mind the comparison of the model performances during spatial validation for the two cases i e i case 1 the model performance without the dm corrected estimated smc for deeper layers and ii case 2 the model performance with the dm corrected values are presented to show the requirement of dm correction in tables s6 s9 in the supplementary document it clearly shows that the superiority of the model performance during the second case i e after dm correction the performance metrics values i e cc dr rmse and urmse shows that the differences of cc of all the four depths from all four hsgs between the two cases range from 0 006 to 0 012 which is quite low however the values of dr rmse and urmse of all the four depths from all four hsgs are observed to be significantly improved in the second case where dm corrected values are used fig 8 represents a time series plot of observed estimated smc values with and without dm correction for all four depths of a station from hsg a where the improvement of smc estimation after dm correction at each depth is evident other such plots from remaining hsgs are also prepared and similar outcome is observed hence in the manuscript only one such example is shown to avoid repetition therefore the comparative analyses discussed above suggests the dm correction of the ssmp model estimated values is essential for ungauged locations and hence is the final step of spatial validation the performances of the ssmp model for each hsg during spatial validation are also shown by the comparison of the mean and the standard deviation values of each station for all hsgs of the observed and estimated smc in figs 9a and 9b respectively for each depth pair the difference in average values of the mean and standard deviation of observed smc and dm corrected estimated smc for all four hsgs vary from 0 02 to 0 077 and 0 022 0 085 respectively for all four depth pairs hence it can be concluded that the proposed statistical approach can almost correctly characterize the mean of smc for all depths of all four hsgs although the characterization of standard deviation is comparatively poor however the values of performance metrics during spatial validation show a reasonably acceptable model performance given the possibility of uncertainty present due to various unaccounted physical controls of the ungauged location finally the theory of using only the surface smc information to estimate the vertical smc profile for different hsgs in proposed spatially varying ssmp model shows the efficient applicability to the locations where the smc information for deeper layers is not available 5 summary and conclusions in this study a spatially varying statistical soil moisture profile ssmp model is developed the key features of the ssmp model are 1 estimating the vertical smc profile using only the surface smc and 2 imparting the spatial transferability by incorporating the hsg information the smc data are obtained from 171 monitoring stations from scan uscrn and snotel network scattered over entire usa from ismn database at 5 10 20 51 and 102 cm depths and the hsg information of each monitoring stations are determined from the wss during the model development the forcing components show the trend of decreasing in the direction of hsg a to hsg d i e the forcing coefficients are higher for high infiltration hsg a and low for low infiltration hsg d of the soil this specific feature of the forcing components for different hsgs having different infiltration characteristics including the effects of the of soil hydraulic properties on the smc dynamics justifies the applicability of the spatially varying ssmp model for each hsg group to new locations the potential of spatially varying ssmp model developed are investigated by comparison of the model performances of the station wise observed data specific models and the proposed spatially varying models the efficacy of the developed spatially varying ssmp model in terms of spatial transferability is also investigated by applying the models to new monitoring stations of each hsg the difference in smc regimes of the model development stations and the target stations drives the study to compute the deviation in mean dm of the model developing stations and stations selected for spatial validation for surface layers the dm corrected estimated smc values of deeper layers obtained during the spatial validation gives better model performances for all four hsgs for both the cases model development and spatial validation the model performances illustrated indicate that the developed spatially varying ssmp model are able to characterize the smc at deeper layers from only the surface smc information for all hsg and all depths however it has also been studied that the model performance consistently decreases with increase in depths for all the four hsgs but still acceptable given the complexity of the model considering the key features of the developed model future scope lies in the integration of remotely sensed surface soil moisture content 0 5 cm in the estimation of large scale fine resolution vertical soil moisture profile up to root zone it is expected to be useful

is described in the following section a2 model coefficients the coefficients of the ssmp model are estimated by the least square method which minimizes the summation of the square of the residuals

6699,hydrological and sediment transport characteristics for the kosi basin which covers parts of nepal and india were analysed to understand the spatiotemporal variability of the hydrology and sediment dynamics of the kosi basin and its implications for flood hazard and sediment dynamics the study revealed that 56 of the discharge at chatara where all major tributaries of the kosi meet is contributed from the western part of the basin even though this constitutes only 34 of the total basin area in contrast the central and eastern parts of the basin constitute 57 and 8 of the basin area but contribute 38 and 16 of the discharge at chatara respectively the contribution of sediment load at chatara from the different tributaries of the kosi river also shows a similar pattern of a total of 100 million tonnes of the annual sediment load at chatara 56 is transported from four tributaries the indrawati bhote kosi tama kosi all draining from the west and tamor the remaining 44 is transported by other tributaries upstream of chatara the most important being the arun dudh kosi and sun kosi sediment budgeting in this study based on annual sediment load data suggested that 20 million tonnes of sediments are deposited between chatara and birpur annually this study also found that 53 million tonnes of sediments are being accommodated between birpur and baltara annually

linkage through hydrological modelling panday et al 2014 nepal et al 2014 this study presents a comprehensive analysis of the historical hydrological data for the entire basin in nepal and india for the last 4 5 decades we have used the standard methods of flow duration curves fdcs flood frequency analysis ffa discharge sediment relationships and sediment budgeting to derive a first order estimate of sediment flux through the basin and to highlight its implications for river avulsion and flood risk 2 study area the kosi river drains the northern slopes of the himalaya in the tibet autonomous region and the southern slopes of the nepal himalaya before it finally enters the bihar plains in india and meets the ganga river fig 1 a the mountain fed kosi river has a total basin area of 84 739 km2 and spans a total length of 730 km up to baltara gole and chitale 1966 sinha and friend 1994 the tibetan region of the kosi basin comprises 22 of the total drainage area and is characterized by high elevation and flat plateau on the leeward side of the himalaya with a large number of glaciers and glacier lakes bajracharya et al 2007 about 40 of the drainage area of the kosi basin lies in the nepal himalaya and is characterized by alpine and mountainous areas the alluvial part of the kosi basin in the bihar plains in india comprises 38 of the total drainage area and comprises low elevation and flat plains with high population density the spatial variation in rainfall for the kosi basin fig 1b shows that the mid latitude region receives higher rainfall compared to the low and high latitudes see supplementary section for data used and analysis the tibetan region experiences very low rainfall as it lies on the leeward side of the himalaya fig 1b and table 1 also show that the rainfall decreases from west to east of the kosi basin in the nepal himalaya the pachuwarghat and khurkot stations in the west show the highest basin average rainfall 2900 mm and maghitar in the east shows the lowest value 1238 mm a gradual decrease in rainfall from the himalayan part of the basin in nepal towards the alluvial reaches in bihar is also noted all tributaries of the kosi river originate from the high altitude areas and apart from rainfall streamflow from glaciers snow and permafrost contribute during the dry season singh et al 1993 bajracharya et al 2007 the major drainage in the tibetan region is marked by the tributaries of the arun river flowing from the west as well from the east in the nepal himalaya the kosi basin is drained by seven rivers the indrawati bhote kosi tama kosi dudh kosi sun kosi arun and tamor the combined flow from these rivers reaches tribeni through three major tributaries the sun kosi from the west the tamor from the east and arun from the north sharma 1977 downstream of tribeni the river flows through a narrow gorge and then passes through the gauging station at chatara from this point the kosi is known as the sapt kosi literally seven rivers and eventually enters the alluvial plains of northern bihar india gole and chitale 1966 before debouching into the plains of northern bihar the flow of the kosi is controlled by the kosi barrage at birpur and is also embanked on both sides in the downstream reaches a series of breaches in the embankment over the years have often resulted in large floods one of the most recent breaches in the eastern embankment occurred at kusaha in nepal 12 km upstream of the kosi barrage on 18 august 2008 this resulted in a major shift of the kosi river by 120 km eastward and globally it was one of the greatest avulsions in a large river in recent years sinha 2009a chakraborty et al 2010 sinha et al 2014 3 data and methods 3 1 discharge and sediment data discharge and sediment data at various stations in the kosi basin falling in the nepalese and indian territory were obtained from department of hydrology and meteorology nepal and the central water commission cwc india respectively see details in supplementary tables 1 and 2 the kosi basin lacks continuous records of hydrologic data over a long period and there are gaps and inconsistencies in the available data from different stations an averaging method was used to fill the data gaps and flow duration curves fdc to check the consistency of discharge data as well as to analyse the flow characteristics of different tributaries of the kosi double mass curves dmc were also prepared to check the relative consistency and homogeneity of gauge stations within the same basin our analysis suggests that the discharge and sediment data are generally consistent see supplementary section for details 3 2 discharge data analysis monthly average discharge data were used to generate the hydrographs for each station along the kosi river and its major tributaries flow duration curves fdc were plotted using discharge on a logarithmic scale as the ordinate and percentage of time discharge exceeded on a probability scale as the abscissa annual peak discharge data were used for flood frequency analysis ffa to compute flood quantiles and corresponding prediction uncertainties at return periods of 2 33 10 50 and 100 years using gumbel distribution the chi square γ 2 test was carried out to ascertain the goodness of fit of the gumbel distribution the ratio between the peak discharge and mean annual flood qmax qav was used to characterize annual variability in the magnitude of the flood discharge in response to precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and drainage basin characteristics beckinsale 1969 annual variability in the discharge was assessed from the ratio of maximum to minimum discharges qmax qmin 3 3 sediment load data suspended sediment load data for different stations were used to generate sediment discharge rating curves sdrcs using the power law function eq 1 which describes the average relation between discharge and suspended sediment concentration or load for a certain location walling 1974 1978 1 c s a q b o r q s a q b where cs is the suspended sediment concentration mg l q is streamflow rate river discharge m3 s and qs is suspended sediment load tonnes day the exponents α and β are site specific constants or rating coefficients isik 2013 related to basin characteristics such as runoff and relief and represent the measures of soil erodibility and erosivity of the river respectively rannie 1978 thomas 1988 for this study the sdrcs were generated for four stations namely barahkshetra 1948 61 chatara 2003 08 birpur 2002 08 and baltara 1990 98 since suspended sediment load data at different stations are limited and fragmentary see also supplementary tables 1 and 2 we selected the dataset for generating sdrcs for time windows when continuous sediment and discharge data were available with a common data measurement frequency i e monthly basis the relationship between discharge and suspended sediment load was considered to be consistent over the selected measurement period asselman 2000 the sediment budget between two stations along the same channel was defined eq 2 to provide an account of the sources and disposition of sediment as it traveled from its source to its outlet in the drainage basin reid and dunne 1996 2 i o δ s where i is input o is output and δ s is the change in storage the sediment load data at different stations for the period 1980 2010 were analysed primarily to understand sediment dynamics across the basin and to obtain a first order estimate of the volume of sediment accumulating in the channel belt between a pair of stations for sediment budgeting average annual sediment load mt year was calculated for all sediment stations since sediment data were not available for the same period we have used the average annual sediment load contributed from all tributaries in the mountainous and alluvial parts 4 results and analysis 4 1 discharge characteristics of the kosi river 4 1 1 hydrographs of the kosi and tributaries hydrographs for the downstream stations e g baltara had comparatively higher ordinates than those of the upstream stations except in situations when the water was abstracted upstream of a station e g birpur chatara and turkighat simle fig 2 khurkot lies at the confluence of the tributaries on which busti and pachuwarghat are located and therefore it shows higher values of monthly discharges the stations that do not fall along the same stream may have different catchment characteristics and hence different discharge patterns the pachuwarghat rabuwabazar and maghitar stations show broad and low peak hydrographs with a low rising limb as these catchments are elongated in shape with high slope angles and low drainage density in contrast chatara birpur and baltara stations show high peak and narrow hydrographs with pronounced rising limbs representing an increase in the discharge due to storage in the catchment area as well as in the channels these sub catchments have low to very low slopes and high drainage density 4 1 2 flow duration curves fdcs fig 3 shows the fdcs for all discharge stations in the kosi basin pachuwarghat busti khurkot and rabuwabazar are the discharge stations that contribute at chatara from the west of the kosi basin turkighat simle and maghitar are the stations that link the eastern part including the arun river basin from the north table 1 shows the q50 flow available for 50 of the time and q90 flow available for 90 of the time values for all stations as expected the q50 and q90 values in a stream increase downstream except for the reach between chatara and birpur this deviation is attributed to the diversions at birpur through eastern and western canals to irrigate nearly 9000 km2 of land in india and nepal the fdc for the most downstream station baltara is much higher than the fdc of the upstream stations of chatara and birpur because of its large catchment area similar explanations can be given for the pairs of fdcs for turkighat birpur maghitar chatara and pachuwarghat chatara the pachuwarghat busti khurkot rabuwabazar maghitar chatara and birpur showed fdc with steep slopes throughout this suggested highly variable flows that are largely derived from direct runoff from catchments that were dominated by low permeability lithologies the fdcs for baltara and simle were relatively flatter and this was attributed to the significant surface or groundwater storage and permeable catchment that tended to equalize the flow searcy 1959 liucci et al 2014 the fdcs for turkighat simle arun and baltara sapt kosi had flat peaks in the upper part high flows as compared to others this suggested that the high flows of these streams came largely from snowmelt or through flood regulatory storage in the case of baltara large floodplain storage searcy 1959 may also have had a role the lower end of the fdc is valuable for understanding the effect of geology on the groundwater runoff to the stream the steep lower ends of the fdcs of busti khurkot rabuwabazar birpur and baltara stations indicated that they did not have any perennial storage in contrast the fdcs of pachuwarghat simle turkighat and chatara stations reflected considerable perennial storage 4 1 3 flood frequency analysis ffa fig 4 shows the results of ffa and table 2 presents the peak discharges and corresponding uncertainties in the estimates for 2 33 10 50 and 100 years of return periods for the data following gumbel distribution the mean annual flood corresponded to the return period of 2 33 years leopold et al 1964 except for barahkshetra the estimates of peak discharges for the same return period for the downstream station were relatively higher than those for the upstream station along the same tributary they also showed a strong dependency on lithological characteristics catchment area and source of runoff generation estimated peak floods of maghitar and rabuwabazar for all return periods were very close the rate of change in the estimated peak floods showed a similar trend for the upstream stations such as pachuwarghat rabuwabazar turkighat maghitar and chatara the trends for the downstream stations birpur and baltara were similar but differed from those of upstream stations busti had the lowest peak flood followed by pachuwarghat rabuwabazar in the west and maghitar in the east these regions are dominated by low permeability lithology smaller catchment areas and steep slopes which indicate that most flows rainfall glacial melt lead to direct runoff anderson 1957 benson 1962 nash and shaw 1966 simle had higher values of peak floods compared to the upstream station at turkighat both located along the arun and the flows were largely contributed to by glacial melt khurkot also showed higher peak discharge values compared to the upstream stations pachuwarghat and busti chatara and kampughat have large permeable catchments and extensive mainstream lengths resulting in increased travel time for the direct runoff as the river flows through a deep gorge near barahkshetra it shows a higher flood peak as compared to birpur and baltara which lie in the piedmont area and alluvial plains respectively 4 1 4 discharge variability and flood magnitude fig 5 a l plots discharge variability qmax qmin versus flood magnitude qmax qav for all stations for all plots the slope was positive suggesting that floods of higher magnitude qmax qav will also have higher discharge variability qmax qmin rabuwabazar showed high values for both flow variability and flood magnitude followed by khurkot and maghitar the plots for the pachuwarghat and barahkshetra stations showed the highest slopes with the highest coefficient of determination 0 82 and 0 94 respectively amongst all stations the rivers associated with these stations traverse the mountainous areas characterized by orographic rainfall that is manifested in high discharge variability as well as by high flood magnitude the busti kampughat turkighat birpur simle and chatara stations showed low flood magnitude as well as flood variability chatara being the lowest with the least coefficient of determination 0 37 baltara had the lowest rate of increment in flood magnitude with reference to flow variability this is attributed to the location of this station in the most downstream part of the tropical basin and to flow contributions from areas occupying more than one climatic zone these observations indicate significant spatial variability in the flooding characteristics across the kosi basin as a function of the geomorphic setting 4 2 sediment analysis 4 2 1 discharge sediment relationship sediment load and discharge data from july 2002 to november 2008 were analyzed to obtain sdrcs for the barahkshetra chatara birpur downstream of the kosi barrage and baltara stations fig 6 a d high β values for the sdrcs for barahkshetra 2 23 chatara 1 99 and birpur 2 11 and a fairly low value for baltara 1 18 indicated significant spatial variation in the erosive power of the river knighton 1984 and dominance of sand and silt sized sediments that require more power to transport asselman 2000 fig 6 also shows a rising trend in rating curve for all stations attributed to an increase in stream power and sediment transport capacity as discharge increases however the values of α were low for chatara barahkshetra and birpur but very high for baltara fig 6 this reflected spatial variation in erodibility of soils and high values at baltara suggested the availability at this location of sediments that could be easily eroded and transported peters kümmerly 1973 morgan 1995 our analysis suggests therefore that the kosi behaves as a supply limited system at chatara barahkshetra and birpur but as a transport limited system at baltara this is in contrast to the rivers draining the western ganga plains where most rivers are supply limited roy and sinha 2017 table 3 lists the catchment areas with average annual discharges average annual sediment loads sediment yield sediment load per unit of catchment area and specific discharges discharge per unit area at different stations an increase in the average annual discharge from upstream to downstream was noted as a function of the catchment area of the respective stations the dolalghat busti and mulghat stations showed high specific discharges compared to the other stations this is because these three stations lie in the high himalayan region and have a highly dissected terrain with high longitudinal slopes lower specific discharge at chatara and barahkshetra was due to limited contributions from the upstream tibetan part that is a low precipitation zone because of the rain shadow effect downstream of chatara barahkshetra a decreasing trend of specific discharge is noted table 3 shows that the sediment yield decreases from upstream to downstream sediment yield was plotted against annual average discharge and specific discharge fig 7 a b at all stations as average annual discharge increases specific sediment load decreases fig 7a and this can be explained as the drainage area effect latrubesse et al 2005 table 3 and fig 8 b also show that as specific discharge increases sediment yield also increases exceptions to this trend are noted for two pairs of stations dolalghat busti and busti mulghat the specific sediment load at dolalghat which has a major contribution from bhote kosi was more than that at busti tama kosi but specific discharge at dolalghat was less than that at busti similarly the specific sediment load at busti was higher than that at mulghat tamor but specific discharge at busti was less than that at mulghat it is argued that these variations are primarily related to sediment connectivity of the individual basins which governs the efficiency of sediment transfer harvey 2001 sediment connectivity analysis for the upper kosi basin has shown that the bhote kosi sub basin is highly connected followed by the tama kosi and tamor sub basins mishra et al 2019 and this is manifested in sediment yield from these sub basins 4 2 2 sediment budgeting chatara fig 1 is situated immediately downstream of the confluence of the three major tributaries of the kosi hence the sediment load at chatara represents the total sediment transported from the upstream sources fig 8 of the total sediment load at chatara 101 mt year table 3 56 mt year of sediment was transported from three basins indrawati and bhote kosi dolaghat tama kosi busti and tamor mulghat presumably the remaining 45 mt year is transported by other tributaries upstream of chatara the most important being the arun dudh kosi and sun kosi downstream of dolaghat for which no independent estimates were available it is important to note that the chatara birpur and baltara stations lie on the same stream and hence sediment budgeting was been done only for this stretch the inputs from two important tributaries of the kosi in the alluvial reaches the baghmati and kamla balan were considered for the birpur baltara stretch these contributed 7 mt and 8 mt of sediments annually sinha and friend 1994 fig 8 shows that the annual sediment load at the upstream station at chatara 101 mt year is higher than that at the downstream station at birpur 81 mt year suggesting aggradation of 20 mt of sediments annually between these two stations this may be attributed to the break in slope at chatara and the presence of the kosi barrage at birpur which acts as a barrier to sediment transport and induces siltation upstream further the total sediment input in the birpur baltara stretch is much higher 96 mt yr than the sediment load measured at baltara 43 mt yr suggesting a further deposition of 53 mt year of sediment annually between birpur and baltara also see section 5 1 such large scale aggradation is attributed partly to the barrage located just downstream of birpur but mainly to the very low longitudinal slope 0 01 8 4 between birpur and baltara 5 discussion 5 1 hydroclimatic conditions and discharge contributions our analysis suggests that the kosi basin has extremely variable hydroclimatic characteristics rainfall data table 1 suggest that pachuwarghat and maghitar have the highest and the lowest average annual rainfall respectively and the difference is as great as 2400 mm over the entire basin fig 1b the mid latitude region receives the maximum average rainfall which increases from the west to the center and decreases towards the east the rainfall distribution in the kosi basin is clearly manifested in the discharge contributions at chatara from different parts of the basin considering average annual discharges at kampughat sun kosi simle arun and maghitar tamor as the sum total of contributions from western central and eastern parts respectively it is noted that 56 of the discharge comes from the western part only even though this constitutes only 34 of the total basin area up to chatara in contrast 33 of the discharge comes from the central part 58 of the basin area and only 16 from the eastern part 8 of the basin area up to chatara 5 2 basin scale sediment dynamics and controls although sediment data for all stations do not correspond to the same period of observation a first order sediment budgeting provides important insights about sediment dynamics in the kosi basin it is estimated that more than 40 of the total sediment load at chatara 101 mt yr is contributed by the western tributaries the indrawati and tama kosi the eastern tributary tamor adds 16 of the total sediment load at chatara the remaining 44 of the sediment load is contributed by arun dudh kosi and sun kosi after dolalghat from which no independent sediment load data are available the sediment budgeting in this study also provides a first order estimate of total mass and volume of sediments being accumulated in the channel belt over the last few decades estimates for the last 54 years post embankment period suggest that the total mass of sediments accumulated in the channel belt between chatara and birpur could be 1080 mt which translates to 408 million m3 of volume and this may have accumulated at a rate as high as 5 31 cm year see inset table in fig 7 the average thickness of sediments accumulated in the channel belt over the period of 54 years is computed as 2 87 m in this stretch this is attributed to the relatively narrow channel belt and a smaller area available for sediment accommodation i e 142 km2 between the two stations in contrast the channel belt is much wider between birpur and baltara and the available depositional area is almost five times the area between chatara and birpur the barrage at birpur also acts as a barrier to coarse and medium fractions of sediments taking the sediment load at birpur as well as contributions from the baghmati and kamla balan system into account the total sediment accumulation in the birpur baltara stretch is very high 2862 mt translating to 1080 million m3 of sediments this is because of large channel widths in this stretch that can accommodate a large volume of sediments but results in lower sediment thickness and sedimentation rate 2 13 m 3 94 cm year respectively it is important to note however that the sediment thickness computed from this method assumes uniform sedimentation across the entire channel belt in practice the rate of sedimentation is extremely variable and is controlled by local slopes and hydrological conditions therefore local sedimentation rates and thickness may be much higher as reported in sinha et al 2014 where the river bed around kusaha was estimated to be 2 3 m higher than the adjoining floodplain table 3 also shows a decreasing trend of sediment yield at dolalghat busti mulghat and chatara that clearly reflects the contributing area but rainfall also plays an important role in mobilizing the sediments downstream for example a large part of the arun lies in the mountainous tibetan region where sediment production is high this is demonstrated by a 10be derived mean denudation rate of 1 44 mm yr for the tributaries of the arun draining through the higher himalaya compared to other tributaries of the kosi draining through the lesser himalaya 0 2 0 5 mm yr olen et al 2015 however the rainfall in the arun basin is fairly low table 1 and therefore total sediment transport is less further the tibetan part of the arun also shows low sediment connectivity between the hillslopes and channel mishra et al 2019 and this will also result in lower sediment yield in contrast the tributaries draining the middle kosi basin not only produce large amounts of sediment but this is also mobilized downstream because of higher rainfall compared to the tibetan region sediment transported from the hinterland is deposited downstream of chatara because of a major topographic break drastically reducing the slope and stream power this occurs even though the mean discharge at chatara 1545 m3 s is much higher compared to other stations it is important to understand the causal factors of such high sediment supply and aggradation in the kosi basin for designing a sustainable sediment management strategy natural erosion in the himalaya has been an important phenomenon and is probably higher than in most other mountain systems in the world ives and messerli 1990 it is well established that the himalayan river basins are characterized by high annual rainfall resulting in high streamflow rates steep slopes and a young and fragile hinterland bruijnzeel 1990 ives and messerli 1990 these factors limit the opportunity to store sediment and a high rate of sediment transport is reflected in the basin output however there is significant spatial variability in sediment yield from different parts of the kosi basin this study suggests that sediment connectivity also plays an important role here see mishra et al 2019 apart from the natural factors human impact on the sediment yield may have been substantial in recent years because of large scale developmental activities such as road construction in many parts of the basin falling within nepal in regions with high rainfall rates steep terrain and high natural erosion rates similar to the himalayan region the relative impact of land use may be negligible however at this stage it is not possible to separate the natural and anthropogenic contributions to the sediment flux in the kosi basin 5 3 implications for morphodynamics floods and hydropower the high sediment yield of the kosi river has significant implications for the morphodynamics of the river and floods particularly in the downstream reaches the construction of embankments on both sides and the kosi barrage has further aggravated the situation and channel siltation is now confined within the embankment this has led to a decrease in the longitudinal gradient and an increase in cross valley gradient the ratio of which determines the avulsion threshold bryant et al 1995 mackey and bridge 1995 at many locations large scale aggradation has resulted in a superelevated channel sinha et al 2014 where the elevation difference between the channel bed and the surrounding floodplain is as much as 4 5 m this often leads to channel instability and avulsions the last major event being the 2008 avulsion at kusaha following the breach in the embankment sinha 2009a sinha et al 2014 majumder and ghosh 2018 this single event resulted in a maximum shift of 120 km of the kosi channel in the alluvial region for a few months and also in a large flood affecting more than 3 million people in nepal and northern bihar the kosi is often called the sorrow of bihar mainly because of its frequent and extensive floods and the migration that is often linked to them it is important to note that since the construction of the embankments most floods in the kosi basin have occurred because of the breaches in the embankment rather than through overbank flooding nine breaches have occurred since 1963 on both eastern and western embankments resulting in severe flooding mishra 2008 sinha et al 2014 the latest breach in august 2008 at kusaha 12 km upstream of the kosi barrage occurred at a relatively low water discharge 4 320 m3 s compared to the design discharge 28 500 m3 s of the embankment this was attributed to the fact that the river was very close to the avulsion threshold at that point because of its superelevated position sinha 2009a sinha et al 2014 hydroelectric power projects have a designed power production capacity this capacity depends on the discharge of the river and head at the turbine the extent of erosion and deposition will change because of spatiotemporal variability in meteorological conditions and to the hydrological and geomorphological characteristics of the basin landslides triggered by hillslope erosion levee breach and channel avulsion may result in partial or total abandonment of hydroelectric projects a recent example is a major landslide in the upstream reaches of the bhote kosi jure landslide in 2014 this created a large dam upstream and a small hydroelectric power station downstream became defunct further sediment extruding mechanisms may be required during higher sediment transport so that the channel is not filled or which prevent sediment from partially or fully entering the turbine the kosi basin is considered to have significant hydropower potential and at least three multipurpose projects the kosi high dam at barahkshetra the tamor i and the sun kosi kamla diversion project have been under discussion thapa 1993 chinnaswamy et al 2015 these projects have been conceived for flood and sediment control and for hydropower generation and partially for irrigation the high sediment yield of the kosi and its tributaries is a major concern for all these projects nayak 1996 the findings of this study will benefit hydropower projects by promoting an understanding of the spatial variability in sediment load at different catchments and the planning of an appropriate sediment control strategy similarly the information on flooding characteristics particularly on floods of different return periods will be very useful in designing hydropower capacity and infrastructure 6 conclusions the hydrological characteristics of the kosi river and its tributaries show significant spatial and temporal variability this first ever compilation of all available data for water discharge and sediment load for the entire kosi basin draining through nepal and northern bihar provides important insights about the influence of basin characteristics on flow and on sediment storage and transfer our analysis suggests that the western tributaries contribute 56 of the total annual flows at chatara whereas the central and eastern parts add 38 and 16 respectively further 40 of annual sediment load is contributed from the western tributaries 16 from the eastern tributaries and the remaining 44 from the central part of the kosi basin discharge sediment relationships suggest that the kosi river is supply limited at the upstream stations chatara and birpur but transport limited at the downstream station baltara leading to large scale aggradation in the alluvial reaches the embankments constructed on both sides of the river in 1955 1956 have constrained the river flow and this has increased in channel sedimentation significantly sediment budgeting from the study suggests that 408 million m3 of sediments may have accumulated between chatara and birpur and 1080 million m3 between birpur and baltara in the post embankment period of 54 years such large scale aggradation has resulted in superelevated channels at several locations leading to serious problems of channel instability and flooding this study shows that sediment dynamics in the kosi basin is one of the single most serious problems and is linked to several river related hazards sediment management plans should therefore become an integral part of river management of the kosi and its tributaries

supplementary data 1 
6699,hydrological and sediment transport characteristics for the kosi basin which covers parts of nepal and india were analysed to understand the spatiotemporal variability of the hydrology and sediment dynamics of the kosi basin and its implications for flood hazard and sediment dynamics the study revealed that 56 of the discharge at chatara where all major tributaries of the kosi meet is contributed from the western part of the basin even though this constitutes only 34 of the total basin area in contrast the central and eastern parts of the basin constitute 57 and 8 of the basin area but contribute 38 and 16 of the discharge at chatara respectively the contribution of sediment load at chatara from the different tributaries of the kosi river also shows a similar pattern of a total of 100 million tonnes of the annual sediment load at chatara 56 is transported from four tributaries the indrawati bhote kosi tama kosi all draining from the west and tamor the remaining 44 is transported by other tributaries upstream of chatara the most important being the arun dudh kosi and sun kosi sediment budgeting in this study based on annual sediment load data suggested that 20 million tonnes of sediments are deposited between chatara and birpur annually this study also found that 53 million tonnes of sediments are being accommodated between birpur and baltara annually sediment dynamics in the kosi basin emerges as the most important river management issue and this is closely linked to channel instability and frequent flooding in the alluvial plains keywords

of northern bihar in india the kosi has been a problematic river over the last several decades owing to its extremely dynamic channels and frequent flooding gole and chitale 1966 wells and dorr 1987 sinha and jain 1998 chakraborty et al 2010 previous research e g dixit 2009 sinha 2009a b sinha et al 2013 2014 has clearly established that the problems of channel instability and flooding have been aggravated in recent years these were primarily due to several interventions for water resource development including the embankments on both sides of the river completed in 1955 56 and a barrage at birpur completed in 1963 india wris 2016 excessive siltation in the alluvial part of the kosi river has resulted in superelevation of the river bed in several reaches with respect to the adjacent floodplains sinha et al 2014 this has not only significantly affected the longitudinal connectivity of the river through alterations in planform morphology but has also increased the flood risk enormously in these reaches through multiple embankment breaches and avulsions over the years sinha and jain 1998 sinha 2009a sinha et al 2013 2014 it is therefore necessary to understand the implications of sediment dynamics on river processes and associated hazards in the kosi basin to develop effective river management strategies previous analysis of the hydrological data for the kosi

estimate of sediment flux through the basin and to highlight its implications for river avulsion and flood risk 2 study area the kosi river drains the northern slopes of the himalaya in the tibet autonomous region and the southern slopes of the nepal himalaya before it finally enters the bihar plains in india and meets the ganga river fig 1 a the mountain fed kosi river has a total basin area of 84 739 km2 and spans a total length of 730 km up to baltara gole and chitale 1966 sinha and friend 1994 the tibetan region of the kosi basin comprises 22 of the total drainage area and is characterized by high elevation and flat plateau on the leeward side of the himalaya with a large number of glaciers and glacier lakes bajracharya et al 2007 about 40 of the drainage area of the kosi basin lies in the nepal himalaya and is characterized by alpine and mountainous areas the alluvial part of the kosi basin in the bihar plains in india comprises 38 of the total drainage area and comprises low elevation and flat plains with high population density the spatial variation in rainfall for the kosi basin fig 1b shows that the mid latitude region receives higher rainfall compared to the low and high latitudes see supplementary section for data used and analysis the tibetan region experiences very low rainfall as it lies on the leeward side of the himalaya fig 1b and table 1 also show that the rainfall decreases from west to east of the kosi basin in the nepal himalaya the pachuwarghat and khurkot stations in the west show the highest basin average rainfall 2900 mm and maghitar in the east shows the lowest value 1238 mm a gradual decrease in rainfall from the himalayan part of the basin in nepal towards the alluvial reaches in bihar is also noted all tributaries of the kosi river originate from the high altitude areas and apart from rainfall streamflow from glaciers snow and permafrost contribute during the dry season singh et al 1993 bajracharya et al 2007 the major drainage in the tibetan region is marked by the tributaries of the arun river flowing from the west as well from the east in the nepal himalaya the kosi basin is drained by seven rivers the indrawati bhote kosi tama kosi dudh kosi sun kosi arun and tamor the combined flow from these rivers reaches tribeni through three major tributaries the sun kosi from the west the tamor from the east and arun from the north sharma 1977 downstream of tribeni the river flows through a narrow gorge and then passes through the gauging station at chatara from this point the kosi is known as the sapt kosi literally seven rivers and eventually enters the alluvial plains of northern bihar india gole and chitale 1966 before debouching into the plains of northern bihar the flow of the kosi is controlled by the kosi barrage at birpur and is also embanked on both sides in the downstream reaches a series of breaches in the embankment over the years have often resulted in large floods one of the most recent breaches in the eastern embankment occurred at kusaha in nepal 12 km upstream of the kosi barrage on 18 august 2008 this resulted in a major shift of the kosi river by 120 km eastward and globally it was one of the greatest avulsions in a large river in recent years sinha 2009a chakraborty et al 2010 sinha et al 2014 3 data and methods 3 1 discharge and sediment data discharge and sediment data at various stations in the kosi basin falling in the nepalese and indian territory were obtained from department of hydrology and meteorology nepal and the central water commission cwc india respectively see details in supplementary tables 1 and 2 the kosi basin lacks continuous records of hydrologic data over a long period and there are gaps and inconsistencies in the available data from different stations an averaging method was used to fill the data gaps and flow duration curves fdc to check the consistency of discharge data as well as to analyse the flow characteristics of different tributaries of the kosi double mass curves dmc were also prepared to check the relative consistency and homogeneity of gauge stations within the same basin our analysis suggests that the discharge and sediment data are generally consistent see supplementary section for details 3 2 discharge data analysis monthly average discharge data were used to generate the hydrographs for each station along the kosi river and its major tributaries flow duration curves fdc were plotted using discharge on a logarithmic scale as the ordinate and percentage of time discharge exceeded on a probability scale as the abscissa annual peak discharge data were used for flood frequency analysis ffa to compute flood quantiles and corresponding prediction uncertainties at return periods of 2 33 10 50 and 100 years using gumbel distribution the chi square γ 2 test was carried out to ascertain the goodness of fit of the gumbel distribution the ratio between the peak discharge and mean annual flood qmax qav was used to characterize annual variability in the magnitude of the flood discharge in response to precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and drainage basin characteristics beckinsale 1969 annual variability in the discharge was assessed from the ratio of maximum to minimum discharges qmax qmin 3 3 sediment load data suspended sediment load data for different stations were used to generate sediment discharge rating curves sdrcs using the power law function eq 1 which describes the average relation between discharge and suspended sediment concentration or load for a certain location walling 1974 1978 1 c s a q b o r q s a q b where cs is the suspended sediment concentration mg l q is streamflow rate river discharge m3 s and qs is suspended sediment load tonnes day the exponents α and β are site specific constants or rating coefficients isik 2013 related to basin characteristics such as runoff and relief and represent the measures of soil erodibility and erosivity of the river respectively rannie 1978 thomas 1988 for this study the sdrcs were generated for four stations namely barahkshetra 1948 61 chatara 2003 08 birpur 2002 08 and baltara 1990 98 since suspended sediment load data at different stations are limited and fragmentary see also supplementary tables 1 and 2 we selected the dataset for generating sdrcs for time windows when continuous sediment and discharge data were available with a common data measurement frequency i e monthly basis the relationship between discharge and suspended sediment load was considered to be consistent over the selected measurement period asselman 2000 the sediment budget between two stations along the same channel was defined eq 2 to provide an account of the sources and disposition of sediment as it traveled from its source to its outlet in the drainage basin reid and dunne 1996 2 i o δ s where i is input o is output and δ s is the change in storage the sediment load data at different stations for the period 1980 2010 were analysed primarily to understand sediment dynamics across the basin and to obtain a first order estimate of the volume of sediment accumulating in the channel belt between a pair of stations for sediment budgeting average annual sediment load mt year was calculated for all sediment stations since sediment data were not available for the same period we have used the average annual sediment load contributed from all tributaries in the mountainous and alluvial parts 4 results and analysis 4 1 discharge characteristics of the kosi river 4 1 1 hydrographs of the kosi and tributaries hydrographs for the downstream stations e g baltara had comparatively higher ordinates than those of the upstream stations except in situations when the water was abstracted upstream of a station e g birpur chatara and turkighat simle fig 2 khurkot lies at the confluence of the tributaries on which busti and pachuwarghat are located and therefore it shows higher values of monthly discharges the stations that do not fall along the same stream may have different catchment characteristics and hence different discharge patterns the pachuwarghat rabuwabazar and maghitar stations show broad and low peak hydrographs with a low rising limb as these catchments are elongated in shape with high slope angles and low drainage density in contrast chatara birpur and baltara stations show high peak and narrow hydrographs with pronounced rising limbs representing an increase in the discharge due to storage in the catchment area as well as in the channels these sub catchments have low to very low slopes and high drainage density 4 1 2 flow duration curves fdcs fig 3 shows the fdcs for all discharge stations in the kosi basin pachuwarghat busti khurkot and rabuwabazar are the discharge stations that contribute at chatara from the west of the kosi basin turkighat simle and maghitar are the stations that link the eastern part including the arun river basin from the north table 1 shows the q50 flow available for 50 of the time and q90 flow available for 90 of the time values for all stations as expected the q50 and q90 values in a stream increase downstream except for the reach between chatara and birpur this deviation is attributed to the diversions at birpur through eastern and western canals to irrigate nearly 9000 km2 of land in india and nepal the fdc for the most downstream station baltara is much higher than the fdc of the upstream stations of chatara and birpur because of its large catchment area similar explanations can be given for the pairs of fdcs for turkighat birpur maghitar chatara and pachuwarghat chatara the pachuwarghat busti khurkot rabuwabazar maghitar chatara and birpur showed fdc with steep slopes throughout this suggested highly variable flows that are largely derived from direct runoff from catchments that were dominated by low permeability lithologies the fdcs for baltara and simle were relatively flatter and this was attributed to the significant surface or groundwater storage and permeable catchment that tended to equalize the flow searcy 1959 liucci et al 2014 the fdcs for turkighat simle arun and baltara sapt kosi had flat peaks in the upper part high flows as compared to others this suggested that the high flows of these streams came largely from snowmelt or through flood regulatory storage in the case of baltara large floodplain storage searcy 1959 may also have had a role the lower end of the fdc is valuable for understanding the effect of geology on the groundwater runoff to the stream the steep lower ends of the fdcs of busti khurkot rabuwabazar birpur and baltara stations indicated that they did not have any perennial storage in contrast the fdcs of pachuwarghat simle turkighat and chatara stations reflected considerable perennial storage 4 1 3 flood frequency analysis ffa fig 4 shows the results of ffa and table 2 presents the peak discharges and corresponding uncertainties in the estimates for 2 33 10 50 and 100 years of return periods for the data following gumbel distribution the mean annual flood corresponded to the return period of 2 33 years leopold et al 1964 except for barahkshetra the estimates of peak discharges for the same return period for the downstream station were relatively higher than those for the upstream station along the same tributary they also showed a strong dependency on lithological characteristics catchment area and source of runoff generation estimated peak floods of maghitar and rabuwabazar for all return periods were very close the rate of change in the estimated peak floods showed a similar trend for the upstream stations such as pachuwarghat rabuwabazar turkighat maghitar and chatara the trends for the downstream stations birpur and baltara were similar but differed from those of upstream stations busti had the lowest peak flood followed by pachuwarghat rabuwabazar in the west and maghitar in the east these regions are dominated by low permeability lithology smaller catchment areas and steep slopes which indicate that most flows rainfall glacial melt lead to direct runoff anderson 1957 benson 1962 nash and shaw 1966 simle had higher values of peak floods compared to the upstream station at turkighat both located along the arun and the flows were largely contributed to by glacial melt khurkot also showed higher peak discharge values compared to the upstream stations pachuwarghat and busti chatara and kampughat have large permeable catchments and extensive mainstream lengths resulting in increased travel time for the direct runoff as the river flows through a deep gorge near barahkshetra it shows a higher flood peak as compared to birpur and baltara which lie in the piedmont area and alluvial plains respectively 4 1 4 discharge variability and flood magnitude fig 5 a l plots discharge variability qmax qmin versus flood magnitude qmax qav for all stations for all plots the slope was positive suggesting that floods of higher magnitude qmax qav will also have higher discharge variability qmax qmin rabuwabazar showed high values for both flow variability and flood magnitude followed by khurkot and maghitar the plots for the pachuwarghat and barahkshetra stations showed the highest slopes with the highest coefficient of determination 0 82 and 0 94 respectively amongst all stations the rivers associated with these stations traverse the mountainous areas characterized by orographic rainfall that is manifested in high discharge variability as well as by high flood magnitude the busti kampughat turkighat birpur simle and chatara stations showed low flood magnitude as well as flood variability chatara being the lowest with the least coefficient of determination 0 37 baltara had the lowest rate of increment in flood magnitude with reference to flow variability this is attributed to the location of this station in the most downstream part of the tropical basin and to flow contributions from areas occupying more than one climatic zone these observations indicate significant spatial variability in the flooding characteristics across the kosi basin as a function of the geomorphic setting 4 2 sediment analysis 4 2 1 discharge sediment relationship sediment load and discharge data from july 2002 to november 2008 were analyzed to obtain sdrcs for the barahkshetra chatara birpur downstream of the kosi barrage and baltara stations fig 6 a d high β values for the sdrcs for barahkshetra 2 23 chatara 1 99 and birpur 2 11 and a fairly low value for baltara 1 18 indicated significant spatial variation in the erosive power of the river knighton 1984 and dominance of sand and silt sized sediments that require more power to transport asselman 2000 fig 6 also shows a rising trend in rating curve for all stations attributed to an increase in stream power and sediment transport capacity as discharge increases however the values of α were low for chatara barahkshetra and birpur but very high for baltara fig 6 this reflected spatial variation in erodibility of soils and high values at baltara suggested the availability at this location of sediments that could be easily eroded and transported peters kümmerly 1973 morgan 1995 our analysis suggests therefore that the kosi behaves as a supply limited system at chatara barahkshetra and birpur but as a transport limited system at baltara this is in contrast to the rivers draining the western ganga plains where most rivers are supply limited roy and sinha 2017 table 3 lists the catchment areas with average annual discharges average annual sediment loads sediment yield sediment load per unit of catchment area and specific discharges discharge per unit area at different stations an increase in the average annual discharge from upstream to downstream was noted as a function of the catchment area of the respective stations the dolalghat busti and mulghat stations showed high specific discharges compared to the other stations this is because these three stations lie in the high himalayan region and have a highly dissected terrain with high longitudinal slopes lower specific discharge at chatara and barahkshetra was due to limited contributions from the upstream tibetan part that is a low precipitation zone because of the rain shadow effect downstream of chatara barahkshetra a decreasing trend of specific discharge is noted table 3 shows that the sediment yield decreases from upstream to downstream sediment yield was plotted against annual average discharge and specific discharge fig 7 a b at all stations as average annual discharge increases specific sediment load decreases fig 7a and this can be explained as the drainage area effect latrubesse et al 2005 table 3 and fig 8 b also show that as specific discharge increases sediment yield also increases exceptions to this trend are noted for two pairs of stations dolalghat busti and busti mulghat the specific sediment load at dolalghat which has a major contribution from bhote kosi was more than that at busti tama kosi but specific discharge at dolalghat was less than that at busti similarly the specific sediment load at busti was higher than that at mulghat tamor but specific discharge at busti was less than that at mulghat it is argued that these variations are primarily related to sediment connectivity of the individual basins which governs the efficiency of sediment transfer harvey 2001 sediment connectivity analysis for the upper kosi basin has shown that the bhote kosi sub basin is highly connected followed by the tama kosi and tamor sub basins mishra et al 2019 and this is manifested in sediment yield from these sub basins 4 2 2 sediment budgeting chatara fig 1 is situated immediately downstream of the confluence of the three major tributaries of the kosi hence the sediment load at chatara represents the total sediment transported from the upstream sources fig 8 of the total sediment load at chatara 101 mt year table 3 56 mt year of sediment was transported from three basins indrawati and bhote kosi dolaghat tama kosi busti and tamor mulghat presumably the remaining 45 mt year is transported by other tributaries upstream of chatara the most important being the arun dudh kosi and sun kosi downstream of dolaghat for which no independent estimates were available it is important to note that the chatara birpur and baltara stations lie on the same stream and hence sediment budgeting was been done only for this stretch the inputs from two important tributaries of the kosi in the alluvial reaches the baghmati and kamla balan were considered for the birpur baltara stretch these contributed 7 mt and 8 mt of sediments annually sinha and friend 1994 fig 8 shows that the annual sediment load at the upstream station at chatara 101 mt year is higher than that at the downstream station at birpur 81 mt year suggesting aggradation of 20 mt of sediments annually between these two stations this may be attributed to the break in slope at chatara and the presence of the kosi barrage at birpur which acts as a barrier to sediment transport and induces siltation upstream further the total sediment input in the birpur baltara stretch is much higher 96 mt yr than the sediment load measured at baltara 43 mt yr suggesting a further deposition of 53 mt year of sediment annually between birpur and baltara also see section 5 1 such large scale aggradation is attributed partly to the barrage located just downstream of birpur but mainly to the very low longitudinal slope 0 01 8 4 between birpur and baltara 5 discussion 5 1 hydroclimatic conditions and discharge contributions our analysis suggests that the kosi basin has extremely variable hydroclimatic characteristics rainfall data table 1 suggest that pachuwarghat and maghitar have the highest and the lowest average annual rainfall respectively and the difference is as great as 2400 mm over the entire basin fig 1b the mid latitude region receives the maximum average rainfall which increases from the west to the center and decreases towards the east the rainfall distribution in the kosi basin is clearly manifested in the discharge contributions at chatara from different parts of the basin considering average annual discharges at kampughat sun kosi simle arun and maghitar tamor as the sum total of contributions from western central and eastern parts respectively it is noted that 56 of the discharge comes from the western part only even though this constitutes only 34 of the total basin area up to chatara in contrast 33 of the discharge comes from the central part 58 of the basin area and only 16 from the eastern part 8 of the basin area up to chatara 5 2 basin scale sediment dynamics and controls although sediment data for all stations do not correspond to the same period of observation a first order sediment budgeting provides important insights about sediment dynamics in the kosi basin it is estimated that more than 40 of the total sediment load at chatara 101 mt yr is contributed by the western tributaries the indrawati and tama kosi the eastern tributary tamor adds 16 of the total sediment load at chatara the remaining 44 of the sediment load is contributed by arun dudh kosi and sun kosi after dolalghat from which no independent sediment load data are available the sediment budgeting in this study also provides a first order estimate of total mass and volume of sediments being accumulated in the channel belt over the last few decades estimates for the last 54 years post embankment period suggest that the total mass of sediments accumulated in the channel belt between chatara and birpur could be 1080 mt which translates to 408 million m3 of volume and this may have accumulated at a rate as high as 5 31 cm year see inset table in fig 7 the average thickness of sediments accumulated in the channel belt over the period of 54 years is computed as 2 87 m in this stretch this is attributed to the relatively narrow channel belt and a smaller area available for sediment accommodation i e 142 km2 between the two stations in contrast the channel belt is much wider between birpur and baltara and the available depositional area is almost five times the area between chatara and birpur the barrage at birpur also acts as a barrier to coarse and medium fractions of sediments taking the sediment load at birpur as well as contributions from the baghmati and kamla balan system into account the total sediment accumulation in the birpur baltara stretch is very high 2862 mt translating to 1080 million m3 of sediments this is because of large channel widths in this stretch that can accommodate a large volume of sediments but results in lower sediment thickness and sedimentation rate 2 13 m 3 94 cm year respectively it is important to note however that the sediment thickness computed from this method assumes uniform sedimentation across the entire channel belt in practice the rate of sedimentation is extremely variable and is controlled by local slopes and hydrological conditions therefore local sedimentation rates and thickness may be much higher as reported in sinha et al 2014 where the river bed around kusaha was estimated to be 2 3 m higher than the adjoining floodplain table 3 also shows a decreasing trend of sediment yield at dolalghat busti mulghat and chatara that clearly reflects the contributing area but rainfall also plays an important role in mobilizing the sediments downstream for example a large part of the arun lies in the mountainous tibetan region where sediment production is high this is demonstrated by a 10be derived mean denudation rate of 1 44 mm yr for the tributaries of the arun draining through the higher himalaya compared to other tributaries of the kosi draining through the lesser himalaya 0 2 0 5 mm yr olen et al 2015 however the rainfall in the arun basin is fairly low table 1 and therefore total sediment transport is less further the tibetan part of the arun also shows low sediment connectivity between the hillslopes and channel mishra et al 2019 and this will also result in lower sediment yield in contrast the tributaries draining the middle kosi basin not only produce large amounts of sediment but this is also mobilized downstream because of higher rainfall compared to the tibetan region sediment transported from the hinterland is deposited downstream of chatara because of a major topographic break drastically reducing the slope and stream power this occurs even though the mean discharge at chatara 1545 m3 s is much higher compared to other stations it is important to understand the causal factors of such high sediment supply and aggradation in the kosi basin for designing a sustainable sediment management strategy natural erosion in the himalaya has been an important phenomenon and is probably higher than in most other mountain systems in the world ives and messerli 1990 it is well established that the himalayan river basins are characterized by high annual rainfall resulting in high streamflow rates steep slopes and a young and fragile hinterland bruijnzeel 1990 ives and messerli 1990 these factors limit the opportunity to store sediment and a high rate of sediment transport is reflected in the basin output however there is significant spatial variability in sediment yield from different parts of the kosi basin this study suggests that sediment connectivity also plays an important role here see mishra et al 2019 apart from the natural factors human impact on the sediment yield may have been substantial in recent years because of large scale developmental activities such as road construction in many parts of the basin falling within nepal in regions with high rainfall rates steep terrain and high natural erosion rates similar to the himalayan region the relative impact of land use may be negligible however at this stage it is not possible to separate the natural and anthropogenic contributions to the sediment flux in the kosi basin 5 3 implications for morphodynamics floods and hydropower the high sediment yield of the kosi river has significant implications for the morphodynamics of the river and floods particularly in the downstream reaches the construction of embankments on both sides and the kosi barrage has further aggravated the situation and channel siltation is now confined within the embankment this has led to a decrease in the longitudinal gradient and an increase in cross valley gradient the ratio of which determines the avulsion threshold bryant et al 1995 mackey and bridge 1995 at many locations large scale aggradation has resulted in a superelevated channel sinha et al 2014 where the elevation difference between the channel bed and the surrounding floodplain is as much as 4 5 m this often leads to channel instability and avulsions the last major event being the 2008 avulsion at kusaha following the breach in the embankment sinha 2009a sinha et al 2014 majumder and ghosh 2018 this single event resulted in a maximum shift of 120 km of the kosi channel in the alluvial region for a few months and also in a large flood affecting more than 3 million people in nepal and northern bihar the kosi is often called the sorrow of bihar mainly because of its frequent and extensive floods and the migration that is often linked to them it is important to note that since the construction of the embankments most floods in the kosi basin have occurred because of the breaches in the embankment rather than through overbank flooding nine breaches have occurred since 1963 on both eastern and western embankments resulting in severe flooding mishra 2008 sinha et al 2014 the latest breach in august 2008 at kusaha 12 km upstream of the kosi barrage occurred at a relatively low water discharge 4 320 m3 s compared to the design discharge 28 500 m3 s of the embankment this was attributed to the fact that the river was very close to the avulsion threshold at that point because of its superelevated position sinha 2009a sinha et al 2014 hydroelectric power projects have a designed power production capacity this capacity depends on the discharge of the river and head at the turbine the extent of erosion and deposition will change because of spatiotemporal variability in meteorological conditions and to the hydrological and geomorphological characteristics of the basin landslides triggered by hillslope erosion levee breach and channel avulsion may result in partial or total abandonment of hydroelectric projects a recent example is a major landslide in the upstream reaches of the bhote kosi jure landslide in 2014 this created a large dam upstream and a small hydroelectric power station downstream became defunct further sediment extruding mechanisms may be required during higher sediment transport so that the channel is not filled or which prevent sediment from partially or fully entering the turbine the kosi basin is considered to have significant hydropower potential and at least three multipurpose projects the kosi high dam at barahkshetra the tamor i and the sun kosi kamla diversion project have been under discussion thapa 1993 chinnaswamy et al 2015 these projects have been conceived for flood and sediment control and for hydropower generation and partially for irrigation the high sediment yield of the kosi and its tributaries is a major concern for all these projects nayak 1996 the findings of this study will benefit hydropower projects by promoting an understanding of the spatial variability in sediment load at different catchments and the planning of an appropriate sediment control strategy similarly the information on flooding characteristics particularly on floods of different return periods will be very useful in designing hydropower capacity and infrastructure 6 conclusions the hydrological characteristics of the kosi river and its tributaries show significant spatial and temporal variability this first ever compilation of all available data for water discharge and sediment load for the entire kosi basin draining through nepal and northern bihar provides important insights about the influence of basin characteristics on flow and on sediment storage and transfer our analysis suggests that the western tributaries contribute 56 of the total annual flows at chatara whereas the central and eastern parts add 38 and 16 respectively further 40 of annual sediment load is contributed from the western tributaries 16 from the eastern tributaries and the remaining 44 from the central part of the kosi basin discharge sediment relationships suggest that the kosi river is supply limited at the upstream stations chatara and birpur but transport limited at the downstream station baltara leading to large scale aggradation in the alluvial reaches the embankments constructed on both sides of the river in 1955 1956 have constrained the river flow and this has increased in channel sedimentation significantly sediment budgeting from the study suggests that 408 million m3 of sediments may have accumulated between chatara and birpur and 1080 million m3 between birpur and baltara in the post embankment period of 54 years such large scale aggradation has resulted in superelevated channels at several locations leading to serious problems of channel instability and flooding this study shows that sediment dynamics in the kosi basin is one of the single most serious problems and is linked to several river related hazards sediment management plans should therefore become an integral part of river management of the kosi and its tributaries
