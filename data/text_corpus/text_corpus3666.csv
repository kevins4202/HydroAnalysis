18330,municipal wastewater can contain large amounts of organic micropollutants some of these substances are harmful to the environment even at low concentrations e g when being discharged untreated into surface water bodies in case of combined sewer overflows csos during or after heavy rainfall events constructed wetlands can be very effective in treating csos to date there have only been few investigations about the retention of micropollutants using retention soil filters rsfs which basically are vertical flow constructed wetlands with an additional retention area thus focus of this study was set on the interaction between dry periods loading events filter operation time and the resulting removal of micropollutants originating from csos the removal of 1 h benzotriazole carbamazepine diclofenac metoprolol sulfamethoxazole and bisphenol a was examined in four test scale rsfs removal efficiencies of approximately 70 were found for metoprolol 1 h benzotriazole diclofenac and bisphenol a were removed moderately between 30 and 40 for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole negative retention rates were found no significant correlations were found between removal efficiencies and the length of the antecedent dry period and or filter operation time however the study showed that removal efficiencies depend strongly on respective inflow concentrations thickness of the filter layer seems to have an influence as well does not lead to uniform results though graphical abstract image 1 keywords combined sewer overflow micropollutants pharmaceuticals retention

overflows csos since the late 1980s tondera et al 2018 although there are only few studies investigating the removal of micropollutants with these types of cws the so called retention soil filters rsfs have proven to be the most efficient treatment measure for the treatment and removal of different micropollutants from stormwater and cso bester and schäfer 2009 brunsch et al 2018 christoffels et al 2014 janzen et al 2009 tondera et al 2013 2019 the removal efficiency depends among others on the chemical characteristics of the micropollutant and the operating parameters melvin et al 2016 the availability of oxygen and exposure to light are major factors which influence the degradation of micropollutants matamoros and bayona 2008 since photodegradation aerobic and anaerobic degradation are important processes for the reduction of these substances furthermore the presence of plants contributes to the reduction of micropollutants in cws the organic substances can be adsorbed to the biofilm forming on the root surface or be taken up by the plants hijosa valsero et al 2016 the removal mechanism depends on the kow of the substance those with kow 4 are adsorbed while substances with 1 kow 4 are either removed by plant uptake or remain in the water as dissolved substances hijosa valsero et al 2016 imfeld et al 2009 for cws predictions of the removal efficiency based on characteristics such as eh in the filter body and hydrophobicity kow dow are not reliable on a macro scale since the eliminating mechanisms are very complex and occur on a micro scale hijosa valsero et al 2016 however rsfs are characterized by higher oxygen availability due to alternating operating and dry periods therefore the eh is an adequate approach to assess the removal efficiency of rsfs for substances like cod ammonium phosphorus e coli somatic coliphages and also diclofenac ruppelt et al 2018a additionally the abiotic removal mechanisms photodegradation and volatilization are influenced by the setup of the filter e g surface or subsurface flow the properties of the chosen macrophytes or the absence of substrate hydroponic medium previously laboratory experiments and studies on large scale were conducted showing high removal efficiencies for various micropollutants such as metoprolol diclofenac and bisphenol a 53 90 bester and schäfer 2009 brunsch et al 2018 christoffels et al 2014 janzen et al 2009 tondera et al 2013 2019 while standardized column experiments were developed to compare different types of substrate baumgarten et al 2011 jia et al 2007 however these were affected by highly fluctuating inflow concentrations changing environmental conditions as well as a small sample size tondera et al 2013 2019 therefore correlations regarding the retention and removal of micropollutants and boundary conditions were not possible to be analyzed studies that replicate the operating mode of large scale rsfs but allow combined sewage to be applied for prolonged periods under stable and defined operating parameters are yet missing consequently the study presented in this paper was conducted under controlled conditions in a foil greenhouse to ensure stable boundary conditions thus the different operating conditions of rsfs could be simulated and the resulting removal efficiencies of various constituents of combined sewage especially micropollutants compared based on this recommendations can be developed for operational optimization of existing large scale plants and for the construction of new rsfs 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot scale plant four pilot scale plants mimicking the functionality of large scale rsfs were built to investigate the processes and the extent of micropollutant removal from combined sewage in overflow conditions under different operation conditions and filter setups fig 1 shows the different setups the filters had a surface of approximately 4 m2 each and a retention volume of 4 m3 the filter material was sand 0 2 mm with a steep sieve curve and 20 of broken lime stone to prevent acidification in order to evaluate the influence of the filter height rsf 1 rsf 3a and rsf 3b had a layer height of 0 75 m rsf 2 only 0 5 m the effect of a serial connection was analyzed by connecting rsf 3a and rsf 3b rsf 3b was only loaded with the outflow of rsf 3a which was stored in a buffer tank and discharged onto the surface of rsf 3b as soon as the buffer capacity of 300 l was reached the process was repeated until rsf 3a was completely drained the pilot scale plants were loaded under defined conditions in a foil green house independent from natural precipitation and varying cso volumes details of construction and operation are given in ruppelt et al 2018b the filters were aerated using ventilation systems installed above each filter lateral openings in the greenhouse ensured ventilation inside the greenhouse itself each feeding consisted of 4 m³ of pre conditioned combined sewage for each filter the maximum flow of the loading was limited to 400 l h the discharge of the rsfs was set to 0 03 l m 2 s 1 at a pressure head of 1 m and measured automatically this resulted in a detention time of approximately 10 h in each filter additionally to achieve different conditions in the filters dry periods between loading events were designed to have different durations for sampling schedule see figure a1 supplementary material 2 2 composition and preparation of combined sewage for the study a stainless steel tank v 13 m³ with a stirring unit was used to prepare the combined sewage and feed it onto the rsfs large scale rsfs used to treat cso require a previous treatment step that removes settleable solids from the water by using the outflow of the preliminary sedimentation of the aachen soers wastewater treatment plant the effect of preliminary removal of water constituents in e g stormwater overflow tanks was taken into account in the present study the pre treated wastewater was diluted with drinking water to obtain pollutant concentrations comparable to those of csos in order to ensure the comparability of the synthetic cso the inflow concentrations of relevant parameters were compared to those of large scale applications in preliminary studies the concentrations of some components especially those that are characteristic for surface and road runoff e g heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons might be below those found in real cso however they were not targeted in this study the ratio of one part wastewater to four parts drinking water was established based on a desired cod concentration of 60 mg o2 l 2 3 sampling regime focus of the study was set on the interaction between dry periods loading events filter age and the resulting removal of pollutants the filter age is defined as time since the beginning of the experiment since the filter was newly constructed and only charged regularly for 2 months before beginning of the experiments to activate biofilm development and treatment processes samples were taken on 40 days during a time span of 394 days april 29th 2015 to may 27th 2016 on 27 of these days the samples were analyzed amongst others for the six aforementioned substances the periods between the samplings varied to investigate the influence of dry periods in between loading events on rsfs the dry periods are determined by time span from the end of the discharge of one event until the beginning of the loading of the next event investigated durations of the antecedent dry periods varied from 4 to 40 days the concentrations of the micropollutants diclofenac carbamazepine metoprolol sulfamethoxazole bisphenol a and 1 h benzotriazole as well as the cumulative parameters total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc were analyzed in the feed and effluent of all rsfs a programmable logic controller ensured a steady feeding of rsf 1 2 and 3a from the mixing tank the outflow of the rsfs was controlled with adjustable valves to approximately 0 03 l m 2 s 1 and started only after the retention volume reached a level of 0 75 m on top of the filter level outflow sampling started automatically 5 min after the outflow valves were opened glass bottles volume 10 5 l were washed in conventional dish washer subsequently sterilized and covered with aluminium foil until usage previous tests in our laboratory showed that residues of the micropollutants tested in this study were below limit of quantification loq after this procedure a sample of 500 ml was taken every 30 min until a sterilized marked glass bottle cooled down to 4 c and stored in a dark place was filled thus each event was sampled for approximately 10 h and consisted of 21 subsamples producing a sample volume of 10 5 l the mixed sample was then analyzed in the laboratory 2 4 laboratory analysis the method used for the analysis of toc was according to din en 1484 1997 doc was analyzed in the same way as toc after filtration with membrane filter pore size 0 45 μm the micropollutants chosen were the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine diclofenac metoprolol sulfamethoxazole as well as the industrial chemicals 1 h benzotriazole and bisphenol a bpa the investigated micropollutants were selected during a joint research collaboration between the environmental state agency the ministry of environment of north rhine westphalia and several research institutes since they are particularly relevant in this state diclofenac is used in human and veterinary medicine as a painkiller and to reduce inflammations as it can cause damages in the liver and kidneys of aquatic organisms it is regarded as a problematic micropollutant which requires removal from sewage however the remediation with several different technologies proves to be problematic auvinen et al 2017 matamoros et al 2009 the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole is polar and difficult to adsorb müller et al 2013 its removal from cso is necessary because residual concentrations of antibiotics in the environment can induce antibiotic resistances in bacteria baquero et al 2008 for metoprolol which is a widely used β blocker to treat heart diseases and slow down blood pressure the removal mechanisms in rsfs are still unknown the pharmaceutical is frequently detected in surface waters as its removal in conventional sewage treatment plants is low as the hydrophilic carbamazepine an anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy is persistent in sewage treatment plants as well it is one of the most frequently found drugs in surface waters matamoros et al 2007 2009 moermond 2014 additionaly 1 h benzotriazole e g used as corrosion inhibitor is one of the most frequently detected micropollutants in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants there it is found in concentrations of μg l although it is known to be toxic to aquatic organisms matamoros et al 2010 the chemical bpa is used for various applications it has been identified as an endocrine disruptor whose presence in surface waters causes a threat to the health of humans and animals and the balance of the ecosystem li et al 2007 it is antioxidant and highly resistant to chemical degradation different statements regarding the biodegradability of bpa can be found in literature while some authors classified the chemical as readily biodegradable e g klečka et al 2001 other state its non biodegradability li et al 2007 the above mentioned micropollutants were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry thermo fisher scientific ltq orbitrap after purification and concentration of the samples using solid phase extraction limits of quantification loqs are given in table 1 3 results table 1 gives an overview of mean and median concentrations and the resulting removal efficiencies of all filters as rsf 1 and rsf 3a are set up as replicates they show quasi identical concentrations and removals therefore they are analyzed collectively mean of rsf 1 and rsf 3a rsf 1 3a in fig 2 which illustrates the distributions of the concentrations and removal efficiencies in the different filters the feed concentration of toc is at a mean of 27 mg l and about 56 higher than that of doc at a mean of 17 mg l for both parameters the effluent concentration is lowest after the series connection rsf 3a 3b followed by rsf 1 3a for the thinner filter rsf 2 the mean concentration is 28 toc and 61 doc higher than after rsf 3a 3b regarding the micropollutants the feed concentration of 1 h benzotriazole at a mean of 2 294 ng l is considerably higher compared to the other substances sulfamethoxazole is present at a mean concentration of less than a quarter of that of 1 h benzotriazole at 509 ng l however there are high variations of the presence of this substance from 14 ng l to 5 560 ng l therefore the median of sulfamethoxazole is noticeably lower at 73 ng l making it the lowest median value of all investigated micropollutants the 10 of the highest values are not depicted in fig 2 for graphical reasons maximum values above 1 000 ng l are also observed for diclofenac 1 060 ng l the second highest feed concentration with a mean concentration of 447 ng l and a median of 349 ng l carbamazepine however shows the lowest mean concentrations at 116 ng l as well as the lowest maximum at 213 ng l diclofenac metoprolol bisphenol a and 1 h benzotriazole show the same pattern of effluent concentrations regarding the different rsfs the mean and median concentrations are lowest after the series connection rsf 3a 3b likewise the thinnest filter layer rsf 2 yields the highest effluent concentrations of the aforementioned parameters for diclofenac and metoprolol it is more than twice as high as the mean concentration of rsf 3a 3b but only slightly higher compared to rsf 1 3a these four micropollutants are efficiently removed in all rsfs showing the highest mean removal efficiency in rsf 3a 3b for metoprolol at 87 the β receptor blocker metoprolol is not only remediated the most efficiently it also never exceeds effluent concentrations of 200 ng l therefore indicating a very stable removal also in many samples the effluent concentration for metoprolol was below the loq thus indicating a very effective removal in contrast the removal of bisphenol a in rsf 1 3a and rsf 2 varies noticeably although remaining always positive there is no retention of carbamazepine in any of the rsfs the effluent concentration after the rsfs is higher than the feed concentration showing only a marginal difference between the median and mean values the rsfs do not contribute to the remediation of sulfamethoxazole none of the rsfs shows positive mean removal efficiencies ranging from 5 rsf 2 to 98 rsf 3a 3b the median removal efficiencies indicate variations of the reduction in each filter rsf 2 and rsf 3a show positive median values at 5 and 6 respectively whereas those of rsf 1 6 and rsf 3a 3b 55 are negative albeit not as much as the mean values hence the rsfs seem to be capable of reducing the peak concentrations but not to consistently reduce the sulfamethoxazole concentration the micropollutants show no noticeable trend which relates the removal efficiency to the antecedent dry period all parameters show negative or their lowest i e 1 h benzotriazole reductions after a dry period of 13 days for metoprolol and diclofenac rsf 3a 3b is an exception resulting in positive removal efficiencies whereas 1 h benzotriazole only shows a negative value 77 in the series connection after a dry period of 13 days however there was only one event with this duration furthermore the feed concentration of this loading event was low so that there is no apparent link to the duration of the dry period 4 discussion even though the feed was composed using the same mixing ratio for each trial strong variations in all concentrations occurred due to the nature of the used real wastewater similar to the ones observed by tondera et al 2013 2019 it should be noted that analytical uncertainties get higher as concentrations are closer to the loq choubert et al 2011 the authors state an analytical uncertainty between 30 and 100 for low concentration levels and below 30 for high concentration levels while the limit between both concentration levels is given as between 2 5 and 10 times the limit of quantification the inflow and outflow concentrations are given in table a 2 supplementary material the influence of these concentrations on the results will be discussed in the following for each parameter additionally other factors influence the accuracy of micropollutant concentration determination such as materials used for the installations e g bisphenol a concentrations in plastic hoses and the choice of sampling bottles we tried to eliminate those by using glass bottles and bisphenol a free containers for the pilots but cross contaminations cannot be completely excluded table 2 gives an overview of the half life periods speed of their natural decay and log kow values extent of their hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of the analyzed micropollutants they show strong variations of the half life periods from less than one day to more than 100 days however these values were obtained in differently set up studies 4 1 diclofenac variations of the removal efficiency of diclofenac were recorded in other studies christoffels et al 2014 mertens et al 2012 scheurer et al 2015 tondera et al 2013 interestingly the median feed and effluent concentrations in our study are remarkably higher than the ones observed by christoffels et al 2014 the lowest median effluent concentration for diclofenac in our study rsf 3a 3b at 138 ng l is about as high as the feed concentration in christoffels et al 2014 although the catchment area has similar properties and is located in the same region given that especially close to the limit of quantification the removal efficiencies in comparable studies are higher 65 99 instead of 19 61 christoffels et al 2014 sauvêtre and schröder 2015 scheurer et al 2015 tondera et al 2013 tondera et al 2019 but exclusively tested on a large scale these results are likely overestimated as tondera et al 2019 showed investigations with limited tested events n 5 to 33 in the mentioned studies can easily overestimate the true removal efficiency when investigated on large scale plants hence long term studies on removal on large scale plants most likely will show lower removal efficiencies as expected the series connection rsf 3a 3b removed approximately twice as much as the single rsfs 1 2 and 3a at a median of 62 of the initial diclofenac concentration matamoros and bayona 2008 found noticeable differences between the removal efficiencies of diclofenac in different cw types most likely related to the length of the hydraulic retention time horizontal flow constructed wetlands hfcws 6 15 decrease the diclofenac concentration less than vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcws 73 and surface flow constructed wetlands sfcws 73 96 for saturated soil removal efficiencies of 53 2 were recorded matamoros et al 2007 the removal of this substance was not linked to the oxygen supply but mostly biodegradation matamoros et al 2007 matamoros and bayona 2008 however the chloride in the structure of the substance is believed to make it less available for biodegradation therefore causing lower removal efficiencies kimura et al 2005 matamoros et al 2009 scheurer et al 2015 the biological half life during winter in higher latitude regions and in water without salt or organics is at 10 6 days andreozzi et al 2003 in terms of feed concentrations no seasonal effect was observed mersmann 2003 studied the removal processes for diclofenac laboratory tests investigating unsaturated zones showed that the substance is absorbed at a ph below 7 in aerobic conditions it is degraded biologically in addition to aerobic conditions the redox potential has an effect on the removal of diclofenac kuhlmann et al 2010 hydrophilic ionic compounds form more hydrophobic compounds when the ph falls below the pka value this ensures a steady availability for sorption by biomass and higher removal efficiencies under acidic conditions rattier et al 2014 the log kow 4 which implicates very hydrophobic behavior makes diclofenac unavailable for plant uptake but being held back in the root epidermis imfeld et al 2009 regarding values between 2 5 and 10 times loq only rsf 3b shows frequent values in this range at six out of 24 events the concentrations are between 25 and 100 ng l whereas after two events values below 10 ng l were measured this means that the removal efficiency of 61 20 for the serial connection of rsf 3a 3b can be both over or underestimated but compared to the removal efficiencies for the other filters which are between 19 and 33 an overestimation seems more likely 4 2 carbamazepine other studies showed that the reduction of carbamazepine in rsfs was low matamoros and bayona 2008 scheurer et al 2015 tondera et al 2013 tondera et al 2019 this can be explained by the limited removal mechanisms for this substances since it is mainly reduced to sorption carbamazepine shows moderately hydrophilic characteristics log kow 2 45 table 2 sfcws show higher removal efficiencies compared to other flow types due to the prolonged retention time matamoros and bayona 2008 the biological half life period during winter in higher latitude regions and in water without salt or organics is at 100 days andreozzi et al 2003 this indicates a high resistance to biodegration which is confirmed in bertelkamp et al 2014 therefore the removal of carbamazepine is not signifcantly influenced by temperature matamoros et al 2008 however sauvêtre and schröder 2015 found several bacteria isolates which possess carbamazepine uptake and plant growth promoting traits phosphate solubilization siderophore production and auxin production so that they achieved removal efficiencies of 90 by plant uptake of phragmites australis after 9 days in this study carbamazepine concentrations were not reduced even more so the removal efficiency decreases when the length of the flow path increases this might be caused by metabolites and degradation products in the inflow which recombine to the original substance ternes 1998 in contaminated environments these metabolites and degradation products are found at concentrations of 10 of the original substance moermond 2014 after consumption of the drug the human body metabolizes about 11 of carbamazepine to carbamazepine n glucoronide and excretes it with the urine in the rsfs this conjugate is then transformed back to the original substance this can lead to an increase of the original feed concentration of 100 hence the recombination of carbamazepine n glucoronide explains the low reduction of the drug in rsfs scheurer et al 2015 another metabolite carbamazepine o glucoronide is a lot more unstable and therefore already hydrolysed on its way to the treatment plant bahlmann et al 2014 furthermore the recombination of metabolites into the parent compound can also occur in natural ecosystems as the ecological risk of most metabolites is equivalent or even higher than for the parent compound the negative removal for carbamazepine inside the rsfs does not necessarily imply a higher burden for receiving water bodies thus regarding harmful metabolites a recombination inside the filter body can even be advantageous further studies investigating concentrations of the specific metabolites in the feed and effluent are necessary to estimate the fate and removal as well as the ecological risk originating from carbamazepine and its metabolites bahlmann et al 2014 kaiser et al 2013 since anaerobic conditions are necessary for a degradation of the substance mersmann 2003 a post treatment step is required if considerable removal of carbamazepine is required for eight out of 28 events values between 2 5 and 10 times loq were measured in the inflow and in four to six cases also in the outflow of each filter although the concentrations were mostly close to 100 ng l if comparing the inflow and outflow values of these events table a2 supplementary material a zero reduction or an even higher negative reduction can be assumed which does not change the general interpretation regarding the removal of this substance 4 3 metoprolol chen et al 2016 assume that in dense root networks sufficient oxygen is available for aerobic biodegradation in the rhizosphere in order to remove metoprolol in hfcws furthermore the plants are able to take up the drug due to its moderately hydrophobic characteristics log kow 1 88 chen et al 2016 scheurer et al 2015 agree that biological degradation is the main process responsible for the removal efficiency of 84 in their study additionally metoprolol could be adsorbed to negatively charged sediment particles as the substance is mainly cationic at typical environmental ph values scheurer et al 2015 previous studies showed higher concentrations of metoprolol in the feed 345 809 ng l tondera et al 2013 compared to this study among the investigated micropollutants in our study metoprolol was removed the most efficiently one event with negative removal in rsf 1 was noted which could be caused by several previous loading events with short dry periods and very low concentrations of 102 ng l two other events with removal efficiencies below 50 occurred with low feed concentrations as well in total outflow values were only 2 5 to 10 times higher than the loq for 12 events for each filter and even below this value four times for rsf 1 two times for rsf 2 once for rsf 3a and even six times for rsf 3b hence the uncertainty resulting from these events cannot be neglected and both over and underestimation of the removal efficiency is possible 4 4 sulfamethoxazole while baumgarten et al 2011 determined the biological half life time of sulfamethxazole under oxygen availability to be 9 d this is not applicable to this study these results were obtained over a study period of 27 months at a feed concentration of 250 ng l whereas this study was conducted over a period of 15 months with strongly varying feed concentrations the sensitivity of the results related to the set up of the study is further demonstrated by the varying effect of biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole larcher and yargeau 2012 however as the drug is difficult to adsorb microbial activity is the main mechanism responsible for the retention of the substance müller et al 2013 the removal of sulfamethoxazole depends on the oxygen availability schmidt et al 2003 found no removal under aerobic conditions anaerobic conditions however facilitate a good removal of the substance anoxic conditions enable a reduction of sulfamethoxazole as well kuhlmann et al 2010 the range of the feed concentration in this study is higher than in the study of tondera et al 2013 which accounted for values of 81 ng l to 241 ng l the same study yielded higher removal efficiencies of 13 33 compared to the negative removal in this study the median effluent concentration increased even with the filter thickness this can possibly be explained with the reconversion of metabolites and conjugates larcher and yargeau 2012 nödler et al 2012 comparabel to the processes concerning carbamazepine inflow values were only 2 5 to 10 times the loq for 14 events and once even below this value accordingly outflow values were 12 14 times 2 5 to 10 times the loq for rsf 1 to rsf 3a and five times in this range for rsf 3b if only events with inflow concentrations 100 ng l are considered all ouftflow values are also 100 ng l and removal efficiencies are between 21 18 and 23 22 for rsf 1 to 3a and 16 7 for rsf 3a 3b which means that the serial connection has no further impact on the removal efficiency 4 5 bisphenol a several biotic and abiotic mechanisms contribute to the degradation of bisphenol a this includes biodegradation adsorption to solids and suspended solids and possibly photodegradation staples et al 1998 adsorption to the filter is the first process to fix the substance followed by biodegradation as the main removal process there is no removal due to volatilization dan et al 2017 kuhlmann et al 2010 determined biological degradation of bpa to take less than 10 days accordingly dan et al 2017 found higher removal efficiencies in planted cw compared to unplanted filters the rhizosphere of these aquatic plants accommodates bacteria involved in the biodegradation of the chemical kurzbaum et al 2010 the present feed concentration of bisphenol a 204 124 ng l is markedly lower than in comparable studies tondera et al 2013 recorded values as high as 708 ng l to 1 164 ng l the removal efficiencies of the same study are in a comparable range of 64 73 furthermore some of the negative removal efficiencies in the present study could be related to extremely low feed concentrations below the loq which were recorded for two events furthermore for 15 events outflow concentrations were between 2 5 and 10 times the loq or below these values therefore analytical uncertainties can be assumed higher for bisphenol a than for the other investigated micropollutants 4 6 1 h benzotriazole the low kow and ionization of 1 h benzotriazole cause inefficient reduction by adsoption matamoros et al 2010 jia et al 2007 agree with the sorption being negligible however they state that adsorption can be improved by increasing the amount of iron in the substrate and the retention time biodegradation was observed to be a removal mechanisms in aerobic and anaerobic conditions it is more efficient under aerobic conditions albeit the half life period is above 100 days under both conditions which explains the difficult degradation liu et al 2011 in rsfs photodegradation and plant uptake are further mechanisms that contribute to the reduction of 1 h benzotriazole matamoros et al 2010 previous studies recorded moderate removal efficiencies of 1 h benzotriazole reemtsma et al 2010 voutsa et al 2006 scheurer et al 2015 found a reduction of 66 20 whereas matamoros et al 2010 recorded high removal efficiencies of 89 93 the median of the feed concentration in this study is similar to the one recorded by tondera et al 2013 at 1 433 ng l with removal efficiencies from 32 to 48 which are therefore slightly higher than the 25 34 presented here the series connection has no influence on the median removal efficiencies however it is able to facilitate more consistent removal efficiencies as detected concentrations were considerably above the loq the issue of analytical uncertainties due to values near the loq is negligible 4 7 correlations 4 7 1 influence of design and operation significant pearson correlations were found between the feed and effluent concentration for the investigated micropollutants as depicted in table 3 the inflow and effluent concentrations vary significantly except the effluent concentrations of metoprolol as these are permanently low there are no correlations between the inflow and effluent of this substance table 4 shows the results of the pearson correlation analysis between the filter age and the removal efficiency the filter age was defined as the operational time since the beginning of the experiments and thus ranged between 1 and 338 days diclofenac and metoprolol indicate a relation of the length of the filter operation time to the removal efficiency of micropollutants yet this correlation is difficult to verify as the duration of the dry periods in between the feeding events varies as well imfeld et al 2009 remark that the sorption of organic biomass in rsfs decreases over time as the capacity is the highest before the first feeding the influence of the filter thickness on the removal efficiency can be shown by comparing the average removal efficiencies of rsf 1 3a 0 75 m and rsf 2 0 5 m the thickness of the filter layer seems to influence the removal of diclofenac positively at a thickness of 0 75 m the average removal efficiency is at 29 while the thinner filter layer achieves efficiencies of 19 in contrast to diclofenac the influence of the thickness of the filter layer on the removal efficiency appears to be negative for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole both of these substances show negative average removal efficiencies in these rsfs the average removal of carbamazepine in rsf 2 32 is not as negative as in rsf 1 3a 41 similarly for sulfamethoxazole rsf 2 5 yields not as low removal efficiencies as rsf 1 3a 20 the difference of 0 25 m in the filter layer does not seem to influence the removal of 1 h benzotriazole 28 1 metoprolol 70 2 and bpa 30 2 the series connection of rsf 3a 3b shows a noticeable positive influence on the reduction of diclofenac metoprolol and bpa for carbamazepine the series connection results in lower removal efficiencies for the substances 1 h benzotriazole and sulfamethoxazole there are no obvious differences between the rsfs 4 7 2 influence of toc and doc concentrations carbon is removed efficiently in all rsfs only very small feed concentrations 5 5 mg l and 3 9 mg l yield negative removal efficiencies in the effluent of the rsfs the concentration of toc is only about 15 rsf 3a 3b and 3 rsf 1 3a higher than the doc concentration interestingly it is lower in rsf 2 indicating a very efficient removal of suspended organic carbon and a noticeable retention of doc as the micropollutants contain carbon an investigation of correlations between the removal of these substances and toc or doc was conducted the resulting pearson coefficients are presented in table a3 and table a4 supplementary material the removal efficiency of 1 h benzotriazole in rsf 2 and that of diclofenac in rsf 3b were correlated to the removal of toc significance at the 0 01 level 2 tailed at the significance level of 0 05 carbamazepine and diclofenac were correlated to the reduction of toc in rsf 3a 3b furthermore the removal of doc was correlated to the reductions of some micropollutants in the respective rsfs at the 0 01 level 2 tailed sulfamethoxazole in rsf 1 and with a significance at the 0 05 level 1 h benzotriazole in rsf 3a metoprolol in rsf 3b and bpa in rsf 3a 3b however there are no consistent correlations apparent 5 conclusions the removal efficiencies of micropollutants showed varying results linked to different filter conditions e g filter layer thickness and removal pathways biochemical adsorption physical parameters 1 h benzotriazole was removed by approximately 30 on average and the removal was not correlated to the thickness of the filter layer similar removal efficiencies were recorded in rsf 1 and rsf 3a for bpa and increased to 65 in the series connection rsf 3a 3b diclofenac was removed a bit less efficiently by 19 33 while the increase of the removal efficiency in the series connection was not as high yielding in a reduction of 60 the highest removal efficiency in the single rsfs was recorded for metoprolol at approximately 70 for this substance there is a positive correlation between the thickness of the filter layer and the removal efficiency rsf 3a 3b reduce metoprolol on average by 88 however rsfs proved not to be efficient at reducing the concentrations of sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine in the filter carbamazepine metabolites transform back to their original substance and cause negative removal efficiencies regarding the ecological risk of carbamazepine and its metabolites a recombination of metabolites inside the filter body can be considered advantageous though sulfamethoxazole was influenced by strong variations of the feed concentrations 14 4 560 ng l yet negative average removal efficiencies in all rsfs lead to the conclusion of recombination of metabolites and degradation products of this substance as well there were strong and some very strong correlations between the feed concentration and the effluent concentration in contrast the dry period between two loading events does not seem to have an impact on the removal efficiency for carbamazepine and metoprolol a correlation was found between removal efficiency and the filter age the filter age was defined as the operational time since the beginning of the experiments an evaluation of the influence of the filter age on the retention of various substances is currently only possible to a limited extent since such an influence in rsfs can only be reliably confirmed after a longer filter running time since the experimental filters were only operated for over a year as part of the research project only trends could be derived additionally this correlation has to be verified as results could be falsified due to simultaneous change in the length of dry periods declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18330,municipal wastewater can contain large amounts of organic micropollutants some of these substances are harmful to the environment even at low concentrations e g when being discharged untreated into surface water bodies in case of combined sewer overflows csos during or after heavy rainfall events constructed wetlands can be very effective in treating csos to date there have only been few investigations about the retention of micropollutants using retention soil filters rsfs which basically are vertical flow constructed wetlands with an additional retention area thus focus of this study was set on the interaction between dry periods loading events filter operation time and the resulting removal of micropollutants originating from csos the removal of 1 h benzotriazole carbamazepine diclofenac metoprolol sulfamethoxazole and bisphenol a was examined in four test scale rsfs removal efficiencies of approximately 70 were found for metoprolol 1 h benzotriazole diclofenac and bisphenol a were removed moderately between 30 and 40 for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole negative retention rates were found no significant correlations were found between removal efficiencies and the length of the antecedent dry period and or filter operation time however the study showed that removal efficiencies depend strongly on respective inflow concentrations thickness of the filter layer seems to have an influence as well does not lead to uniform results though graphical abstract image 1 keywords combined sewer overflow micropollutants pharmaceuticals retention

overflows csos since the late 1980s tondera et al 2018 although there are only few studies investigating the removal of micropollutants with these types of cws the so called retention soil filters rsfs have proven to be the most efficient treatment measure for the treatment and removal of different micropollutants from stormwater and cso bester and schäfer 2009 brunsch et al 2018 christoffels et al 2014 janzen et al 2009 tondera et al 2013 2019 the removal efficiency depends among others on the chemical characteristics of the micropollutant and the operating parameters melvin et al 2016 the availability of oxygen and exposure to light are major factors which influence the degradation of micropollutants matamoros and bayona 2008 since photodegradation aerobic and anaerobic degradation are important processes for the reduction of these substances furthermore the presence of plants contributes to the reduction of micropollutants in cws the organic substances can be adsorbed to the biofilm forming on the root surface or be taken up by the plants hijosa valsero et al 2016 the removal mechanism depends on the kow of the substance those with kow 4 are adsorbed while substances with 1 kow 4 are either removed by plant uptake or remain in the water as dissolved substances hijosa valsero et al 2016 imfeld et al 2009 for cws predictions of the removal efficiency based on characteristics such as eh in the filter body and hydrophobicity kow dow are not reliable on a macro scale since the eliminating mechanisms are very complex and occur on a micro scale hijosa valsero et al 2016 however rsfs are characterized by higher oxygen availability due to alternating operating and dry periods therefore the eh is an adequate approach to assess the removal efficiency of rsfs for substances like cod ammonium phosphorus e coli somatic coliphages and also diclofenac ruppelt et al 2018a additionally the abiotic removal mechanisms photodegradation and volatilization are influenced by the setup of the filter e g surface or subsurface flow the properties of the chosen macrophytes or the absence of substrate hydroponic medium previously laboratory experiments and studies on large scale were conducted showing high removal efficiencies for various micropollutants such as metoprolol diclofenac and bisphenol a 53 90 bester and schäfer 2009 brunsch et al 2018 christoffels et al 2014 janzen et al 2009 tondera et al 2013 2019 while standardized column experiments were developed to compare different types of substrate baumgarten et al 2011 jia et al 2007 however these were affected by highly fluctuating inflow concentrations changing environmental conditions as well as a small sample size tondera et al 2013 2019 therefore correlations regarding the retention and removal of micropollutants and boundary conditions were not possible to be analyzed studies that replicate the operating mode of large scale rsfs but allow combined sewage to be applied for prolonged periods under stable and defined operating parameters are yet missing consequently the study presented in this paper was conducted under controlled conditions in a foil greenhouse to ensure stable boundary conditions thus the different operating conditions of rsfs could be simulated and the resulting removal efficiencies of various constituents of combined sewage especially micropollutants compared based on this recommendations can be developed for operational optimization of existing large scale plants and for the construction of new rsfs 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot scale plant four pilot scale plants mimicking the functionality of large scale rsfs were built to investigate the processes and the extent of micropollutant removal from combined sewage in overflow conditions under different operation conditions and filter setups fig 1 shows the different setups the filters had a surface of approximately 4 m2 each and a retention volume of 4 m3 the filter material was sand 0 2 mm with a steep sieve curve and 20 of broken lime stone to prevent acidification in order to evaluate the influence of the filter height rsf 1 rsf 3a and rsf 3b had a layer height of 0 75 m rsf 2 only 0 5 m the effect of a serial connection was analyzed by connecting rsf 3a and rsf 3b rsf 3b was only loaded with the outflow of rsf 3a which was stored in a buffer tank and discharged onto the surface of rsf 3b as soon as the buffer capacity of 300 l was reached the process was repeated until rsf 3a was completely drained the pilot scale plants were loaded under defined conditions in a foil green house independent from natural precipitation and varying cso volumes details of construction and operation are given in ruppelt et al 2018b the filters were aerated using ventilation systems installed above each filter lateral openings in the greenhouse ensured ventilation inside the greenhouse itself each feeding consisted of 4 m³ of pre conditioned combined sewage for each filter the maximum flow of the loading was limited to 400 l h the discharge of the rsfs was set to 0 03 l m 2 s 1 at a pressure head of 1 m and measured automatically this resulted in a detention time of approximately 10 h in each filter additionally to achieve different conditions in the filters dry periods between loading events were designed to have different durations for sampling schedule see figure a1 supplementary material 2 2 composition and preparation of combined sewage for the study a stainless steel tank v 13 m³ with a stirring unit was used to prepare the combined sewage and feed it onto the rsfs large scale rsfs used to treat cso require a previous treatment step that removes settleable solids from the water by using the outflow of the preliminary sedimentation of the aachen soers wastewater treatment plant the effect of preliminary removal of water constituents in e g stormwater overflow tanks was taken into account in the present study the pre treated wastewater was diluted with drinking water to obtain pollutant concentrations comparable to those of csos in order to ensure the comparability of the synthetic cso the inflow concentrations of relevant parameters were compared to those of large scale applications in preliminary studies the concentrations of some components especially those that are characteristic for surface and road runoff e g heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons might be below those found in real cso however they were not targeted in this study the ratio of one part wastewater to four parts drinking water was established based on a desired cod concentration of 60 mg o2 l 2 3 sampling regime focus of the study was set on the interaction between dry periods loading events filter age and the resulting removal of pollutants the filter age is defined as time since the beginning of the experiment since the filter was newly constructed and only charged regularly for 2 months before beginning of the experiments to activate biofilm development and treatment processes samples were taken on 40 days during a time span of 394 days april 29th 2015 to may 27th 2016 on 27 of these days the samples were analyzed amongst others for the six aforementioned substances the periods between the samplings varied to investigate the influence of dry periods in between loading events on rsfs the dry periods are determined by time span from the end of the discharge of one event until the beginning of the loading of the next event investigated durations of the antecedent dry periods varied from 4 to 40 days the concentrations of the micropollutants diclofenac carbamazepine metoprolol sulfamethoxazole bisphenol a and 1 h benzotriazole as well as the cumulative parameters total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc were analyzed in the feed and effluent of all rsfs a programmable logic controller ensured a steady feeding of rsf 1 2 and 3a from the mixing tank the outflow of the rsfs was controlled with adjustable valves to approximately 0 03 l m 2 s 1 and started only after the retention volume reached a level of 0 75 m on top of the filter level outflow sampling started automatically 5 min after the outflow valves were opened glass bottles volume 10 5 l were washed in conventional dish washer subsequently sterilized and covered with aluminium foil until usage previous tests in our laboratory showed that residues of the micropollutants tested in this study were below limit of quantification loq after this procedure a sample of 500 ml was taken every 30 min until a sterilized marked glass bottle cooled down to 4 c and stored in a dark place was filled thus each event was sampled for approximately 10 h and consisted of 21 subsamples producing a sample volume of 10 5 l the mixed sample was then analyzed in the laboratory 2 4 laboratory analysis the method used for the analysis of toc was according to din en 1484 1997 doc was analyzed in the same way as toc after filtration with membrane filter pore size 0 45 μm the micropollutants chosen were the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine diclofenac metoprolol sulfamethoxazole as well as the industrial chemicals 1 h benzotriazole and bisphenol a bpa the investigated micropollutants were selected during a joint research collaboration between the environmental state agency the ministry of environment of north rhine westphalia and several research institutes since they are particularly relevant in this state diclofenac is used in human and veterinary medicine as a painkiller and to reduce inflammations as it can cause damages in the liver and kidneys of aquatic organisms it is regarded as a problematic micropollutant which requires removal from sewage however the remediation with several different technologies proves to be problematic auvinen et al 2017 matamoros et al 2009 the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole is polar and difficult to adsorb müller et al 2013 its removal from cso is necessary because residual concentrations of antibiotics in the environment can induce antibiotic resistances in bacteria baquero et al 2008 for metoprolol which is a widely used β blocker to treat heart diseases and slow down blood pressure the removal mechanisms in rsfs are still unknown the pharmaceutical is frequently detected in surface waters as its removal in conventional sewage treatment plants is low as the hydrophilic carbamazepine an anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy is persistent in sewage treatment plants as well it is one of the most frequently found drugs in surface waters matamoros et al 2007 2009 moermond 2014 additionaly 1 h benzotriazole e g used as corrosion inhibitor is one of the most frequently detected micropollutants in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants there it is found in concentrations of μg l although it is known to be toxic to aquatic organisms matamoros et al 2010 the chemical bpa is used for various applications it has been identified as an endocrine disruptor whose presence in surface waters causes a threat to the health of humans and animals and the balance of the ecosystem li et al 2007 it is antioxidant and highly resistant to chemical degradation different statements regarding the biodegradability of bpa can be found in literature while some authors classified the chemical as readily biodegradable e g klečka et al 2001 other state its non biodegradability li et al 2007 the above mentioned micropollutants were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry thermo fisher scientific ltq orbitrap after purification and concentration of the samples using solid phase extraction limits of quantification loqs are given in table 1 3 results table 1 gives an overview of mean and median concentrations and the resulting removal efficiencies of all filters as rsf 1 and rsf 3a are set up as replicates they show quasi identical concentrations and removals therefore they are analyzed collectively mean of rsf 1 and rsf 3a rsf 1 3a in fig 2 which illustrates the distributions of the concentrations and removal efficiencies in the different filters the feed concentration of toc is at a mean of 27 mg l and about 56 higher than that of doc at a mean of 17 mg l for both parameters the effluent concentration is lowest after the series connection rsf 3a 3b followed by rsf 1 3a for the thinner filter rsf 2 the mean concentration is 28 toc and 61 doc higher than after rsf 3a 3b regarding the micropollutants the feed concentration of 1 h benzotriazole at a mean of 2 294 ng l is considerably higher compared to the other substances sulfamethoxazole is present at a mean concentration of less than a quarter of that of 1 h benzotriazole at 509 ng l however there are high variations of the presence of this substance from 14 ng l to 5 560 ng l therefore the median of sulfamethoxazole is noticeably lower at 73 ng l making it the lowest median value of all investigated micropollutants the 10 of the highest values are not depicted in fig 2 for graphical reasons maximum values above 1 000 ng l are also observed for diclofenac 1 060 ng l the second highest feed concentration with a mean concentration of 447 ng l and a median of 349 ng l carbamazepine however shows the lowest mean concentrations at 116 ng l as well as the lowest maximum at 213 ng l diclofenac metoprolol bisphenol a and 1 h benzotriazole show the same pattern of effluent concentrations regarding the different rsfs the mean and median concentrations are lowest after the series connection rsf 3a 3b likewise the thinnest filter layer rsf 2 yields the highest effluent concentrations of the aforementioned parameters for diclofenac and metoprolol it is more than twice as high as the mean concentration of rsf 3a 3b but only slightly higher compared to rsf 1 3a these four micropollutants are efficiently removed in all rsfs showing the highest mean removal efficiency in rsf 3a 3b for metoprolol at 87 the β receptor blocker metoprolol is not only remediated the most efficiently it also never exceeds effluent concentrations of 200 ng l therefore indicating a very stable removal also in many samples the effluent concentration for metoprolol was below the loq thus indicating a very effective removal in contrast the removal of bisphenol a in rsf 1 3a and rsf 2 varies noticeably although remaining always positive there is no retention of carbamazepine in any of the rsfs the effluent concentration after the rsfs is higher than the feed concentration showing only a marginal difference between the median and mean values the rsfs do not contribute to the remediation of sulfamethoxazole none of the rsfs shows positive mean removal efficiencies ranging from 5 rsf 2 to 98 rsf 3a 3b the median removal efficiencies indicate variations of the reduction in each filter rsf 2 and rsf 3a show positive median values at 5 and 6 respectively whereas those of rsf 1 6 and rsf 3a 3b 55 are negative albeit not as much as the mean values hence the rsfs seem to be capable of reducing the peak concentrations but not to consistently reduce the sulfamethoxazole concentration the micropollutants show no noticeable trend which relates the removal efficiency to the antecedent dry period all parameters show negative or their lowest i e 1 h benzotriazole reductions after a dry period of 13 days for metoprolol and diclofenac rsf 3a 3b is an exception resulting in positive removal efficiencies whereas 1 h benzotriazole only shows a negative value 77 in the series connection after a dry period of 13 days however there was only one event with this duration furthermore the feed concentration of this loading event was low so that there is no apparent link to the duration of the dry period 4 discussion even though the feed was composed using the same mixing ratio for each trial strong variations in all concentrations occurred due to the nature of the used real wastewater similar to the ones observed by tondera et al 2013 2019 it should be noted that analytical uncertainties get higher as concentrations are closer to the loq choubert et al 2011 the authors state an analytical uncertainty between 30 and 100 for low concentration levels and below 30 for high concentration levels while the limit between both concentration levels is given as between 2 5 and 10 times the limit of quantification the inflow and outflow concentrations are given in table a 2 supplementary material the influence of these concentrations on the results will be discussed in the following for each parameter additionally other factors influence the accuracy of micropollutant concentration determination such as materials used for the installations e g bisphenol a concentrations in plastic hoses and the choice of sampling bottles we tried to eliminate those by using glass bottles and bisphenol a free containers for the pilots but cross contaminations cannot be completely excluded table 2 gives an overview of the half life periods speed of their natural decay and log kow values extent of their hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of the analyzed micropollutants they show strong variations of the half life periods from less than one day to more than 100 days however these values were obtained in differently set up studies 4 1 diclofenac variations of the removal efficiency of diclofenac were recorded in other studies christoffels et al 2014 mertens et al 2012 scheurer et al 2015 tondera et al 2013 interestingly the median feed and effluent concentrations in our study are remarkably higher than the ones observed by christoffels et al 2014 the lowest median effluent concentration for diclofenac in our study rsf 3a 3b at 138 ng l is about as high as the feed concentration in christoffels et al 2014 although the catchment area has similar properties and is located in the same region given that especially close to the limit of quantification the removal efficiencies in comparable studies are higher 65 99 instead of 19 61 christoffels et al 2014 sauvêtre and schröder 2015 scheurer et al 2015 tondera et al 2013 tondera et al 2019 but exclusively tested on a large scale these results are likely overestimated as tondera et al 2019 showed investigations with limited tested events n 5 to 33 in the mentioned studies can easily overestimate the true removal efficiency when investigated on large scale plants hence long term studies on removal on large scale plants most likely will show lower removal efficiencies as expected the series connection rsf 3a 3b removed approximately twice as much as the single rsfs 1 2 and 3a at a median of 62 of the initial diclofenac concentration matamoros and bayona 2008 found noticeable differences between the removal efficiencies of diclofenac in different cw types most likely related to the length of the hydraulic retention time horizontal flow constructed wetlands hfcws 6 15 decrease the diclofenac concentration less than vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcws 73 and surface flow constructed wetlands sfcws 73 96 for saturated soil removal efficiencies of 53 2 were recorded matamoros et al 2007 the removal of this substance was not linked to the oxygen supply but mostly biodegradation matamoros et al 2007 matamoros and bayona 2008 however the chloride in the structure of the substance is believed to make it less available for biodegradation therefore causing lower removal efficiencies kimura et al 2005 matamoros et al 2009 scheurer et al 2015 the biological half life during winter in higher latitude regions and in water without salt or organics is at 10 6 days andreozzi et al 2003 in terms of feed concentrations no seasonal effect was observed mersmann 2003 studied the removal processes for diclofenac laboratory tests investigating unsaturated zones showed that the substance is absorbed at a ph below 7 in aerobic conditions it is degraded biologically in addition to aerobic conditions the redox potential has an effect on the removal of diclofenac kuhlmann et al 2010 hydrophilic ionic compounds form more hydrophobic compounds when the ph falls below the pka value this ensures a steady availability for sorption by biomass and higher removal efficiencies under acidic conditions rattier et al 2014 the log kow 4 which implicates very hydrophobic behavior makes diclofenac unavailable for plant uptake but being held back in the root epidermis imfeld et al 2009 regarding values between 2 5 and 10 times loq only rsf 3b shows frequent values in this range at six out of 24 events the concentrations are between 25 and 100 ng l whereas after two events values below 10 ng l were measured this means that the removal efficiency of 61 20 for the serial connection of rsf 3a 3b can be both over or underestimated but compared to the removal efficiencies for the other filters which are between 19 and 33 an overestimation seems more likely 4 2 carbamazepine other studies showed that the reduction of carbamazepine in rsfs was low matamoros and bayona 2008 scheurer et al 2015 tondera et al 2013 tondera et al 2019 this can be explained by the limited removal mechanisms for this substances since it is mainly reduced to sorption carbamazepine shows moderately hydrophilic characteristics log kow 2 45 table 2 sfcws show higher removal efficiencies compared to other flow types due to the prolonged retention time matamoros and bayona 2008 the biological half life period during winter in higher latitude regions and in water without salt or organics is at 100 days andreozzi et al 2003 this indicates a high resistance to biodegration which is confirmed in bertelkamp et al 2014 therefore the removal of carbamazepine is not signifcantly influenced by temperature matamoros et al 2008 however sauvêtre and schröder 2015 found several bacteria isolates which possess carbamazepine uptake and plant growth promoting traits phosphate solubilization siderophore production and auxin production so that they achieved removal efficiencies of 90 by plant uptake of phragmites australis after 9 days in this study carbamazepine concentrations were not reduced even more so the removal efficiency decreases when the length of the flow path increases this might be caused by metabolites and degradation products in the inflow which recombine to the original substance ternes 1998 in contaminated environments these metabolites and degradation products are found at concentrations of 10 of the original substance moermond 2014 after consumption of the drug the human body metabolizes about 11 of carbamazepine to carbamazepine n glucoronide and excretes it with the urine in the rsfs this conjugate is then transformed back to the original substance this can lead to an increase of the original feed concentration of 100 hence the recombination of carbamazepine n glucoronide explains the low reduction of the drug in rsfs scheurer et al 2015 another metabolite carbamazepine o glucoronide is a lot more unstable and therefore already hydrolysed on its way to the treatment plant bahlmann et al 2014 furthermore the recombination of metabolites into the parent compound can also occur in natural ecosystems as the ecological risk of most metabolites is equivalent or even higher than for the parent compound the negative removal for carbamazepine inside the rsfs does not necessarily imply a higher burden for receiving water bodies thus regarding harmful metabolites a recombination inside the filter body can even be advantageous further studies investigating concentrations of the specific metabolites in the feed and effluent are necessary to estimate the fate and removal as well as the ecological risk originating from carbamazepine and its metabolites bahlmann et al 2014 kaiser et al 2013 since anaerobic conditions are necessary for a degradation of the substance mersmann 2003 a post treatment step is required if considerable removal of carbamazepine is required for eight out of 28 events values between 2 5 and 10 times loq were measured in the inflow and in four to six cases also in the outflow of each filter although the concentrations were mostly close to 100 ng l if comparing the inflow and outflow values of these events table a2 supplementary material a zero reduction or an even higher negative reduction can be assumed which does not change the general interpretation regarding the removal of this substance 4 3 metoprolol chen et al 2016 assume that in dense root networks sufficient oxygen is available for aerobic biodegradation in the rhizosphere in order to remove metoprolol in hfcws furthermore the plants are able to take up the drug due to its moderately hydrophobic characteristics log kow 1 88 chen et al 2016 scheurer et al 2015 agree that biological degradation is the main process responsible for the removal efficiency of 84 in their study additionally metoprolol could be adsorbed to negatively charged sediment particles as the substance is mainly cationic at typical environmental ph values scheurer et al 2015 previous studies showed higher concentrations of metoprolol in the feed 345 809 ng l tondera et al 2013 compared to this study among the investigated micropollutants in our study metoprolol was removed the most efficiently one event with negative removal in rsf 1 was noted which could be caused by several previous loading events with short dry periods and very low concentrations of 102 ng l two other events with removal efficiencies below 50 occurred with low feed concentrations as well in total outflow values were only 2 5 to 10 times higher than the loq for 12 events for each filter and even below this value four times for rsf 1 two times for rsf 2 once for rsf 3a and even six times for rsf 3b hence the uncertainty resulting from these events cannot be neglected and both over and underestimation of the removal efficiency is possible 4 4 sulfamethoxazole while baumgarten et al 2011 determined the biological half life time of sulfamethxazole under oxygen availability to be 9 d this is not applicable to this study these results were obtained over a study period of 27 months at a feed concentration of 250 ng l whereas this study was conducted over a period of 15 months with strongly varying feed concentrations the sensitivity of the results related to the set up of the study is further demonstrated by the varying effect of biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole larcher and yargeau 2012 however as the drug is difficult to adsorb microbial activity is the main mechanism responsible for the retention of the substance müller et al 2013 the removal of sulfamethoxazole depends on the oxygen availability schmidt et al 2003 found no removal under aerobic conditions anaerobic conditions however facilitate a good removal of the substance anoxic conditions enable a reduction of sulfamethoxazole as well kuhlmann et al 2010 the range of the feed concentration in this study is higher than in the study of tondera et al 2013 which accounted for values of 81 ng l to 241 ng l the same study yielded higher removal efficiencies of 13 33 compared to the negative removal in this study the median effluent concentration increased even with the filter thickness this can possibly be explained with the reconversion of metabolites and conjugates larcher and yargeau 2012 nödler et al 2012 comparabel to the processes concerning carbamazepine inflow values were only 2 5 to 10 times the loq for 14 events and once even below this value accordingly outflow values were 12 14 times 2 5 to 10 times the loq for rsf 1 to rsf 3a and five times in this range for rsf 3b if only events with inflow concentrations 100 ng l are considered all ouftflow values are also 100 ng l and removal efficiencies are between 21 18 and 23 22 for rsf 1 to 3a and 16 7 for rsf 3a 3b which means that the serial connection has no further impact on the removal efficiency 4 5 bisphenol a several biotic and abiotic mechanisms contribute to the degradation of bisphenol a this includes biodegradation adsorption to solids and suspended solids and possibly photodegradation staples et al 1998 adsorption to the filter is the first process to fix the substance followed by biodegradation as the main removal process there is no removal due to volatilization dan et al 2017 kuhlmann et al 2010 determined biological degradation of bpa to take less than 10 days accordingly dan et al 2017 found higher removal efficiencies in planted cw compared to unplanted filters the rhizosphere of these aquatic plants accommodates bacteria involved in the biodegradation of the chemical kurzbaum et al 2010 the present feed concentration of bisphenol a 204 124 ng l is markedly lower than in comparable studies tondera et al 2013 recorded values as high as 708 ng l to 1 164 ng l the removal efficiencies of the same study are in a comparable range of 64 73 furthermore some of the negative removal efficiencies in the present study could be related to extremely low feed concentrations below the loq which were recorded for two events furthermore for 15 events outflow concentrations were between 2 5 and 10 times the loq or below these values therefore analytical uncertainties can be assumed higher for bisphenol a than for the other investigated micropollutants 4 6 1 h benzotriazole the low kow and ionization of 1 h benzotriazole cause inefficient reduction by adsoption matamoros et al 2010 jia et al 2007 agree with the sorption being negligible however they state that adsorption can be improved by increasing the amount of iron in the substrate and the retention time biodegradation was observed to be a removal mechanisms in aerobic and anaerobic conditions it is more efficient under aerobic conditions albeit the half life period is above 100 days under both conditions which explains the difficult degradation liu et al 2011 in rsfs photodegradation and plant uptake are further mechanisms that contribute to the reduction of 1 h benzotriazole matamoros et al 2010 previous studies recorded moderate removal efficiencies of 1 h benzotriazole reemtsma et al 2010 voutsa et al 2006 scheurer et al 2015 found a reduction of 66 20 whereas matamoros et al 2010 recorded high removal efficiencies of 89 93 the median of the feed concentration in this study is similar to the one recorded by tondera et al 2013 at 1 433 ng l with removal efficiencies from 32 to 48 which are therefore slightly higher than the 25 34 presented here the series connection has no influence on the median removal efficiencies however it is able to facilitate more consistent removal efficiencies as detected concentrations were considerably above the loq the issue of analytical uncertainties due to values near the loq is negligible 4 7 correlations 4 7 1 influence of design and operation significant pearson correlations were found between the feed and effluent concentration for the investigated micropollutants as depicted in table 3 the inflow and effluent concentrations vary significantly except the effluent concentrations of metoprolol as these are permanently low there are no correlations between the inflow and effluent of this substance table 4 shows the results of the pearson correlation analysis between the filter age and the removal efficiency the filter age was defined as the operational time since the beginning of the experiments and thus ranged between 1 and 338 days diclofenac and metoprolol indicate a relation of the length of the filter operation time to the removal efficiency of micropollutants yet this correlation is difficult to verify as the duration of the dry periods in between the feeding events varies as well imfeld et al 2009 remark that the sorption of organic biomass in rsfs decreases over time as the capacity is the highest before the first feeding the influence of the filter thickness on the removal efficiency can be shown by comparing the average removal efficiencies of rsf 1 3a 0 75 m and rsf 2 0 5 m the thickness of the filter layer seems to influence the removal of diclofenac positively at a thickness of 0 75 m the average removal efficiency is at 29 while the thinner filter layer achieves efficiencies of 19 in contrast to diclofenac the influence of the thickness of the filter layer on the removal efficiency appears to be negative for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole both of these substances show negative average removal efficiencies in these rsfs the average removal of carbamazepine in rsf 2 32 is not as negative as in rsf 1 3a 41 similarly for sulfamethoxazole rsf 2 5 yields not as low removal efficiencies as rsf 1 3a 20 the difference of 0 25 m in the filter layer does not seem to influence the removal of 1 h benzotriazole 28 1 metoprolol 70 2 and bpa 30 2 the series connection of rsf 3a 3b shows a noticeable positive influence on the reduction of diclofenac metoprolol and bpa for carbamazepine the series connection results in lower removal efficiencies for the substances 1 h benzotriazole and sulfamethoxazole there are no obvious differences between the rsfs 4 7 2 influence of toc and doc concentrations carbon is removed efficiently in all rsfs only very small feed concentrations 5 5 mg l and 3 9 mg l yield negative removal efficiencies in the effluent of the rsfs the concentration of toc is only about 15 rsf 3a 3b and 3 rsf 1 3a higher than the doc concentration interestingly it is lower in rsf 2 indicating a very efficient removal of suspended organic carbon and a noticeable retention of doc as the micropollutants contain carbon an investigation of correlations between the removal of these substances and toc or doc was conducted the resulting pearson coefficients are presented in table a3 and table a4 supplementary material the removal efficiency of 1 h benzotriazole in rsf 2 and that of diclofenac in rsf 3b were correlated to the removal of toc significance at the 0 01 level 2 tailed at the significance level of 0 05 carbamazepine and diclofenac were correlated to the reduction of toc in rsf 3a 3b furthermore the removal of doc was correlated to the reductions of some micropollutants in the respective rsfs at the 0 01 level 2 tailed sulfamethoxazole in rsf 1 and with a significance at the 0 05 level 1 h benzotriazole in rsf 3a metoprolol in rsf 3b and bpa in rsf 3a 3b however there are no consistent correlations apparent 5 conclusions the removal efficiencies of micropollutants showed varying results linked to different filter conditions e g filter layer thickness and removal pathways biochemical adsorption physical parameters 1 h benzotriazole was removed by approximately 30 on average and the removal was not correlated to the thickness of the filter layer similar removal efficiencies were recorded in rsf 1 and rsf 3a for bpa and increased to 65 in the series connection rsf 3a 3b diclofenac was removed a bit less efficiently by 19 33 while the increase of the removal efficiency in the series connection was not as high yielding in a reduction of 60 the highest removal efficiency in the single rsfs was recorded for metoprolol at approximately 70 for this substance there is a positive correlation between the thickness of the filter layer and the removal efficiency rsf 3a 3b reduce metoprolol on average by 88 however rsfs proved not to be efficient at reducing the concentrations of sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine in the filter carbamazepine metabolites transform back to their original substance and cause negative removal efficiencies regarding the ecological risk of carbamazepine and its metabolites a recombination of metabolites inside the filter body can be considered advantageous though sulfamethoxazole was influenced by strong variations of the feed concentrations 14 4 560 ng l yet negative average removal efficiencies in all rsfs lead to the conclusion of recombination of metabolites and degradation products of this substance as well there were strong and some very strong correlations between the feed concentration and the effluent concentration in contrast the dry period between two loading events does not seem to have an impact on the removal efficiency for carbamazepine and metoprolol a correlation was found between removal efficiency and the filter age the filter age was defined as the operational time since the beginning of the experiments an evaluation of the influence of the filter age on the retention of various substances is currently only possible to a limited extent since such an influence in rsfs can only be reliably confirmed after a longer filter running time since the experimental filters were only operated for over a year as part of the research project only trends could be derived additionally this correlation has to be verified as results could be falsified due to simultaneous change in the length of dry periods declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18331,benthic cyanobacteria are a nuisance because they produce highly potent toxins and taste and odour compounds despite this benthic cyanobacteria remain far less studied than their planktonic counterparts for example little is known about their growth or the seasonality of their secondary metabolite production moreover sampling and monitoring techniques commonly used for the survey of planktonic species are not necessarily applicable to benthic forms this study aimed to develop and validate a new sampling device for the routine monitoring of benthic mats molecular monitoring techniques were established and validated on environmental samples collected in a south australian reservoir sa l2 a total of eight qpcr assays were applied to samples in order to track seasonal variations in cyanobacteria concentrations and associated secondary metabolite production next generation sequencing was utilised to conduct a microbial community composition analysis and to select the most appropriate substrate material for the sampling of benthic cyanobacteria the concentration of the secondary metabolites geosmin and 2 methyl isoborneol were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography and concentrations of key nutrients n p were quantified in water samples the sampling device designed proved efficient and easy to use in the field the qpcr assay designed for the amplification of the cyanobacterial mib synthase had a high efficiency with a minimum limit of quantification of 4 cell equivalents per reaction and identified a potential source of mib in sa l2 reservoir the peak season for benthic growth and secondary metabolite production was observed in spring proportionally 35 of the variability in water geosmin concentrations can be explained by benthic actinobacterial and cyanobacterial activity showing that freshwater benthic mats represent a significant source of taste and odour compounds graphical abstract image 1 keywords benthic cyanobacteria monitoring sampling next generation sequencing taste and odour compounds toxins 1 introduction planktonic cyanobacteria are associated with a range of water quality issues and are now recognised globally as a major risk factor for drinking water falconer and humpage 2005 falconer and humpage 2006 hudnell 2008 gaget et al 2017b despite decades of research on growth control and toxin production by pelagic cyanobacteria there are relatively few studies evaluating the risk associated with benthic forms benthic cyanobacteria are organised in mats representing an important part of the photosynthetic layer of epilithic biofilms quiblier et al 2013 in these mats thin filamentous microalgae and other microorganisms are arranged in a complex polysaccharidic matrix pierre et al 2012 during high growth periods photosynthetic activity increases and produces air bubbles which become entrapped in the mat and cause some segments to detach and float floating mats can contribute to the ingestion of toxins by animals which have occasionally proved lethal gugger et al 2005 mez et al 1997 while this still represents an emerging issue recent studies have demonstrated that cyanotoxins are widespread in benthic mats across australia dasey et al 2005 seifert et al 2007 gaget et al 2017c sendall and mcgregor 2018 and around the world cadel six et al 2007 gugger et al 2005 mez et al 1997 mohamed et al 2006 benthic biofilms also produce a range of taste and odour compounds hereafter referred to as t o compounds in a range of waterbodies izaguirre et al 1995 jüttner and watson 2007 izaguirre and taylor 2007 chen et al 2010 otten et al 2016 geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib are the main taste and odour compounds of concern and cause water to smell and taste earthy musty when present above 10 ng l these compounds can represent a considerable challenge to water treatment chen et al 2010 due to the very high sensitivity that humans have to these two compounds the public may notice off flavours before they are identified via laboratory analysis even if toxins are not present the presence of t o compounds can generate public doubt that the water is safe to drink because treatment does not appear to have been effective therefore it is vitally important for the water industry to have early warning of the presence of cyanobacteria that have the potential to produce t o compounds or toxins despite the demonstration that benthic cyanobacteria can be a source of toxins and t o in drinking water reservoirs gaget et al 2017c no recommended guideline for their survey exists however routine sampling of planktonic cyanobacteria is generally well established in the water industry chorus and bartram 1999 adwg 2011 in contrast no routine techniques have been scientifically validated for the sampling of benthic forms conventional benthic sampling consists of the collection of sediment core samples savichtcheva et al 2011 karlson et al 2012 while collecting sediment core samples gives a close to reality picture of the biodiversity present its practicality is limited in rocky areas where benthic mats seem to thrive and there is also a significant risk for cross contamination between different layers of the core when extracting the sediment out of the sampler this is particularly problematic when using analyses such as next generation sequencing ngs e g for community composition analysis or metagenomics the ministry for the environment of new zealand has published recommendations for the survey of benthic cyanobacteria particularly in rivers wood et al 2009 these guidelines give advice on areas where the sampling effort should be concentrated mainly in shallow shorelines or reaches and on the use of underwater viewers to collect core samples wood et al applied these recommendations by sampling 1 m2 quadrants inside a 10m 10m grid in shallow areas wood et al 2011 the technique was shown to be relevant only in very shallow water and required 10 sub samples per collection site to be reliable making it unsuitable for routine monitoring of reservoirs the present study aimed to develop a reliable and easy to use sampling technique for the routine collection of benthic bacteria growing in epilithic biofilms cell counts under light microscopy the traditional monitoring technique used for planktonic species is not applicable to benthic mats due to the complexity of the matrix in this context the present study aimed to 1 design and trial a novel and easy to use sampling method for benthic cyanobacteria 2 test a range of existing molecular techniques on benthic mats to evaluate their validity as monitoring tools 3 develop a qpcr assay for the specific detection of the mib synthase gene in cyanobacteria and 4 use the aforementioned tools to conduct a field survey in a south australian reservoir to address these aims a sampler was designed and eight quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays and ngs were developed or adapted to analyse benthic matrix samples all of the techniques developed were validated during a year long field survey and utilised to establish seasonal patterns of benthic growth and secondary metabolite production 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling design and validation 2 1 1 design the general sampling concept involved deploying artificial substrates in the reservoirs and allowing the development of microbial biofilms to achieve proper colonisation substrates need to be placed as close as possible to the surface of the sediment therefore a supporting structure for the substrates that could be anchored to rest on the sediment to limit movement was designed and constructed rectangular frames 144 cm 67 cm were built using pvc pipes dwv pipe 100 mm 6m vinidex edinburgh sa australia and covered with a mesh wire mesh garden pvc coated 90 cm 12x12 1 mm bunnings melbourne vic australia which was attached using plastic cable ties holes were drilled in the pipes to prevent air being trapped inside the structure and contributing buoyancy an anchoring frame larger than the sampling frame 184 cm 107 cm was weighed down by fixing 1 5m steel rods on each side of the frame four buoys spherical white foam marker buoy 150 mm diameter were attached by rope at the corners of the anchor frame a fifth buoy was attached to the centre of the sampling frame this central rope was used to lift the frame for sampling while the anchor frame was left at the bottom of the reservoir fig 1 rectangles of three different substrates namely wood wet and dry sandpaper and the rough surface of tiles were attached to the mesh using cable ties each rectangle covered a total surface area of 45 cm2 to validate the practicality of the structure and determine the time necessary for the biofilm to colonise the substrate a frame was built and deployed at 1m depth in sa l2 reservoir located in urban south australia after the launch substrates were sampled initially and at two week intervals for 8 weeks t0 t0 2 weeks t0 4 weeks and t0 8 weeks 2 1 2 coupon material and replicate number validation to validate the choice of substrate to be used for future monitoring and to compare these substrates to core sediment samples 18 sampling frames were built and deployed in october 2013 in two urban reservoirs in south australia sa l1 and sa l2 where problematic benthic species were previously detected gaget et al 2017c samples were collected after 12 weeks of incubation january 2014 and processed as described below next generation sequencing was applied on a selection of samples from both reservoirs to evaluate the minimum number of physical replicates per site and sampling date necessary to conduct a robust community composition analysis five replicate natural samples i e core sediment samples were collected in january 2014 from one location in sa l2 reservoir similarly to compare the closeness of communities growing on the different substrates tested to that of the original sediment communities five replicate samples of each substrate material i e wood tile and sandpaper and natural sediment were collected from two locations in sa l2 reservoir at the same time in january 2014 genomic dna was extracted from the five replicate samples collected at that same location and diluted to a final concentration of 10 μg ml for the depth of read analysis dna extracts were then sequenced either on their own or pooled together in all possible combinations of 2 3 4 or 5 extracts in one sample to be analysed 2 1 3 benthic sample processing preservation and dna extraction for each sampling the biofilm was detached and washed off the substrate using sterile ro water and a sterile toothbrush cleaned and decontaminated with detergent and treated with uvc light for 15 min samples were placed in pre weighed non pyrogenic 50 ml tubes 114 28 mm pp sarstedt nümbrecht germany and were centrifuged at 1614 g for 15 min supernatant was discarded and the mass of biofilm was measured by deducting the mass of the empty tube from that of the combined tube and sample sample aliquots 250 300 mg of wet weight were transferred from the total mass obtained during the processing phase into 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes and preserved at 20 c until further analysis dna isolation was conducted as described previously gaget et al 2017b 2 2

out of megan by exporting data from the bar chart visualisation option 2 2 2 qpcrs to assess the presence of t o and toxin producers in benthic biofilms seven qpcr assays were selected to optimise the time spent on method development most primer sets used in this study were carefully chosen from previously published work shaw et al 1999 giglio et al 2008 ballot et al 2010 al tebrineh et al 2012 kutovaya and watson 2014 table 1 however at the start of the project no existing assay for the detection of the mib synthase gene was available and a new pair of primers was designed published mib

efficiently between 50 c and 55 c after optimisation all assays were conducted with the following cycling conditions 10 min incubation at 95 c 50 cycles 95 c for 20 s 50 c for 20 s 72 c for 20 s with data acquisition at the end of this step as toxin and t o gene sequences may vary between taxa an annealing temperature of 50 c was chosen to improve the chances of amplification by choosing a lower annealing temperature it is noteworthy that the chances of amplifying non target sequences are increased each amplification was followed by high resolution melting curve analysis 95 for 60 s 40 c for 60 s 65 c for 1 s and 97 c for 1 s with continuous acquisition at 97 c all data were acquired on the fam channel using a light cycler 96 pcr thermocycler roche diagnostics corporation indianapolis ind

of 5 copies of genomes cell and one copy of the target gene per genome for environmental samples these numbers were divided by the amount of wet weight collected and expressed per unit substrate area using the surface area of the coupon material 45 cm2 providing final results in cell equivalents cm2 2 3 field validation to verify the efficiency of the methods developed during the project a time series survey over a year was conducted in sa l2 reservoir as this location has previously experienced t o episodes chen et al 2010 hobson et al 2010 and toxic isolates were previously isolated from this reservoir gaget et al 2017c the confirmed presence of benthic cyanobacteria producing the secondary metabolites of interest in this reservoir meant that this survey gave the opportunity to determine the sensitivity and reliability of the sampling and monitoring techniques described above 2 3 1 strain isolation culturing and morphological identification prior to the start of the field survey sediment core samples were collected from six locations in sa l2 reservoir in south australia using a custom made core sampler 50 mm diameter the phototrophic top layer of the core samples most likely to contain benthic algae was scraped off and transferred to a container for transportation a weight of approximately 500 mg of the retained sediment core sample was resuspended in 10 ml of filtered reservoir water drops of the suspension were placed on 1 agar media asm 1 bg11 wc and mla carmichael and gorham 1974 allen 1968 guillard 1975 gorham et al 1964 the isolation of species was conducted as previously described rippka 1988 gaget et al 2017a all cultures placed on agar were maintained at 21 c under white light osram universal white with a photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of 30 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the remainder of the suspension was preserved by adding 10 v v lugol s iodine and observed by light microscopy nikon eclipse 50i microscope in order to identify the species present in the collected mats the level of purity of the isolated cultures and the species identification were determined by observation using light microscopy with phase contrast nikon eclipse 50i microscope with images captured using a nikon digital sight camera nikon shinagawa tokyo japan the cyanoprokaryota part 2 and 3 taxonomic keys were used for genus and species identification komárek and anagnostidis 2005a and 2005b as the taxonomy of cyanobacteria is ever evolving following molecular advances species names established through microscopic observation were modified as appropriate to fit to the most recent taxonomy available using references available on the algaebase website http www algaebase org purified isolates were tested for their toxin production as previously described gaget et al 2017b and for t o production as described below 2 3 2 sampling regime in september 2014 samplers harbouring 60 substrates of the validated type of material see results section were deployed at 1m depth in five locations fig 2 the first sampling was completed on 19 11 2014 which corresponded to 8 weeks of incubation after this date samples were collected monthly until 21 11 2015 with the exception of february 2015 when resources were not available to allow sampling samples were processed as described above and analysed using all monitoring techniques detailed in this section 2 3 3 screening of key nutrients and t o in water and culture samples three replicate water samples 300 ml were collected at 0 5m depth immediately adjacent to the sampling device and were sent directly to als global for nutrient analysis and two replicate samples of 100 ml were sent to the australian water quality centre awqc for t o measurements by gas chromatography the key nutrient forms analysed during the survey were ammonia nitrites nitrates nox i e the sum of nitrites and nitrates tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen total nitrogen i e the sum of nox and tkn total phosphorus and reactive phosphorus additional triplicate water samples 300 ml were collected as described above these samples were destined to qpcr and ngs purposes and each replicate was filtered through a mixed cellulose ester membrane 0 45 μm pore size pall corporation u s a which was then preserved at 20 c until further analysis samples collected for t o analysis were concentrated with a solid phase micro extraction syringe fibre supelco australia and analysed on a 7890a gas chromatograph system with a 5975c vl series mass selective detector agilent technologies australia against quantified deuterated internal standards ultrafine chemicals uk according to a method developed by graham and hayes 1998 the loq for this method is 4 ng l aliquots of isolate cultures 4 ml approximately 80 mg of wet weight were centrifuged at 20 000 g for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and pellets were preserved at 20 c prior to dna extraction for both culture and filtered water samples a screening of genes involved in the synthesis of geosmin and mib was completed by qpcr using the assays listed in tables 1 and 2 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical tests were conducted on normalised data using the xlstat software add on on excel version 19 5 all the data collected were combined in a unique matrix and used to first conduct a pca if any major trend could be identified then the relationship between variables was investigated using individual linear regressions 3 results 3 1 sampling method design and validation 3 1 1 sampler deployment and incubation trial the sampling frames were simple to deploy and sank appropriately pulling the central buoy allowed the sampling frame to be lifted easily and the collection of samples could be executed safely at t0 2 weeks and t0 4 weeks the biomass collected from the wooden substrates was somewhat comparable fig 3 the biomass growing on the two other substrates sandpaper and tile increased progressively over time at t0 8 weeks all substrates were colonised by the biofilm and the wooden coupon generally allowed for the collection of a larger mass than from the other two other materials there was more variability between replicates in the biomass collected from the sandpaper substrate 217 78 mg for sandpaper in opposition to 139 52 mg and 126 75 mg for wood and tile substrates respectively 3 1 2 evaluation of replicate number necessary for community composition analysis five replicate samples were collected from wooden substrates at location o2 in sa l2 reservoir to evaluate the minimum number of physical replicates needed to be collected at each site per sampling date supp fig 2 presents the average number of taxonomic reads or leaves measured for each of the various replicate combinations this value corresponds to the maximum diversity detected by ngs in these samples the combination of three or four replicates provided the highest numbers of taxonomic reads at a genus level meaning that the microbial diversity was better captured using a minimum of three replicates the standard deviation calculated for the highest number of reads per run last point of each curve was lower for the three replicate condition than for the four replicate combination with values of respectively 9 62 and 13 39 number of taxonomic reads 3 1 3 coupon material validation the biofilms collected comprised two parts a green photosynthetic part composed of a mix of filamentous cyanobacteria and other classes of microalgae supp fig 3 a c and d and an anoxic brown under layer composed of other groups of bacteria supp fig 3b the ngs analysis demonstrated that the dominant phyla were the same between the two reservoirs but proportions changed fig 4 in both reservoirs the quantity of cyanobacteria in the biofilm was greater in core samples when compared to coupon substrate samples cyanobacteria and proteobacteria represented the dominant microbial phyla bacteroidetes and spirochaetes were present in higher proportions in sa l2 reservoir samples than in biofilms collected in sa l1 reservoir in sa l1 reservoir the microbial community composition varied greatly between substrates tile samples had a general composition closer to that of sediment core samples while sandpaper and wood substrates presented significantly lower concentrations of cyanobacteria when compared to the core or tile substrate in sa l2 reservoir all artificial substrates exhibited similar community composition but were different to that of the sediment core sample with the exception of cyanobacteria which were less represented in the artificial substrate the dominant and minor phyla were present in equivalent importance in the sediment core and the wood samples with the major dominant phyla were also the same in both the commonly found microbial taxa in benthic biofilms sampled were actinobacteria bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia cyanobacteria planctomycetes proteobacteria and spirochaetes the community composition comparison between the core sediment samples and artificial substrates highlighted a catchment specific response sa l1 reservoir tiles exhibited a similar microbial community composition to that of the natural sample core sample while in sa l2 reservoir the closest to the natural population was found in biofilms growing on the wood substrates fig 4a and b the nj network computed with the ngs data at a species level highlighted no significant correlation between the α diversity between core samples and other substrate overall nonetheless at location g the microbial diversity present on wood substrates was the closest to that of the core sediment sample fig 4c 3 2 molecular monitoring techniques establishment 3 2 1 choice of primers for the mib synthase assay two primer sets designed for the mib synthase gene table 1 were compared in terms of amplification efficiency primers were tested on a mib producing cultured strain pseudanabaena galeata awqc psa016 under the above conditions ms f1 ms r1 showed amplification with cq values of 20 4 while ms f2 ms r2 failed to amplify the target fragment consequently the ms f1 ms r1 set of primers was selected for further optimisation the pair of primers was subjected to a temperature gradient from 50 c to 60 c to evaluate its optimum annealing temperature the best signal was obtained between 50 c and 57 2 c above an annealing temperature of 51 8 the control amplified a non specific fragment of around 1 kbp in addition to the expected fragment of 178 bp data not shown the choice of running all assays at an annealing temperature of 50 c is therefore particularly suitable for this set of primers the specificity of the primers was evaluated against 30 strains from the awqc culture collection only the mib producing strain positive control was found to produce a specific amplificon some non specific products were amplified but could be distinguished from the target amplicon using melting curve analysis the specific fragment harbours a peak corresponding to a melting temperature tm of 87 4 c 3 2 2 qpcr assays standard curves limit of detection and melting curve profiles positive controls were chosen from a list of cultured strains from the awqc culture collection and the cawthron institute culture collection of microalgae new zealand culture collections rhodes et al 2016 each strain was known for producing the following secondary metabolites mib pseudanabaena galeata strain awqc psa016 geosmin streptomyces strain awqc strepto yellow and phormidium sp strain awqc pho021 anatoxin a phormidium sp strain cyn112 cylindrospermopsin cylindrospermopsis raciborskii strain awqc cyp011 saxitoxin dolichospermum circinale strain awqc ana131 and microcystin microcystis aeruginosa strain awqc mic058 table 2 these strains are summarised in table 2 along with their genome weight the standard curves for all the pcr assays were calculated using a genomic dna dilution series from 10 ng μl to 10 fg μl of genomic dna table 2 the most efficient assays were the qpcrs targeting cyra and mib synthase able to detect 5 or 4 cell equivalents respectively the least efficient assays 16s rdna anaf and geoa actinomycetes presented high loq 3 636 3571 and 2128 cell equivalents respectively 3 3 field survey 3 3 1 characterization of isolated strains the isolation process allowed for the purification of 9 different strains from the core samples collected in sa l2 reservoir these strains were characterized morphologically genetically and for their toxin production ability in a previous publication gaget et al 2017c only one strain produced toxins isolate i013 0028 deposited in the awqc algal collection as phormidium ambiguum awqc pho021 which produced cylindrospermopsin cyn and deoxy cylindrospermopsin deocyn this same isolate also produces geosmin 3 79 104 ng extracellular geosmin l in a culture analysed during stationary phase 3 3 2 growth and nutrients the microbial biomass harvested from coupon samples increased in march april 2015 after the end of the planktonic bloom season december 2014 to march 2015 data not shown reaching a peak of 4 8 g w w wet weight in location o1 in october 2015 the biomass collected in this reservoir was ten times below the yield of biofilm harvested in sa l1 reservoir during sampling diverse predators grazers were observed on the coupons supp fig 4 with especially high numbers of cadis fly larvae notalina spira and small freshwater snails physa acuta total nitrogen totaln varied between 0 and 1 8 mg l with an average value of 0 85 mg l tkn represented the majority of nitrogen forms in the samples with values varying from 0 to 1 6 mg l and an average of 0 77 mg l the total phosphorus totalp varied from 0 to 0 34 mg l with an average of 0 04 mg l while the reactive phosphorus represented a very small portion with a maximum value of 0 02 mg l and an average concentration of 0 002 mg l this was reflected in the principal component analysis pca the two main factors calculated in the pca account for only 55 74 of the observed data variability with f1 and f2 explaining 37 11 and 18 63 of the variability respectively supp fig 5 the geosmin concentrations and the percentage of actinobacteria and cyanobacteria present progress in the same direction on the f1 axis while pointing in the opposite direction than tkn and total nitrogen and total phosphorus on that same axis the linear regression calculations computed between log cyano and log totalp and log totaln show that only 9 and 8 of the variability in concentrations of cyanobacteria respectively can be explained by the changing totalp and totaln concentrations present in water samples collected at benthic depth 3 3 3 community composition analysis next generation sequencing results are presented in fig 5 and describe the evolution of the benthic microbial community composition over time with bars representing a particular sampling date for simplicity only the seven most abundant phyla are displayed as a percentage of the total population proteobacteria planctomycetes firmicutes cyanobacteria verrucomicrobia bacteroidetes and actinobacteria in most cases these phyla accounted for over 90 of the total population in sa l2 reservoir proteobacteria and planctomycetes were the dominant phyla in most of the samples collected during the year long survey there was an issue with the amplification and sequencing of the sample collected in location o2 in march 2015 this sample was therefore not included in further analyses except for the sample collected in location o3 in january 2015 the population of cyanobacteria evolved in a similar manner in all locations with lower concentrations in winter months and an increase in concentrations starting from september 2015 spring the microbial community composition analysis also highlighted that actinobacteria i e including actinomycetes and streptomyces were more dominant in samples collected during winter 3 3 4 t o production monitoring the presence of mib and geosmin was monitored monthly in the reservoir during the year long survey in parallel the presence of the genes required for the synthesis of these two molecules was investigated in the biofilm in the absence of a qpcr assay for the specific detection of mib production by actinobacteria i e actinomycetes and streptomyces the mib synthase gene was monitored only for cyanobacteria while geoa was monitored for both cyanobacteria geoac and actinobacteria geoaa fig 6 with the exception of location o4 the peaks of geoac gene concentrations were observed in spring and corresponded with peaks of biofilm biomass indeed the peak of biomass collected from wood substrates were high over winter and the start of spring while decreasing around mid spring while concentrations of geosmin increased from the end of autumn 26 05 2015 to reach a peak in spring peaks of geoac genes were observed much later october 2015 it is important to note that the loq usually given for geosmin and mib in hplc is set at 4 ng l due to quality standards delivered by the awqc in order to see whether t o compounds were present all year long concentrations between the lod and the loq were also plotted on fig 6 with the exception of location o2 geoaa was not detected although mib was not detected above loq values in the water during the year long survey some mib synthase gene copies were detected in two locations the linear regression describing the relationship between log concentration of cyanobacteria and log concentration of geosmin presented data points mostly falling outside of the expected 95 confidence interval calculated by the model the explanatory variable log cyano explains 10 of the variability observed for log geosmin this means that only a small portion of the geosmin detected in the water can be linked to production by benthic cyanobacteria similarly the regression analysis describing the relationship between log concentration of actinobacteria and log concentration of geosmin showed that most data points fall outside of the expected 95 confidence interval calculated by the model the explanatory variable log actino explains 25 of the variability observed for log geosmin this means that only part of the geosmin detected in the water can be linked to production by benthic actinobacteria collectively benthic actinobacteria and cyanobacteria account for 35 of the geosmin detected in the water column 3 3 5 monitoring toxin genes over the course of this field survey samples were also tested for the presence of cyanotoxin genes anaf atx cyra cyn mcye mc and stxa stx positive values were recorded only in november 2015 in two locations o2 and o5 potential producers of cyn the presence of cyra gene copies was detected in both locations with higher levels in site o5 with 2 77 x 10 3 2 79 x 10 0 cell equivalent cm2 than in site o2 with 3 09 x 10 2 2 10 10 1 cell equivalent cm2 copies of stxa and mcye were also detected in location o5 with values of 7 83 x 10 1 1 25 10 1 cell equivalent cm2 and 1 34 x 10 4 9 53 x 10 1 cell equivalent cm2 respectively considering the lack of detection of toxin genes in the samples collected in sa l2 reservoir the data associated with these genes were not included in the pca 4 discussion the sampling frames were easy to use and allowed for safe recovery of benthic samples this device has application to both research and routine monitoring by water utilities to sample benthic biofilms the fact that the biomass collected from the wooden substrate after 2 and 4 weeks of incubation were somewhat comparable between each other demonstrates that the growth observed on this substrate until t0 4 weeks is not necessarily a reflection of its colonisation by the biofilm this preliminary study highlighted that a minimum of 8 weeks of incubation was necessary to reach biofilm colonisation on all substrate materials wooden substrates allowed for the collection of a larger biomass than the two other materials and exhibited less variability between replicates in the biomass compared with sandpaper substrates this is likely due to resuspension of the biofilm by wave action the more porous nature of the wooden material could also provide better anchoring for the biofilm therefore providing better resistance against physical disturbance when dna extracts were analysed by ngs on their own or in combinations of 3 or 4 replicates the number of total reads increased significantly and the number of taxonomic leaves was higher than for the other combinations it was therefore decided to extract three replicate samples for each site and date for the year survey the total surface covered by all substrate coupons on one sampler corresponded to about 3000 cm2 including spaces three coupons covered a surface area of 135 cm2 which amounts to 4 5 of the surface surveyed this is in agreement with previously published work in their study wood and collaborators wood et al 2011 established that it was necessary to investigate five 1 m quadrants in a 100 m2 grid to obtain a proper representation of the benthic population which represents a 5 coverage of the area studied and is close to the minimum coverage reported herein biofilms collected comprised two parts a green photosynthetic part comprising a range of microalgae and an anoxic dark under layer composed of other bacterial groups in both reservoirs the quantity of cyanobacteria in the biofilm was significantly greater in core samples this suggests that using substrates for the sampling of benthic cyanobacteria could underestimate their true abundance this could represent a significant issue in the monitoring of benthic cyanotoxins indeed in the eventuality that the species present are toxigenic this would lead to an underestimation of the toxic risk the thickness of material and therefore biomass growing on substrates was inferior to that collected from sediment core samples data not shown this along with the nature of the substrates tested might explain the observed difference in abundance between phyla present on different substrates while the sampling frame represents an easy to use solution for the routine monitoring of benthic mats water utilities need to consider that by using this device and depending on the type of substrate used the abundance of cyanobacteria may be under evaluated this short survey also identified commonly found microbial taxa in benthic biofilms actinobacteria bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia cyanobacteria planctomycetes proteobacteria and spirochaetes the comparison of microbial community composition between the core sediment samples and artificial substrates highlighted that the best choice of substrate material depends on the reservoir sampled in the light of these results it is recommended that a preliminary study is conducted in each reservoir to identify which substrate to use for routine monitoring in the present case wave action seemed to have less impact on biofilm resuspension with the wood substrates than with the other materials due to this a timber substrate provided a higher amount of sample material to analyse and was therefore selected for the field validation survey monitoring techniques were mainly molecular and were adapted to the benthic matrix a new qpcr assay for the specific detection of the cyanobacterial mib synthase gene was designed and validated for this work the most efficient assays tested during the course of this study were the qpcrs targeting cyra and mib synthase while the 16s rdna anaf and geoaa actinobacteria were the least efficient presenting high loqs this can be due to high specificity of the primers for planktonic species most of the primer pairs used for this study were designed based on pelagic strain sequences namely aphanizomenon for the 16s rdna shaw et al 1999 assay and aphanizomenon anabaenopsis for the anaf qpcr ballot et al 2010 while primer concentrations were reasonably similar between the studies mentioned above and the present work the annealing temperature chosen in this study is much lower i e 50 c instead of 55 c and 57 c for the 16s rdna and anaf assays respectively by reducing the annealing temperature and increasing the number of cycles the intent was to increase the chance of amplifying sequences from benthic species while using primers designed for pelagic forms indeed sequence variation between pelagic and benthic species is likely which renders the attachment of primers to target dna weak even at a lower annealing temperature most of the studies using the list of primers applied here ran the pcrs for 30 to 35 cycles compared to 50 cycles in this study the melting curve analysis provided a specificity control this exercise worked efficiently for most toxin genes and for the mib synthase assays al tebrineh and collaborators al tebrineh et al 2012 published loqs higher to the ones obtained here 88 cell equivalents for each assay compared to 41 28 and 5 cell equivalents for the mcye sxta and cyra assays respectively in the present study it is our understanding that the authors estimated that only one copy of the genome was present per cell it has been demonstrated that the number of copies of the genome per cell varies from 3 to over 10 copies depending on the species concerned and life stage monis et al 2012 by including this factor in calculations and using the average number of 5 copies per cell the loq is reduced to 18 cell equivalents showing better detection of pelagic species over benthic forms for most of the assays nevertheless the lods and loqs reached for most of the assays allowed for the detection of low cell numbers and were therefore easily applicable on environmental samples all sampling and monitoring techniques developed to characterise benthic samples were validated during a year long field survey in a south australian reservoir the microbial biomass harvested from the coupon samples increased in march april 2015 after the end of the planktonic bloom season december 2014 to march 2015 these results confirm previous findings chen et al 2010 demonstrating a peak season for benthic cyanobacterial growth during the south australian spring and autumn seasons despite this peak the biomass collected in sa l2 reservoir was ten times below the yield of biofilm harvested in sa l1 reservoir during sampling a diversity of predators grazers were observed on the coupons collected in sa l2 reservoir with especially high numbers of cadis fly larvae notalina spira and small freshwater snails physa acuta it is likely that a community of invertebrate grazers regulated biofilm growth in this reservoir as the biofilm biomass peaked when no grazers were observed in the light of these results it appears that there may be potential for grazer driven bioremediation for the management of benthic microalgae however this would require further investigation in addition this study demonstrated that benthic algal growth was not driven by nitrogen or phosphorus availability in the water this can be explained by the fact that nutrient cycling occurs mainly in the sediment therefore benthic algae rest on a pool of nutrients and are not likely to be limited by concentrations of bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus in terms of secondary metabolite production mib was not detected in sa l2 reservoir although mib was not detected above the loq values by gas chromatography 4 ng l some mib synthase gene copies were observed highlighting a potential cyanobacterial source of mib in benthic biofilms in this reservoir this is of particular importance as humans can detect mib at a concentration of 1 ng l which is below the loq of the analytical method used while conventional water treatment methods such as activated carbon can reduce the concentration of t o present in raw water to provide a safe and palatable end product little is known on the growth of mats in treatment plants themselves and how water quality is subsequently affected this qpcr assay represents a useful tool to monitor the presence and growth of mib producing bacteria in low concentrations both in raw water and along the treatment line the peak of geosmin occurred in spring coinciding with peaks in benthic biomass and outside of the pelagic cyanobacterial bloom season summer suggesting a role for benthic t o production this also demonstrates that in spring the t o production potential increases along with cyanobacterial growth and overall biofilm biomass the amount of biomass collected for analysis is crucial to reach loq values in the geoac and even more so in the geoaa qpcr assays therefore biofilm sampling needs to be sufficient to be able to detect t o production the concentration of geosmin in the water column varied between sampling sites seasonal patterns were again different between sites sites o1 to o3 observed similar geosmin concentration patterns two sampling sites o2 and o5 presented peaks of geosmin and geoa gene concentrations interestingly due to the topography of the reservoir these sites were subject to less wave action than the other sites if geosmin concentrations exceeded the loq of 4 ng l in the water column in sheltered locations the geosmin synthase could be detected by qpcr in location o4 subject to higher wave action a peak in benthic geoac gene detection was followed by rising concentrations of geosmin in the water column these results highlight that wave action impacts benthic biofilms in two ways 1 the dispersion of benthic mats in the case of high wave activity and 2 the colonisation of biofilms in shallow areas which then also likely affects the amount of biofilm that can be collected for analysis the isolation process led to the purification of a geosmin producing cyanobacterial strain awqc pho021 this strain was described previously for its toxin producing potential gaget et al 2017b and was taxonomically characterised as oxynema accuminatum ex phormidium accuminatum phormidium has been previously identified as a common t o producing culprit in surface water sugiura and nakano 2000 chen et al 2010 the specific actinobacterial geosmin synthase gene geoaa was detected in one location proving 1 the heterogeneity of the benthic matrix and 2 a potential source of geosmin by a benthic actinobacterial species similarly copies of anaf atx cyra cyn and mcye mc genes were detected in two locations in spring 2015 considering that cyn and atx producers were identified amongst isolates purified from sa l2 reservoir it is not surprising to observe a positive detection of cyra and anaf in environmental benthic samples gaget et al 2017c nevertheless no sxt and mc producers were purified during the isolation process and therefore the culprits producing these two toxins in the benthic biofilm remain unidentified the disparity of results between locations could be due to either 1 a reflection of the heterogeneous nature of benthic biofilms or 2 a result of low concentrations of mc and sxt producing cells in proportion to the total population it is also possible that these toxins are produced by planktonic species present as resting cells in the biofilm each location receives different concentrations of nutrients that promote algal growth this factor combined with different predation pressure can explain why potentially toxic cells might grow more abundantly in some locations than others similarly the reason why sufficient potentially toxic cells were detected in november 2015 might be explained by both an increase in factors promoting growth i e key nutrient increased availability higher temperatures and light exposure and limited grazing these results highlight once more the need to sample sufficient biofilm to obtain significant results with the qpcr assays seven phyla including cyanobacteria accounted for over 90 of the total microbial community throughout the sa l2 reservoir proteobacteria and planctomycetes were the dominant phyla in the majority of samples collected this contrasts with results obtained previously simon et al 2002 hullar et al 2006 anderson glenna et al 2008 bartrons et al 2012 wang et al 2012 where cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes were largely dominant one of these studies was conducted on epilithic biofilms collected from oligotrophic or mesotrophic lakes bartrons et al 2012 which highlights the dominance of benthic cyanobacteria following this hypothesis the difference in dominance observed during the field study could suggest that nutrient availability in the water i e through uptake by planktonic microalgae may impact the dominance of cyanobacteria in benthic biofilms nevertheless the results presented herein suggest that key nutrient concentrations in the water were not a factor influencing benthic cyanobacterial growth this dominance could also be the result of better defence strategies from some groups of bacteria indeed alpha proteobacteria can form grazing resistant agglomerates in freshwater biofilms newton et al 2011 this could explain their dominance in this reservoir considering the high abundance of grazers observed during the field survey generally the population of cyanobacteria followed similar seasonal patterns across the catchment smaller population in winter and highest cell concentrations in spring which is a common trend observed in previously published studies aberle and whitshire 2006 chen et al 2010 toxin genes were only detected in two locations towards the end of spring 2015 november the absence in three locations could potentially be a reflection of the heterogeneity of the benthic mat with toxic strains being only located sporadically around the reservoir heterogeneity has previously been observed in benthic communities wood et al 2012 similar heterogeneity was observed in the detection of geosmin and geoa gene copies actinobacteria i e including actinomycetes and streptomyces were more dominant in samples collected in winter while concentrations of geosmin started to rise in winter and peaked in spring it could therefore be hypothesised that the production of geosmin by benthic bacteria starts in winter by actinobacteria and is continued or even intensified by the growth of cyanobacteria in spring although the amount of data variability that can be explained by the two calculated pca factors was rather low this study suggests that benthic actinobacteria and cyanobacteria play a significant role in the production of geosmin in the sa l2 reservoir and amount for over a third of the total geosmin concentrations in the water this rather low percentage can be explained by a potential lack of accuracy of the detection method for the geosmin between lod and loq values observed for most of the year survey which can impact the distribution of the data points it can also be explained by potential considerable growth of non geosmin producing actinobacteria and cyanobacteria at times in this case the number of cyanobacteria and actinobacteria would rise substantially while the percentage of this community able to produce geosmin does not concurrently results presented herein suggested an inverse relationship between the concentration of cyanobacteria present in benthic biofilms and key nutrients tkn total nitrogen and total phosphorus a trend which was previously observed gillet et al 2016 nevertheless the regression analyses conducted herein demonstrated a poor correlation between cyanobacterial growth and key nutrient concentrations in the water it is well known that sediments represent a reserve of nutrients for lakes and reservoirs and that a range of bacteria transform organic nutrients within the sediment in what can be characterised as metabolic networks larsen et al 2011 scott et al 2014 benthic nitrogen cycling in particular has been thoroughly investigated due to its impact on environmental eutrophication through natural denitrification and anammox scott et al 2014 it is therefore unlikely for benthic cyanobacteria to be depleted in nitrogen and phosphorus controlling these nutrients in the water as it is sometime attempted by water utilities to reduce pelagic growth would not represent an effective in situ management strategy for benthic cyanobacteria 5 conclusion the sampling device designed during this study worked effectively in the field and provides a new solution for routinely monitoring benthic biofilms substrates used to collect samples need to be incubated for at least 6 8 weeks prior to first sampling in order to allow for the biofilm to colonise the surface and a minimum of 3 replicate samples need to be collected to assess the microbial community adequately although the sampling system worked efficiently it tended to underestimate the proportion of cyanobacteria present in samples some of the qpcr assays designed to track down benthic cyanobacteria and associated production of secondary metabolites presented relatively high loqs nevertheless all assays were validated on environmental samples and permitted an assessment of growth and the seasonal patterns of secondary metabolite production over the course of a one year field survey november 2014 november 2015 in sa l2 reservoir it appeared that benthic biofilms were regulated by a range of grazers and a seasonal peak in growth was observed in spring as a result of this predation the biomass collected was inferior to that observed in the other reservoir and bioremediation could be considered for benthic biofilm management this study highlighted the presence of a confirmed geosmin and cyn producer oxynema accuminatum and of potential stx and mc producers in benthic biofilm in sa l2 reservoir benthic actinobacteria were abundant in winter and likely started the release of geosmin in the water while benthic cyanobacteria participated to the geosmin production actively in spring statistically 35 of the geosmin present in the water column can be directly attributed to a benthic production by actinobacteria and cyanobacteria conflicts of interest all authors listed for this publication hereby attest that none of the participants in this

18331,benthic cyanobacteria are a nuisance because they produce highly potent toxins and taste and odour compounds despite this benthic cyanobacteria remain far less studied than their planktonic counterparts for example little is known about their growth or the seasonality of their secondary metabolite production moreover sampling and monitoring techniques commonly used for the survey of planktonic species are not necessarily applicable to benthic forms this study aimed to develop and validate a new sampling device for the routine monitoring of benthic mats molecular monitoring techniques were established and validated on environmental samples collected in a south australian reservoir sa l2 a total of eight qpcr assays were applied to samples in order to track seasonal variations in cyanobacteria concentrations and associated secondary metabolite production next generation sequencing was utilised to conduct a microbial community composition analysis and to select the most appropriate substrate material for the sampling of benthic cyanobacteria the concentration of the secondary metabolites geosmin and 2 methyl isoborneol were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography and concentrations of key nutrients n p were quantified in water samples the sampling device designed proved efficient and easy to use in the field the qpcr assay designed for the amplification of the cyanobacterial mib synthase had a high efficiency with a minimum limit of quantification of 4 cell equivalents per reaction and identified a potential source of mib in sa l2 reservoir the peak season for benthic growth and secondary metabolite production was observed in spring proportionally 35 of the variability in water geosmin concentrations can be explained by benthic actinobacterial and cyanobacterial activity showing that freshwater benthic mats represent a significant source of taste and odour compounds graphical abstract image 1 keywords benthic cyanobacteria

globally as a major risk factor for drinking water falconer and humpage 2005 falconer and humpage 2006 hudnell 2008 gaget et al 2017b despite decades of research on growth control and toxin production by pelagic cyanobacteria there are relatively few studies evaluating the risk associated with benthic forms benthic cyanobacteria are organised in mats representing an important part of the photosynthetic layer of epilithic biofilms quiblier et al 2013 in these mats thin filamentous microalgae and other microorganisms are arranged in a complex polysaccharidic matrix pierre et al 2012 during high growth periods photosynthetic activity increases and produces air bubbles which become entrapped in the mat and cause some segments to detach and float floating mats can contribute to the ingestion of toxins by animals which have occasionally proved lethal gugger et al 2005 mez et al 1997 while this still represents an emerging issue recent studies have demonstrated that cyanotoxins are widespread in benthic mats across australia dasey et al 2005 seifert et al 2007 gaget et al 2017c sendall and mcgregor 2018 and around the world cadel six et al 2007 gugger et al 2005 mez et al 1997 mohamed et al 2006 benthic biofilms also produce a range of taste and odour compounds hereafter referred to as t o compounds in a range of waterbodies izaguirre et al 1995 jüttner and watson 2007 izaguirre and taylor 2007 chen et al 2010 otten et al 2016 geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib are the main taste and odour compounds of concern and cause water to smell and taste earthy musty when present above 10 ng l these compounds can represent a considerable challenge to water treatment chen et al 2010 due to the very high sensitivity that humans have to these two compounds the public may notice off flavours before they are identified via laboratory analysis even if toxins are not present the presence of t o compounds can generate public doubt that the water is safe to drink because treatment does not appear to have been effective therefore it is vitally important for the water industry to have early warning of the presence of cyanobacteria that have the potential to produce t o compounds or toxins despite the demonstration that benthic cyanobacteria can be a source of toxins and t o in drinking water reservoirs gaget et al 2017c no recommended guideline for their survey exists however routine sampling of planktonic cyanobacteria is generally well established in the water industry chorus and bartram 1999 adwg 2011 in contrast no routine techniques have been scientifically validated for the sampling of benthic forms conventional benthic sampling consists of the collection of sediment core samples savichtcheva et al 2011 karlson et al 2012 while collecting sediment core samples gives a close to reality picture of the biodiversity present its practicality is limited in rocky areas where benthic mats seem to thrive and there is also a significant risk for cross contamination between different layers of the core when extracting the sediment out of the sampler this is particularly problematic when using analyses such as next generation sequencing ngs e g for community composition analysis or metagenomics the ministry for the environment of new zealand has published recommendations for the survey of benthic cyanobacteria particularly in rivers wood et al 2009 these guidelines give advice on areas where the sampling effort should be concentrated mainly in shallow shorelines or reaches and on the use of underwater viewers to collect core samples wood et al applied these recommendations by sampling 1 m2 quadrants inside a 10m 10m grid in shallow areas wood et al 2011 the technique was shown to be relevant only in very shallow water and required 10 sub samples per collection site to be reliable making it unsuitable for routine monitoring of reservoirs the present study aimed to develop a reliable and easy to use sampling technique for the routine collection of benthic bacteria growing in epilithic biofilms cell counts under light microscopy the traditional monitoring technique used for planktonic species is not applicable to benthic mats due to the complexity of the matrix in this context the present study aimed to 1 design and trial a novel and easy to use sampling method for benthic cyanobacteria 2 test a range of existing molecular techniques on benthic mats to evaluate their validity as monitoring tools 3 develop a qpcr assay for the specific detection of the mib synthase gene in cyanobacteria and 4 use the aforementioned tools to conduct a field survey in a south australian reservoir to address these aims a sampler was designed and eight quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays and ngs were developed or adapted to analyse benthic matrix samples all of the techniques developed were validated during a year long field survey and utilised to establish seasonal patterns of benthic growth and secondary metabolite production 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling design and validation 2 1 1 design the general sampling concept involved deploying artificial substrates in the reservoirs and allowing the development of microbial biofilms to achieve proper colonisation substrates need to be placed as close as possible to the surface of the sediment therefore a supporting structure for the substrates that could be anchored to rest on the sediment to limit movement was designed and constructed rectangular frames 144 cm 67 cm were built using pvc pipes dwv pipe 100 mm 6m vinidex edinburgh sa australia and covered with a mesh wire mesh garden pvc coated 90 cm 12x12 1 mm bunnings melbourne vic australia which was attached using plastic cable ties holes were drilled in the pipes to prevent air being trapped inside the structure and contributing buoyancy an anchoring frame larger than the sampling frame 184 cm 107 cm was weighed down by fixing 1 5m steel rods on each side of the frame four buoys spherical white foam marker buoy 150 mm diameter were attached by rope at the corners of the anchor frame a fifth buoy was attached to the centre of the sampling frame this central rope was used to lift the frame for sampling while the anchor frame was left at the bottom of the reservoir fig 1 rectangles of three different substrates namely wood wet and dry sandpaper and the rough surface of tiles were attached to the mesh using cable ties each rectangle covered a total surface area of 45 cm2 to validate the practicality of the structure and determine the time necessary for the biofilm to colonise the substrate a frame was built and deployed at 1m depth in sa l2 reservoir located in urban south australia after the launch substrates were sampled initially and at two week intervals for 8 weeks t0 t0 2 weeks t0 4 weeks and t0 8 weeks 2 1 2 coupon material and replicate number validation to validate the choice of substrate to be used for future monitoring and to compare these substrates to core sediment samples 18 sampling frames were built and deployed in october 2013 in two urban reservoirs in south australia sa l1 and sa l2 where problematic benthic species were previously detected gaget et al 2017c samples were collected after 12 weeks of incubation january 2014 and processed as described below next generation sequencing was applied on a selection of samples from both reservoirs to evaluate the minimum number of physical replicates per site and sampling date necessary to conduct a robust community composition analysis five replicate natural samples i e core sediment samples were collected in january 2014 from one location in sa l2 reservoir similarly to compare the closeness of communities growing on the different substrates tested to that of the original sediment communities five replicate samples of each substrate material i e wood tile and sandpaper and natural sediment were collected from two locations in sa l2 reservoir at the same time in january 2014 genomic dna was extracted from the five replicate samples collected at that same location and diluted to a final concentration of 10 μg ml for the depth of read analysis dna extracts were then sequenced either on their own or pooled together in all possible combinations of 2 3 4 or 5 extracts in one sample to be analysed 2 1 3 benthic sample processing

out of megan by exporting data from the bar chart visualisation option 2 2 2 qpcrs to assess the presence of t o and toxin producers in benthic biofilms seven qpcr assays were selected to optimise the time spent on method development most primer sets used in this study were carefully chosen from previously published work shaw et al 1999 giglio et al 2008 ballot et al 2010 al tebrineh et al 2012 kutovaya and watson 2014 table 1 however at the start of the project no existing assay for the detection of the mib synthase gene was available and a new pair of primers was designed published mib synthase gene sequences were obtained from genbank https www ncbi nlm nih gov genbank and aligned using clustal x v 2 0 larkin et al 2007 multiple alignments were corrected using genedoc v 2 7 000

efficiently between 50 c and 55 c after optimisation all assays were conducted with the following cycling conditions 10 min incubation at 95 c 50 cycles 95 c for 20 s 50 c for 20 s 72 c for 20 s with data acquisition at the end of this step as toxin and t o gene sequences may vary between taxa an annealing temperature of 50 c was chosen to improve the chances of amplification by choosing a lower annealing temperature it is noteworthy that the chances of amplifying non target sequences are increased each amplification was followed by high resolution melting curve analysis 95 for 60 s 40 c for 60 s 65 c for 1 s and 97 c for 1 s with continuous acquisition at 97 c all data were acquired on the fam channel using a light cycler 96 pcr thermocycler roche diagnostics corporation indianapolis ind usa quantification was done using 10 ng μl genomic dna extracts to produce dna standards calculations took into account the genome weight of each of the positive control strains as well as an average

using the surface area of the coupon material 45 cm2 providing final results in cell equivalents cm2 2 3 field validation to verify the efficiency of the methods developed during the project a time series survey over a year was conducted in sa l2 reservoir as this location has previously experienced t o episodes chen et al 2010 hobson et al 2010 and toxic isolates were previously isolated from this reservoir gaget et al 2017c the confirmed presence of benthic cyanobacteria producing the secondary metabolites of interest in this reservoir meant that this survey gave the opportunity to determine the sensitivity and reliability of the sampling and monitoring techniques described above 2 3 1 strain isolation culturing and morphological identification prior to the start of the field survey sediment core samples were collected from six locations in sa l2 reservoir in south australia using a custom made core sampler 50 mm diameter the phototrophic top layer of the core samples most likely to contain benthic algae was scraped off and transferred to a container for transportation a weight of approximately 500 mg of the retained sediment core sample was resuspended in 10 ml of filtered reservoir water drops of the suspension were placed on 1 agar media asm 1 bg11 wc and mla carmichael and gorham 1974 allen 1968 guillard 1975 gorham et al 1964 the isolation of species was conducted as previously described rippka 1988 gaget et al 2017a all cultures placed on agar were maintained at 21 c under white light osram universal white with a photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of 30 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the remainder of the suspension was preserved by adding 10 v v lugol s iodine and observed by light microscopy nikon eclipse 50i microscope in order to identify the species present in the collected mats the level of purity of the isolated cultures and the species identification were determined by observation using light microscopy with phase contrast nikon eclipse 50i microscope with images captured using a nikon digital sight camera nikon shinagawa tokyo japan the cyanoprokaryota part 2 and 3 taxonomic keys were used for genus and species identification komárek and anagnostidis 2005a and 2005b as the taxonomy of cyanobacteria is ever evolving following molecular advances species names established through microscopic observation were modified as appropriate to fit to the most recent taxonomy available using references available on the algaebase website http www algaebase org purified isolates were tested for their toxin production as previously described gaget et al 2017b and for t o production as described below 2 3 2 sampling regime in september 2014 samplers harbouring 60 substrates of the validated type of material see results section were deployed at 1m depth in five locations fig 2 the first sampling was completed on 19 11 2014 which corresponded to 8 weeks of incubation after this date samples were collected monthly until 21 11 2015 with the exception of february 2015 when resources were not available to allow sampling samples were processed as described above and analysed using all monitoring techniques detailed in this section 2 3 3 screening of key nutrients and t o in water and culture samples three replicate water samples 300 ml were collected at 0 5m depth immediately adjacent to the sampling device and were sent directly to als global for nutrient analysis and two replicate samples of 100 ml were sent to the australian water quality centre awqc for t o measurements by gas chromatography the key nutrient forms analysed during the survey were ammonia nitrites nitrates nox i e the sum of nitrites and nitrates tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen total nitrogen i e the sum of nox and tkn total phosphorus and reactive phosphorus additional triplicate water samples 300 ml were collected as described above these samples were destined to qpcr and ngs purposes and each replicate was filtered through a mixed cellulose ester membrane 0 45 μm pore size pall corporation u s a which was then preserved at 20 c until further analysis samples collected for t o analysis were concentrated with a solid phase micro extraction syringe fibre supelco australia and analysed on a 7890a gas chromatograph system with a 5975c vl series mass selective detector agilent technologies australia against quantified deuterated internal standards ultrafine chemicals uk according to a method developed by graham and hayes 1998 the loq for this method is 4 ng l aliquots of isolate cultures 4 ml approximately 80 mg of wet weight were centrifuged at 20 000 g for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and pellets were preserved at 20 c prior to dna extraction for both culture and filtered water samples a screening of genes involved in the synthesis of geosmin and mib was completed by qpcr using the assays listed in tables 1 and 2 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical tests were conducted on normalised data using the xlstat software add on on excel version 19 5 all the data collected were combined in a unique matrix and used to first conduct a pca if any major trend could be identified then the relationship between variables was investigated using individual linear regressions 3 results 3 1 sampling method design and validation 3 1 1 sampler deployment and incubation trial the sampling frames were simple to deploy and sank appropriately pulling the central buoy allowed the sampling frame to be lifted easily and the collection of samples could be executed safely at t0 2 weeks and t0 4 weeks the biomass collected from the wooden substrates was somewhat comparable fig 3 the biomass growing on the two other substrates sandpaper and tile increased progressively over time at t0 8 weeks all substrates were colonised by the biofilm and the wooden coupon generally allowed for the collection of a larger mass than from the other two other materials there was more variability between replicates in the biomass collected from the sandpaper substrate 217 78 mg for sandpaper in opposition to 139 52 mg and 126 75 mg for wood and tile substrates respectively 3 1 2 evaluation of replicate number necessary for community composition analysis five replicate samples were collected from wooden substrates at location o2 in sa l2 reservoir to evaluate the minimum number of physical replicates needed to be collected at each site per sampling date supp fig 2 presents the average number of taxonomic reads or leaves measured for each of the various replicate combinations this value corresponds to the maximum diversity detected by ngs in these samples the combination of three or four replicates provided the highest numbers of taxonomic reads at a genus level meaning that the microbial diversity was better captured using a minimum of three replicates the standard deviation calculated for the highest number of reads per run last point of each curve was lower for the three replicate condition than for the four replicate combination with values of respectively 9 62 and 13 39 number of taxonomic reads 3 1 3 coupon material validation the biofilms collected comprised two parts a green photosynthetic part composed of a mix of filamentous cyanobacteria and other classes of microalgae supp fig 3 a c and d and an anoxic brown under layer composed of other groups of bacteria supp fig 3b the ngs analysis demonstrated that the dominant phyla were the same between the two reservoirs but proportions changed fig 4 in both reservoirs the quantity of cyanobacteria in the biofilm was greater in core samples when compared to coupon substrate samples cyanobacteria and proteobacteria represented the dominant microbial phyla bacteroidetes and spirochaetes were present in higher proportions in sa l2 reservoir samples than in biofilms collected in sa l1 reservoir in sa l1 reservoir the microbial community composition varied greatly between substrates tile samples had a general composition closer to that of sediment core samples while sandpaper and wood substrates presented significantly lower concentrations of cyanobacteria when compared to the core or tile substrate in sa l2 reservoir all artificial substrates exhibited similar community composition but were different to that of the sediment core sample with the exception of cyanobacteria which were less represented in the artificial substrate the dominant and minor phyla were present in equivalent importance in the sediment core and the wood samples with the major dominant phyla were also the same in both the commonly found microbial taxa in benthic biofilms sampled were actinobacteria bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia cyanobacteria planctomycetes proteobacteria and spirochaetes the community composition comparison between the core sediment samples and artificial substrates highlighted a catchment specific response sa l1 reservoir tiles exhibited a similar microbial community composition to that of the natural sample core sample while in sa l2 reservoir the closest to the natural population was found in biofilms growing on the wood substrates fig 4a and b the nj network computed with the ngs data at a species level highlighted no significant correlation between the α diversity between core samples and other substrate overall nonetheless at location g the microbial diversity present on wood substrates was the closest to that of the core sediment sample fig 4c 3 2 molecular monitoring techniques establishment 3 2 1 choice of primers for the mib synthase assay two primer sets designed for the mib synthase gene table 1 were compared in terms of amplification efficiency primers were tested on a mib producing cultured strain pseudanabaena galeata awqc psa016 under the above conditions ms f1 ms r1 showed amplification with cq values of 20 4 while ms f2 ms r2 failed to amplify the target fragment consequently the ms f1 ms r1 set of primers was selected for further optimisation the pair of primers was subjected to a temperature gradient from 50 c to 60 c to evaluate its optimum annealing temperature the best signal was obtained between 50 c and 57 2 c above an annealing temperature of 51 8 the control amplified a non specific fragment of around 1 kbp in addition to the expected fragment of 178 bp data not shown the choice of running all assays at an annealing temperature of 50 c is therefore particularly suitable for this set of primers the specificity of the primers was evaluated against 30 strains from the awqc culture collection only the mib producing strain positive control was found to produce a specific amplificon some non specific products were amplified but could be distinguished from the target amplicon using melting curve analysis the specific fragment harbours a peak corresponding to a melting temperature tm of 87 4 c 3 2 2 qpcr assays standard curves limit of detection and melting curve profiles positive controls were chosen from a list of cultured strains from the awqc culture collection and the cawthron institute culture collection of microalgae new zealand culture collections rhodes et al 2016 each strain was known for producing the following secondary metabolites mib pseudanabaena galeata strain awqc psa016 geosmin streptomyces strain awqc strepto yellow and phormidium sp strain awqc pho021 anatoxin a phormidium sp strain cyn112 cylindrospermopsin cylindrospermopsis raciborskii strain awqc cyp011 saxitoxin dolichospermum circinale strain awqc ana131 and microcystin microcystis aeruginosa strain awqc mic058 table 2 these strains are summarised in table 2 along with their genome weight the standard curves for all the pcr assays were calculated using a genomic dna dilution series from 10 ng μl to 10 fg μl of genomic dna table 2 the most efficient assays were the qpcrs targeting cyra and mib synthase able to detect 5 or 4 cell equivalents respectively the least efficient assays 16s rdna anaf and geoa actinomycetes presented high loq 3 636 3571 and 2128 cell equivalents respectively 3 3 field survey 3 3 1 characterization of isolated strains the isolation process allowed for the purification of 9 different strains from the core samples collected in sa l2 reservoir these strains were characterized morphologically genetically and for their toxin production ability in a previous publication gaget et al 2017c only one strain produced toxins isolate i013 0028 deposited in the awqc algal collection as phormidium ambiguum awqc pho021 which produced cylindrospermopsin cyn and deoxy cylindrospermopsin deocyn this same isolate also produces geosmin 3 79 104 ng extracellular geosmin l in a culture analysed during stationary phase 3 3 2 growth and nutrients the microbial biomass harvested from coupon samples increased in march april 2015 after the end of the planktonic bloom season december 2014 to march 2015 data not shown reaching a peak of 4 8 g w w wet weight in location o1 in october 2015 the biomass collected in this reservoir was ten times below the yield of biofilm harvested in sa l1 reservoir during sampling diverse predators grazers were observed on the coupons supp fig 4 with especially high numbers of cadis fly larvae notalina spira and small freshwater snails physa acuta total nitrogen totaln varied between 0 and 1 8 mg l with an average value of 0 85 mg l tkn represented the majority of nitrogen forms in the samples with values varying from 0 to 1 6 mg l and an average of 0 77 mg l the total phosphorus totalp varied from 0 to 0 34 mg l with an average of 0 04 mg l while the reactive phosphorus represented a very small portion with a maximum value of 0 02 mg l and an average concentration of 0 002 mg l this was reflected in the principal component analysis pca the two main factors calculated in the pca account for only 55 74 of the observed data variability with f1 and f2 explaining 37 11 and 18 63 of the variability respectively supp fig 5 the geosmin concentrations and the percentage of actinobacteria and cyanobacteria present progress in the same direction on the f1 axis while pointing in the opposite direction than tkn and total nitrogen and total phosphorus on that same axis the linear regression calculations computed between log cyano and log totalp and log totaln show that only 9 and 8 of the variability in concentrations of cyanobacteria respectively can be explained by the changing totalp and totaln concentrations present in water samples collected at benthic depth 3 3 3 community composition analysis next generation sequencing results are presented in fig 5 and describe the evolution of the benthic microbial community composition over time with bars representing a particular sampling date for simplicity only the seven most abundant phyla are displayed as a percentage of the total population proteobacteria planctomycetes firmicutes cyanobacteria verrucomicrobia bacteroidetes and actinobacteria in most cases these phyla accounted for over 90 of the total population in sa l2 reservoir proteobacteria and planctomycetes were the dominant phyla in most of the samples collected during the year long survey there was an issue with the amplification and sequencing of the sample collected in location o2 in march 2015 this sample was therefore not included in further analyses except for the sample collected in location o3 in january 2015 the population of cyanobacteria evolved in a similar manner in all locations with lower concentrations in winter months and an increase in concentrations starting from september 2015 spring the microbial community composition analysis also highlighted that actinobacteria i e including actinomycetes and streptomyces were more dominant in samples collected during winter 3 3 4 t o production monitoring the presence of mib and geosmin was monitored monthly in the reservoir during the year long survey in parallel the presence of the genes required for the synthesis of these two molecules was investigated in the biofilm in the absence of a qpcr assay for the specific detection of mib production by actinobacteria i e actinomycetes and streptomyces the mib synthase gene was monitored only for cyanobacteria while geoa was monitored for both cyanobacteria geoac and actinobacteria geoaa fig 6 with the exception of location o4 the peaks of geoac gene concentrations were observed in spring and corresponded with peaks of biofilm biomass indeed the peak of biomass collected from wood substrates were high over winter and the start of spring while decreasing around mid spring while concentrations of geosmin increased from the end of autumn 26 05 2015 to reach a peak in spring peaks of geoac genes were observed much later october 2015 it is important to note that the loq usually given for geosmin and mib in hplc is set at 4 ng l due to quality standards delivered by the awqc in order to see whether t o compounds were present all year long concentrations between the lod and the loq were also plotted on fig 6 with the exception of location o2 geoaa was not detected although mib was not detected above loq values in the water during the year long survey some mib synthase gene copies were detected in two locations the linear regression describing the relationship between log concentration of cyanobacteria and log concentration of geosmin presented data points mostly falling outside of the expected 95 confidence interval calculated by the model the explanatory variable log cyano explains 10 of the variability observed for log geosmin this means that only a small portion of the geosmin detected in the water can be linked to production by benthic cyanobacteria similarly the regression analysis describing the relationship between log concentration of actinobacteria and log concentration of geosmin showed that most data points fall outside of the expected 95 confidence interval calculated by the model the explanatory variable log actino explains 25 of the variability observed for log geosmin this means that only part of the geosmin detected in the water can be linked to production by benthic actinobacteria collectively benthic actinobacteria and cyanobacteria account for 35 of the geosmin detected in the water column 3 3 5 monitoring toxin genes over the course of this field survey samples were also tested for the presence of cyanotoxin genes anaf atx cyra cyn mcye mc and stxa stx positive values were recorded only in november 2015 in two locations o2 and o5 potential producers of cyn the presence of cyra gene copies was detected in both locations with higher levels in site o5 with 2 77 x 10 3 2 79 x 10 0 cell equivalent cm2 than in site o2 with 3 09 x 10 2 2 10 10 1 cell equivalent cm2 copies of stxa and mcye were also detected in location o5 with values of 7 83 x 10 1 1 25 10 1 cell equivalent cm2 and 1 34 x 10 4 9 53 x 10 1 cell equivalent cm2 respectively considering the lack of detection of toxin genes in the samples collected in sa l2 reservoir the data associated with these genes were not included in the pca 4 discussion the sampling frames were easy to use and allowed for safe recovery of benthic samples this device has application to both research and routine monitoring by water utilities to sample benthic biofilms the fact that the biomass collected from the wooden substrate after 2 and 4 weeks of incubation were somewhat comparable between each other demonstrates that the growth observed on this substrate until t0 4 weeks is not necessarily a reflection of its colonisation by the biofilm this preliminary study highlighted that a minimum of 8 weeks of incubation was necessary to reach biofilm colonisation on all substrate materials wooden substrates allowed for the collection of a larger biomass than the two other materials and exhibited less variability between replicates in the biomass compared with sandpaper substrates this is likely due to resuspension of the biofilm by wave action the more porous nature of the wooden material could also provide better anchoring for the biofilm therefore providing better resistance against physical disturbance when dna extracts were analysed by ngs on their own or in combinations of 3 or 4 replicates the number of total reads increased significantly and the number of taxonomic leaves was higher than for the other combinations it was therefore decided to extract three replicate samples for each site and date for the year survey the total surface covered by all substrate coupons on one sampler corresponded to about 3000 cm2 including spaces three coupons covered a surface area of 135 cm2 which amounts to 4 5 of the surface surveyed this is in agreement with previously published work in their study wood and collaborators wood et al 2011 established that it was necessary to investigate five 1 m quadrants in a 100 m2 grid to obtain a proper representation of the benthic population which represents a 5 coverage of the area studied and is close to the minimum coverage reported herein biofilms collected comprised two parts a green photosynthetic part comprising a range of microalgae and an anoxic dark under layer composed of other bacterial groups in both reservoirs the quantity of cyanobacteria in the biofilm was significantly greater in core samples this suggests that using substrates for the sampling of benthic cyanobacteria could underestimate their true abundance this could represent a significant issue in the monitoring of benthic cyanotoxins indeed in the eventuality that the species present are toxigenic this would lead to an underestimation of the toxic risk the thickness of material and therefore biomass growing on substrates was inferior to that collected from sediment core samples data not shown this along with the nature of the substrates tested might explain the observed difference in abundance between phyla present on different substrates while the sampling frame represents an easy to use solution for the routine monitoring of benthic mats water utilities need to consider that by using this device and depending on the type of substrate used the abundance of cyanobacteria may be under evaluated this short survey also identified commonly found microbial taxa in benthic biofilms actinobacteria bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia cyanobacteria planctomycetes proteobacteria and spirochaetes the comparison of microbial community composition between the core sediment samples and artificial substrates highlighted that the best choice of substrate material depends on the reservoir sampled in the light of these results it is recommended that a preliminary study is conducted in each reservoir to identify which substrate to use for routine monitoring in the present case wave action seemed to have less impact on biofilm resuspension with the wood substrates than with the other materials due to this a timber substrate provided a higher amount of sample material to analyse and was therefore selected for the field validation survey monitoring techniques were mainly molecular and were adapted to the benthic matrix a new qpcr assay for the specific detection of the cyanobacterial mib synthase gene was designed and validated for this work the most efficient assays tested during the course of this study were the qpcrs targeting cyra and mib synthase while the 16s rdna anaf and geoaa actinobacteria were the least efficient presenting high loqs this can be due to high specificity of the primers for planktonic species most of the primer pairs used for this study were designed based on pelagic strain sequences namely aphanizomenon for the 16s rdna shaw et al 1999 assay and aphanizomenon anabaenopsis for the anaf qpcr ballot et al 2010 while primer concentrations were reasonably similar between the studies mentioned above and the present work the annealing temperature chosen in this study is much lower i e 50 c instead of 55 c and 57 c for the 16s rdna and anaf assays respectively by reducing the annealing temperature and increasing the number of cycles the intent was to increase the chance of amplifying sequences from benthic species while using primers designed for pelagic forms indeed sequence variation between pelagic and benthic species is likely which renders the attachment of primers to target dna weak even at a lower annealing temperature most of the studies using the list of primers applied here ran the pcrs for 30 to 35 cycles compared to 50 cycles in this study the melting curve analysis provided a specificity control this exercise worked efficiently for most toxin genes and for the mib synthase assays al tebrineh and collaborators al tebrineh et al 2012 published loqs higher to the ones obtained here 88 cell equivalents for each assay compared to 41 28 and 5 cell equivalents for the mcye sxta and cyra assays respectively in the present study it is our understanding that the authors estimated that only one copy of the genome was present per cell it has been demonstrated that the number of copies of the genome per cell varies from 3 to over 10 copies depending on the species concerned and life stage monis et al 2012 by including this factor in calculations and using the average number of 5 copies per cell the loq is reduced to 18 cell equivalents showing better detection of pelagic species over benthic forms for most of the assays nevertheless the lods and loqs reached for most of the assays allowed for the detection of low cell numbers and were therefore easily applicable on environmental samples all sampling and monitoring techniques developed to characterise benthic samples were validated during a year long field survey in a south australian reservoir the microbial biomass harvested from the coupon samples increased in march april 2015 after the end of the planktonic bloom season december 2014 to march 2015 these results confirm previous findings chen et al 2010 demonstrating a peak season for benthic cyanobacterial growth during the south australian spring and autumn seasons despite this peak the biomass collected in sa l2 reservoir was ten times below the yield of biofilm harvested in sa l1 reservoir during sampling a diversity of predators grazers were observed on the coupons collected in sa l2 reservoir with especially high numbers of cadis fly larvae notalina spira and small freshwater snails physa acuta it is likely that a community of invertebrate grazers regulated biofilm growth in this reservoir as the biofilm biomass peaked when no grazers were observed in the light of these results it appears that there may be potential for grazer driven bioremediation for the management of benthic microalgae however this would require further investigation in addition this study demonstrated that benthic algal growth was not driven by nitrogen or phosphorus availability in the water this can be explained by the fact that nutrient cycling occurs mainly in the sediment therefore benthic algae rest on a pool of nutrients and are not likely to be limited by concentrations of bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus in terms of secondary metabolite production mib was not detected in sa l2 reservoir although mib was not detected above the loq values by gas chromatography 4 ng l some mib synthase gene copies were observed highlighting a potential cyanobacterial source of mib in benthic biofilms in this reservoir this is of particular importance as humans can detect mib at a concentration of 1 ng l which is below the loq of the analytical method used while conventional water treatment methods such as activated carbon can reduce the concentration of t o present in raw water to provide a safe and palatable end product little is known on the growth of mats in treatment plants themselves and how water quality is subsequently affected this qpcr assay represents a useful tool to monitor the presence and growth of mib producing bacteria in low concentrations both in raw water and along the treatment line the peak of geosmin occurred in spring coinciding with peaks in benthic biomass and outside of the pelagic cyanobacterial bloom season summer suggesting a role for benthic t o production this also demonstrates that in spring the t o production potential increases along with cyanobacterial growth and overall biofilm biomass the amount of biomass collected for analysis is crucial to reach loq values in the geoac and even more so in the geoaa qpcr assays therefore biofilm sampling needs to be sufficient to be able to detect t o production the concentration of geosmin in the water column varied between sampling sites seasonal patterns were again different between sites sites o1 to o3 observed similar geosmin concentration patterns two sampling sites o2 and o5 presented peaks of geosmin and geoa gene concentrations interestingly due to the topography of the reservoir these sites were subject to less wave action than the other sites if geosmin concentrations exceeded the loq of 4 ng l in the water column in sheltered locations the geosmin synthase could be detected by qpcr in location o4 subject to higher wave action a peak in benthic geoac gene detection was followed by rising concentrations of geosmin in the water column these results highlight that wave action impacts benthic biofilms in two ways 1 the dispersion of benthic mats in the case of high wave activity and 2 the colonisation of biofilms in shallow areas which then also likely affects the amount of biofilm that can be collected for analysis the isolation process led to the purification of a geosmin producing cyanobacterial strain awqc pho021 this strain was described previously for its toxin producing potential gaget et al 2017b and was taxonomically characterised as oxynema accuminatum ex phormidium accuminatum phormidium has been previously identified as a common t o producing culprit in surface water sugiura and nakano 2000 chen et al 2010 the specific actinobacterial geosmin synthase gene geoaa was detected in one location proving 1 the heterogeneity of the benthic matrix and 2 a potential source of geosmin by a benthic actinobacterial species similarly copies of anaf atx cyra cyn and mcye mc genes were detected in two locations in spring 2015 considering that cyn and atx producers were identified amongst isolates purified from sa l2 reservoir it is not surprising to observe a positive detection of cyra and anaf in environmental benthic samples gaget et al 2017c nevertheless no sxt and mc producers were purified during the isolation process and therefore the culprits producing these two toxins in the benthic biofilm remain unidentified the disparity of results between locations could be due to either 1 a reflection of the heterogeneous nature of benthic biofilms or 2 a result of low concentrations of mc and sxt producing cells in proportion to the total population it is also possible that these toxins are produced by planktonic species present as resting cells in the biofilm each location receives different concentrations of nutrients that promote algal growth this factor combined with different predation pressure can explain why potentially toxic cells might grow more abundantly in some locations than others similarly the reason why sufficient potentially toxic cells were detected in november 2015 might be explained by both an increase in factors promoting growth i e key nutrient increased availability higher temperatures and light exposure and limited grazing these results highlight once more the need to sample sufficient biofilm to obtain significant results with the qpcr assays seven phyla including cyanobacteria accounted for over 90 of the total microbial community throughout the sa l2 reservoir proteobacteria and planctomycetes were the dominant phyla in the majority of samples collected this contrasts with results obtained previously simon et al 2002 hullar et al 2006 anderson glenna et al 2008 bartrons et al 2012 wang et al 2012 where cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes were largely dominant one of these studies was conducted on epilithic biofilms collected from oligotrophic or mesotrophic lakes bartrons et al 2012 which highlights the dominance of benthic cyanobacteria following this hypothesis the difference in dominance observed during the field study could suggest that nutrient availability in the water i e through uptake by planktonic microalgae may impact the dominance of cyanobacteria in benthic biofilms nevertheless the results presented herein suggest that key nutrient concentrations in the water were not a factor influencing benthic cyanobacterial growth this dominance could also be the result of better defence strategies from some groups of bacteria indeed alpha proteobacteria can form grazing resistant agglomerates in freshwater biofilms newton et al 2011 this could explain their dominance in this reservoir considering the high abundance of grazers observed during the field survey generally the population of cyanobacteria followed similar seasonal patterns across the catchment smaller population in winter and highest cell concentrations in spring which is a common trend observed in previously published studies aberle and whitshire 2006 chen et al 2010 toxin genes were only detected in two locations towards the end of spring 2015 november the absence in three locations could potentially be a reflection of the heterogeneity of the benthic mat with toxic strains being only located sporadically around the reservoir heterogeneity has previously been observed in benthic communities wood et al 2012 similar heterogeneity was observed in the detection of geosmin and geoa gene copies actinobacteria i e including actinomycetes and streptomyces were more dominant in samples collected in winter while concentrations of geosmin started to rise in winter and peaked in spring it could therefore be hypothesised that the production of geosmin by benthic bacteria starts in winter by actinobacteria and is continued or even intensified by the growth of cyanobacteria in spring although the amount of data variability that can be explained by the two calculated pca factors was rather low this study suggests that benthic actinobacteria and cyanobacteria play a significant role in the production of geosmin in the sa l2 reservoir and amount for over a third of the total geosmin concentrations in the water this rather low percentage can be explained by a potential lack of accuracy of the detection method for the geosmin between lod and loq values observed for most of the year survey which can impact the distribution of the data points it can also be explained by potential considerable growth of non geosmin producing actinobacteria and cyanobacteria at times in this case the number of cyanobacteria and actinobacteria would rise substantially while the percentage of this community able to produce geosmin does not concurrently results presented herein suggested an inverse relationship between the concentration of cyanobacteria present in benthic biofilms and key nutrients tkn total nitrogen and total phosphorus a trend which was previously observed gillet et al 2016 nevertheless the regression analyses conducted herein demonstrated a poor correlation between cyanobacterial growth and key nutrient concentrations in the water it is well known that sediments represent a reserve of nutrients for lakes and reservoirs and that a range of bacteria transform organic nutrients within the sediment in what can be characterised as metabolic networks larsen et al 2011 scott et al 2014 benthic nitrogen cycling in particular has been thoroughly investigated due to its impact on environmental eutrophication through natural denitrification and anammox scott et al 2014 it is therefore unlikely for benthic cyanobacteria to be depleted in nitrogen and phosphorus controlling these nutrients in the water as it is sometime attempted by water utilities to reduce pelagic growth would not represent an effective in situ management strategy for benthic cyanobacteria 5 conclusion the sampling device designed during this study worked effectively in the field and provides a new solution for routinely monitoring benthic biofilms substrates used to collect samples need to be incubated for at least 6 8 weeks prior to first sampling in order to allow for the biofilm to colonise the surface and a minimum of 3 replicate samples need to be collected to assess the microbial community adequately although the sampling system worked efficiently it tended to underestimate the proportion of cyanobacteria present in samples some of the qpcr assays designed to track down benthic cyanobacteria and associated production of secondary metabolites presented relatively high loqs nevertheless all assays were validated on environmental samples and permitted an assessment of growth and the seasonal patterns of secondary metabolite production over the course of a one year field survey november 2014 november 2015 in sa l2 reservoir it appeared that benthic biofilms were regulated by a range of grazers and a seasonal peak in growth was observed in spring as a result of this predation the biomass collected was inferior to that observed in the other reservoir and bioremediation could be considered for benthic biofilm management this study highlighted the presence of a confirmed geosmin and cyn producer oxynema accuminatum and of potential stx and mc producers in benthic biofilm in sa l2 reservoir benthic actinobacteria were abundant in winter and likely started the release of geosmin in the water while benthic cyanobacteria participated to the geosmin production actively in spring statistically 35 of the geosmin present in the water column can be directly attributed to a benthic production by actinobacteria and cyanobacteria conflicts of interest all authors listed for this publication hereby attest that none of the participants in this

18332,dissolved organic matter dom in groundwater is fundamentally important with respect to biogeochemical reactions global carbon cycling heavy metal transport water treatability and potability one source of dom to groundwater is from the transport of organic matter from the vadose zone by rainfall recharge changes in precipitation patterns associated with natural climate variability and climate change are expected to alter the load and character of organic matter released from these areas which ultimately impacts on groundwater quality and dom treatability in order to investigate potential changes in groundwater dom character after rainfall recharge we sampled shallow groundwater from a coastal peat rich sand aquifer in new south wales australia during an extended period of low precipitation average daily precipitation rate 1 6 mm day 1 over the 8 months prior to sampling and after two heavy precipitation events 84 mm day 1 and 98 mm day 1 respectively we assess changes in dom composition after correcting for dilution by a novel combination of two advanced analytical techniques liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd and negative ion electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms we also assess changes in water chemistry pre and post rainfall post rainfall we show that the dilution corrected amount of highly aromatic dom molecular formulae i e those categorised into the groups polyphenolics and condensed aromatics were 1 7 and 2 0 times higher respectively than in pre rainfall samples we attribute this to the flushing of peat derived dom from buried organic material into the groundwater we also identify that periods of low precipitation can lead to low hydrophilic hoc ratios in groundwater median 4 9 n 14 redundancy analysis rda was used to compare the hoc fraction with ft icr ms compound groups we show that hoc has a more aromatic character in pre rainfall samples and is less similar to the aromatic groups in post rainfall samples this suggests that the decline in water borne hydrophobics observed post rainfall could be associated with preferential adsorption of the hydrophobic aromatic dom making post rainfall samples less treatable for potable water supply post rainfall we also observe significant increases in arsenic leading to concentrations greater than 3 times the world health organisation drinking water limit of 10 μg l increases in coastal rainfall due to climate change may therefore alter the composition of groundwater dom in coastal peatland areas in ways that may impact dom bioavailability and increase arsenic concentrations reducing the ease of water treatment for human consumption to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to identify the chemical and molecular changes of shallow groundwater dom pre rainfall and post rainfall in a sedimentary organic carbon rich environment through multiple analytical techniques graphical

potentially increasing the load of aromatic dom drained from these areas the composition of this dom may change with an increase in hydrophilic oc to hydrophobic organic carbon hoc ratios in drought conditions previously observed scott et al 1998 tang et al 2013 and attributed to the higher solubility of hydrophilic dom compared to hoc scott et al 1998 this would suggest an increasing difficulty in the treatment of these waters as hydrophilic molecules have been shown to have lower removal rates during water treatment methods compared to hydrophobic compounds jung et al 2017 this could affect dom removal efficiency by treatment methods including coagulation edzwald 1993 and ozonation peter et al 2019 here we aim to investigate the impact of extreme wet and dry conditions on the molecular

liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd to correlate size based dom classes and hydrophobicity with elemental compositions derived from ft icr ms through this combined approach we propose a mechanism for the observed precipitation induced dom compositional shifts previous studies have successfully combined size exclusion chromatography and molecular characterisation techniques

research site is located next to a wetland at samurai beach in anna bay approximately 150 km north of sydney nsw australia fig 1 we installed nine multilevel samplers mlss made from pvc tubing rakhimbekova et al 2018 next to the wetland between may and june 2017 using a hand auger the mlss are between 1 m and 3 m in length and were installed between 0 and 3 m from the wetland edge fig 1

and are located 0 2 m apart with slight offsets to the north and south fig 1 the purpose of the mls installation was to monitor rainfall recharge into the shallow sand aquifer five pre existing groundwater monitoring bores s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 installed in 2011 and a water level logger installed at the wetland in march 2018 were used to determine groundwater hydraulic gradients and flow directions fig 1 figure a 1 and figure a 2 samurai beach sand dunes were formed from holocene marine and aeolian sands that form well drained unstable calcareous sand dunes bell 1997 and form part of the tomaree sandbeds the lithology of the aquifer includes sand deposits peat layers and a clay unit close to the shoreline andersen et al 2012 meredith et al 2019 water is extracted from the tomaree sandbeds in anna bay and treated for potable domestic water supply at a water treatment plant located approximately 1 5 km to the north of the study site three sources of groundwater have been previously identified to the tomaree sandbeds at samurai beach through organic and inorganic chemical studies brügger 2018 meredith et al 2019 these include water input from wetland rainwater and a regional groundwater source wetland and rainwater inputs are potentially the most relevant inputs associated with the mls samples however it is noted that the wetland was largely dry due to antecedent

recorded respectively the first sampling campaign was performed at least six months after mls installation to ensure that sample results were not impacted by any disruption to the natural water sediment interaction processes caused by installation of the mlss limited water extractability in some mlss resulted in our sampling of eight of the nine mlss with fourteen mls ports sampled each trip

concentrations of approximately 35 g l dulaquais et al 2018 can affect lc ocd results due to the formation of hypochlorite by uv irradiation which results in the incomplete oxidation of doc all

ft icr ms may also occur in other isomeric arrangements however since the molecules assigned to ft icr ms peaks describe the underlying molecular compounds of dom the term compound is used when discussing these peaks these compound groups are therefore based on elemental compositions and are not based on compound structural motifs compound groups were classified based on aimod and elemental

residuals versus fitted plots and normal q q plots were checked to ensure constant variance and normality assumptions were met after transformation all statistical analyses and figures were generated using rstudio v 1 1 456 rda was performed using the methods provided in hutchins et al 2017 corrections for the rainfall recharge dilution were performed by averaging the post rainfall chloride concentrations for each sampling port and dividing the post rainfall concentrations by pre rainfall concentrations the pre rainfall dom concentrations were then multiplied by the fraction of chloride remaining in the sample for each port any increase or decrease in concentrations of water chemistry parameters or dom fractions or groups over the values expected due to dilution are reported in the results 3 results and interpretation 3 1 geology and hydrogeology during mls installation it was noted that there was an organic rich peat layer at approximately 0 2 m below ground surface bgs at mlsa on the wetland edge this organic rich layer increased in depth with distance from the wetland suggesting buried peat layers in the area during the mls installation clusters of organic material were observed intermittently through the sand the oc content in these regions was up to 48 5 1 compared to sandy regions which were as low as 0 1 1 oc the δ 13cdoc values of the low oc 10 sandy sediment was as high as 7 3 whilst the maximum δ 13cdoc values of the high oc 10 sediment was 28 2 table a 1 the hydraulic gradient between the wetland and s1 is variable with a predominant long term average gradient and groundwater flow direction from the wetland to the dunes the average hydraulic conductivity of the upper sandy aquifer has previously been measured using a hydraulic profiling tool hpt inserted using a geoprobe 7822 dt drill rig to approximately 16 m day andersen et al 2012 brügger 2018 using this value and the monitoring of absolute groundwater levels in s1 lat 32 76 long 152 12 and in the wetland lat 32 76 long 152 12 the average darcy velocity during the period of sampling was calculated as 0 031 m day the negative velocity indicates a reversal in flow from the long term average to a flow direction running from the dunes to the wetland assuming an effective porosity of 0 3 the water flowed a lateral distance of 1 3 m from the dunes to the wetland between the date of wetland water logger installation march 15 2018 and the final sampling trip march 28 2018 this indicates that groundwater travelled almost half of the total distance of the mls transect in one week during sampling pre rainfall samples therefore comprised a mix of water from both the dunes and the wetland with post rainfall samples comprising a mix of water originating from the dunes wetland and rainfall recharge the change in water level at well s1 pre and post rainfall events was used to estimate the approximate volume of rainfall recharging the aquifer post rainfall water levels at s1 rose approximately 0 25 m during the heavy precipitation events on the 26th february 2018 and 22nd march 2018 84 mm and 99 mm of rainfall respectively this indicates that approximately 41 of the total rain volume recharged the aquifer and mixed with groundwater from the wetland and dunes brügger 2018 this is supported by stable water isotopes figure a 3 table a 1 which show that pre rainfall samples are more enriched δ18o average 2 88 0 11 1 σ δ2h average 10 17 0 76 1 σ n 3 than post rainfall δ18o average 3 33 0 54 1 σ δ2h average 14 70 2 33 1 σ n 24 these values indicate that precipitation events have resulted in fluxes of water that has previously experienced partial evaporation on or close to the surface 3 2 groundwater chemistry the results show that there is a significant decline in the median non dilution corrected concentration of cl p 2 35 x 10 3 zn p 1 82 x 10 2 mn p 2 97x10 2 ec p 1 26 x 10 2 k p 3 73 x 10 5 and na p 5 22 x 10 4 in the post rainfall samples compared to pre rainfall samples table 1 which can largely be attributed to the input of fresh rainfall recharge we note an increase in median as p 4 72 x 10 5 and a n nh4 p 1 73 x 10 2 concentrations post rainfall table 1 pre rainfall data reveals a significant negative correlation between hoc and as concentrations p 2 02 x 10 2 which is not observed post rainfall this has important implications for water treatment and interpretation of these findings are explored in further detail in section 5 the increase in n nh4 is positively correlated with doc concentration p 3 32 x 10 2 and p 1 51 x 10 2 pre and post rainfall respectively suggesting that the increase in n nh4 post rainfall may be associated with desorption from dom or aquifer minerals maier 2015 changes in the median values of co u n no3 po4 and so4 post rainfall were not assessed as both the pre and post rainfall median concentrations were below the limit of detection lod lowest concentration of a substance that can be reliably reported using a specific laboratory method and instrument there were no significant increases in pre and post rainfall in other ions table 1 when not corrected for dilution average cl concentrations in the pre rainfall samples are 38 01 2 83 mg l 1 σ the change in average cl concentrations at each sampling port from pre rainfall to post rainfall ranged from between 0 15 and 58 00 average 26 96 10 31 95 ci with a significant median decline of 29 5 p 2 53 x 10 3 as noted above we assume here that cl does not undergo any geochemical reactions in the aquifer since the groundwater is fresh as cl is present in very low concentrations 0 2 mg l in rainwater thomas et al 2007 the change in cl concentrations at each port between pre and post rainfall sampling trips were used to quantify the extent of dilution expected for water chemistry parameters table 1 and concentrations of lc ocd fractions and ft icr ms groups at each sampling port caused by rainfall recharge table 2 after correction for dilution concentrations of n nh4 p as ca mg si sr and ni are shown to significantly increase post rainfall table 1 we suggest that these increases in n nh4 p and as may be a result of desorption from sedimentary organic matter or aquifer minerals guppy et al 2005 bauer and blodau 2006 maier 2015 there also appears to be dissolution of carbonate derived elements as evidenced by the increase in ca mg si and sr post rainfall after correcting for dilution table 1 an increase in ni is observed after dilution correction however we do not identify any correlation between ni and hydrophobicity or doc concentration p 0 05 we do not observe increases in any other nom related metals including co cr or cu and all occur at low median concentrations in pre and post rainfall data 0 4 μg l table 1 3 3 dilution corrected change in dom variables the predicted median post rainfall doc concentration using the change in cl as a correction factor was 4 6 mg l similar to the observed median concentration table 2 the range of minimum and maximum doc concentration values increased from 5 8 mg l pre rainfall min 4 79 mg l max 10 55 mg l to 8 1 mg l post rainfall min 1 51 mg l max 9 79 mg l standard deviation increased from 1 8 mg l to 2 2 mg l suggesting some mls ports are more affected by dilution than others hoc is the only lc ocd fraction significantly lower in post rainfall concentrations after correction for dilution p 1 01 x 10 4 table 2 the ionization process and high resolution of ft icr ms produces molecular ions from all species in the sample that can be assigned a molecular formula within specific chemical classes and peak intensity enables semi quantitation of these classes here we observe a significant increase in the median number of polyphenolics p 2 61 x 10 5 condensed aromatics p 4 53 x 10 5 and highly unsaturated and phenolics p 3 10 x 10 2 compared to predicted levels after correction for dilution table 2 3 4 lc ocd fractions and ft icr ms compound group relative abundances in pre rainfall lc ocd samples the hs fraction comprised the largest lc ocd fraction of dom followed by hoc fig 2 post rainfall hs remained the largest lc ocd fraction however hoc became the least abundant after bp fig 2 we attribute increases in percent relative abundance ra of hs bp and lmwn largely to the decrease in ra hoc we observe a significant decline in both concentration and ra of hoc after rainfall recharge from a median concentration of 1 172 0 μg l to 79 8 μg l p 1 01 x 10 4 and a median ra decline from 17 0 to 1 1 p 1 176 x 10 6 for both pre and post rainfall recharge the largest proportion of ft icr ms formulae were identified as belonging to the highly unsaturated and phenolic group followed by the polyphenolic group fig 2 there was a significant increase in the ra and number of formulae of condensed aromatics p 1 06 x 10 3 and p 4 49 x 10 3 respectively and polyphenolics p 1 20 x 10 4 and p 1 19 x 10 3 respectively the median ra of aliphatics significantly declined p 1 13 x 10 2 however the number of aliphatic formulae did not significantly decline p 4 99 x 10 2 table 2 suggesting the decline in ra is due to the increase in ra of condensed aromatics and polyphenolics 3 5 changes in dom molecular properties weighted median h c organic matter elemental ratios declined significantly post rainfall p 2 31 x 10 4 fig 3 whilst median o c ratios increased significantly p 2 00 x 10 03 fig 3 post rainfall median weighted nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc also increased from 0 06 to 0 16 p 5 41 x 10 4 post rainfall median weighted double bond equivalents dbe increased from 11 09 to 11 91 p 4 81 x 10 4 median weighted aimod increased from 0 35 to 0 39 p 1 79 x 10 4 and median weighted mass of the samples increases from 474 96 to 481 44 p 4 76 x 10 3 fig 3 these changes indicate that dom became larger and more aromatic in character after rainfall recharge 3 6 changes in hoc lc ocd data shows significant changes in the hoc and bp fractions table 2 this assessment however focuses on the changes in hoc as the bp fraction represents 2 of the total dom composition pre rainfall hoc is positively correlated with nosc and o c ratios p 2 23 x 10 2 and p 1 63 x 10 2 and negatively correlated with numbers of ft icr ms formulae identified p 2 67 x 10 3 post rainfall hoc is negatively correlated with nosc p 2 26 x 10 3 aimod p 3 83 x 10 3 dbe p 3 30 x 10 3 and mass p 8 26 x 10 3 redundancy analysis rda can be used to explain one dataset using another dataset in this analysis we compare lc ocd fractions with ft icr ms groups and specifically look at changes in hoc the rda results show that hoc in the shallow aquifer at anna bay is associated with different molecular groups pre rainfall recharge compared to post rainfall pre rainfall the rda shows that hoc is most closely associated with condensed aromatics and polyphenolics fig 4 table a 2 this is also supported by a significant positive relationship between hoc ra and polyphenolics ra p 4 99 x 10 3 and condensed aromatics ra p 1 12 x 10 2 pre rainfall there is also a significant negative relationship between hoc ra and highly unsaturated and phenolics ra p 1 21 x 10 2 and aliphatics ra p 2 48x10 4 interestingly the redundancy analysis fig 4b table a 2 shows hoc is most strongly correlated with these two ft icr ms groups and least correlated with condensed aromatics and polyphenolics post rainfall these observations are also reflected in simple linear models of post rainfall data which show negative correlations between hoc ra and polyphenolic ra p 1 17 x 10 2 and ra aromatics p 9 78 x 10 3 and positive correlations with ra highly unsaturated and phenolics p 2 05 x 10 3 and ra aliphatics p 7 87 x 10 4 4 discussion coastal peatlands are significant stores of carbon however changes in precipitation regimes are likely to alter coastal peatland carbon dynamics and inorganic chemistry many people rely on coastal aquifers for fresh drinking water domestic water supply irrigation water and water for industry ferguson and gleeson 2012 small and nicholls 2003 water supply however can be impacted by high amounts of dom and inorganic ions exported from these coastal peatlands which subsequently requires removal via water treatment processes the ease and cost of water treatment is largely dependent upon the character and the amount of dom fabris et al 2003 and inorganic contaminants present in source water to date it has been unclear how changing precipitation regimes may affect the quality of groundwater in coastal peatlands our results indicate that extreme rainfall events will cause the character of groundwater dom in peat rich sandy aquifers to shift to that of a more aromatic nature due to leaching from peat layers this is probably attributed to physicochemical sorption equilibria mechanisms after dilution qualls and richardson 2003 the movement of water from the dunes to the wetland indicates that this highly aromatic dom probably originates from peat leachate either from peat layers in the dune area or peat located in the shallow aquifer sampling area fig 5 these findings indicate that prolonged drying events followed by extreme rainfall events expected in the future may flush previously stored aromatic dom into groundwater where it is available to be processed or exported in some mls sample ports however the amount of dilution appears to be restricted suggesting that low permeability in some areas is limiting the exchange of water and solutes between peat pore water and rainfall recharge in these locations rezanezhad et al 2016 the extent of aromatic dom flushed into groundwater in peatlands after rainfall events therefore appears to be directly related to the permeability of the peat this suggests that shallower less compact peat layers may play a larger role in the flushing of aromatic dom into groundwater as with aromaticity the hydrophobicity of groundwater om in peatland environments is also highly variable and impacted by changes in rainfall broder et al 2017 scott et al 1998 tang et al 2013 rda shows that hoc is associated with more aromatic groups pre rainfall and less aromatic groups post rainfall fig 4 table a 2 linear modelling shows that in pre rainfall samples hoc is positively correlated with nosc compounds with high nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc are more thermodynamically favourable to oxidise and thus associated with more bioavailable dom keiluweit et al 2016 particularly in environments low in energetic electron acceptors i e oxygen and nitrate such as anna bay table a 1 research shows that aromatics with high nosc are targeted first by microbes in anaerobic environments pracht et al 2018 the positive correlation between hoc and nosc and the observation of high hoc which the rda shows is associated with aromatic unprocessed om indicates that hoc in pre rainfall samples is likely the result of a steady accumulation of hoc sourced from buried peat that has evaded biodegradation fig 5 the observation of high hoc in pre rainfall samples and declining hoc in post rainfall samples contrasts with research which indicates that higher hydrophilic oc hoc ratios should be observed in dry conditions due to the fact that hydrophilics desorb from mineral surfaces quickly compared to hoc scott et al 1998 tang et al 2013 in high ionic strength solutions research has shown that dom forms coils that concentrate hydrophobic domains in the centre pedersen et al 1999 this leads to less exposure of the hydrophobic adsorption points which we propose results in the accumulation of the more aromatic hoc observed in the pre rainfall rda fig 4 the decrease in ionic strength post rainfall likely resulted in sorption of these aromatic hydrophobics as indicated by the rda by causing the om molecules to uncoil previous studies have also observed the preferential adsorption of higher molecular mass more aromatic hoc filella 2006 jardine et al 1989 kaiser et al 1996 kaiser and zech 1997 particularly in high oc environments such as at anna bay our results show significant increases in groundwater as post rainfall previous research has shown that dom can mobilise as from sediments due to competitive sorption bauer and blodau 2006 this mechanism is supported by a significant negative correlation between as and hoc in pre rainfall samples p 2 02 x 10 2 the lack of correlation between as and hoc post rainfall p 7 68 x 10 2 could be attributed to the almost complete removal of hoc from solution and the flushing of desorbed as through the system during rainfall events other mechanisms for as release include pyrite oxidation and fe oxide dissolution however we do not observe an increase in fe in solution table 1 post rainfall there is no correlation observed between fe and as observed pre or post rainfall and there is no increase in so4 table 1 or decrease in ph p 0 05 which would be expected to be associated with pyrite oxidation appelo and postma 2005 our results show a median as concentration increase of 47 post rainfall leading to concentrations greater than 3 times the world health organisation who guideline value of 10 μg l for drinking water this research shows that extreme rainfall events may increase the export of inorganic and organic contaminants such as hydrophilic dom and as from coastal peatland groundwaters heavy rainfall events following prolonged dry periods may result in the requirement for more rigorous water treatment to meet drinking water quality guidelines increased hydrophilic dom in groundwater in high sedimentary oc environments will result in increasing difficulty to treat due to the low removal efficiency of hydrophilic dom during water treatment processes alexander et al 2012 edzwald 1993 matilainen et al 2010 peter et al 2019 and due to the increased formation potential of haloacetic acids a harmful disinfectant by product during bio treatment as a result of hydrophilic compounds bond et al 2009 we note that as the changes observed appear to be largely driven by dom sourced from sedimentary oc these findings are likely specific to coastal wetland environments which exceed an area of 1 64 106 km2 globally davidson and finlayson 2018 further research would also benefit from an assessment of the changes to groundwater chemistry and dom pre and post rainfall in low sedimentary oc coastal environments 5 conclusions lc ocd and ft icr ms techniques were used to investigate the changes to dom character specifically associated with extreme rainfall events following drought conditions the work highlights the benefit of using multiple dom characterisation techniques to understand dom character sources and processing the results show that dom amount and character in coastal peatlands is highly dynamic and depends largely on hydrologic regimes dom sources and dom processing mechanisms this research confirms the hypothesis that rainfall events after dry conditions result in the leaching of sedimentary oc and changes the groundwater dom character in these environments the findings suggest that under the more extreme rainfall conditions anticipated in the future wasko and sharma 2017 leaching of peat after heavy rainfall events could increase as concentrations and change the character of dom increasing its hydrophilic hoc ratio due to sorption of aromatic hoc this will make groundwater in these areas more difficult and expensive to treat in the future alexander et al 2012 bond et al 2009 author contributions l k m

18332,dissolved organic matter dom in groundwater is fundamentally important with respect to biogeochemical reactions global carbon cycling heavy metal transport water treatability and potability one source of dom to groundwater is from the transport of organic matter from the vadose zone by rainfall recharge changes in precipitation patterns associated with natural climate variability and climate change are expected to alter the load and character of organic matter released from these areas which ultimately impacts on groundwater quality and dom treatability in order to investigate potential changes in groundwater dom character after rainfall recharge we sampled shallow groundwater from a coastal peat rich sand aquifer in new south wales australia during an extended period of low precipitation average daily precipitation rate 1 6 mm day 1 over the 8 months prior to sampling and after two heavy precipitation events 84 mm day 1 and 98 mm day 1 respectively we assess changes in dom composition after correcting for dilution by a novel combination of two advanced analytical techniques liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd and negative ion electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms we also assess changes in water chemistry pre and post rainfall post rainfall we show that the dilution corrected amount of highly aromatic dom molecular formulae i e those categorised into the groups polyphenolics and condensed aromatics were 1 7 and 2 0 times higher respectively than in pre rainfall samples we attribute this to the flushing of peat derived dom from buried organic material into the groundwater we also identify that periods of low precipitation can lead to low hydrophilic hoc ratios in groundwater median 4 9 n 14 redundancy analysis rda was used to compare the hoc fraction with ft icr ms compound groups we show that hoc has a more aromatic character in pre rainfall samples and is less similar to the aromatic groups in post rainfall samples this suggests that the decline in water borne hydrophobics observed post rainfall could be associated with preferential adsorption of the hydrophobic aromatic dom making post rainfall samples less treatable for potable water supply post rainfall we also observe significant increases in arsenic leading to concentrations greater than 3 times the world health organisation drinking water limit of 10 μg l increases in coastal rainfall due to climate change may therefore alter the composition of groundwater dom in coastal peatland areas in ways that may impact dom bioavailability and increase arsenic concentrations reducing the ease of water treatment for human consumption to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to identify the chemical and molecular changes of shallow groundwater dom pre rainfall and post rainfall in a sedimentary organic carbon rich environment through multiple analytical techniques graphical

rogers et al 2019 surface water and shallow groundwater doc concentrations are often highest in dry seasons due to evapotranspirative concentration and decline after dilution by low doc recharge such as snowmelt or precipitation dalva and moore 1991 however research has shown that doc concentration aromaticity and hydrophobicity in peat environments are highly variable broder et al 2017 scott et al 1998 tang et al 2013 in sedimentary environments high in organic carbon oc heavy rainfall events can cause the flushing of aromatic dom into groundwater broder et al 2017 luzius et al 2018 potentially increasing the load of aromatic dom drained from these areas the composition of this dom may change with an increase in hydrophilic oc to hydrophobic organic carbon hoc ratios in drought conditions previously observed scott et al 1998 tang et al 2013 and attributed to the higher solubility of hydrophilic dom compared to hoc scott et al 1998 this would suggest an increasing difficulty in the treatment of these waters as hydrophilic molecules have been shown to have lower removal rates during water treatment methods compared to hydrophobic compounds jung et al 2017 this could affect dom removal efficiency by treatment methods including coagulation edzwald 1993 and ozonation peter et al 2019 here we aim to investigate the impact of extreme wet and dry conditions on the molecular composition and reactivity of dom in a high sedimentary oc coastal peatland environment we compare qualitative molecular level characterization of dom isolated before and after major precipitation events in a coastal peatland in anna bay new south wales nsw australia based on negative ion electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms we apply liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd to correlate size based dom classes and hydrophobicity with elemental compositions derived from ft icr ms through this combined approach we propose a mechanism for the observed precipitation induced dom compositional shifts previous studies have successfully combined size exclusion chromatography and molecular characterisation techniques to characterise dom along a soil stream river continuum hutchins et al 2017 as well as in marine riverine and arctic environments bodmer et al 2016 chen et al 2016 he et al 2016 retelletti brogi et al

research site is located next to a wetland at samurai beach in anna bay approximately 150 km north of sydney nsw australia fig 1 we installed nine multilevel samplers mlss made from pvc tubing rakhimbekova et al 2018 next to the wetland between may and june 2017 using a hand auger the mlss are between 1 m and 3 m in length and were installed between 0 and 3 m from the wetland edge fig 1

and are located 0 2 m apart with slight offsets to the north and south fig 1 the purpose of the mls installation was to monitor rainfall recharge into the shallow sand aquifer five pre existing groundwater monitoring bores s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 installed in 2011 and a water level logger installed at the wetland in march 2018 were used to determine groundwater hydraulic gradients and flow directions fig 1 figure a 1 and figure a 2 samurai beach sand dunes were formed from holocene marine and aeolian sands that form well drained unstable calcareous sand dunes bell 1997 and form part of the tomaree sandbeds the lithology of the aquifer includes sand deposits peat layers and a clay unit close to the shoreline andersen et al 2012 meredith et al 2019 water is extracted from the tomaree sandbeds in anna bay and treated for potable domestic water supply at a water treatment plant located approximately 1 5 km to the north of the study site three sources of groundwater have been previously identified to the tomaree sandbeds at samurai beach through organic and inorganic chemical studies brügger 2018 meredith et al 2019 these include water input from wetland rainwater and a regional groundwater source wetland and rainwater inputs are potentially the most relevant inputs associated with the mls samples however it is noted that the wetland was largely dry due to antecedent

recorded respectively the first sampling campaign was performed at least six months after mls installation to ensure that sample results were not impacted by any disruption to the natural water

ft icr ms may also occur in other isomeric arrangements however since the molecules assigned to ft icr ms peaks describe the underlying molecular compounds of dom the term compound is used when discussing these peaks these compound groups are therefore based on elemental compositions and are not based on compound structural motifs compound groups were classified based on aimod and elemental

on the wetland edge this organic rich layer increased in depth with distance from the wetland suggesting buried peat layers in the area during the mls installation clusters of organic material were observed intermittently through the sand the oc content in these regions was up to 48 5 1 compared to sandy regions which were as low as 0 1 1 oc the δ 13cdoc values of the low oc 10 sandy sediment

and in the wetland lat 32 76 long 152 12 the average darcy velocity during the period of sampling was calculated as 0 031 m day the negative velocity indicates a reversal in flow from the long term average to a flow direction running from the dunes to the wetland assuming an effective porosity of 0 3 the water flowed a lateral distance of 1 3 m from the dunes to the wetland between the date of wetland water logger installation march 15 2018 and the final sampling trip march 28 2018 this indicates that groundwater travelled almost half of the total distance of the mls transect in one week during sampling pre rainfall samples therefore comprised a mix of water from both the dunes and the wetland with post rainfall samples comprising a mix of water originating from the dunes wetland and rainfall recharge the change in water level at well s1 pre and post rainfall events was used to estimate the approximate volume of rainfall recharging the aquifer post rainfall water levels at s1 rose approximately 0 25 m during the heavy precipitation events on the 26th february 2018 and 22nd march 2018 84 mm and 99 mm of rainfall respectively this indicates that approximately 41 of the total rain volume recharged the aquifer and mixed with groundwater from the wetland and dunes brügger 2018 this is supported by stable water isotopes figure a 3 table a 1 which show that pre rainfall samples are more enriched δ18o average 2 88 0 11 1 σ δ2h average 10 17 0 76 1 σ n 3 than post rainfall δ18o average 3 33 0 54 1 σ δ2h average 14 70 2 33 1 σ n 24 these values indicate that precipitation events have resulted in fluxes of water that has previously experienced partial evaporation on or close to the surface 3 2 groundwater chemistry the results show that there is a significant decline in the median non dilution corrected concentration of cl p 2 35 x 10 3 zn p 1 82 x 10 2 mn p 2 97x10 2 ec p 1 26 x 10 2 k p 3 73 x 10 5 and na p 5 22 x 10 4 in the post rainfall samples compared to pre rainfall samples table 1 which can largely be attributed to the input of fresh rainfall recharge we note an increase in median as p 4 72 x 10 5 and a n nh4 p 1 73 x 10 2 concentrations post rainfall table 1 pre rainfall data reveals a significant negative correlation between hoc and as concentrations p 2 02 x 10 2 which is not observed post rainfall this has important implications for water treatment and interpretation of these findings are explored in further detail in section 5 the increase in n nh4 is positively correlated with doc concentration p 3 32 x 10 2 and p 1 51 x 10 2 pre and post rainfall respectively suggesting that the increase in n nh4 post rainfall may be associated with desorption from dom or aquifer minerals maier 2015 changes in the median values of co u n no3 po4 and so4 post rainfall were not assessed as both the pre and post rainfall median concentrations were below the limit of detection lod lowest concentration of a substance that can be reliably reported using a specific laboratory method and instrument there were no significant increases in pre and post rainfall in other ions table 1 when not corrected for dilution average cl concentrations in the pre rainfall samples are 38 01 2 83 mg l 1 σ the change in average cl concentrations at each sampling port from pre rainfall to post rainfall ranged from between 0 15 and 58 00 average 26 96 10 31 95 ci with a significant median decline of 29 5 p 2 53 x 10 3 as noted above we assume here that cl does not undergo any geochemical reactions in the aquifer since the groundwater is fresh as cl is present in very low concentrations 0 2 mg l in rainwater thomas et al 2007 the change in cl concentrations at each port between pre and post rainfall sampling trips were used to quantify the extent of dilution expected for water chemistry parameters table 1 and concentrations of lc ocd fractions and ft icr ms groups at each sampling port caused by rainfall recharge table 2 after correction for dilution concentrations of n nh4 p as ca mg si sr and ni are shown to significantly increase post rainfall table 1 we suggest that these increases in n nh4 p and as may be a result of desorption from sedimentary organic matter or aquifer minerals guppy et al 2005 bauer and blodau 2006 maier 2015 there also appears to be dissolution of carbonate derived elements as evidenced by the increase in ca mg si and sr post rainfall after correcting for dilution table 1 an increase in ni is observed after dilution correction however we do not identify any correlation between ni and hydrophobicity or doc concentration p 0 05 we do not observe increases in any other nom related metals including co cr or cu and all occur at low median concentrations in pre and post rainfall data 0 4 μg l table 1 3 3 dilution corrected change in dom variables the predicted median post rainfall doc concentration using the change in cl as a correction factor was 4 6 mg l similar to the observed median concentration table 2 the range of minimum and maximum doc concentration values increased from 5 8 mg l pre rainfall min 4 79 mg l max 10 55 mg l to 8 1 mg l post rainfall min 1 51 mg l max 9 79 mg l standard deviation increased from 1 8 mg l to 2 2 mg l suggesting some mls ports are more affected by dilution than others hoc is the only lc ocd fraction significantly lower in post rainfall concentrations after correction for dilution p 1 01 x 10 4 table 2 the ionization process and high resolution of ft icr ms produces molecular ions from all species in the sample that can be assigned a molecular formula within specific chemical classes and peak intensity enables semi quantitation of these classes here we observe a significant increase in the median number of polyphenolics p 2 61 x 10 5 condensed aromatics p 4 53 x 10 5 and highly unsaturated and phenolics p 3 10 x 10 2 compared to predicted levels after correction for dilution table 2 3 4 lc ocd fractions and ft icr ms compound group relative abundances in pre rainfall lc ocd samples the hs fraction comprised the largest lc ocd fraction of dom followed by hoc fig 2 post rainfall hs remained the largest lc ocd fraction however hoc became the least abundant after bp fig 2 we attribute increases in percent relative abundance ra of hs bp and lmwn largely to the decrease in ra hoc we observe a significant decline in both concentration and ra of hoc after rainfall recharge from a median concentration of 1 172 0 μg l to 79 8 μg l p 1 01 x 10 4 and a median ra decline from 17 0 to 1 1 p 1 176 x 10 6 for both pre and post rainfall recharge the largest proportion of ft icr ms formulae were identified as belonging to the highly unsaturated and phenolic group followed by the polyphenolic group fig 2 there was a significant increase in the ra and number of formulae of condensed aromatics p 1 06 x 10 3 and p 4 49 x 10 3 respectively and polyphenolics p 1 20 x 10 4 and p 1 19 x 10 3 respectively the median ra of aliphatics significantly declined p 1 13 x 10 2 however the number of aliphatic formulae did not significantly decline p 4 99 x 10 2 table 2 suggesting the decline in ra is due to the increase in ra of condensed aromatics and polyphenolics 3 5 changes in dom molecular properties weighted median h c organic matter elemental ratios declined significantly post rainfall p 2 31 x 10 4 fig 3 whilst median o c ratios increased significantly p 2 00 x 10 03 fig 3 post rainfall median weighted nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc also increased from 0 06 to 0 16 p 5 41 x 10 4 post rainfall median weighted double bond equivalents dbe increased from 11 09 to 11 91 p 4 81 x 10 4 median weighted aimod increased from 0 35 to 0 39 p 1 79 x 10 4 and median weighted mass of the samples increases from 474 96 to 481 44 p 4 76 x 10 3 fig 3 these changes indicate that dom became larger and more aromatic in character after rainfall recharge 3 6 changes in hoc lc ocd data shows significant changes in the hoc and bp fractions table 2 this assessment however focuses on the changes in hoc as the bp fraction represents 2 of the total dom composition pre rainfall hoc is positively correlated with nosc and o c ratios p 2 23 x 10 2 and p 1 63 x 10 2 and negatively correlated with numbers of ft icr ms formulae identified p 2 67 x 10 3 post rainfall hoc is negatively correlated with nosc p 2 26 x 10 3 aimod p 3 83 x 10 3 dbe p 3 30 x 10 3 and mass p 8 26 x 10 3 redundancy analysis rda can be used to explain one dataset using another dataset in this analysis we compare lc ocd fractions with ft icr ms groups and specifically look at changes in hoc the rda results show that hoc in the shallow aquifer at anna bay is associated with different molecular groups pre rainfall recharge compared to post rainfall pre rainfall the rda shows that hoc is most closely associated with condensed aromatics and polyphenolics fig 4 table a 2 this is also supported by a significant positive relationship between hoc ra and polyphenolics ra p 4 99 x 10 3 and condensed aromatics ra p 1 12 x 10 2 pre rainfall there is also a significant negative relationship between hoc ra and highly unsaturated and phenolics ra p 1 21 x 10 2 and aliphatics ra p 2 48x10 4 interestingly the redundancy analysis fig 4b table a 2 shows hoc is most strongly correlated with these two ft icr ms groups and least correlated with condensed aromatics and polyphenolics post rainfall these observations are also reflected in simple linear models of post rainfall data which show negative correlations between hoc ra and polyphenolic ra p 1 17 x 10 2 and ra aromatics p 9 78 x 10 3 and positive correlations with ra highly unsaturated and phenolics p 2 05 x 10 3 and ra aliphatics p 7 87 x 10 4 4 discussion coastal peatlands are significant stores of carbon however changes in precipitation regimes are likely to alter coastal peatland carbon dynamics and inorganic chemistry many people rely on coastal aquifers for fresh drinking water domestic water supply irrigation water and water for industry ferguson and gleeson 2012 small and nicholls 2003 water supply however can be impacted by high amounts of dom and inorganic ions exported from these coastal peatlands which subsequently requires removal via water treatment processes the ease and cost of water treatment is largely dependent upon the character and the amount of dom fabris et al 2003 and inorganic contaminants present in source water to date it has been unclear how changing precipitation regimes may affect the quality of groundwater in coastal peatlands our results indicate that extreme rainfall events will cause the character of groundwater dom in peat rich sandy aquifers to shift to that of a more aromatic nature due to leaching from peat layers this is probably attributed to physicochemical sorption equilibria mechanisms after dilution qualls and richardson 2003 the movement of water from the dunes to the wetland indicates that this highly aromatic dom probably originates from peat leachate either from peat layers in the dune area or peat located in the shallow aquifer sampling area fig 5 these findings indicate that prolonged drying events followed by extreme rainfall events expected in the future may flush previously stored aromatic dom into groundwater where it is available to be processed or exported in some mls sample ports however the amount of dilution appears to be restricted suggesting that low permeability in some areas is limiting the exchange of water and solutes between peat pore water and rainfall recharge in these locations rezanezhad et al 2016 the extent of aromatic dom flushed into groundwater in peatlands after rainfall events therefore appears to be directly related to the permeability of the peat this suggests that shallower less compact peat layers may play a larger role in the flushing of aromatic dom into groundwater as with aromaticity the hydrophobicity of groundwater om in peatland environments is also highly variable and impacted by changes in rainfall broder et al 2017 scott et al 1998 tang et al 2013 rda shows that hoc is associated with more aromatic groups pre rainfall and less aromatic groups post rainfall fig 4 table a 2 linear modelling shows that in pre rainfall samples hoc is positively correlated with nosc compounds with high nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc are more thermodynamically favourable to oxidise and thus associated with more bioavailable dom keiluweit et al 2016 particularly in environments low in energetic electron acceptors i e oxygen and nitrate such as anna bay table a 1 research shows that aromatics with high nosc are targeted first by microbes in anaerobic environments pracht et al 2018 the positive correlation between hoc and nosc and the observation of high hoc which the rda shows is associated with aromatic unprocessed om indicates that hoc in pre rainfall samples is likely the result of a steady accumulation of hoc sourced from buried peat that has evaded biodegradation fig 5 the observation of high hoc in pre rainfall samples and declining hoc in post rainfall samples contrasts with research which indicates that higher hydrophilic oc hoc ratios should be observed in dry conditions due to the fact that hydrophilics desorb from mineral surfaces quickly compared to hoc scott et al 1998 tang et al 2013 in high ionic strength solutions research has shown that dom forms coils that concentrate hydrophobic domains in the centre pedersen et al 1999 this leads to less exposure of the hydrophobic adsorption points which we propose results in the accumulation of the more aromatic hoc observed in the pre rainfall rda fig 4 the decrease in ionic strength post rainfall likely resulted in sorption of these aromatic hydrophobics as indicated by the rda by causing the om molecules to uncoil previous studies have also observed the preferential adsorption of higher molecular mass more aromatic hoc filella 2006 jardine et al 1989 kaiser et al 1996 kaiser and zech 1997 particularly in high oc environments such as at anna bay our results show significant increases in groundwater as post rainfall previous research has shown that dom can mobilise as from sediments due to competitive sorption bauer and blodau 2006 this mechanism is supported by a significant negative correlation between as and hoc in pre rainfall samples p 2 02 x 10 2 the lack of correlation between as and hoc post rainfall p 7 68 x 10 2 could be attributed to the almost complete removal of hoc from solution and the flushing of desorbed as through the system during rainfall events other mechanisms for as release include pyrite oxidation and fe oxide dissolution however we do not observe an increase in fe in solution table 1 post rainfall there is no correlation observed between fe and as observed pre or post rainfall and there is no increase in so4 table 1 or decrease in ph p 0 05 which would be expected to be associated with pyrite oxidation appelo and postma 2005 our results show a median as concentration increase of 47 post rainfall leading to concentrations greater than 3 times the world health organisation who guideline value of 10 μg l for drinking water this research shows that extreme rainfall events may increase the export of inorganic and organic contaminants such as hydrophilic dom and as from coastal peatland groundwaters heavy rainfall events following prolonged dry periods may result in the requirement for more rigorous water treatment to meet drinking water quality guidelines increased hydrophilic dom in groundwater in high sedimentary oc environments will result in increasing difficulty to treat due to the low removal efficiency of hydrophilic dom during water treatment processes alexander et al 2012 edzwald 1993 matilainen et al 2010 peter et al 2019 and due to the increased formation potential of haloacetic acids a harmful disinfectant by product during bio treatment as a result of hydrophilic compounds bond et al 2009 we note that as the changes observed appear to be largely driven by dom sourced from sedimentary oc these findings are likely specific to coastal wetland environments which exceed an area of 1 64 106 km2 globally davidson and finlayson 2018 further research would also benefit from an assessment of the changes to groundwater chemistry and dom pre and post rainfall in low sedimentary oc coastal environments 5 conclusions lc ocd and ft icr ms techniques were used to investigate the changes to dom character specifically associated with extreme rainfall events following drought conditions the work highlights the benefit of using multiple dom characterisation techniques to understand dom character sources and processing the results show that dom amount and character in coastal peatlands is highly dynamic and depends largely on hydrologic regimes dom sources and dom processing mechanisms this research confirms the hypothesis that rainfall events after dry conditions result in the leaching of sedimentary oc and changes the groundwater dom character in these environments the findings suggest that under the more extreme rainfall conditions anticipated in the future wasko and sharma 2017 leaching of peat after heavy rainfall events could increase as concentrations and change the character of dom increasing its hydrophilic hoc ratio due to sorption of aromatic hoc this will make groundwater in these areas more difficult and expensive to treat in the future alexander et al 2012 bond et al 2009 author contributions l k m

18333,enhancing biogas production while avoiding inhibition of methanogenesis during co digestion of grease interceptor waste giw can help water resource recovery facilities reduce their carbon footprint here we used pre adapted and non adapted digesters to link microbial community structure to digester function before disturbance the pre adapted and non adapted digesters showed similar methane production and microbial community diversity but dissimilar community composition when exposed to an identical disturbance the pre adapted digester achieved better performance while the non adapted digester was inhibited when re exposed to disturbance after recovery communities and performance of both digesters converged regardless of the temporal variations co digestion of up to 75 giw added on a volatile solids vs basis was achieved increasing methane yield by 336 from 0 180 to 0 785 l methane g vs added the highest methane yield reported to date for lipid rich waste progressive

in a potentially cost effective way giw consists of the entire contents of a grease interceptor gi including fat oil and grease fog food solids and associated wastewater wang et al 2013 a key question in giw co digestion is how to substantially increase biogas production while avoiding overloading with giw and inhibition of methanogenesis major metabolic processes in anaerobic digestion including hydrolysis acidogenesis fermentation acetogenesis and methanogenesis are carried out by different consortia of microbes with distinct ecological roles when treating high strength lipid waste one major challenge is to ensure efficient degradation of intermediates such as long chain fatty acids lcfas acetate propionate and butyrate excessive substrate input can lead to accumulation of these intermediates and decreases in ph high levels of lcfa can also lead to inhibition of substrate and product transport damage to cell membrane increased lag phase of methane production loss of

fog l day no general conclusion can be drawn based on empirical limitations of fog addition especially at olrs of fog higher than 1 3 g vs fog l day where the performance profiles differed markedly even at the same fog loading rate the limit of fog co digestion threshold of fog loading rate that can be achieved without process upset appears to vary depending on the sources of inoculum base substrate and co substrate temperature solids retention time srt and mixing intensity results from a study of co digestion between sewage sludge and carbon rich beverage waste showed that there was an olr threshold where the function and resilience of the anaerobic microbiomes could be maintained nguyen et al 2018 however whether the threshold can be further pushed to improve performance remains unclear the microbial community dynamics in digester sludge are largely driven by deterministic factors such as substrate selection de francisci et al 2015 wagner et al 2013 immigration from feedstock

microbial adaptation chen et al 2008 palatsi et al 2010 particularly shifts in abundance of syntrophic fatty acid degrading populations has been shown to correlate to reduced inhibition and improved community performance in fog disturbed environments amha et al 2017 ziels et al 2017 2016 however results from such environmental surveys are limited to community function correlations de los reyes et al 2015 reed and martiny 2007 rather than direct demonstrations of how composition drives function only two studies showed improved performance of co digestion of grease waste silvestre et al 2011 and lcfas kougias et al 2016 due to the presence of pre adapted microbial populations in the inoculum however both were short term disturbance analyses approximately 25 days and did not examine community dynamics in response to post failure recovery or re exposure at similar or higher intensity in this study we used a pre adapted digester with a disturbance to failure experience and a non adapted digester with no prior contact to the disturbance and subsequently exposed them to a common overloading disturbance this approach similar to a common garden experiment de los reyes et al 2015 reed and martiny 2007 allowed us to more directly test how compositional differences due to past disturbance experience lead to functional differences compared to environmental treatment studies following process failure post failure recovery and re exposure to a second perturbation we examined how different perturbation events direct long term community dynamics in pre adapted and non pre adapted anaerobic co digesters 2 materials and methods 2 1 digester setup seeding environment and performance monitoring to link the microbial community dynamics to digester performance and environmental conditions two 8 l lab scale anaerobic digesters with a working volume of 6 l were set up in parallel the schematic overview of reactor set up was described in detail previously wang et al 2013 mixing was provided using a peristaltic pump that generated a circular mixing pattern feeding and decanting were conducted every other day in a draw and fill semi continuous mode every other day after biogas analysis 600 ml of effluent was removed for characterization and an equal amount of feedstock was fed into the digesters to achieve an srt of 20 days digesters were inoculated with anaerobic digester biosolids from the south durham water reclamation facility sdwrf in north carolina nc the sdwrf digester was operated under mesophilic condition with a working volume of 732 000 gallons and was fed every other day using primary sludge and thickened sludge from a gravity belt thickener thickened waste activated sludge twas from the north cary water reclamation facility in nc was used as base substrate and giw from a restaurant in cary nc was used as co substrate the giw is defined as the entire contents of a gi and therefore comprises three primary components fog food particles and wastewater these components were collected separately from the gi and stored at 4 c immediately after collection digesters were supplied with a mixture of twas and giw every other day in a temperature controlled room to maintain mesophilic conditions 37 c detailed description of feedstock characteristics was provided previously wang et al 2013 biogas production was recorded daily using a wet tip

carbon atoms was measured following method 5560 c in standard methods a blank and a reference standard samples were included in each test batch to improve quality control 2 2 digester operation during the training phase to create a pre adapted digester community to compare to a non adapted community the pre adapted digester was subjected to discrete loading steps from 0 giw w w vs added to 46 and 66 then 84 as described previously wang et al 2013 process inhibition was observed at 84 giw w w vs added after which the pre adapted digester was allowed to recover at 100 twas 0 giw stable biogas production and methane content and returns of effluent ph alkalinity and concentrations of vs cod and tvfas back to the original ranges were achieved in the pre adapted digester at the end of the training phase during the training phase the non adapted digester was operated at 100 twas 0 giw in this study sludge samples collected during the training phase fig s1 were analyzed to investigate how pre adaptation influenced the microbial populations and subsequent digester performance during the disturbance phases the progressive perturbation approach used for the pre adapted digester was replicated in a subsequent experiment ii the same reactor setup was used with a different source of giw progressive perturbations from 0 giw w w vs added to 30 and 70 then 90 fig s2 were used to drive shifts in the digester communities 2 3 dna extraction 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics a total of 68 composite samples were collected from which genomic dna components were extracted using an aluminum sulfate dna extraction method staley et al 2011 forward and reverse primer pair sequences 341f and 806r respectively were used to amplify a dna fragment of 460 bp length flanking the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene of bacteria and archaea yu et al 2005 to improve primer coverage for the ribosomal database project rdp database the base 5 from the 5 end of the forward primer was modified from c to y and the bases 8 and 9 from the 5 end of the reverse primer were modified from yv to nn as described previously sundberg et al 2013 library preparation quantification normalization and pooling were performed according to the illumina 16s metagenomics protocol illumina 2013 library quantity and quality were assessed using the high sensitivity agilent 2100 bioanalyzer agilent technologies santa clara ca pooled libraries were run on an illumina miseq platform for 300 bp paired end read sequencing at the genomic sciences laboratory north carolina state university nc sequences were deposited to the national centre for biotechnology information sequence read archive accession number srp077521 amplicon sequence pairs were merged trimmed to remove primer sequences and quality filtered using the qiime pipeline caporaso et al 2010a and trimmomatic 0 33 bolger et al 2014 otu clustering was performed at the 97 sequence similarity level using open reference otu picking workflows edgar 2010 rideout et al 2014 rdp classifier 2 2 wang et al 2007 was used to assign taxonomy to each cluster representative based on the greengenes taxonomy and reference database mcdonald et al 2012 werner et al 2012 sequences were aligned based on the greengenes core reference alignment desantis et al 2006 using pynast caporaso et al 2010b chimeric

total number of sequences were further removed from the datasets to reduce possible spurious otus as described previously navas molina et al 2013 quality filtered and chimera free sequences were rarefied to correct for differences in sampling results knight et al 2018 the compositional differences between microbiomes were assessed by principal coordinate analysis pcoa using r phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 applying the bray curtis distance on rarefied datasets navas molina et al 2013 to assess alpha diversity we calculated measures of species richness observed otu counts and combined richness and evenness shannon s index using r phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 on rarefied datasets sludge samples from the replicate experiment were processed sequenced and analyzed with samples from the first experiment to reduce biases from library preparation sequencing platforms and bioinformatics when comparing individual microbiome studies as identified previously allali et al 2017 3 results 3 1 digester performance during the disturbance and the 2nd disturbance phases to investigate the influence of pre adaptation on subsequent digester performance when exposed to a sudden overloading shock we spiked the non adapted and pre adapted digesters with 66 giw w w vs added at an olr of 2 16 g vs l day disturbance phase fig 1 the non adapted digester responded poorly compared to the pre adapted digester when faced with giw perturbation of identical intensity a severe digester upset was observed shortly after 66 giw w w vs added was introduced into the non adapted digester immediate decreases in methane yield methane content biogas production reduction rates of cod and vs ph and alkalinity as well as increases in effluent vs cod and concentrations of tvfas and tvfa alkalinity ratio indicated buildup of undigested substrates and inhibition of methanogenesis in the non adapted digester fig 1 on day 18 the 66 giw w w feed was discontinued and replaced by 100 twas to allow recovery as the non adapted digester recovered the methane yield gradually peaked at 0 599 l methane g vs added on day 39 fig 1 this increase in methane yield was due to the consumption of accumulated substrates undigested fog in giw it required approximately three srts 60 days for the non adapted digester to regain stable biogas production and methane content on the other hand the pre adapted digester stabilized within 10 days when re stressed at 66 giw w w as vs producing biogas at 12 6 l day methane yield at 0 665 l methane g vs added and methane content at 69 6 fig 1 during the 2nd disturbance phase we tested the recovery capacity of post failure anaerobic digesters specifically we examined 1 if the pre adapted digester can tolerate the 2nd disturbance at higher giw addition 75 giw w w and 2 if the non adapted digester overloaded at 66 giw w w during the disturbance phase can survive the same giw feed this time after recovery on day 79 the pre adapted digester was challenged with 75 giw w w increasing methane yield from 0 665 to 0 785 l methane g vs added and biogas production from 12 6 to 21 6 l day fig 1 at the same time the non pre adapted digester was spiked with 66 giw w w which increased methane yield from 0 197 to 0 740 l methane g vs added and biogas production from 2 3 to 16 5 l day the non pre adapted digester was further pushed on day 102 to 75 giw w w producing 0 783 l methane g vs added and biogas at 21 4 l day both the pre adapted and non pre adapted digesters achieved similar levels of digester performance and could be further pushed to a higher giw loading rate after recovery however the regular fluctuation of methane production associated with the semi continuous feeding mode wang et al 2013 was more substantial when re stressed suggesting less stable operation in both digesters overall the implementation of progressive perturbation in the pre adapted digester up to 75 giw w w increased biogas production from 2 2 to 21 6 l day methane content from 60 2 to 68 6 and methane yield from 0 180 to 0 785 l methane g vs added 3 2 the training phase the influence of progressive perturbation on microbial community dynamics and digester performance a total of 68 samples were sequenced and processed generating 5 957 812 quality filtered and chimera free sequences with an average of 99 296 sequences per sample and a total of 370 operational taxonomic units otus 97 sequence similarity identified the taxonomic distribution showed that the majority of the otus remained low in relative abundance sub dominant throughout the experiment figs 2 and 3 only 15 otus 4 of the populations individually constituted more than 6 of total sequences in at least one sample but collectively accounted for 40 70 of total sequences in different samples the 6 cutoff was chosen to improve visualization of taxonomic profiles and identification of sub dominant populations that were low in abundance dynamic changes of microbial community were observed throughout the experiment figs 2 4 during startup 100 twas 0 giw not shown on fig 1 communities from both digesters were similar fig 4 the most abundant bacterial populations during startup were saprospiraceae and bacteroidales of the phylum bacteroidetes thermovirgaceae of the phylum synergistetes sc103 of the phylum thermotogae candidatus cloacamonas and w22 of the phylum wwe1 fig 2 the most abundant archaeal population during startup was acetoclastic methanosaeta during startup these populations detected appeared to be phylogenetically and functionally diverse and involved in hydrolysis and utilization of carbohydrates proteins and vfas si communities during startup also showed higher community richness observed species and evenness shannon s index compared to other communities fig 5 in agreement with this observation over 50 of the sequences obtained during startup belonged to sub dominant populations with less than 6 relative abundance fig 2 suggesting the long tailed existence of low abundance populations in both digesters galand et al 2009 lynch and neufeld 2015 during the training phase before day 0 on fig 1 the relative abundances of the pre dominant bacterial populations during startup decreased drastically with increasing giw addition since 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing measures relative abundances of taxa the observed succession does not reflect absolute taxon abundance and could be due to the pre dominant populations becoming relatively less abundant progressive perturbation of giw led to dynamic shifts of methanogenic microbiomes away from the startup community fig 4 decreasing sub dominant populations from 57 4 to 27 4 fig 2 and whole community diversity fig 5 studies have suggested that higher community diversity or evenness resulted in more robust function werner et al 2014 2011 wittebolle et al 2009 because it ensures more suites of populations with a wide range of metabolic possibilities however in the face of major disturbances that led to dynamic successions of microbial populations we observed decreasing community richness and evenness with increasing digester performance fig 5 decreases in diversity associated with enhanced population function were also observed in other studies jia et al 2016 nguyen et al 2018 progressive perturbation selectively enriched a group of populations over time including bacteroidales within bacteroidetes sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and syntrophomonas of the phylum firmicutes vadinca02 of phylum synergistetes and wchb1 15 of phylum ws6 while other populations decreased fig 2 the syntrophic relationship between methanogens and firmicutes family syntrophomonadaceae capable of using fatty acids with carbon chain lengths ranging from c4 to c18 has been well established mcinerney et al 2009 sieber et al 2012 importantly syntrophomonas became substantially prevalent and increased in abundance from less than 1 to 21 7 during the training phase fig 2 acetoclastic methanogenesis became more dominated by methanosaeta from 2 3 to 18 9 relative abundance while more versatile methanosarcina remained sub dominant with less than 0 1 relative abundance hydrogenotrophic methanomicrobiales members methanospirillum increased from 1 to 8 8 while other hydrogenotrophs decreased in relative abundance these observations are consistent with a previous study where syntrophomonas methanosaeta and methanospirillum dominated lab scale mesophilic digesters treating waste cooking oil ziels et al 2016 at the end of the training phase before day 0 on fig 1 the pre adapted digester recovered from the 84 giw addition wang et al 2013 and the relative abundances of the most pre dominant communities including syntrophomonas methanosaeta and methanospirillum decreased drastically approximately 45 50 of the community was re populated by the sub dominant members fig 2 interestingly the populations in the pre adapted digester were dissimilar from the startup communities samples t22 to 24 fig 4 although the community richness and evenness increased back to the original level observed during startup fig 5 a smaller subset of bacterial populations continued to thrive and became dominant even after the process failure and the change of feeds during recovery including porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae and ruminococcaceae as well as vadinca02 of synergistetes fig 2 at the end of the training phase syntrophomonas also became slightly more abundant compared to the startup communities as a result the community remained dissimilar and did not return to the previous structure during startup fig 4 3 3 the disturbance phases the influence of adaptation history on microbial community dynamics and digester performance during the disturbance phase both the pre adapted and non pre adapted digesters were subjected to 66 giw w w addition the non pre adapted digester encountered major process failure fig 1 after which the majority of the community remained populated by sub dominant populations with less than 6 relative abundance fig 3 however the microbial structure of the non pre adapted digester became dissimilar from the original structure fig 4 during post failure recovery with 100 twas feeds the microbial community further shifted as the accumulated substrates were consumed a group of populations emerged during recovery including porphyromonadaceae up to 7 5 sporanaerobacter up to 18 6 lutispora up to 7 2 and ruminococcaceae up to 8 4 fig 3 by the end of the recovery several pre dominant organisms during startup including bacteroidales and the populations within the phylum wwe1 regained their prevalence the community richness and evenness also increased back to the original level during startup fig 5 however the microbial community in the non pre adapted digester did not return to the original structure during startup samples d22 to 24 fig 4 syntrophomonas porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 synergistetes became noticeably more abundant after recovery compared to the startup communities in the non pre adapted digester these populations were the same group of organisms detected in the recovered pre adapted digester and their increased abundance remained even after 60 days of continuous 100 twas feeding by the end of the recovery on the other hand during the disturbance phase the pre adapted digester showed increased methane production fig 1 increased giw addition and prior adaptation history also led to substantial increases of pre dominant syntrophomonas from less than 1 to 14 8 methanosaeta from 3 5 to 15 9 and methanospirillum from less than 1 to 2 9 fig 3 compared to the non pre adapted digester continuous prevalence of porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 was also observed the pre adapted digester was able to rebound fig 4 generating similar amounts of methane as observed during the training phase despite more fluctuations fig 1 as anticipated the disturbance also led to decreases of community richness and evenness fig 5 and total sub dominant populations from 50 2 to 27 0 figs 2 and 3 during the 2nd disturbance the non pre adapted digester showed enhanced digester performance fig 1 as the community diversity decreased fig 5 relative abundances of syntrophomonas porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 synergistetes continued to increase with increasing methane production fig 3 both the pre adapted and non pre adapted digesters were able to produce similar amounts of methane at 66 giw w w and be further pushed to 75 giw w w fig 1 the microbial community structure in both digesters converged fig 4 and syntrophomonas methanosaeta and methanospirillum were dominant along with other populations such as porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 that showed higher relative abundance compared to other populations fig 3 as anticipated sub dominant populations decreased to as low as 22 4 total relative abundance when re stressed at 75 giw w w when the lowest community richness and evenness were observed compared to communities during other phases fig 5 3 4 progressive perturbations led to similar microbial community shifts and increased methane production in experiment ii the implementation of progressive perturbation during experiment ii up to 70 giw w w increased biogas production from 2 0 to 18 6 l day methane content from 57 9 to 66 8 and methane yield from 0 141 to 0 704 l methane g vs added fig s2 these results were in good agreement with the performance at 75 giw w w in experiment i a total of 8 sludge samples were sequenced and analyzed generating 562 878 quality filtered and chimera free sequences with an average of 70 359 sequences per sample a consistent trend of selective enrichments in the archaeal and bacterial populations was observed with increasing giw loading rates syntrophomonas methanosaeta and methanospirillum thrived while other populations subsided fig s3 after overloading sample r5 a smaller subset of bacterial populations continued to increase and became dominant including porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae and ruminococcaceae as well as vadinca02 of synergistetes fig s3 an additional fermenter prevotella was also identified purushe et al 2010 strobel 1992 similarly increasing giw disturbance levels correlated with the community dynamics fig s4 after overloading microbial populations of the replicate digester experiment ii converged with other communities in recovery experiment i in experiment ii decreases in diversity were also associated with increasing perturbation and digester performance fig s5 results from experiment ii supported and were in agreement with the findings in experiment i 4 discussion 4 1 the link between community composition and digester function during startup digester sludge was dominated by phyla bacteroidetes synergistetes thermotogae and wwe1 whereas firmicutes remained sub dominant before large proportions of giw were introduced carbohydrates and proteins from the base substrate twas could be utilized by saprospiraceae and other bacteroidales populations rosenberg et al 2014 amino acids by synergistetes thermovirgaceae göker et al 2012 vartoukian et al 2007 fatty acids by syntrophomonas and perhaps unconventional syntrophic acetate degraders thermotogae also fermenters of carbohydrates lykidis et al 2011 nobu et al 2015 sieber et al 2012 more versatile wwe1 populations could perform cellulose hydrolysis of substrates limam et al 2014 syntrophic metabolism of amino acid and oxidative degradation of propionate pelletier et al 2008 sieber et al 2012 after pre adaptation through progressive perturbation a specialized microbial community displaced the original community in the digester sludge that showed improved performance in addition to known syntrophomonas as fatty acids degraders several key populations were selectively enriched in the high yield digesters including porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 synergistetes their prevalence was observed consistently when 1 the pre adapted digester recovered during the training phase 2 the non pre adapted digester recovered during the disturbance phase 3 the pre adapted digester showed enhanced performance during the disturbance phase and 4 the non pre adapted digester showed enhanced performance during the 2nd disturbance phase these selection driven shifts could be linked to enhanced digester performance during co digestion of giw monosaccharides could be utilized by saccharolytic christensenellaceae and versatile porphyromonadaceae family christensenellaceae of the phylum firmicutes has been identified to be strictly anaerobic and saccharolytic with acetic acid and a small amount of butyric acid as the end products of fermentation morotomi et al 2011 porphyromonadaceae members of the phylum bacteroidetes can utilize a wide range of substrates such as glucose fructose glycogen soluble starch and gelatin some species are asaccharolytic and utilization of a few substrates such as starch and gelatin are not detected in some strains fermentation products include butyric propionic acetic succinic acids hydrogen and carbon dioxide rosenberg et al 2014 in lab scale digesters of chemically enhanced primary treatment sludge bacteroidales members were identified as stronger competitors for carbohydrates than cloacamonales wwe1 and saprospirales populations ju et al 2017 in our digester sludge bacteroidales members porphyromonadaceae outcompeted saprospirales populations saprospiraceae after giw disturbance the predominance of bacteroidetes synergistetes and wwe1 during startup was replaced by members of firmicutes after giw disturbance because of the substantial growth of christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae sedimentibacter and syntrophomonas since giw is rich in fog and food solids the addition of polysaccharides e g starch and cellulose from fruits and vegetables likely selected for ruminococcaceae and some bacteroidales members proteinaceous substrates e g from meats and associated amino acids for sedimentibacter and vadinca02 synergistetes as well as fatty acid rich materials e g fog from cooking oil and meats for syntrophomonas ruminococcaceae has been studied in diverse gut communities and identified as polysaccharide degraders abell et al 2008 ding et al 2001 flint et al 2008 ze et al 2012 in digester sludge disturbed with alpha cellulose members of the order bacteroidales and genus ruminococcus had a significant correlation to higher concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfas and were likely the main cellulose degraders during the initial hydrolysis vanwonterghem et al 2014 sedimentibacter is capable of utilizing amino acid and pyruvate producing acetate and butyrate as the main fermentation products and propionate lactate and traces of isobutyrate and isovalerate as the minor products breitenstein et al 2002 within synergistetes vadinca02 became dominant after giw disturbance while predominant thermovirgaceae subsided synergistetes can be found in a wide variety of habitats such as anaerobic digestion sludge and wastewater particularly when high levels of amino acids are present göker et al 2012 rosenberg et al 2014 vartoukian et al 2007 synergistetes members are mostly asaccharolytic and can utilize amino acids peptides and proteins selective members can grow in syntrophic interactions with hydrogenotrophic methanogens additionally acetate utilization by synergistes group 4 affiliated with synergistetes has been identified in anaerobic digester sludge and may compete with acetoclastic methanosaeta at high acetate concentrations ito et al 2011 subsequently as more vfas and other intermediates were produced syntrophic oxidizers such as syntrophomonas acetoclastic methanosaeta and hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum increased in abundance to further convert these substrates to acetate and or hydrogen and carbon dioxide and finally methane and carbon dioxide overall the implementation of progressive perturbation and pre adaptation directed community dynamics and led to a specific selection of microorganisms the increased methane yield of the pre adapted community from 0 180 to 0 785 l methane g vs added is the highest value reported to date compared to other studies at closely identical olrs of fog based materials amha et al 2017 davidsson et al 2008 kabouris et al 2009 luostarinen et al 2009 noutsopoulos et al 2013 silvestre et al 2011 wan et al 2011 ziels et al 2016 4 2 microbial populations from the feedstock from an ecological perspective the successions from saprospiraceae thermovirgaceae thermotogae and wwe1 during startup to porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae syntrophomonas ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 after giw perturbation could be due to niche preferences of these populations when switched to a high fat food solids rich environment however although progressive perturbation of giw led to proliferation of these populations it is unclear whether this was due to selective growth in the startup assemblage or populations originated from the feedstock immigration or both additional studies are necessary to evaluate the impact of feedstock originated populations on post disturbance digester microbiomes for example pre defined criteria have been used to identify a target community e g residue or non growing populations and study their influence on digester microbiomes mei et al 2017 alternatively the change in abundance of all influent populations could be calculated to profile their distribution and tendency to die off survive or grow after being introduced kirkegaard et al 2017 pre exposing inocula to increasing disturbance of non sterile sewage sludge and grease waste has been shown to reduce initial lag phase and increase acetoclastic methanogenic and synthrophic acetogenic activities compared to the original community silvestre et al 2011 a previous metagenomic study using synthetic lcfas na oleate and cattle manure sterilized using autoclave also showed that the presence of specialized consortia in the lcfa acclimated inoculum led to improved process efficiency compared to the non acclimated inoculum kougias et al 2016 since waste materials are most likely not pre sterilized before co digestion regardless of the variations in ascertaining the effect of feedstock originated populations the common finding from the current and previous studies demonstrates the feasibility of enriching a group of specialized microbial populations through adaptation to achieve better co digestion of lipid rich substrates 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the long term microbial community dynamics in lab scale methanogenic digesters challenged by a series of disturbance to failure experiments pre adaptation through progressive perturbation resulted in a specialized microbial community in digester sludge that showed improved performance and tolerance to high giw loading rates fermenters porphyromonadaceae christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae sedimentibacter and vadinca02 synergistetes along with fatty acid degrading syntrophomonas acetoclastic methanosaeta and hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum became dominant after adaptation and post disturbance recovery suggesting their niche preferences under a high fat food waste rich environment at high giw loadings well adapted communities converged and became less diverse and less even but more specialized with increased methane yield this convergence occurred regardless of stress history reactors that were pre adapted or that have recovered after previous failure had communities that converged once well adapted to high giw addition implementation of progressive perturbation up to 75 giw w w addition achieved the highest methane yield reported to date for co digestion of giw increasing methane yield by 336 from 0 180 to 0 785 l methane g vs added declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18333,enhancing biogas production while avoiding inhibition of methanogenesis during co digestion of grease interceptor waste giw can help water resource recovery facilities reduce their carbon footprint here we used pre adapted and non adapted digesters to link microbial community structure to digester function before disturbance the pre adapted and non adapted digesters showed similar methane production and microbial community diversity but dissimilar community composition when exposed to an identical disturbance the pre adapted digester achieved better performance while the non adapted digester was inhibited when re exposed to disturbance after recovery communities and performance of both digesters converged regardless of the temporal variations co digestion of up to 75 giw added on a volatile solids vs basis was achieved increasing methane yield by 336 from 0 180 to 0 785 l methane g vs added the highest methane yield reported to date for lipid rich waste progressive perturbation substantially enriched fatty acid degrading syntrophomonas from less than 1 to 24 6 of total 16s rrna gene sequences acetoclastic methanosaeta from 2 3 to 11 9 and hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum from less than 1 to 6 6 in the pre adapted digester specific hydrolytic and fermentative populations also increased these ecological insights demonstrated how progressive perturbation can be strategically used to influence methanogenic microbiomes and improve co digestion of giw graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic co digestion grease interceptor waste fat oil and grease fog perturbation adaptation history microbial community dynamics 1 introduction the anaerobic co digestion of energy rich grease interceptor waste giw integrates waste management and resource recovery in a potentially cost effective way giw consists of the entire contents of a grease interceptor gi including fat oil and grease fog food solids and associated wastewater wang et al 2013 a key question in giw co digestion is how to substantially increase biogas production while avoiding overloading with giw and inhibition of methanogenesis major metabolic processes in anaerobic digestion including hydrolysis acidogenesis fermentation acetogenesis and methanogenesis are carried out by different consortia of microbes with distinct ecological roles when treating high strength lipid waste one major challenge is to ensure efficient degradation of intermediates such as long chain fatty acids lcfas acetate propionate and butyrate excessive substrate input can lead to accumulation of these intermediates and decreases in ph high levels of lcfa can also lead to inhibition of substrate and product transport damage to cell membrane increased lag phase of methane production loss of methanogenic activity and sludge flotation and washout palatsi et al 2010 rinzema et al 2013 the co digestion of sewage sludge with lipid wastes from different sources such as fog from a receiving facility a meat processing plant and restaurants has been widely studied a wide range of organic loading rates olrs of fog on a volatile solids vs basis has been evaluated ranging from 0 05 4 fog w w

noutsopoulos et al 2013 wan et al 2011 wang et al 2013 process failure has been documented at 1 45 2 5 4 0 and 7 47 g vs fog l day but some experiments demonstrated operation between 1 3 and 3 0 g vs fog l day no general conclusion can be drawn based on empirical limitations of fog addition especially at olrs of fog higher than 1 3 g vs fog l day where the performance profiles differed markedly even at the same fog loading rate the limit of fog co digestion threshold of fog loading rate that can be achieved without process upset appears to vary depending on the sources of inoculum base substrate and co substrate temperature solids retention time srt and mixing intensity results from a study of co digestion between sewage sludge and carbon rich beverage waste showed that there was an olr threshold where the function and resilience of the anaerobic microbiomes could be maintained nguyen et al 2018 however whether the threshold can be further pushed to improve performance remains unclear the microbial community dynamics in digester sludge are largely driven by deterministic factors such as substrate selection de francisci et al 2015 wagner et al 2013 immigration from feedstock kirkegaard et al 2017 mei et al 2017 control of inoculum and operational conditions olr and srt ju et al 2017 peces et al 2018 to link microbial community to improved digester performance a widely studied approach is feeding strategy for example through changes in fog loading rates e g incremental step increases or a pulse sudden shock of higher olr goux et al 2015 luostarinen et al 2009 wang et al 2013 ziels et al 2016 or feeding frequency e g continuous daily or intermittently de vrieze et al 2013 nadais et al 2006 ziels et al 2017 through the use of different feeding strategies microbial adaptation chen et al 2008 palatsi et al 2010 particularly shifts in abundance of syntrophic fatty acid degrading populations has been shown to correlate to reduced inhibition and improved community performance in fog disturbed environments amha et al 2017 ziels et al 2017 2016 however results from such environmental surveys are limited to community function correlations de los reyes et al 2015 reed and martiny 2007 rather than direct demonstrations of how composition drives function only two studies showed improved performance of co digestion of grease waste silvestre et al 2011 and lcfas kougias et al 2016 due to the presence of pre adapted microbial populations in the inoculum however both were short term disturbance analyses approximately 25 days and did not examine community dynamics in response to post failure recovery or re exposure at similar or higher intensity in this study we used a pre adapted digester with a disturbance to failure experience and a non adapted digester with no prior contact to the disturbance and subsequently exposed them to a common overloading disturbance this approach similar to a common garden experiment de los reyes et al 2015 reed and martiny 2007 allowed us to more directly test how compositional differences due to past disturbance experience lead to functional differences compared to environmental treatment studies following process failure post failure recovery and re exposure to a second perturbation we examined how different perturbation events direct long term community dynamics in pre adapted and non pre adapted anaerobic co digesters 2 materials and methods 2 1 digester setup seeding environment and performance monitoring to link the microbial community dynamics to digester performance and environmental conditions two 8 l lab scale anaerobic digesters with a working volume of 6 l were set up in parallel the schematic overview of reactor set up was described in detail previously wang et al 2013 mixing was provided using a peristaltic pump that generated a circular mixing pattern feeding and decanting were conducted every other day in a draw and fill semi continuous mode every other day after biogas analysis 600 ml of effluent was removed for characterization and an equal amount of feedstock was fed into the digesters to achieve an srt of 20 days digesters were inoculated with anaerobic digester biosolids from the south durham water reclamation facility sdwrf in north carolina nc the sdwrf digester was operated under mesophilic condition with a working volume of 732 000 gallons and was fed every other day using primary sludge and thickened sludge from a gravity belt thickener thickened waste activated sludge twas from the north cary water reclamation facility in nc was used as base substrate and giw from a restaurant in cary nc was used as co substrate the giw is defined as the entire contents of a gi and therefore comprises three primary components fog food particles and wastewater these components were collected separately from the gi and stored at 4 c immediately after collection digesters were supplied with a mixture of twas and giw every other day in a temperature controlled room to maintain mesophilic conditions 37 c detailed description of feedstock characteristics was provided previously wang et al 2013 biogas production was recorded daily using a wet tip gas meter wet tip gas meter com nashville tn and normalized to standard temperature and pressure 273 k and 101 325 pa conditions the methane content in biogas was analyzed daily using a gas chromatograph gc sri 8610c torrance ca equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a ctr 1 column alltech deerfield il maintained at 75 c helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of

carbon atoms was measured following method 5560 c in standard methods a blank and a reference standard samples were included in each test batch to improve quality control 2 2 digester operation during the training phase to create a pre adapted digester community to compare to a non adapted community the pre adapted digester was subjected to discrete loading steps from 0 giw w w vs added to 46 and 66 then 84 as described previously wang et al 2013 process inhibition was observed at 84 giw w w vs added after which the pre adapted digester was allowed to recover at 100 twas 0 giw stable biogas production and methane content and returns of effluent ph alkalinity and concentrations of vs cod and tvfas back to the original ranges were achieved in the pre adapted digester at the end of the training phase during the training phase the non adapted digester was operated at 100 twas 0 giw in this study sludge samples collected during the training phase fig s1 were analyzed to investigate how pre adaptation influenced the microbial populations and subsequent digester performance during the disturbance phases the progressive perturbation approach used for the pre adapted digester was replicated in a subsequent experiment ii the same reactor setup was used with a different source of giw progressive perturbations from 0 giw w w vs added to 30 and 70 then 90 fig s2 were used to drive shifts in the digester communities 2 3 dna extraction 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics a total of 68 composite samples were collected from which genomic dna components were extracted using an aluminum sulfate dna extraction method staley et al 2011 forward and reverse primer pair sequences 341f and 806r respectively were used to amplify a dna fragment of 460 bp length flanking the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene of bacteria and archaea yu et al 2005 to improve primer coverage for the ribosomal database project rdp database the base 5 from the 5 end of the forward primer was modified from c to y and the bases 8 and 9 from the 5 end of the reverse primer were modified from yv to nn as described previously sundberg et al 2013 library preparation quantification normalization and pooling were performed according to the illumina 16s metagenomics protocol illumina 2013 library quantity and quality were assessed using the high sensitivity agilent 2100 bioanalyzer agilent technologies santa clara ca pooled libraries were run on an illumina miseq platform for 300 bp paired end read sequencing at the genomic sciences laboratory north carolina state university nc sequences were deposited to the national centre for biotechnology information sequence read archive accession number srp077521 amplicon sequence pairs were merged trimmed to remove primer sequences and quality filtered using the qiime pipeline caporaso et al 2010a and trimmomatic 0 33 bolger et al 2014 otu clustering was performed at the 97 sequence similarity level using open reference otu picking workflows edgar 2010 rideout et al 2014 rdp classifier 2 2 wang et al 2007 was used to assign taxonomy to each cluster representative based on the greengenes taxonomy and reference database mcdonald et al 2012 werner et al 2012 sequences were aligned based on the greengenes core reference alignment desantis et al 2006 using pynast caporaso et al 2010b chimeric sequences were identified using chimeraslayer haas et al 2011 and removed from the alignment to build a phylogenetic tree using fasttree 2 1 3 price et al 2010 sequences with less than 0 005 of the total number of sequences were further removed from the datasets to reduce possible spurious otus as described previously navas molina et al 2013 quality filtered and chimera free sequences were rarefied to correct for differences in sampling results knight et al 2018 the compositional differences between microbiomes were assessed by principal coordinate analysis pcoa using r phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 applying the bray curtis distance on rarefied datasets navas molina et al 2013 to assess alpha diversity we calculated measures of species richness observed otu counts and combined richness and evenness shannon s index using r phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 on rarefied datasets sludge samples from the replicate experiment were processed sequenced and analyzed with samples from the first experiment to reduce biases from library preparation sequencing platforms and bioinformatics when comparing individual microbiome studies as identified previously allali et al 2017 3 results 3 1 digester performance during the disturbance and the 2nd disturbance phases to investigate the influence of pre adaptation on subsequent digester performance when exposed to a sudden overloading shock we spiked the non adapted and pre adapted digesters with 66 giw w w vs added at an olr of 2 16 g vs l day disturbance phase fig 1 the non adapted digester responded poorly compared to the pre adapted digester when faced with giw perturbation of identical intensity a severe digester upset was observed shortly after 66 giw w w vs added was introduced into the non adapted digester immediate decreases in methane yield methane content biogas production reduction rates of cod and vs ph and alkalinity as well as increases in effluent vs cod and concentrations of tvfas and tvfa alkalinity ratio indicated buildup of undigested substrates and inhibition of methanogenesis in the non adapted digester fig 1 on day 18 the 66 giw w w feed was discontinued and replaced by 100 twas to allow recovery as the non adapted digester recovered the methane yield gradually peaked at 0 599 l methane g vs added on day 39 fig 1 this increase in methane yield was due to the consumption of accumulated substrates undigested fog in giw it required approximately three srts 60 days for the non adapted digester to regain stable biogas production and methane content on the other hand the pre adapted digester stabilized within 10 days when re stressed at 66 giw w w as vs producing biogas at 12 6 l day methane yield at 0 665 l methane g vs added and methane content at 69 6 fig 1 during the 2nd disturbance phase we tested the recovery capacity of post failure anaerobic digesters specifically we examined 1 if the pre adapted digester can tolerate the 2nd disturbance at higher giw addition 75 giw w w and 2 if the non adapted digester overloaded at 66 giw w w during the disturbance phase can survive the same giw feed this time after recovery on day 79 the pre adapted digester was challenged with 75 giw w w increasing methane yield from 0 665 to 0 785 l methane g vs added and biogas production from 12 6 to 21 6 l day fig 1 at the same time the non pre adapted digester was spiked with 66 giw w w which increased methane yield from 0 197 to 0 740 l methane g vs added and biogas production from 2 3 to 16 5 l day the non pre adapted digester was further pushed on day 102 to 75 giw w w producing 0 783 l methane g vs added and biogas at 21 4 l day both the pre adapted and non pre adapted digesters achieved similar levels of digester performance and could be further pushed to a higher giw loading rate after recovery however the regular fluctuation of methane production associated with the semi continuous feeding mode wang et al 2013 was more substantial when re stressed suggesting less stable operation in both digesters overall the implementation of progressive perturbation in the pre adapted digester up to 75 giw w w increased biogas production from 2 2 to 21 6 l day methane content from 60 2 to 68 6 and methane yield from 0 180 to 0 785 l methane g vs added 3 2 the training phase the influence of progressive perturbation on microbial community dynamics and digester performance a total of 68 samples were sequenced and processed generating 5 957 812 quality filtered and chimera free sequences with an average of 99 296 sequences per sample and a total of 370 operational taxonomic units otus 97 sequence similarity identified the taxonomic distribution showed that the majority of the otus remained low in relative abundance sub dominant throughout the experiment figs 2 and 3 only 15 otus 4 of the populations individually constituted more than 6 of total sequences in at least one sample but collectively accounted for 40 70 of total sequences in different samples the 6 cutoff was chosen to improve visualization of taxonomic profiles and identification of sub dominant populations that were low in abundance dynamic changes of microbial community were observed throughout the experiment figs 2 4 during startup 100 twas 0 giw not shown on fig 1 communities from both digesters were similar fig 4 the most abundant bacterial populations during startup were saprospiraceae and bacteroidales of the phylum bacteroidetes thermovirgaceae of the phylum synergistetes sc103 of the phylum thermotogae candidatus cloacamonas and w22 of the phylum wwe1 fig 2 the most abundant archaeal population during startup was acetoclastic methanosaeta during startup these populations detected appeared to be phylogenetically and functionally diverse and involved in hydrolysis and utilization of carbohydrates proteins and vfas si communities during startup also showed higher community richness observed species and evenness shannon s index compared to other communities fig 5 in agreement with this observation over 50 of the sequences obtained during startup belonged to sub dominant populations with less than 6 relative abundance fig 2 suggesting the long tailed existence of low abundance populations in both digesters galand et al 2009 lynch and neufeld 2015 during the training phase before day 0 on fig 1 the relative abundances of the pre dominant bacterial populations during startup decreased drastically with increasing giw addition since 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing measures relative abundances of taxa the observed succession does not reflect absolute taxon abundance and could be due to the pre dominant populations becoming relatively less abundant progressive perturbation of giw led to dynamic shifts of methanogenic microbiomes away from the startup community fig 4 decreasing sub dominant populations from 57 4 to 27 4 fig 2 and whole community diversity fig 5 studies have suggested that higher community diversity or evenness resulted in more robust function werner et al 2014 2011 wittebolle et al 2009 because it ensures more suites of populations with a wide range of metabolic possibilities however in the face of major disturbances that led to dynamic successions of microbial populations we observed decreasing community richness and evenness with increasing digester performance fig 5 decreases in diversity associated with enhanced population function were also observed in other studies jia et al 2016 nguyen et al 2018 progressive perturbation selectively enriched a group of populations over time including bacteroidales within bacteroidetes sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and syntrophomonas of the phylum firmicutes vadinca02 of phylum synergistetes and wchb1 15 of phylum ws6 while other populations decreased fig 2 the syntrophic relationship between methanogens and firmicutes family syntrophomonadaceae capable of using fatty acids with carbon chain lengths ranging from c4 to c18 has been well established mcinerney et al 2009 sieber et al 2012 importantly syntrophomonas became substantially prevalent and increased in abundance from less than 1 to 21 7 during the training phase fig 2 acetoclastic methanogenesis became more dominated by methanosaeta from 2 3 to 18 9 relative abundance while more versatile methanosarcina remained sub dominant with less than 0 1 relative abundance hydrogenotrophic methanomicrobiales members methanospirillum increased from 1 to 8 8 while other hydrogenotrophs decreased in relative abundance these observations are consistent with a previous study where syntrophomonas methanosaeta and methanospirillum dominated lab scale mesophilic digesters treating waste cooking oil ziels et al 2016 at the end of the training phase before day 0 on fig 1 the pre adapted digester recovered from the 84 giw addition wang et al 2013 and the relative abundances of the most pre dominant communities including syntrophomonas methanosaeta and methanospirillum decreased drastically approximately 45 50 of the community was re populated by the sub dominant members fig 2 interestingly the populations in the pre adapted digester were dissimilar from the startup communities samples t22 to 24 fig 4 although the community richness and evenness increased back to the original level observed during startup fig 5 a smaller subset of bacterial populations continued to thrive and became dominant even after the process failure and the change of feeds during recovery including porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae and ruminococcaceae as well as vadinca02 of synergistetes fig 2 at the end of the training phase syntrophomonas also became slightly more abundant compared to the startup communities as a result the community remained dissimilar and did not return to the previous structure during startup fig 4 3 3 the disturbance phases the influence of adaptation history on microbial community dynamics and digester performance during the disturbance phase both the pre adapted and non pre adapted digesters were subjected to 66 giw w w addition the non pre adapted digester encountered major process failure fig 1 after which the majority of the community remained populated by sub dominant populations with less than 6 relative abundance fig 3 however the microbial structure of the non pre adapted digester became dissimilar from the original structure fig 4 during post failure recovery with 100 twas feeds the microbial community further shifted as the accumulated substrates were consumed a group of populations emerged during recovery including porphyromonadaceae up to 7 5 sporanaerobacter up to 18 6 lutispora up to 7 2 and ruminococcaceae up to 8 4 fig 3 by the end of the recovery several pre dominant organisms during startup including bacteroidales and the populations within the phylum wwe1 regained their prevalence the community richness and evenness also increased back to the original level during startup fig 5 however the microbial community in the non pre adapted digester did not return to the original structure during startup samples d22 to 24 fig 4 syntrophomonas porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 synergistetes became noticeably more abundant after recovery compared to the startup communities in the non pre adapted digester these populations were the same group of organisms detected in the recovered pre adapted digester and their increased abundance remained even after 60 days of continuous 100 twas feeding by the end of the recovery on the other hand during the disturbance phase the pre adapted digester showed increased methane production fig 1 increased giw addition and prior adaptation history also led to substantial increases of pre dominant syntrophomonas from less than 1 to 14 8 methanosaeta from 3 5 to 15 9 and methanospirillum from less than 1 to 2 9 fig 3 compared to the non pre adapted digester continuous prevalence of porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 was also observed the pre adapted digester was able to rebound fig 4 generating similar amounts of methane as observed during the training phase despite more fluctuations fig 1 as anticipated the disturbance also led to decreases of community richness and evenness fig 5 and total sub dominant populations from 50 2 to 27 0 figs 2 and 3 during the 2nd disturbance the non pre adapted digester showed enhanced digester performance fig 1 as the community diversity decreased fig 5 relative abundances of syntrophomonas porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 synergistetes continued to increase with increasing methane production fig 3 both the pre adapted and non pre adapted digesters were able to produce similar amounts of methane at 66 giw w w and be further pushed to 75 giw w w fig 1 the microbial community structure in both digesters converged fig 4 and syntrophomonas methanosaeta and methanospirillum were dominant along with other populations such as porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 that showed higher relative abundance compared to other populations fig 3 as anticipated sub dominant populations decreased to as low as 22 4 total relative abundance when re stressed at 75 giw w w when the lowest community richness and evenness were observed compared to communities during other phases fig 5 3 4 progressive perturbations led to similar microbial community shifts and increased methane production in experiment ii the implementation of progressive perturbation during experiment ii up to 70 giw w w increased biogas production from 2 0 to 18 6 l day methane content from 57 9 to 66 8 and methane yield from 0 141 to 0 704 l methane g vs added fig s2 these results were in good agreement with the performance at 75 giw w w in experiment i a total of 8 sludge samples were sequenced and analyzed generating 562 878 quality filtered and chimera free sequences with an average of 70 359 sequences per sample a consistent trend of selective enrichments in the archaeal and bacterial populations was observed with increasing giw loading rates syntrophomonas methanosaeta and methanospirillum thrived while other populations subsided fig s3 after overloading sample r5 a smaller subset of bacterial populations continued to increase and became dominant including porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae and ruminococcaceae as well as vadinca02 of synergistetes fig s3 an additional fermenter prevotella was also identified purushe et al 2010 strobel 1992 similarly increasing giw disturbance levels correlated with the community dynamics fig s4 after overloading microbial populations of the replicate digester experiment ii converged with other communities in recovery experiment i in experiment ii decreases in diversity were also associated with increasing perturbation and digester performance fig s5 results from experiment ii supported and were in agreement with the findings in experiment i 4 discussion 4 1 the link between community composition and digester function during startup digester sludge was dominated by phyla bacteroidetes synergistetes thermotogae and wwe1 whereas firmicutes remained sub dominant before large proportions of giw were introduced carbohydrates and proteins from the base substrate twas could be utilized by saprospiraceae and other bacteroidales populations rosenberg et al 2014 amino acids by synergistetes thermovirgaceae göker et al 2012 vartoukian et al 2007 fatty acids by syntrophomonas and perhaps unconventional syntrophic acetate degraders thermotogae also fermenters of carbohydrates lykidis et al 2011 nobu et al 2015 sieber et al 2012 more versatile wwe1 populations could perform cellulose hydrolysis of substrates limam et al 2014 syntrophic metabolism of amino acid and oxidative degradation of propionate pelletier et al 2008 sieber et al 2012 after pre adaptation through progressive perturbation a specialized microbial community displaced the original community in the digester sludge that showed improved performance in addition to known syntrophomonas as fatty acids degraders several key populations were selectively enriched in the high yield digesters including porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 synergistetes their prevalence was observed consistently when 1 the pre adapted digester recovered during the training phase 2 the non pre adapted digester recovered during the disturbance phase 3 the pre adapted digester showed enhanced performance during the disturbance phase and 4 the non pre adapted digester showed enhanced performance during the 2nd disturbance phase these selection driven shifts could be linked to enhanced digester performance during co digestion of giw monosaccharides could be utilized by saccharolytic christensenellaceae and versatile porphyromonadaceae family christensenellaceae of the phylum firmicutes has been identified to be strictly anaerobic and saccharolytic with acetic acid and a small amount of butyric acid as the end products of fermentation morotomi et al 2011 porphyromonadaceae members of the phylum bacteroidetes can utilize a wide range of substrates such as glucose fructose glycogen soluble starch and gelatin some species are asaccharolytic and utilization of a few substrates such as starch and gelatin are not detected in some strains fermentation products include butyric propionic acetic succinic acids hydrogen and carbon dioxide rosenberg et al 2014 in lab scale digesters of chemically enhanced primary treatment sludge bacteroidales members were identified as stronger competitors for carbohydrates than cloacamonales wwe1 and saprospirales populations ju et al 2017 in our digester sludge bacteroidales members porphyromonadaceae outcompeted saprospirales populations saprospiraceae after giw disturbance the predominance of bacteroidetes synergistetes and wwe1 during startup was replaced by members of firmicutes after giw disturbance because of the substantial growth of christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae sedimentibacter and syntrophomonas since giw is rich in fog and food solids the addition of polysaccharides e g starch and cellulose from fruits and vegetables likely selected for ruminococcaceae and some bacteroidales members proteinaceous substrates e g from meats and associated amino acids for sedimentibacter and vadinca02 synergistetes as well as fatty acid rich materials e g fog from cooking oil and meats for syntrophomonas ruminococcaceae has been studied in diverse gut communities and identified as polysaccharide degraders abell et al 2008 ding et al 2001 flint et al 2008 ze et al 2012 in digester sludge disturbed with alpha cellulose members of the order bacteroidales and genus ruminococcus had a significant correlation to higher concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfas and were likely the main cellulose degraders during the initial hydrolysis vanwonterghem et al 2014 sedimentibacter is capable of utilizing amino acid and pyruvate producing acetate and butyrate as the main fermentation products and propionate lactate and traces of isobutyrate and isovalerate as the minor products breitenstein et al 2002 within synergistetes vadinca02 became dominant after giw disturbance while predominant thermovirgaceae subsided synergistetes can be found in a wide variety of habitats such as anaerobic digestion sludge and wastewater particularly when high levels of amino acids are present göker et al 2012 rosenberg et al 2014 vartoukian et al 2007 synergistetes members are mostly asaccharolytic and can utilize amino acids peptides and proteins selective members can grow in syntrophic interactions with hydrogenotrophic methanogens additionally acetate utilization by synergistes group 4 affiliated with synergistetes has been identified in anaerobic digester sludge and may compete with acetoclastic methanosaeta at high acetate concentrations ito et al 2011 subsequently as more vfas and other intermediates were produced syntrophic oxidizers such as syntrophomonas acetoclastic methanosaeta and hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum increased in abundance to further convert these substrates to acetate and or hydrogen and carbon dioxide and finally methane and carbon dioxide overall the implementation of progressive perturbation and pre adaptation directed community dynamics and led to a specific selection of microorganisms the increased methane yield of the pre adapted community from 0 180 to 0 785 l methane g vs added is the highest value reported to date compared to other studies at closely identical olrs of fog based materials amha et al 2017 davidsson et al 2008 kabouris et al 2009 luostarinen et al 2009 noutsopoulos et al 2013 silvestre et al 2011 wan et al 2011 ziels et al 2016 4 2 microbial populations from the feedstock from an ecological perspective the successions from saprospiraceae thermovirgaceae thermotogae and wwe1 during startup to porphyromonadaceae sedimentibacter christensenellaceae syntrophomonas ruminococcaceae and vadinca02 after giw perturbation could be due to niche preferences of these populations when switched to a high fat food solids rich environment however although progressive perturbation of giw led to proliferation of these populations it is unclear whether this was due to selective growth in the startup assemblage or populations originated from the feedstock immigration or both additional studies are necessary to evaluate the impact of feedstock originated populations on post disturbance digester microbiomes for example pre defined criteria have been used to identify a target community e g residue or non growing populations and study their influence on digester microbiomes mei et al 2017 alternatively the change in abundance of all influent populations could be calculated to profile their distribution and tendency to die off survive or grow after being introduced kirkegaard et al 2017 pre exposing inocula to increasing disturbance of non sterile sewage sludge and grease waste has been shown to reduce initial lag phase and increase acetoclastic methanogenic and synthrophic acetogenic activities compared to the original community silvestre et al 2011 a previous metagenomic study using synthetic lcfas na oleate and cattle manure sterilized using autoclave also showed that the presence of specialized consortia in the lcfa acclimated inoculum led to improved process efficiency compared to the non acclimated inoculum kougias et al 2016 since waste materials are most likely not pre sterilized before co digestion regardless of the variations in ascertaining the effect of feedstock originated populations the common finding from the current and previous studies demonstrates the feasibility of enriching a group of specialized microbial populations through adaptation to achieve better co digestion of lipid rich substrates 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the long term microbial community dynamics in lab scale methanogenic digesters challenged by a series of disturbance to failure experiments pre adaptation through progressive perturbation resulted in a specialized microbial community in digester sludge that showed improved performance and tolerance to high giw loading rates fermenters porphyromonadaceae christensenellaceae ruminococcaceae sedimentibacter and vadinca02 synergistetes along with fatty acid degrading syntrophomonas acetoclastic methanosaeta and hydrogenotrophic methanospirillum became dominant after adaptation and post disturbance recovery suggesting their niche preferences under a high fat food waste rich environment at high giw loadings well adapted communities converged and became less diverse and less even but more specialized with increased methane yield this convergence occurred regardless of stress history reactors that were pre adapted or that have recovered after previous failure had communities that converged once well adapted to high giw addition implementation of progressive perturbation up to 75 giw w w addition achieved the highest methane yield reported to date for co digestion of giw increasing methane yield by 336 from 0 180 to 0 785 l methane g vs added declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18334,the reducing capacity rc of natural organic matter plays an important role in the carbon cycle and biogeochemical fates of environmental contaminants in the aquatic system however the electron donation potentials of dissolved organic matter dom from high latitude lakes are still uncertain in this study we collected dom samples from high latitude lakes across the arctic and boreal regions in sweden and norway to investigate the effects of the dom concentration and characteristics on its ambient reducing capacity arc mercury hg ii abiotic reduction in darkness was used to determine the arc the results showed that the dom in arctic lakes is less terrestrial dominant than in reference sites i e forest lakes between the two categories of arctic lakes tundra lakes are more terrestrial influenced compared to mountain lakes additionally terrestrial originated dom is a main controlling factor for enhancing the ambient reducing capacity whereas the dom concentration i e dissolved organic carbon doc resulted in variations in the hg doc ratios that also cause the variations of the observed arc values thus comparisons of the arc values can be conducted while oxidant doc ratios are kept the same and reported through the method using heavy metals as a chemical probe after correction for hg doc ratio interference the ambient reducing capacity of dom followed the order boreal forest lakes arctic tundra lakes arctic mountain lakes this study highlights that the dom concentration should also be considered when estimating the arc as compared to the previous that mainly focusing on the properties of dom such as its origins as climate change is projected to be severe in high latitudes this study demonstrates a significant connection between aquatic dom geochemical reactivity and terrestrial inputs which is crucial for a better prediction of the role of dom in high latitude lakes in the context of climate change graphical abstract image 1 keywords arctic ambient

2014 osburn et al 2017 which act as a potential source of greenhouse gases such as co2 and ch4 schuur et al 2015 o donnell et al 2016 ongoing climate change has resulted in the permafrost thawing which can promote the release of carbon previously stored in terrestrial systems vonk et al 2015 into adjacent lakes during the past decades several studies have qualitatively and quantitatively addressed various aspects of dissolved organic matter dom in arctic rivers cory et al 2014 o donnell et al 2016 kaiser et al 2017 lakes cory et al 2014 osburn et al 2017 and oceans shen et al 2016 mann et al 2016 and reported that terrigenous dom is abundant and widely distributed in arctic surface waters the internal links between the carbon cycle resulting from dom bio photodegradation and dom quality have also been explicitly established cory et al 2013 2014 larouche et al 2015 kaiser et al 2017 however there have been fewer studies to assess the relationships between dom properties e g origins and its biogeochemical reactivities e g reducing capacity in these areas as compared with other studies in low latitude aquatic systems investigation of the origins characteristics and biogeochemical reactivities of dom in such regions is therefore crucial for a further understanding of the regional carbon dynamics karlsson and giesler 2008 cory et al 2013 2014 kokic et al 2015 and the relevant environmental fates of contaminants in the arctic environment wei hass et al 2014 schartup et al 2015a jonsson et al 2017 among all of biogeochemical reactivities of dom the redox characteristics play an important role not only in the production of co2 and ch4 blodau et al 2007 knorr and blodau 2009 gao et al 2019 but also in the chemical speciation bioavailability toxicity and mobility of various elements and contaminants in aquatic systems for example the electron donating transfer ability of dom facilitates the reduction of many elements such as sulfur s yu et al 2015 poulin et al 2017 iron fe lovley et al 1996 lovley and blunt harris 1999 scott et al 1998 kappler et al 2004 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 jiang and kappler 2008 and copper cu pham et al 2012 maurer et al 2013 as well as the reduction of redox sensitive trace heavy elements and even radionuclides such as chromium cr gu and chen 2003 mercury hg gu et al 2011 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2015 uranium u gu and chen 2003 gu et al 2005 and neptunium np shcherbina et al 2007 reductive degradation of organic contaminants could also be mediated by dom kappler and haderlein 2003 thus determining the electron transfer potential of dom is a key step to understand its crucial roles in diverse environments quantitatively the electron donation capacity of natural organic matter nom also called the reducing capacity rc is defined as the moles of electrons that can be donated or transferred by the per unit amount of nom e g normalized carbon amount to date extensive studies have been carried out to assess the reducing capacities of dom with a wide range of values reported depending on varying quantification methods and nom origins macalady and walton day 2011 sposito 2011 it remains a major challenge to accurately determine the reducing capacity or reflect the relevant environments typically two types of methods have been widely used in parallel in the past 1 the chemical probe method i e wet chemical method lovley et al 1996 scott et al 1998 kappler et al 2004 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 jiang and kappler 2008 and 2 the electrochemical method aeschbacher et al 2010 2012 nurmi and tratnyek 2011 there is an argument about the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods although the chemical probe method is a traditional approach that relies on reaction with added chemical oxidants such as the fe iii species kappler et al 2004 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 bauer et al 2007 roden et al 2010 it may result less accuracy than the electrochemical method due to indirect measurement and poorly controlled experimental conditions e g e h aeschbacher et al 2010 gao et al 2019 however it has a unique advantage that it can reflect the kinetic and thermodynamic processes involving the complexation e g rearrangement of binding sites between target contaminants and dom structures i e binding groups and electron transfer moieties shcherbina et al 2007 gu et al 2011 pham et al 2012 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2015 if the study aims to study a specific contaminant especially trace heavy metals e g hg thus the electrochemical method cannot replace the chemical probe method especially in less well equipped laboratories and in field analyses macalady and walton day 2011 the most popular and widely used chemical probes in the previous studies are ferric compounds such as ferric citrate lovley et al 1996 lovley and blunt harris 1999 scott et al 1998 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 and hexacyanoferrate helburn and maccarthy 1994 kappler and haderlein 2003 kappler et al 2004 jiang and kappler 2008 where fe ii was quantified by a ferrozine assay stookey 1970 viollier et al 2000 the reducing capacity is usually calculated by quantifying the electrons transferring from organic matter to fe iii while forming fe ii traditionally this iron test method requires manipulation of bulk dom first including doc dilution ph adjustment buffer addition or even pre reduction thus the reducing capacity is more likely an operational parameter which is slightly far from that of the real environment especially in high doc conditions for example dom in the sediment of pore water shows a reducing capacity for hg ii after dilution in the laboratory however we found the contribution of electrons from dom was negligible due to the high doc in the real environment jiang et al 2018b additionally as dom is an operational definition of water mixtures water chemistry e g inorganic background such as the ph influences its properties and further results in a changed biogeochemical reactivity thereby dom should be considered as a system in which organic components are predominant but within the specific steric structures under the ambient inorganic backgrounds kothawala et al 2014 thus we proposed the parameter of the ambient i e apparent reducing capacity arc as a further supplement for the chemical probe methods according to the proposed concept of the nom reducing capacity from the pioneering works by kappler and sposito kappler et al 2004 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 sposito 2011 the ambient reducing capacity can be directly obtained from the original dom samples without manipulation by using the chemical probe method representing the specific reducing capacity of dom in an ambient environment especially regarding the samples with high doc concentrations for determining the arc traditional colorimetry in the iron test method has limitations due to the complexation of fe iii fe ii with dom viollier et al 2000 poulin et al 2014 and influence of chromophoric dom cdom xiao et al 2013 2015 alternatively we selected the hg abiotic reduction in dark conditions alberts et al 1974 allard and arsenie 1991 gu et al 2011 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 2015 lee et al 2019 to determine the arc of dissolved organic matter hereafter the archg one of the advantages of hg ii reduction is that hg is a unique heavy metal element that has a gaseous phase i e hg 0 which can be continuously purged into robust oxidizing solution e g kmno4 or aqua regia or a gold coated glass trap for further independently measuring the hg ii compared to the iron test the reduction of hg ii avoids interferences from the further interaction between the reductive product and dom in the system additionally measurement of the trapped hg ii is conducted by cold vapor fluorescence or an absorption method instead of colorimetry which is independent of the reduction system containing dom and thus avoids the influences of chromophoric dom previous studies of humic or soil organic matter illustrated higher reducing capacity is associated with higher aromaticity derived allochthonous sources macalady and walton day 2011 therefore we hypothesized that dom from lakes with higher terrestrial inputs e g forest lakes shows higher electron donation capacities dom samples were collected from 29 northern lakes situated across a latitude gradient from 67 3 to 69 3 n in sweden and norway i e above the arctic circle and further extending to the boreal region of sweden as a reference 63 6 64 3 n to address the knowledge gaps as all mentioned above the main aims of this study were three fold 1 to characterize the properties and origins of dom in the arctic lakes 2 to quantify the arc of dissolved organic matter using the hg ii reduction method and 3 evaluate the influences of dom origins and properties on its arc 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling strategy generally the origins of lake dom consist of both autochthonous i e produced in the lake such as microbial and algae and allochthonous i e external inputs such as terrestrial runoff or leaching which are dependent on the specific environmental conditions including catchment characteristics and climate sobek et al 2007 kothawala et al 2014 larson et al 2014 jiang et al 2018a b the dom samples were collected from 29 high latitude lakes in the arctic and boreal areas from andenes norway to abisko sweden and then finally to umeå of sweden fig 1 according to the surrounding landscapes we divided the 29 lakes into three categories including tundra mountain and boreal forest lakes respectively fig 1 the nine lakes investigated in norway are arctic tundra lakes n 9 within the permafrost tundra landscapes partially mixed with dwarf shrubs mire and peatland arctic mountain lakes n 10 are thermokarst lakes surrounded by mosses lichens and dwarf shrubs ten boreal forest lakes n 10 are located in northern sweden within the boreal forest landscapes and the dominant tree species include scots pine norway spruces and some birch all water samples of arctic lakes were collected during the summer of 2018 july to august boreal forest lakes were sampled from may to june of 2018 samples were collected 30 cm below the surface water in a well mixed location and syringe filtered in situ using a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter sarstedt germany two parameters of the water including the ph and conductivity were measured in situ using the ph conductivity portable combo meter hi 98129 hanna italy a part of the original water sample 0 5 1 l was kept intact as backup storage all samples were stored in the dark and kept in ice storage boxes during the sampling campaign and transportation and they were stored in the 4 c low temperature storage room before analysis 2 2 dom property analysis 2 2 1 dom characterization the dom concentration represented by dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn were measured using a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu japan as represented by the dissolved organic carbon doc mg l 1 additionally we measured the nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 using ion selective electrodes bante instrument shanghai china and subtracted them from the tn to obtain the dissolved organic nitrogen don the nitrogen carbon molar ratio i e n c was calculated as the don doc for optical characterization of the dom fluorescence and uv vis measurements were conducted in a 10 mm quartz cuvette using an aqualog horiba japan absorption fluorescence spectroscopy instrument equipped with a 150 w ozone free xenon lamp at constant room temperature 20 c for emission excitation matrices eems of the fluorescence spectra scan milli q water 18 2 m cm was used as a blank to be subtracted from sample eems to remove the interferences of water raman peaks eems were corrected for the inner filter effect using the parallel absorbance measurements from the same sample and blank yang and hur 2014 using the aqualog eems data processing software which also adjusted the instrument specific excitation and emission effects these corrections were also double checked using originpro 2017 the emission spectral range was 250 620 nm in 3 18 nm steps and the excitation spectral range was 230 450 nm with steps of 5 nm the scan integration time was 3 s the uv vis scan ranged from 230 to 800 nm with a 1 nm interval milli q water was used as the blank the naperian absorption coefficient a at wavelength λ nm was calculated as 1 a λ 2 303 a l where a is the absorbance and l is the cuvette path length m the fraction of dom having light absorbing properties called chromophoric dom cdom is an important means of quantifying the pool of dom the absorption coefficient at 355 nm a 355 was chosen to represent the quantity of cdom jiang et al 2018b the dom samples with high doc concentrations e g samples from boreal forest lakes were diluted to doc 10 mg l 1 before all spectra scanning including absorption and fluorescence to avoid the inner filter effect thus the original abundance of cdom reported in this study was calculated by multiplying the measured values by the dilution factor 2 2 2 dom spectral parameters and the two end member mixing model after iron correction the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 associated with dom aromaticity and humification was calculated as a254 normalized by the doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 in both wavelength ranges 275 295 nm and 350 400 nm the spectral slope s of the dom absorption curve was fitted by a nonlinear regression using eq 2 2 a λ a λr exp s λ λr where λr is a reference wavelength moreover the spectral slope ratio s r was calculated by eq 3 helms et al 2008 3 s r s 275 295 s 350 400 through fluorescence analysis for distinguishing dom sources the fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at the emission wavelengths of 450 and 500 nm excitation wavelength was kept at 370 nm mcknight et al 2001 huguet et al 2009 additionally the biological index bix an indicator of the newly produced dom from microbial algae origins i e autochthonous inputs also called the freshness index was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity at 380 nm to the emission intensity of the maximum value in the range of 420 435 nm with excitation at 310 nm wilson and xenopoulos 2009 fellman et al 2010 the relative fluorescence efficiency rfe was calculated by the fluorescence intensity at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm divided by the absorbance at 370 nm which represents the relative amounts of algal and non algal moieties of dom downing et al 2009 hansen et al 2016 for further tracking the dom origins as a cross validation we also used the mixing model of the nitrogen carbon ratio to estimate the fractions of terrestrial i e allochthonous and non terrestrial i e autochthonous contributions to the dom perdue and koprivnjak 2007 jiang et al 2018b 4 f a l l o

jiang et al 2018b 2 3 determination of the archg by hg ii abiotic reduction assays 2 3 1 reduction kinetic experimental set up a continuously purging incubation system was established for the hg ii abiotic reduction assays fig 2 following the setup described in our previous works jiang et al 2014 2015 zhu et al 2018 kinetic experiments were conducted with 7 time intervals 10 min 30 min 2 h 6 h 24 h 48 h and 72 h eight systems mainly consisted of three components including reaction washing and trap units that are borosilicate bottles reaction units with teflon caps containing hg ii and dom were wrapped with aluminum foil and kept in the dark throughout the entire experimental period reaction and trap solutions were both continuously mixed using a teflon magnetic bar and a magnetic stirrer topolino ika the speed of the magnetic bar was adjusted to 25 rpm to obtaining a steady vortex on the solution surface all units in this system were connected by teflon tubes we set two experimental conditions to determine the ambient reducing capacity 1 same hg addition with varying hg doc mass ratios and 2 same hg doc mass ratio within varying hg additions the experimental conduction procedures have been described in detail in jiang et al 2014 2015 and zhu et al 2018 in brief high purity n2 gas 99 99 aga sweden was introduced 0 2 l min 1 continuously into the system through all of the units to transport the hg 0 produced by a reduction in the reaction unit the washing unit containing cysteine solution was used to trap the possible traces of ionic and organic hg ii purged out from the reaction unit due to n2 gas flow hg 0 was eventually captured in an acidic kmno4 solution in the form of hg ii each 5 ml trap solution was collected at the given time intervals after a reduction of excess kmno4 by titration with 20 w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution until the red purple color totally disappeared the total hg in the trap solution was measured by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry cvaas ca 205 shanghai jingmi instrument china jiang et al 2014 2015 for each experimental condition duplicates were conducted for each dom sample two control experiments including dom alone and hg ii alone were prepared as blanks for all of the experiments blank values were used to correct the hg 0 production by subtraction to remove the backgrounds hg 0 produced by reduction was shown as the percentage of initial hg ii added into the reaction unit due to no organic interference in the trap unit the total hg 0 trapped by kmno4 after decolorization by nh2oh hcl was directly reduced with sncl2 and then the hg ii quantity was measured by cvaas usepa method 245 1 the detection limit of the mercury analysis instrument is 3 ng l 1 2 3 2 archg calculation and kinetic fitting according to the terminology of reducing capacity in peretyazhko and sposito 2006 the archg is a specific reducing capacity parameter representing the native reducing capacity of dom without pre reduction and other manipulations which is directly derived from hg ii reduction instead of fe iii or other oxidants as 1 mol hg ii needs 2 mol of electrons to form hg 0 the archg values of all samples were calculated by the electrons transferred per unit amount of doc at the kinetic end i e 72 h with regards to kinetics hg ii reduction entered into a slow phase and reached a plateau after 24 h thus 72 h is sufficient as the endpoint in this study we thus assumed a pseudo first order rate law for fitting the kinetic process for simplicity by accounting for one or two redox active pools of dom bauer et al 2007 pham et al 2012 the two pools are defined as dom1 the kinetically labile electron donating components e g hydroquinones and other polyphenolic moieties and dom2 the less labile electron donating components e g nonquinone moieties respectively 7 d hg0 hg ii 0 dt k obs 1 dom 1 dom bulk doc k obs 2 dom 2 dom bulk doc the time dependent solution to eq 7 leads to eq 8 8 hg0 hg ii 0 t dom1 1 e kobs1 t dom2 1 e kobs2 t where hg0 t is the concentration of the reduction product formed hg 0 at the time point of the kinetic process k obs 1 and k obs 2 represent the two kinetic phases including the rapid and slow stages respectively and dom1 and dom2 are the proportions of bulk dom representing the two different dom pools respectively the two dom pools are constrained by dom1 dom2 100 hg ii 0 is the initial hg ii concentration in react system 2 3 3 quality assessment and control a pure procedure for heavy metal analysis was conducted in this study the detection limit of this reduction system i e method detection limit was 15 ng l 1 hg ii all results were reported as the mean values standard deviation and statistical analyses were performed in originpro 2017 and spss 24 the detailed descriptions of quality assessment and control are listed in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 dom properties and origins 3 1 1 doc and cdom the doc concentration ranged from 1 17 to 33 81 mg l 1 with obvious spatial variation coefficient of variation cv 90 the three regions were significantly different from each other p 0 015 mountain lakes were generally clear water lakes with the lowest doc 3 32 1 71 mg l 1 whereas the southern boreal forest lakes were the most colored cdom 46 59 19 37 m 1 with the highest doc concentration of 17 40 6 83 mg l 1 fig 3 a after normalizing the cdom by the doc the cdom doc ratio was used for estimating the relative proportion of chromophores in bulk doc among the three regions the average cdom doc values were 1 93 0 64 tundra lakes 1 08 0 42 mountain lakes and 2 67 0 39 boreal forest lakes respectively this was indicative of the relative contribution of cdom to the bulk doc which was greatest in the lakes influenced by forests the high coefficient of determination r 2 0 95 of cdom versus doc for all samples fig 3b indicates that variations of chromophores in waters are a key factor in the doc spatial variations previous studies have revealed that the surrounding landscape i e land cover types and climate control the quality and quantities of dom in northern lakes kothawala et al 2014 larson et al 2014 including high latitude lakes osburn et al 2017 kellerman et al 2014 suggested that lakes with high doc concentrations contain the most diversity of dom because of new terrestrial imports thus it was not surprising to observe the highest doc and cdom in boreal forest lakes in this study in contrast the mountain lakes showed the lowest cdom and doc which can be attributed to the colder climate less precipitation and lack of vascular plant coverage which resulted in less terrestrial dom inputs compared to tundra and boreal areas for tundra lakes in norway located more than 300 km northwest of the mountain lakes the rich humic tundra soils provide more terrestrial dom input due to the frozen soil thawing and increasing precipitation in the summer which explains the higher dom than mountain lakes but less than forest lakes 3 1 2 dom optical properties and origins the dom optical properties were obviously different among the three groups of lakes fig 4 an higher suva254 after iron correction implies higher dom aromaticity indicating the greater contributions of allochthonous inputs of dom weishaar et al 2003 as shown in fig 4a the highest values were observed in boreal forest lakes 4 00 0 40 l mg c 1 m 1 however in arctic lakes dom from tundra lakes 3 05 0 76 l mg c 1 m 1 showed higher aromaticity than that from mountain lakes 2 11 0 53 l mg c 1 m 1 in contrast to the study by ripszam et al 2015 we did not observe a decline in the aromaticity of dom from high to low latitudes additionally the s r usually is negatively correlated with the dom molecular mass helms et al 2008 fichot and benner 2012 fichot et al 2013 the greatest s r value 1 00 0 16 was found in mountain lakes followed by tundra lakes 0 86 0 09 and forest lakes 0 73 0 02 which reflected that the dom with higher aromaticity and molecular mass in lakes was greatly influenced by forests rather than tundra bushes lichens or mosses which was further validated by the fluorescence parameters the fi 1 35 0 06 and bix 0 63 0 03 values of boreal forest lakes were close to the allochthonous end member fi 1 4 bix 0 7 mcknight et al 2001 huguet et al 2009 and mountain lakes fi 1 67 0 31 bix 0 89 0 16 were more adjacent to the autochthonous end member fig 4b and c additionally a higher rfe indicates a higher relative amount of algal compared to non algal inputs downing et al 2009 hansen et al 2016 the distribution of the rfe displays the highest values in arctic lakes and lowest in boreal forest lakes fig 5 b in terms of aromaticity poor explanations for doc variations were observed in the mountain and forest lakes fig 5a as well as for the cdom only in forest lakes fig 5b due to the limited size of the dataset however aromaticity showed a highly significant correlation with the doc and cdom respectively for all datasets for all three regions fig 5a b this suggests that doc and cdom are still relevant to reflect the changes in dom aromaticity in overall areas and could be used to estimate the variation of dom aromaticity in less equipped conditions for dom characterization meanwhile the ratio of cdom doc showed a highly significant correlation with the suva254 in the three categories of lakes fig 5c and can be strongly explained by the aromatic difference r 2 0 98 the relatively higher proportion of cdom which reflects the obvious terrestrial characteristics fig 5d as similar to fig 5b supports this however it should be emphasized that the good correlation between suva254 and the doc concentration may lead to a problem that it might not accurately estimate the biogeochemical reactivities of dom by only focusing on the dom characteristics if the reactions are also influenced by doc concentrations e g reactant doc ratios see 3 2 ambient reducing capacity determination and kinetic fitting 3 1 3 n c ratios and the two end member mixing model in addition to optical indicators e g fi we used the n c molar ratios and the classic model of two end member mixing to estimate the relative contributions from allochthonous and autochthonous sources to the bulk dom a simple comparison of n c molar ratios within well characterized reference samples from the international humic substances society ihss fig 6 a showed that dom in this study is from multiple sources higher n c ratios from arctic lakes viii and ix regions in fig 6a were similar with fulvic acid and bulk soils samples which were higher than the average n c ratio 0 038 0 021 in contrast to the arctic lakes boreal forest lakes showed closer value ranges 0 015 0 026 to reference bulk nom collected from terrestrial influencing aquatic systems 0 018 0 021 such as the suwannee river within a significant proportion of allochthonous om meanwhile the f auto was the highest in mountain lakes 50 15 followed by tundra lakes 27 10 as shown in the two end member mixing model fig 6b however samples from forest lakes 89 3 showed predominant allochthonous contributions thus our results further demonstrate that the dom in arctic lakes is less terrestrial dominant than in reference sites i e forest lakes between the two categories of arctic lakes tundra lakes are more terrestrial influenced compared to mountain lakes 3 2 ambient reducing capacity determination and kinetic fitting 3 2 1 experiment 1 same hg addition with the same hg addition the ambient reducing capacities of dom were determined by reacting 286 nm hg ii with original dom samples with a large doc concentration range 1 17 33 81 mg c l 1 for 72 h continuous purging kinetic experiments under dark anoxic conditions the hg doc ratios varied within the range of 5 2 14 9 mg g 1 with the boreal lake dom showing the lowest hg doc ratios due to the highest doc concentrations 9 02 33 81 mg c l 1 among all of the samples the archg ranged from 0 17 5 61 mmol e mol c 1 mean 2 17 1 78 mmol e mol c 1 which were significantly different among the three categories fig 7 a mountain lake dom showed the highest value 3 34 1 43 mmol e mol c 1 while boreal lake dom had the lowest 0 38 0 185 mmol e mol c 1 as shown in table 1 correlation analysis showed the quantitative and characteristic parameters of dom including the suva254 cdom cdom dom doc and f allo all of them showed significant negative correlations with the archg in contrast the archg was positively correlated with the rfe s r fi f auto and bix in appearance these correlations might lead to a conclusion that the dom with higher terrestrial contributions i e boreal lake dom had a lower reducing capacity compared to the higher electron donations from autochthonous derived dom i e mountain lake dom which is different from our initial expectation that autochthonous dominant dom has a lower rc values because of less aromaticity however it should be emphasized that the large variations of hg doc ratios should be considered to understand the relationship between the reducing capacity of dom and its characteristics previous studies have reported that the relative proportion of electron acceptors e g fe iii doc or hg ii doc ratio has a predominant influence on the observed reducing capacity of dom bauer et al 2007 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 2015 in this study the doc showed highly positive correlations with these characteristic parameters of dom e g suva254 fig 5a cdom fig 3b n c and f allo table s1 supporting information and negative correlations with the rfe f auto fi and bix table s1 supporting information indicating that high doc concentrations for example in boreal lakes are associated with high terrestrial inputs as a result the lowest archg value was observed in boreal lake dom with the same hg addition amount in the experiment which reflects the relative deficiency of electron acceptors i e hg ii rather than the relative insufficient electron donation capacities the results of this experiment explain why the reducing capacity of dom is not easy to be observed in the situation of an overly high doc concentration e g 50 mg l 1 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 2018b even though the dom is highly terrestrial dominant furthermore to avoid the multicollinearity between the quantitative e g hg doc and doc and qualitative parameters e g suva254 of dom we used partial least squares pls regression to fit and track the relative contributions of different influencing factors e g doc hg doc ratios suva254 and fi to the archg fig s1 supporting information the results support that the hg doc ratios resulting from doc variations together explained 85 of relative variance contributions for archg variations in contrast to the contributions from dom properties including its origins 3 2 2 experiment 2 same hg doc ratios under the condition with the same hg doc ratio 6 mg g 1 the archg differences among the three groups followed the order of boreal forest lakes 0 33 0 07 mmol e mol c 1 tundra lakes 0 27 0 05 mmol e mol c 1 and mountain lakes 0 20 0 05 mmol e mol c 1 fig 7b as the proportion of hg relative to the specific electron pool of individual dom is identical the hg doc ratio could not be an influencing factor and the differences in the archg can only be explained by the differences in the electron donation capacities of dom the archg values of all samples decreased with increasing autochthonousness of the dom table 1 the archg showed significant negative correlations with the fi f auto s r bix and rfe and positive correlations with the suva254 doc f allo cdom and cdom dom these correlations suggest that dom with a greater terrestrial contribution has a higher electron donation capacity the higher aromaticity and molecular size of aquatic dom might enrich the redox reactive functional groups such as polyphenols and quinones thus resulting in greater electron shuttle capacities for diverse aquatic dom samples scott et al 1998 aeschbacher et al 2012 sharpless et al 2014 aeschbacher et al 2012 quantified the electron donation capacities of different aquatic nom samples from lower latitudes by mediated electrochemical oxidation methods they found that nom from a sphagnum bog mainly terrestrial plant inputs and a coastal pond in antarctica mainly lichen and microorganism inputs could be the typical two end members and showed the highest and lowest reducing capacities respectively compared to the nom of mixed origins such as suwannee river with nom in the middle aeschbacher et al 2012 thus the effects of the aquatic dom origins on the arc reflect the vital role of phenolic and quinone moieties derived from terrestrial higher plants our study agrees with their findings showing a similar order of the rc values based on the influence of terrestrial inputs boreal forest lakes high tundra lakes median mountain lakes low table 1 and fig s2 supporting information additionally after comparing the archg values from the two experiments exp 1 and exp 2 the observed changes in the archg observed were not proportional to the changes of hg doc by the same ratio fig s3 supporting information which further implies the importance of heterogeneous dom structures steric extension of the dom structure might affect the availability of electron donating moieties this may be the reason for the linear deviations i e non linear change of the electron transfer capacity while the hg doc decreased which was caused by increasing the doc beyond a certain threshold concentration gu and chen 2003 blodau et al 2009 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 thus the calculated reducing capacity from manipulating bulk dom especially the dilution of higher doc concentrations into lower ones may overestimate the ambient reducing capacities of dom when its concentration i e doc is high in a real environment 3 2 3 kinetic fitting hg species are involved in binding with weak e g ro n containing groups and strong e g rsh groups sites of nom and are a crucial factor to control the complete kinetics and thermodynamics jiang et al 2015 zheng et al 2012 gu et al 2011 we estimated the concentration of rsh to be 0 15 of the doc mass skyllberg 2008 jiang et al 2015 or 0 5 μm rsh at 10 mg l 1 doc thus the threshold of the hg doc mass ratio accounting for hg saturation with strong sites of rsh such as in the form of hg sr 2 is approximately 4 6 mg g 1 this threshold is less than the lowest hg doc 5 2 mg g 1 of samples suggesting the oversaturation of hg with rsh in this study thus hg species with o n containing groups i e hg or 2 and rshgor are the predominant species hence the influence of competition for hg binding between weak and strong reduction sites is unlikely to be a limiting factor to control the complete kinetics in this study instead kinetics are mainly dependent on the electron donations from dom previous works have identified two redox reactive functional groups participating in the electron transfers of nom but only one is related to quinone moieties ratasuk and nanny 2007 pham et al 2012 hernández montoya et al 2012 which controls the rapid and slow kinetic phases based on the average kinetic curves of the three categories of dom fig 8 the fitted kinetic results were obtained by eq 5 and are listed in table 2 the ranges of k obv1 and k obv2 were 0 10 0 19 h 1 and 0 001 0 004 h 1 respectively the kinetic rates controlled by the labile electron donation component of dom dom1 were greater than by the less labile part dom2 dom1 and dom2 contributed 10 31 and 69 89 to the overall electron donations respectively the proportions of the two dom pools were similar to bauer et al 2007 who used the iron test method and reported fractions of 20 44 dom1 and 56 80 dom2 for the rapid and slow phase respectively additionally in some cases the sum of dom1 and dom2 is less than 100 table 2 suggesting that a small fraction 1 4 of redox moieties of dom were inert and did not participate in the reaction for each category of dom samples the k obv values for the two kinetic phases were similar table 2 between the two experimental conditions indicating that the kinetics of electron transfers from the two dom pools are independent of the hg doc ratio but associated with its intrinsic reducing capacity in contrast the fraction changes of the two dom pools at the two different experimental conditions suggest the inconsistent relative proportions of labile and less labile electron donation components in dom which may change due to the hg doc variations thus in exp 1 for the mountain lake dom the greatest dom1 31 is attributed to the highest hg doc resulting in the highest observed archg values even though the k obv is the slowest k obv1 0 10 h 1 and k obv2 0 002 h 1 on average compared to the dom from tundra k obv1 0 13 h 1 and k obv2 0 003 h 1 on average and forest lakes k obv1 0 19 h 1 and k obv2 0 004 h 1 on average since rapid reduction is the key step for hg ii reduction k obv1 decreased in the sequence of boreal forest lakes tundra lakes mountain lakes which further supports that the highest reducing capacity was in boreal forest lakes rather than the mountain lakes which was misled by the interference of various hg doc mass ratios 3 3 influence of complexed iron ii iron iii and ph previous studies have suggested that the influence of complexed iron could be a potential source of the reducing capacity from nom struyk and sposito 2001 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 purification for removing the iron is not practical if we consider that the bulk dom is also a system within predominant organic components under ambient inorganic conditions kothawala et al 2014 however the electron contribution from complexed fe iii fe ii would require a very high prior loading of iron for low carbon iron molar ratios e g 2 7 xie and shang 2005 in order to be significantly observed struyk and sposito 2001 xie and shang 2005 in this study all dom samples contain iron within a narrow range of 0 11 0 46 mg l 1 which is 0 16 0 05 mg l 1 in tundra lakes 0 13 0 01 mg l 1 in mountain lakes and 0 21 0 09 mg l 1 in forest lakes respectively therefore the carbon iron molar ratios were in the range of 33 723 average 232 183 in which the fe content in dom samples was far less than carbon by at least two orders of magnitude meanwhile a simple estimation of an extreme situation assuming that all iron is fe ii and can donate electrons by a 1 1 m stoichiometry showed that the calculated contributions to reducing capacities from fe ii were only accountable for only 0 1 3 0 of the observed ambient reducing capacities of dom additionally the redox buffering mechanism of dom for preserving fe ii daugherty et al 2017 could inhibit the influence of iron on the redox properties of dom itself in such narrow kinetic window i e 72 h as a consequence iron in dom is unlikely to substantially affect the reducing capacity observed on the other hand the influences of ph on the redox characteristics of dom mainly include 1 speciation of the chemical probe e g heavy metals and 2 dom steric structures both indicate that the reduction of hg by various dom could be strongly ph dependent previous studies have shown that the ph influence on the nom redox characteristics involves deprotonation and protonation which resulted in effects of either enhancement or inhibition helburn and maccarthy 1994 bauer et al 2007 ratasuk and nanny 2007 aeschbacher et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 walpen et al 2018 however the ph of all dom samples showed a narrow range of 4 64 5 77 in this study compared to the above literature that had large ph differences furthermore no significant correlation was found between the ph and the archg at two conditions fig s4 supporting information which may excludes the possibility of a substantial effect from ph changes 3 4 notes and limits several previous studies have illustrated that quinone moieties as the most redox prone component of natural organic matter could be derived from the degradation of lignin i e terrestrial inputs and microbial synthesis i e internal aquatic processes stevenson 1994 mcknight et al 1991 extracted fulvic acid from lake fryxell of the antarctic which despite being devoid of vascular plants showed obvious redox properties scott et al 1998 the similar redox characteristic was also observed in sample from pony lake of the antarctic aeschbacher et al 2012 thus besides the terrestrial dominant dom pool even dom from the aquatic environments influenced less by terrestrial inputs such as the reported antarctic lakes and the arctic lakes in this study can still serve as electron donors additionally all dom samples in this study were not pre reduced and kept their original status without manipulation the observed reducing capacities substantiate that some portion of the redox components e g phenolic and semiquinone moieties cannot be fully oxidized and reserve the potential for electron donation to certain degrees even in air exposure conditions this is supported by the previous works ratasuk and nanny 2007 bauer and kappler 2009 and the study even including the fully reoxidized dom samples maurer et al 2010 additionally it should be emphasized that we cannot extend too much of the influences of the dom reducing capacity to hg geochemistry as the higher hg doc mass ratios used in this study were higher than ratios in the pristine environment less than 0 1 mg g 1 however this study used the hg reduction process to assess the electron donation potential of dom which might partially unveil the effect of dom on hg abiotic reduction in highly contaminated aquatic sites such as the rice paddy fields and lakes in hg mine areas zhao et al 2016 feng et al 2018 this study revealed that the archg values are not only controlled by the dom composition and origins but also related to the complexation with dom involving metals doc ratios on the other hand from the perspective of the hg biogeochemical cycle and atmosphere surface exchange zhu et al 2016 our results could further provide a partial explanation to estimate whether organic rich environments are sinks osterwalder et al 2017 or sources jiskra et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 for the mercury cycle particularly in the arctic regions which have been estimated as globally significant mercury schuster et al 2018 and terrestrial organic carbon pools vonk et al 2015 without regards to the deficiency of electron acceptors e g hg ii only focusing on the electron donation pool as shown in exp 1 could lead to the misjudging of the reducing capacities of dom in real situations furthermore the results from this study show that the dom origins and composition have a large impact on its reactivity with hg which supports our previous observation jiang et al 2018a b and other reports schartup et al 2015b jonsson et al 2017 importantly this study further illustrates that dom optical characterization is a useful tool for unveiling the relationship between dom and hg lescord et al 2018 however the limitations of this study need to be noted the experiments were conducted in constant room temperature and cannot represent the actual temperature variation in the real environment which may be particularly critical for investigating the changes in dom in the arctic lakes that are experiencing global warming additionally competition from other divalent cations higher iron carbon ratios in some environments and the influences of ph and high concentrations of chloride are still unknown additionally this study is specifically designed to investigate the spatial variations of dom associated with the ambient reducing capacity instead of on a temporal scale hence further temporal long term investigation and repetitions will be necessary on laboratory scale and natural aquatic systems respectively 4 conclusion our study examined the influences of the dom origins and properties on its ambient reducing capacity in high latitude lakes the results demonstrated that dom as an electron provider is ubiquitous in aquatic systems regardless of latitudes the effects of the dom origins on the reducing capacities reflect that terrestrial dominant dom e g in boreal forest lakes is more reactive than dom with a reduced terrestrial property e g arctic including tundra and mountain lakes however only the dom quality cannot explain the observed differences in the arc this study highlights that terrestrial dominant characteristics of dom with higher aromaticity could not ensure a significantly greater electron donation in practical observations as a relative indicator the arc is also dependent on the relative proportions of oxidants and the dom concentration i e doc for example the hg doc ratio in this study therefore when using heavy metals as oxidants for measuring the reducing capacity we suggest that comparisons among different dom samples can be conducted while the oxidant doc ratios are kept the same level and should be reported on the other hand regarding dom being a black box mixture it is recommended to use the arc without manipulation to reflect the native electron transfer capacity of dom in the given environmental conditions which is also more relevant to real circumstances additionally as a supplement for the traditional chemical probe methods for reducing capacity measurements the hg ii reduction method can be used even in high doc conditions especially organic rich environments such as humic lakes or eutrophic waters as projected in the arctic region permafrost thaws heavily influence the composition and characteristics of dom in arctic aquatic systems which imposes further feedback on the carbon cycle and thus climate change consequently further investigation of the coupling influences of dom on mercury and carbon cycles in the future may establish links between hg cycles in the context of climate change especially in the rapidly changing

18334,the reducing capacity rc of natural organic matter plays an important role in the carbon cycle and biogeochemical fates of environmental contaminants in the aquatic system however the electron donation potentials of dissolved organic matter dom from high latitude lakes are still uncertain in this study we collected dom samples from high latitude lakes across the arctic and boreal regions in sweden and norway to investigate the effects of the dom concentration and characteristics on its ambient reducing capacity arc mercury hg ii abiotic reduction in darkness was used to determine the arc the results showed that the dom in arctic lakes is less terrestrial dominant than in reference sites i e forest lakes between the two categories of arctic lakes tundra lakes are more terrestrial influenced compared to mountain lakes additionally terrestrial originated dom is a main controlling factor for enhancing the ambient reducing capacity whereas the dom concentration i e dissolved organic carbon doc resulted in variations in the hg doc ratios that also cause the variations of the observed arc values thus comparisons of the arc values can be conducted while oxidant doc ratios are kept the same and reported through the method using heavy metals as a chemical probe after correction for hg doc ratio interference the ambient reducing capacity of dom followed the order boreal forest lakes arctic tundra lakes arctic mountain lakes this study highlights that the dom concentration should also be considered when estimating the arc as compared to the previous that mainly focusing on the properties of dom such as its origins as climate change is projected to be severe in high latitudes this study demonstrates a significant connection between aquatic dom geochemical reactivity and terrestrial inputs which is crucial for a better prediction of the role of dom in high latitude lakes in the context of climate change graphical abstract image 1 keywords arctic ambient

2014 osburn et al 2017 which act as a potential source of greenhouse gases such as co2 and ch4 schuur et al 2015 o donnell et al 2016 ongoing climate change has resulted in the permafrost thawing which can promote the release of carbon previously stored in terrestrial systems vonk et al 2015 into adjacent lakes during the past decades several studies have qualitatively and quantitatively addressed various aspects of dissolved organic matter dom in arctic rivers cory et al 2014 o donnell et al 2016 kaiser et al 2017 lakes cory et al 2014 osburn et al 2017 and oceans shen et al 2016 mann et al 2016 and reported that terrigenous dom is abundant and widely distributed in arctic surface waters the internal links between the carbon cycle resulting from dom bio photodegradation and dom quality have also been explicitly established cory et al 2013 2014 larouche et al 2015 kaiser et al 2017 however there have been fewer studies to assess the relationships between dom properties e g origins and its biogeochemical reactivities e g reducing capacity in these areas as compared with other studies in low latitude aquatic systems investigation of the origins characteristics and biogeochemical reactivities of dom in such regions is therefore crucial for a further understanding of the regional carbon dynamics karlsson and giesler 2008 cory et al 2013 2014 kokic et al 2015 and the relevant environmental fates of contaminants in the arctic environment wei hass et al 2014 schartup et al 2015a jonsson et al 2017 among all of biogeochemical reactivities of dom the redox characteristics play an important role not only in the production of co2 and ch4 blodau et al 2007 knorr and blodau 2009 gao et al 2019 but also in the chemical speciation bioavailability toxicity and mobility of various elements and contaminants in aquatic systems for example the electron donating transfer ability of dom facilitates the reduction of many elements such as sulfur s yu et al 2015 poulin et al 2017 iron fe lovley et al 1996 lovley and blunt harris 1999 scott et al 1998 kappler et al 2004 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 jiang and kappler 2008 and copper cu pham et al 2012 maurer et al 2013 as well as the reduction of redox sensitive trace heavy elements and even radionuclides such as chromium cr gu and chen 2003 mercury hg gu et al 2011 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2015 uranium u gu and chen 2003 gu et al 2005 and neptunium np shcherbina et al 2007 reductive degradation of organic contaminants could also be mediated by dom kappler and haderlein 2003 thus determining the electron transfer potential of dom is a key step to understand its crucial roles in diverse environments quantitatively the electron donation capacity of natural organic matter nom also called the reducing capacity rc is defined as the moles of electrons that can be donated or transferred by the per unit amount of nom e g normalized carbon amount to date extensive studies have been carried out to assess the reducing capacities of dom with a wide range of values reported depending on varying quantification methods and nom origins macalady and walton day 2011 sposito 2011 it remains a major challenge to accurately determine the reducing capacity or reflect the relevant environments typically two types of methods have been widely used in parallel in the past 1 the chemical probe method i e wet chemical method lovley et al 1996 scott et al 1998 kappler et al 2004 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 jiang and kappler 2008 and 2 the electrochemical method aeschbacher et al 2010 2012 nurmi and tratnyek 2011 there is an argument about the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods although the chemical probe method is a traditional approach that relies on reaction with added chemical oxidants such as the fe iii species kappler et al 2004 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 bauer et al 2007 roden et al 2010 it may result less accuracy than the electrochemical method due to indirect measurement and poorly controlled experimental conditions e g e h aeschbacher et al 2010 gao et al 2019 however it has a unique advantage that it can reflect the kinetic and thermodynamic processes involving the complexation e g rearrangement of binding sites between target contaminants and dom structures i e binding groups and electron transfer moieties shcherbina et al 2007 gu et al 2011 pham et al 2012 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2015 if the study aims to study a specific contaminant especially trace heavy metals e g hg thus the electrochemical method cannot replace the chemical probe method especially in less well equipped laboratories and in field analyses macalady and walton day 2011 the most popular and widely used chemical probes in the previous studies are ferric compounds such as ferric citrate lovley et al 1996 lovley and blunt harris 1999 scott et al 1998 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 and hexacyanoferrate helburn and maccarthy 1994 kappler and haderlein 2003 kappler et al 2004 jiang and kappler 2008 where fe ii was quantified by a ferrozine assay stookey 1970 viollier et al 2000 the reducing capacity is usually calculated by quantifying the electrons transferring from organic matter to fe iii while forming fe ii traditionally this iron test method requires manipulation of bulk dom first including doc dilution ph adjustment buffer addition or even pre reduction thus the reducing capacity is more likely an operational parameter which is slightly far from that of the real environment especially in high doc conditions for example dom in the sediment of pore water shows a reducing capacity for hg ii after dilution in the laboratory however we found the contribution of electrons from dom was negligible due to the high doc in the real environment jiang et al 2018b additionally as dom is an operational definition of water mixtures water chemistry e g inorganic background such as the ph influences its properties and further results in a changed biogeochemical reactivity thereby dom should be considered as a system in which organic components are predominant but within the specific steric structures under the ambient inorganic backgrounds kothawala et al 2014 thus we proposed the parameter of the ambient i e apparent reducing capacity arc as a further supplement for the chemical probe methods according to the proposed concept of the nom reducing capacity from the pioneering works by kappler and sposito kappler et al 2004 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 sposito 2011 the ambient reducing capacity can be directly obtained from the original dom samples without manipulation by using the chemical probe method representing the specific reducing capacity of dom in an ambient environment especially regarding the samples with high doc concentrations for determining the arc traditional colorimetry in the iron test method has limitations due to the complexation of fe iii fe ii with dom viollier et al 2000 poulin et al 2014 and influence of chromophoric dom cdom xiao et al 2013 2015 alternatively we selected the hg abiotic reduction in dark conditions alberts et al 1974 allard and arsenie 1991 gu et al 2011 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 2015 lee et al 2019 to determine the arc of dissolved organic matter hereafter the archg one of the advantages of hg ii reduction is that hg is a unique heavy metal element that has a gaseous phase i e hg 0 which can be continuously purged into robust oxidizing solution e g kmno4 or aqua regia or a gold coated glass trap for further independently measuring the hg ii compared to the iron test the reduction of hg ii avoids interferences from the further interaction between the reductive product and dom in the system additionally measurement of the trapped hg ii is conducted by cold vapor fluorescence or an absorption method instead of colorimetry which is independent of the reduction system containing dom and thus avoids the influences of chromophoric dom previous studies of humic or soil organic matter illustrated higher reducing capacity is associated with higher aromaticity derived allochthonous sources macalady and walton day 2011 therefore we hypothesized that dom from lakes with higher terrestrial inputs e g forest lakes shows higher electron donation capacities dom samples were collected from 29 northern lakes situated across a latitude gradient from 67 3 to 69 3 n in sweden and norway i e above the arctic circle and further extending to the boreal region of sweden as a reference 63 6 64 3 n to address the knowledge gaps as all mentioned above the main aims of this study were three fold 1 to characterize the properties and origins of dom in the arctic lakes 2 to quantify the arc of dissolved organic matter using the hg ii reduction method and 3 evaluate the influences of dom origins and properties on its arc 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling strategy generally the origins of lake dom consist of both autochthonous i e produced in the lake such as microbial and algae and allochthonous i e external inputs such as terrestrial runoff or leaching which are dependent on the specific environmental conditions including catchment characteristics and climate sobek et al 2007 kothawala et al 2014 larson et al 2014 jiang et al 2018a b the dom samples were collected from 29 high latitude lakes in the arctic and boreal areas from andenes norway to abisko sweden and then finally to umeå of sweden fig 1 according to the surrounding landscapes we divided the 29 lakes into three categories including tundra mountain and boreal forest lakes respectively fig 1 the nine lakes investigated in norway are arctic tundra lakes n 9 within the permafrost tundra landscapes partially mixed with dwarf shrubs mire and peatland arctic mountain lakes n 10 are thermokarst lakes surrounded by mosses lichens and dwarf shrubs ten boreal forest lakes n 10 are located in northern sweden within the boreal forest landscapes and the dominant tree species include scots pine norway spruces and some birch all water samples of arctic lakes were collected during the summer of 2018 july to august boreal forest lakes were sampled from may to june of 2018 samples were collected 30 cm below the surface water in a well mixed location and syringe filtered in situ using a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter sarstedt germany two parameters of the water including the ph and conductivity were measured in situ using the ph conductivity portable combo meter hi 98129 hanna italy a part of the original water sample 0 5 1 l was kept intact as backup storage all samples were stored in the dark and kept in ice storage boxes during the sampling campaign and transportation and they were stored in the 4 c low temperature storage room before analysis 2 2 dom property analysis 2 2 1 dom characterization the dom concentration represented by dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn were measured using a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu japan as represented by the dissolved organic carbon doc mg l 1 additionally we measured the nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 using ion selective electrodes bante instrument shanghai china and subtracted them from the tn to obtain the dissolved organic nitrogen don the nitrogen carbon molar ratio i e n c was calculated as the don doc for optical characterization of the dom fluorescence and uv vis measurements were conducted in a 10 mm quartz cuvette using an aqualog horiba japan absorption fluorescence spectroscopy instrument equipped with a 150 w ozone free xenon lamp at constant room temperature 20 c for emission excitation matrices eems of the fluorescence spectra scan milli q water 18 2 m cm was used as a blank to be subtracted from sample eems to remove the interferences of water raman peaks eems were corrected for the inner filter effect using the parallel absorbance measurements from the same sample and blank yang and hur 2014 using the aqualog eems data processing software which also adjusted the instrument specific excitation and emission effects these corrections were also double checked using originpro 2017 the emission spectral range was 250 620 nm in 3 18 nm steps and the excitation spectral range was 230 450 nm with steps of 5 nm the scan integration time was 3 s the uv vis scan ranged from 230 to 800 nm with a 1 nm interval milli q water was used as the blank the naperian absorption coefficient a at wavelength λ nm was calculated as 1 a λ 2 303 a l where a is the absorbance and l is the cuvette path length m the fraction of dom having light absorbing properties called chromophoric dom cdom is an important means of quantifying the pool of dom the absorption coefficient at 355 nm a 355 was chosen to represent the quantity of cdom jiang et al 2018b the dom samples with high doc concentrations e g samples from boreal forest lakes were diluted to doc 10 mg l 1 before all spectra scanning including absorption and fluorescence to avoid the inner filter effect thus the original abundance of cdom reported in this study was calculated by multiplying the measured values by the dilution factor 2 2 2 dom spectral parameters and the two end member mixing model after iron correction the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 associated with dom aromaticity and humification was calculated as a254 normalized by the doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 in both wavelength ranges 275 295 nm and 350 400 nm the spectral slope s of the dom absorption curve was fitted by a nonlinear regression using eq 2 2 a λ a λr exp s λ λr where λr is a reference wavelength moreover the spectral slope ratio s r was calculated by eq 3 helms et al 2008 3 s r s 275 295 s 350 400 through fluorescence analysis for distinguishing dom sources the fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at the emission wavelengths of 450 and 500 nm excitation wavelength was kept at 370 nm mcknight et al 2001 huguet et al 2009 additionally the biological index bix an indicator of the newly produced dom from microbial algae origins i e autochthonous inputs also called the freshness index was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity at 380 nm to the emission intensity of the maximum value in the range of 420 435 nm with excitation at 310 nm wilson and xenopoulos 2009 fellman et al 2010 the relative fluorescence efficiency rfe was calculated by the fluorescence intensity at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm divided by the absorbance at 370 nm which represents the relative amounts of algal and non algal moieties of dom downing et al 2009 hansen et al 2016 for further tracking the dom origins as a cross validation we also used the mixing model of the nitrogen carbon ratio to estimate the fractions of terrestrial i e allochthonous and non terrestrial i e autochthonous contributions to the dom perdue and koprivnjak 2007 jiang et al 2018b 4 f a l l o

and autochthonous sources respectively and n c allo and n c auto are for the two end members including the allochthonousness 0 01 and autochthonousness 0 1 respectively perdue and koprivnjak 2007 jiang et al 2018b 2 3 determination of the archg by hg ii abiotic reduction assays 2 3 1 reduction kinetic experimental set up a continuously purging incubation system was established for the hg ii abiotic reduction assays fig 2 following the setup described in our previous works jiang et al 2014 2015 zhu et al 2018 kinetic experiments were conducted with 7 time intervals 10 min 30 min 2 h 6 h 24 h 48 h and 72 h eight systems mainly consisted of three components including reaction washing and trap units that are borosilicate bottles reaction units with teflon caps containing hg ii and dom were wrapped with aluminum foil and kept in the dark throughout the entire experimental period reaction and trap solutions were both continuously mixed using a teflon magnetic bar and a magnetic stirrer topolino ika the speed of the magnetic bar was adjusted to 25 rpm to obtaining a steady vortex on the solution surface all units in this system were connected by teflon tubes we set two experimental conditions to determine the ambient reducing capacity 1 same hg addition with varying hg doc mass ratios and 2 same hg doc mass ratio within varying hg additions the experimental conduction procedures have been described in detail in jiang et al 2014 2015 and zhu et al 2018 in brief high purity n2 gas 99 99 aga sweden was introduced 0 2 l min 1 continuously into the system through all of the units to transport the hg 0 produced by a reduction in the reaction unit the washing unit containing cysteine solution was used to trap the possible traces of ionic and organic hg ii purged out from the reaction unit due to n2 gas flow hg 0 was eventually captured in an acidic kmno4 solution in the form of hg ii each 5 ml trap solution was collected at the given time intervals after a reduction of excess kmno4 by titration with 20 w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution until the red purple color totally disappeared the total hg in the trap solution was measured by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry cvaas ca 205 shanghai jingmi instrument china jiang et al 2014 2015 for each experimental condition duplicates were conducted for each dom sample two control experiments including dom alone and hg ii alone were prepared as blanks for all of the experiments blank values were used to correct the hg 0 production by subtraction to remove the backgrounds hg 0 produced by reduction was shown as the percentage of initial hg ii added into the reaction unit due to no organic interference in the trap unit the total hg 0 trapped by kmno4 after decolorization by nh2oh hcl was directly reduced with sncl2 and then the hg ii quantity was measured by cvaas usepa method 245 1 the detection limit of the mercury analysis instrument is 3 ng l 1 2 3 2 archg calculation and kinetic fitting according to the terminology of reducing capacity in peretyazhko and sposito 2006 the archg is a specific reducing capacity parameter representing the native reducing capacity of dom without pre reduction and other manipulations which is directly derived from hg ii reduction instead of fe iii or other oxidants as 1 mol hg ii needs 2 mol of electrons to form hg 0 the archg values of all samples were calculated by the electrons transferred per unit amount of doc at the kinetic end i e 72 h with regards to kinetics hg ii reduction entered into a slow phase and reached a plateau after 24 h thus 72 h is sufficient as the endpoint in this study we thus assumed a pseudo first order rate law for fitting the kinetic process for simplicity by accounting for one or two redox active pools of dom bauer et al 2007 pham et al 2012 the two pools are defined as dom1 the kinetically labile electron donating components e g hydroquinones and other polyphenolic moieties and dom2 the less labile electron donating components e g nonquinone moieties respectively 7 d hg0 hg ii 0 dt k obs 1 dom 1 dom bulk doc k obs 2 dom 2 dom bulk doc the time dependent solution to eq 7 leads to eq 8 8 hg0 hg ii 0 t dom1 1 e kobs1 t dom2 1 e kobs2 t where hg0 t is the concentration of the reduction product formed hg 0 at the time point of the kinetic process k obs 1 and k obs 2 represent the two kinetic phases including the rapid and slow stages respectively and dom1 and dom2 are the proportions of bulk dom representing the two different dom pools respectively the two dom pools are constrained by dom1 dom2 100 hg ii 0 is the initial hg ii concentration in react system 2 3 3 quality assessment and control a pure procedure for heavy metal analysis was conducted in this study the detection limit of this reduction system i e method detection limit was 15 ng l 1 hg ii all results were reported as the mean values standard deviation and statistical analyses were performed in originpro 2017 and spss 24 the detailed descriptions of quality assessment and control are listed in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 dom properties and origins 3 1 1 doc and cdom the doc concentration ranged from 1 17 to 33 81 mg l 1 with obvious spatial variation coefficient of variation cv 90 the three regions were significantly different from each other p 0 015 mountain lakes were generally clear water lakes with the lowest doc 3 32 1 71 mg l 1 whereas the southern boreal forest lakes were the most colored cdom 46 59 19 37 m 1 with the highest doc concentration of 17 40 6 83 mg l 1 fig 3 a after normalizing the cdom by the doc the cdom doc ratio was used for estimating the relative proportion of chromophores in bulk doc among the three regions the average cdom doc values were 1 93 0 64 tundra lakes 1 08 0 42 mountain lakes and 2 67 0 39 boreal forest lakes respectively this was indicative of the relative contribution of cdom to the bulk doc which was greatest in the lakes influenced by forests the high coefficient of determination r 2 0 95 of cdom versus doc for all samples fig 3b indicates that variations of chromophores in waters are a key factor in the doc spatial variations previous studies have revealed that the surrounding landscape i e land cover types and climate control the quality and quantities of dom in northern lakes kothawala et al 2014 larson et al 2014 including high latitude lakes osburn et al 2017 kellerman et al 2014 suggested that lakes with high doc concentrations contain the most diversity of dom because of new terrestrial imports thus it was not surprising to observe the highest doc and cdom in boreal forest lakes in this study in contrast the mountain lakes showed the lowest cdom and doc which can be attributed to the colder climate less precipitation and lack of vascular plant coverage which resulted in less terrestrial dom inputs compared to tundra and boreal areas for tundra lakes in norway located more than 300 km northwest of the mountain lakes the rich humic tundra soils provide more terrestrial dom input due to the frozen soil thawing and increasing precipitation in the summer which explains the higher dom than mountain lakes but less than forest lakes 3 1 2 dom optical properties and origins the dom optical properties were obviously different among the three groups of lakes fig 4 an higher suva254 after iron correction implies higher dom aromaticity indicating the greater contributions of allochthonous inputs of dom weishaar et al 2003 as shown in fig 4a the highest values were observed in boreal forest lakes 4 00 0 40 l mg c 1 m 1 however in arctic lakes dom from tundra lakes 3 05 0 76 l mg c 1 m 1 showed higher aromaticity than that from mountain lakes 2 11 0 53 l mg c 1 m 1 in contrast to the study by ripszam et al 2015 we did not observe a decline in the aromaticity of dom from high to low latitudes additionally the s r usually is negatively correlated with the dom molecular mass helms et al 2008 fichot and benner 2012 fichot et al 2013 the greatest s r value 1 00 0 16 was found in mountain lakes followed by tundra lakes 0 86 0 09 and forest lakes 0 73 0 02 which reflected that the dom with higher aromaticity and molecular mass in lakes was greatly influenced by forests rather than tundra bushes lichens or mosses which was further validated by the fluorescence parameters the fi 1 35 0 06 and bix 0 63 0 03 values of boreal forest lakes were close to the allochthonous end member fi 1 4 bix 0 7 mcknight et al 2001 huguet et al 2009 and mountain lakes fi 1 67 0 31 bix 0 89 0 16 were more adjacent to the autochthonous end member fig 4b and c additionally a higher rfe indicates a higher relative amount of algal compared to non algal inputs downing et al 2009 hansen et al 2016 the distribution of the rfe displays the highest values in arctic lakes and lowest in boreal forest lakes fig 5 b in terms of aromaticity poor explanations for doc variations were observed in the mountain and forest lakes fig 5a as well as for the cdom only in forest lakes fig 5b due to the limited size of the dataset however aromaticity showed a highly significant correlation with the doc and cdom respectively for all datasets for all three regions fig 5a b this suggests that doc and cdom are still relevant to reflect the changes in dom aromaticity in overall areas and could be used to estimate the variation of dom aromaticity in less equipped conditions for dom characterization meanwhile the ratio of cdom doc showed a highly significant correlation with the suva254 in the three categories of lakes fig 5c and can be strongly explained by the aromatic difference r 2 0 98 the relatively higher proportion of cdom which reflects the obvious terrestrial characteristics fig 5d as similar to fig 5b supports this however it should be emphasized that the good correlation between suva254 and the doc concentration may lead to a problem that it might not accurately estimate the biogeochemical reactivities of dom by only focusing on the dom characteristics if the reactions are also influenced by doc concentrations e g reactant doc ratios see 3 2 ambient reducing capacity determination and kinetic fitting 3 1 3 n c ratios and the two end member mixing model in addition to optical indicators e g fi we used the n c molar ratios and the classic model of two end member mixing to estimate the relative contributions from allochthonous and autochthonous sources to the bulk dom a simple comparison of n c molar ratios within well characterized reference samples from the international humic substances society ihss fig 6 a showed that dom in this study is from multiple sources higher n c ratios from arctic lakes viii and ix regions in fig 6a were similar with fulvic acid and bulk soils samples which were higher than the average n c ratio 0 038 0 021 in contrast to the arctic lakes boreal forest lakes showed closer value ranges 0 015 0 026 to reference bulk nom collected from terrestrial influencing aquatic systems 0 018 0 021 such as the suwannee river within a significant proportion of allochthonous om meanwhile the f auto was the highest in mountain lakes 50 15 followed by tundra lakes 27 10 as shown in the two end member mixing model fig 6b however samples from forest lakes 89 3 showed predominant allochthonous contributions thus our results further demonstrate that the dom in arctic lakes is less terrestrial dominant than in reference sites i e forest lakes between the two categories of arctic lakes tundra lakes are more terrestrial influenced compared to mountain lakes 3 2 ambient reducing capacity determination and kinetic fitting 3 2 1 experiment 1 same hg addition with the same hg addition the ambient reducing capacities of dom were determined by reacting 286 nm hg ii with original dom samples with a large doc concentration range 1 17 33 81 mg c l 1 for 72 h continuous purging kinetic experiments under dark anoxic conditions the hg doc ratios varied within the range of 5 2 14 9 mg g 1 with the boreal lake dom showing the lowest hg doc ratios due to the highest doc concentrations 9 02 33 81 mg c l 1 among all of the samples the archg ranged from 0 17 5 61 mmol e mol c 1 mean 2 17 1 78 mmol e mol c 1 which were significantly different among the three categories fig 7 a mountain lake dom showed the highest value 3 34 1 43 mmol e mol c 1 while boreal lake dom had the lowest 0 38 0 185 mmol e mol c 1 as shown in table 1 correlation analysis showed the quantitative and characteristic parameters of dom including the suva254 cdom cdom dom doc and f allo all of them showed significant negative correlations with the archg in contrast the archg was positively correlated with the rfe s r fi f auto and bix in appearance these correlations might lead to a conclusion that the dom with higher terrestrial contributions i e boreal lake dom had a lower reducing capacity compared to the higher electron donations from autochthonous derived dom i e mountain lake dom which is different from our initial expectation that autochthonous dominant dom has a lower rc values because of less aromaticity however it should be emphasized that the large variations of hg doc ratios should be considered to understand the relationship between the reducing capacity of dom and its characteristics previous studies have reported that the relative proportion of electron acceptors e g fe iii doc or hg ii doc ratio has a predominant influence on the observed reducing capacity of dom bauer et al 2007 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 2015 in this study the doc showed highly positive correlations with these characteristic parameters of dom e g suva254 fig 5a cdom fig 3b n c and f allo table s1 supporting information and negative correlations with the rfe f auto fi and bix table s1 supporting information indicating that high doc concentrations for example in boreal lakes are associated with high terrestrial inputs as a result the lowest archg value was observed in boreal lake dom with the same hg addition amount in the experiment which reflects the relative deficiency of electron acceptors i e hg ii rather than the relative insufficient electron donation capacities the results of this experiment explain why the reducing capacity of dom is not easy to be observed in the situation of an overly high doc concentration e g 50 mg l 1 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 2018b even though the dom is highly terrestrial dominant furthermore to avoid the multicollinearity between the quantitative e g hg doc and doc and qualitative parameters e g suva254 of dom we used partial least squares pls regression to fit and track the relative contributions of different influencing factors e g doc hg doc ratios suva254 and fi to the archg fig s1 supporting information the results support that the hg doc ratios resulting from doc variations together explained 85 of relative variance contributions for archg variations in contrast to the contributions from dom properties including its origins 3 2 2 experiment 2 same hg doc ratios under the condition with the same hg doc ratio 6 mg g 1 the archg differences among the three groups followed the order of boreal forest lakes 0 33 0 07 mmol e mol c 1 tundra lakes 0 27 0 05 mmol e mol c 1 and mountain lakes 0 20 0 05 mmol e mol c 1 fig 7b as the proportion of hg relative to the specific electron pool of individual dom is identical the hg doc ratio could not be an influencing factor and the differences in the archg can only be explained by the differences in the electron donation capacities of dom the archg values of all samples decreased with increasing autochthonousness of the dom table 1 the archg showed significant negative correlations with the fi f auto s r bix and rfe and positive correlations with the suva254 doc f allo cdom and cdom dom these correlations suggest that dom with a greater terrestrial contribution has a higher electron donation capacity the higher aromaticity and molecular size of aquatic dom might enrich the redox reactive functional groups such as polyphenols and quinones thus resulting in greater electron shuttle capacities for diverse aquatic dom samples scott et al 1998 aeschbacher et al 2012 sharpless et al 2014 aeschbacher et al 2012 quantified the electron donation capacities of different aquatic nom samples from lower latitudes by mediated electrochemical oxidation methods they found that nom from a sphagnum bog mainly terrestrial plant inputs and a coastal pond in antarctica mainly lichen and microorganism inputs could be the typical two end members and showed the highest and lowest reducing capacities respectively compared to the nom of mixed origins such as suwannee river with nom in the middle aeschbacher et al 2012 thus the effects of the aquatic dom origins on the arc reflect the vital role of phenolic and quinone moieties derived from terrestrial higher plants our study agrees with their findings showing a similar order of the rc values based on the influence of terrestrial inputs boreal forest lakes high tundra lakes median mountain lakes low table 1 and fig s2 supporting information additionally after comparing the archg values from the two experiments exp 1 and exp 2 the observed changes in the archg observed were not proportional to the changes of hg doc by the same ratio fig s3 supporting information which further implies the importance of heterogeneous dom structures steric extension of the dom structure might affect the availability of electron donating moieties this may be the reason for the linear deviations i e non linear change of the electron transfer capacity while the hg doc decreased which was caused by increasing the doc beyond a certain threshold concentration gu and chen 2003 blodau et al 2009 zheng et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 thus the calculated reducing capacity from manipulating bulk dom especially the dilution of higher doc concentrations into lower ones may overestimate the ambient reducing capacities of dom when its concentration i e doc is high in a real environment 3 2 3 kinetic fitting hg species are involved in binding with weak e g ro n containing groups and strong e g rsh groups sites of nom and are a crucial factor to control the complete kinetics and thermodynamics jiang et al 2015 zheng et al 2012 gu et al 2011 we estimated the concentration of rsh to be 0 15 of the doc mass skyllberg 2008 jiang et al 2015 or 0 5 μm rsh at 10 mg l 1 doc thus the threshold of the hg doc mass ratio accounting for hg saturation with strong sites of rsh such as in the form of hg sr 2 is approximately 4 6 mg g 1 this threshold is less than the lowest hg doc 5 2 mg g 1 of samples suggesting the oversaturation of hg with rsh in this study thus hg species with o n containing groups i e hg or 2 and rshgor are the predominant species hence the influence of competition for hg binding between weak and strong reduction sites is unlikely to be a limiting factor to control the complete kinetics in this study instead kinetics are mainly dependent on the electron donations from dom previous works have identified two redox reactive functional groups participating in the electron transfers of nom but only one is related to quinone moieties ratasuk and nanny 2007 pham et al 2012 hernández montoya et al 2012 which controls the rapid and slow kinetic phases based on the average kinetic curves of the three categories of dom fig 8 the fitted kinetic results were obtained by eq 5 and are listed in table 2 the ranges of k obv1 and k obv2 were 0 10 0 19 h 1 and 0 001 0 004 h 1 respectively the kinetic rates controlled by the labile electron donation component of dom dom1 were greater than by the less labile part dom2 dom1 and dom2 contributed 10 31 and 69 89 to the overall electron donations respectively the proportions of the two dom pools were similar to bauer et al 2007 who used the iron test method and reported fractions of 20 44 dom1 and 56 80 dom2 for the rapid and slow phase respectively additionally in some cases the sum of dom1 and dom2 is less than 100 table 2 suggesting that a small fraction 1 4 of redox moieties of dom were inert and did not participate in the reaction for each category of dom samples the k obv values for the two kinetic phases were similar table 2 between the two experimental conditions indicating that the kinetics of electron transfers from the two dom pools are independent of the hg doc ratio but associated with its intrinsic reducing capacity in contrast the fraction changes of the two dom pools at the two different experimental conditions suggest the inconsistent relative proportions of labile and less labile electron donation components in dom which may change due to the hg doc variations thus in exp 1 for the mountain lake dom the greatest dom1 31 is attributed to the highest hg doc resulting in the highest observed archg values even though the k obv is the slowest k obv1 0 10 h 1 and k obv2 0 002 h 1 on average compared to the dom from tundra k obv1 0 13 h 1 and k obv2 0 003 h 1 on average and forest lakes k obv1 0 19 h 1 and k obv2 0 004 h 1 on average since rapid reduction is the key step for hg ii reduction k obv1 decreased in the sequence of boreal forest lakes tundra lakes mountain lakes which further supports that the highest reducing capacity was in boreal forest lakes rather than the mountain lakes which was misled by the interference of various hg doc mass ratios 3 3 influence of complexed iron ii iron iii and ph previous studies have suggested that the influence of complexed iron could be a potential source of the reducing capacity from nom struyk and sposito 2001 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 purification for removing the iron is not practical if we consider that the bulk dom is also a system within predominant organic components under ambient inorganic conditions kothawala et al 2014 however the electron contribution from complexed fe iii fe ii would require a very high prior loading of iron for low carbon iron molar ratios e g 2 7 xie and shang 2005 in order to be significantly observed struyk and sposito 2001 xie and shang 2005 in this study all dom samples contain iron within a narrow range of 0 11 0 46 mg l 1 which is 0 16 0 05 mg l 1 in tundra lakes 0 13 0 01 mg l 1 in mountain lakes and 0 21 0 09 mg l 1 in forest lakes respectively therefore the carbon iron molar ratios were in the range of 33 723 average 232 183 in which the fe content in dom samples was far less than carbon by at least two orders of magnitude meanwhile a simple estimation of an extreme situation assuming that all iron is fe ii and can donate electrons by a 1 1 m stoichiometry showed that the calculated contributions to reducing capacities from fe ii were only accountable for only 0 1 3 0 of the observed ambient reducing capacities of dom additionally the redox buffering mechanism of dom for preserving fe ii daugherty et al 2017 could inhibit the influence of iron on the redox properties of dom itself in such narrow kinetic window i e 72 h as a consequence iron in dom is unlikely to substantially affect the reducing capacity observed on the other hand the influences of ph on the redox characteristics of dom mainly include 1 speciation of the chemical probe e g heavy metals and 2 dom steric structures both indicate that the reduction of hg by various dom could be strongly ph dependent previous studies have shown that the ph influence on the nom redox characteristics involves deprotonation and protonation which resulted in effects of either enhancement or inhibition helburn and maccarthy 1994 bauer et al 2007 ratasuk and nanny 2007 aeschbacher et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 walpen et al 2018 however the ph of all dom samples showed a narrow range of 4 64 5 77 in this study compared to the above literature that had large ph differences furthermore no significant correlation was found between the ph and the archg at two conditions fig s4 supporting information which may excludes the possibility of a substantial effect from ph changes 3 4 notes and limits several previous studies have illustrated that quinone moieties as the most redox prone component of natural organic matter could be derived from the degradation of lignin i e terrestrial inputs and microbial synthesis i e internal aquatic processes stevenson 1994 mcknight et al 1991 extracted fulvic acid from lake fryxell of the antarctic which despite being devoid of vascular plants showed obvious redox properties scott et al 1998 the similar redox characteristic was also observed in sample from pony lake of the antarctic aeschbacher et al 2012 thus besides the terrestrial dominant dom pool even dom from the aquatic environments influenced less by terrestrial inputs such as the reported antarctic lakes and the arctic lakes in this study can still serve as electron donors additionally all dom samples in this study were not pre reduced and kept their original status without manipulation the observed reducing capacities substantiate that some portion of the redox components e g phenolic and semiquinone moieties cannot be fully oxidized and reserve the potential for electron donation to certain degrees even in air exposure conditions this is supported by the previous works ratasuk and nanny 2007 bauer and kappler 2009 and the study even including the fully reoxidized dom samples maurer et al 2010 additionally it should be emphasized that we cannot extend too much of the influences of the dom reducing capacity to hg geochemistry as the higher hg doc mass ratios used in this study were higher than ratios in the pristine environment less than 0 1 mg g 1 however this study used the hg reduction process to assess the electron donation potential of dom which might partially unveil the effect of dom on hg abiotic reduction in highly contaminated aquatic sites such as the rice paddy fields and lakes in hg mine areas zhao et al 2016 feng et al 2018 this study revealed that the archg values are not only controlled by the dom composition and origins but also related to the complexation with dom involving metals doc ratios on the other hand from the perspective of the hg biogeochemical cycle and atmosphere surface exchange zhu et al 2016 our results could further provide a partial explanation to estimate whether organic rich environments are sinks osterwalder et al 2017 or sources jiskra et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 for the mercury cycle particularly in the arctic regions which have been estimated as globally significant mercury schuster et al 2018 and terrestrial organic carbon pools vonk et al 2015 without regards to the deficiency of electron acceptors e g hg ii only focusing on the electron donation pool as shown in exp 1 could lead to the misjudging of the reducing capacities of dom in real situations furthermore the results from this study show that the dom origins and composition have a large impact on its reactivity with hg which supports our previous observation jiang et al 2018a b and other reports schartup et al 2015b jonsson et al 2017 importantly this study further illustrates that dom optical characterization is a useful tool for unveiling the relationship between dom and hg lescord et al 2018 however the limitations of this study need to be noted the experiments were conducted in constant room temperature and cannot represent the actual temperature variation in the real environment which may be particularly critical for investigating the changes in dom in the arctic lakes that are experiencing global warming additionally competition from other divalent cations higher iron carbon ratios in some environments and the influences of ph and high concentrations of chloride are still unknown additionally this study is specifically designed to investigate the spatial variations of dom associated with the ambient reducing capacity instead of on a temporal scale hence further temporal long term investigation and repetitions will be necessary on laboratory scale and natural aquatic systems respectively 4 conclusion our study examined the influences of the dom origins and properties on its ambient reducing capacity in high latitude lakes the results demonstrated that dom as an electron provider is ubiquitous in aquatic systems regardless of latitudes the effects of the dom origins on the reducing capacities reflect that terrestrial dominant dom e g in boreal forest lakes is more reactive than dom with a reduced terrestrial property e g arctic including tundra and mountain lakes however only the dom quality cannot explain the observed differences in the arc this study highlights that terrestrial dominant characteristics of dom with higher aromaticity could not ensure a significantly greater electron donation in practical observations as a relative indicator the arc is also dependent on the relative proportions of oxidants and the dom concentration i e doc for example the hg doc ratio in this study therefore when using heavy metals as oxidants for measuring the reducing capacity we suggest that comparisons among different dom samples can be conducted while the oxidant doc ratios are kept the same level and should be reported on the other hand regarding dom being a black box mixture it is recommended to use the arc without manipulation to reflect the native electron transfer capacity of dom in the given environmental conditions which is also more relevant to real circumstances additionally as a supplement for the traditional chemical probe methods for reducing capacity measurements the hg ii reduction method can be used even in high doc conditions especially organic rich environments such as humic lakes or eutrophic waters as projected in the arctic region permafrost thaws heavily influence the composition and characteristics of dom in arctic aquatic systems which imposes further feedback on the carbon cycle and thus climate change consequently further investigation of the coupling influences of dom on mercury and carbon cycles in the future may establish links between hg cycles in the context of climate change especially in the rapidly changing
