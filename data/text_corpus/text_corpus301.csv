1505,groundwater contributed nutrients aided with increasing population threaten the global coastal ecosystems in this study attempt has been made using major ions and nutrients to evaluate the significance of submarine groundwater discharge sgd in a semi arid estuary of south india surface seepage and groundwater chemistry altered from fresh nak camg no3cl to mixed nak no3cl to saline water nacl type from upstream to outlet that connects bay of bengal we predicted abundant nitrate no3 along upstream and towards the bay due to application of fertilizers and aquaculture activities respectively elevated ammonium nh4 observed in the recirculated groundwater sea water suggests contribution from sea water intrusion and higher phosphate po4 3 noted at the outer bay suggests sources from phosphatic nodules decreasing redfield ratio towards the bay suggests anoxic aquifer condition due to salinization the sgd driven nutrient fluxes were 40 0 47 0 for no3 43 0 51 0 for nh4 and 9 0 32 0 for po4 3 from the total input fluxes the estimated nutrient fluxes showed that no3 and po4 3 discharges to the sea due to sgd and nh4 removed from the coast due to consumption by microorganisms that creates toxic algal blooms in the study area keywords submarine groundwater discharge coleroon nutrients redfield ratio and nutrient mass balance 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd is treated as a significant pathway in transporting chemical elements nutrients heavy metals organic contaminants from land to the coastal ocean taniguchi et al 2019 there are two prominent sgd types the first being the terrestrial fresh groundwater entering the ocean and the other is recirculation of sea water through the sediments both are influenced by hydraulic gradient aquifer properties density tides waves storms and seasonal influences robinson et al 2007 sawyer et al 2013 both types of sgd significantly alter the oceans chemical budget due to biogeochemical and environmental interactions that transpire between the terrestrial freshwater from aquifer and the saline water front slomp and cappellen 2004 santos et al 2009 moosdorf and oehler 2017 burnett et al 2018 sgd often discharges greater material fluxes particularly nutrients to the oceans in comparison with surface water synthetic fertilizers pesticides application and waste water discharge append nutrients like nitrogen n phosphorus p and ammonium nh4 to the oceans wang et al 2014 urquidi gaume et al 2016 the factors influencing nutrients addition are groundwater flow groundwater residence time in aquifer addition due to natural and human influences redox conditions and atmospheric sources wang et al 2018a higher nutrients leaching causes phenomenon like eutrophication aquifer is enriched with nutrients due to discharging of groundwater from the inland and it inductive excessive growth of algae blooms and phytoplankton s hwang et al 2005 mccoy et al 2011 liu et al 2018 cho et al 2019 biogeochemical change lee et al 2010 tamborski et al 2017 benthic production gonneea et al 2014 adyasari et al 2018 and coastal acidification liu et al 2018 adyasari et al 2018 the redfield ratio kroeger et al 2007 kim et al 2010 signifies the requirement of n p ratio of 16 1 for algal growth in coastal water the n p ratio increases by sgd due to practices like saline water intrusion into the aquifers enhanced domestic waste water release and fertilizer applications from agricultural activities due to ion exchange and other related reactions moore 1999 slomp and cappellen 2004 the variation in nitrogen and phosphorus ratio alters the production of phytoplankton biomass along the coastal zones howarth 2001 previous studies portray sgd fluxes by means of diverse techniques like water balance carter et al 2008 prakash et al 2018a darcy s law kroeger et al 2007 prakash et al 2018a numerical modeling rasmussen 1998 cohen et al 2010 vaeret et al 2012 gopinath et al 2016a 2019a seepage meter debnath and mukherjee 2016 prakash et al 2018a major chemistry and geochemical tracers burnett et al 2006 lee et al 2010 peterson et al 2013 baskaran et al 2016 prakash et al 2017 2018b srinivasamoorthy et al 2019 quantification of submarine groundwater discharge aided by biogeochemical conditions to estimate nutrient fluxes in near shore aquifers and groundwater has been attempted globally in various settings eg waquoit bay usa charette et al 2001 jeju south korea hwang et al 2005 huntington beach usa boehm et al 2006 spencer beach hawaii street et al 2008 sarasota bay usa mwashote et al 2013 new zealand estuary santos et al 2014 tolo horbor hong kong luo et al 2014 laizhou bay china ma et al 2015 mediterranean sea rodellas et al 2015 geoje bay korea hwang et al 2016 yangtze river east china sea zhu et al 2017 jiazhou bay china zhang et al 2017 east china sea wang et al 2017 sansha bay china wang et al 2018a daya bay china wang et al 2018b and many others in the past decade s nutrients from agriculture aquaculture and domestic wastes have increased drastically which poses serious threats like eutrophication red tides toxic algae and seawater intrusion in the study area ramanathan et al 1999 srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 although limited sgd studies was attempted prakash et al 2017 prakash et al 2018a b but estimation of nutrients flux associated sgd is never reported in coleroon river estuary as per the author knowledge and literatures hence the present study we have attempted to quantify sgd associated nutrient fluxes from surface water seepage water and groundwater to the bay of bengal aided with major ion chemistry attempt has also been made to compare the nutrient fluxes with red field ratio along with mass balance modeling to discuss the significance of nutrient fluxes via estuary to the bay of bengal the coleroon estuary experiences warm wet tropical climatic condition with higher atmospheric and water temperatures during summer and vice versa during winter heavy rainfall due to cyclones and depressions in bay of bengal during north east monsoon and with higher aquifer permeability the estuary is largely used for flood water outlet to the bay of bengal with an average discharge rate of 263 0 mm y 1 jain 2012 during recent years the region is considerably altered by human intervenes and hot spot for anthropogenic activities i e urbanization agriculture industrial aquaculture and land alternations that have resulted in alteration in material fluxes to the bay ramanathan et al 1999 about 176 fresh and saline water aquaculture farms reported in the study area msme 2011 5 0 metric tons of chemical fertilizers utilized for agricultural activities and 600 0 m3d 1of effluents released from industries has seriously influenced the coleroon river resulting in hypoxia vaithiyanathan et al 1992 prakash et al 2017 prakash et al 2018b reported the sgd flux in the coleroon estuary ranging between 2 4 and 7 5 m d 1 using radon 222rn isotope mass balance method however no nutrient fluxes were quantified and evaluated in this estuary hence we aim to assess submarine groundwater discharge aided with chemical constituents and nutrients fluxes and to evaluate its influence in coleroon river estuary 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area coleroon estuary situated along southeastern coastal india fig 1 is a tropical estuary the distributary of river cauvery with an outlet of about 0 7 km wide to the bay of bengal river coleroon is the northern distributary of river cauvery that splits at srirangam island at tamil nadu and traverses a total length of 160 0 km and finally configures bay of bengal at palayar near sirkali in nagapattinam district at tamil nadu latitude 11 22 n and longitude 79 49 e the average annual precipitation of the area is 1200 0 mm y 1 which is mostly during october to january imd 2015 the area is exposed to semidiurnal tidal regime with minimum and maximum tidal ranges of 0 7 m and 1 2 m respectively the estuary is well mixed due to tidal influences with average water depth 5 0 m during low tide and with 7 0 m during high tides the width of the estuary ranges between 50 0 m and 1500 0 m with sediment deposits of silt sandy and clay in nature ramanathan et al 1999 the geology of the estuary is made up of quaternary sediments with groundwater occurrences highly confined to high permeability alluvium aquifer with water depths varying between 8 0 and 18 m gopinath et al 2017 due to higher transmissivity ranges 150 0 to 3950 0 m2 d 1 cgwb 2009 the aquifers are subjected to frequent groundwater discharge due to hydraulic gradient towards the sea and also reversal in gradient due to tidal influences and groundwater extraction alters the fluxes supplied to the bay the estuary is prone to anthropogenic disturbances due to usage of pellet feed for shrimp cultivation presence of fish landing centers that dump fish wastes dredging activities usage of antifouling paints oil and its spillage extensive outflow from agricultural fields has severely degraded the habitats in the estuary with spatial and temporal heterogeneity resulting in hypoxia kalaivanan et al 2016 2 2 sampling and analytical techniques sampling of surface water n 8 seepage water n 36 and groundwater n 36 were collected from the estuary surface water samples were collected from river depth 1 0 m using submersible pump with a flow rate of 10 0 15 0 l min 1 with a total distance variance of 2 0 km seepage meters after lee 1977 were installed along transect perpendicular to the coast line by considering the distance from the coast seepage meter 1 mounted 20 0 km away from the coast seepage meter 2 at 9 0 km and seepage meter 3 at 0 5 km from the coast respectively and seepage samples were collected by considering the tidal variations groundwater samples were collected from open wells tapping alluvium aquifer within 100 0 m radius of seepage meters location all the samples were immediately filtered through cellulose acetate membrane filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm immediately and stored in acid washed polyethylene 500 0 ml bottle and taken for refrigeration

battery and paper industries identified along the upstream of the study area shameem et al 2014 na and mg2 were found to be increasing towards coast with decreasing of ca2 might be due to mixing of seawater with river water due to the influence of tides which exchanges ca2 to na and mg2 prasanna et al 2011 sources of k might be due to effluents released from industries domestic and agricultural fertilizers bohlke 2002 higher nh4 observed in location 1 4 2 mg l 1 and location 2 2 1 mg l 1 when compared with location 3 1 0 mg l 1 signifies the influence of sea cucumbers isolated in the study

practices along with bacterial activities slomp and cappellen 2004 zhang et al 2016 2 3 2 seepage water chemistry the chemical constituents of seepage water show large variation in chemistry due to surface water influence and tidal processes for the physicochemical parameters fig 3 ph ranges between 6 5 and 7 8 with a mean of 7 2 which signifies that seepage water is acidic to alkaline in nature irrespective of locations the large variations in ec tds and salinity were found to be influenced due to the coastal proximity prakash et al 2017 higher values ec 55 198 8 μs cm 1 tds 35 326 0 mg l 1

calcium rich silicate minerals from the sediments of the study area and or industrial and municipal effluents anderson et al 2002 identical trend observed for na and mg2 ions indicates the effective domination of seawater intrusion gning et al 2017 the sources for k might be from rock water interaction and agricultural influences from upstream and lower might be due to cation exchange with calcium and sodium during seawater intrusion howari and banat 2002 higher nh4 observed in location 1 2 8 mg l 1 and location 2 2 1 mg l 1 when compared with location 3 1 4 mg l 1 might be due to agricultural practices in particularly application of n p k and di ammonium phosphate dap in agricultural fields ramanathan et al 1999 and lowering in location 2 and 3 might be due to the denitrification nitrogen degradation process which is significant towards coast in general cationic concentration was found to be increasing towards the coast which follow the order of na mg2 k ca2 nh4 higher cl 14 011 2 mg l 1 and so4 2 68 2 mg l 1 noted in location 3 might be due to saline water intrusion and so4 2 might be due to breaking down of the organic substances from weathered soil or water and might also be due to saline water influence craig and anderson 1979 the concentration of cl and so4 2 is found to be decreasing towards inland location 2 cl 2869 8 mg l 1 so4 2 20 3 mg l 1 location 1 cl 506 4 mg l 1 so4 2 2 2 mg l 1 signifies the mixing of fresh water and saline water and sources of cl might be from domestic wastes base exchange reactions and tidal influences freeze and

recirculation of fresh water and influence of precipitation that adds freshwater panno et al 2001 tamma rao et al 2012 ions like po4 3 and no3 might be due to anthropogenic sources especially derived from the application of fertilizers giambastiani et al 2013 lower hco3 216 0 mg l 1 no3 1 1 mg l 1 po4 3 0 2 mg l 1 in location 1 might be due to the inflow of precipitated water and in location 3

water samples hill piper 1944 plot is used to isolate the hydrochemical faces of waters fig 5 a total of 3 water types were recognized in the study area as camg no3cl nak no3cl and nacl respectively seepage water sample in location 1 represents nakcamg no3cl water type indicating influence of rock weathering and anthropogenic sources saravanan et al 2016 2018 in location 2 nak no3cl type is noted indicating replacement of ca2 and mg2 by na due to sea water mixing and tidal influences song et al 2007 location 3 which is proximity to the sea shows nacl type due to seawater intrusion aided by tidal influences pulido leboeuf 2004 the surface water alters from nakcamg no3cl to nak no3cl to nacl type with reference to distance away from the coast in location 1 significant contribution of na k ca2 and mg2 are mainly due to primary rock weathering and in location 3 samples represent nacl facies due to seawater influences hakan 2013 groundwater shows camg no3cl type in location 1 nak no3cl in location 2 and nacl type in location 3 location 1 groundwater samples infers camg no3cl type indicating the release of ca2 and mg2 from rock water interaction and no3 and cl due to agricultural activities gopinath et al 2015 location 2 represents nak no3cl type brackish water due to mixing of freshwater and sea water appelo and postma 2005 in location 3 nacl water type is observed which points the influence of sea water recirculation intrusion gopinath et al 2019b the results clearly isolates submarine groundwater in location 1 which tend to alter as subterranean condition due to mixing between fresh water and sea water in location 2 and to a final saline facies in location 3 indicating proximity to the sea 2 5 nutrients nutrients are derived from the agriculture activities due to application of fertilizers and manures higher population density predominance of agriculture activities like paddy groundnuts coconut and sugar crops have increased the nutrients in the study area prior to harvesting about 7 kg m3 of fertilizers like urea di ammonium phosphate dap n p k ammonium nitrate ammonium chloride and ammonium sulphate ramanathan et al 1999 are used for better harvesting which tends to dissolve by leaching to aquifer materials senal et al 2011 due to hydraulic gradient and groundwater flow the nutrients gets transported to the coast taniguchi et al 2002 the continuous discharge of nutrients in coastal regions also influences the microorganism by creating algal blooms lee et al 2010 which also manipulate the ecological and environmental significance of the coastal regions the nitrogen and phosphorus ratio will limit the phytoplankton growth on a global scale the n p ratio is of the order of 16 1 which is the redfield ratio lignell et al 2008 the redfield ratio significantly varies based on the nutrients concentration nutrients cycle and environment kroeger et al 2007 the n p ratios in coastal waters are generally below the redfield ratio attributed to enhanced recycling of p relative to n slomp and cappellen 2004 in general there exists two different environments with reference to presence oxic or absence anoxic of oxygen the anoxic environment is suitable for denitrification processes and oxic is suitable for nitrification process fig 6 denitrification is a process by which nitrate gets altered as nitrogen with the help of anaerobic bacteria and their respiratory process in anoxic nature moran et al 2014 nitrification is a process by which nh4 gets converted to no2 which is unstable and hence no2 gets altered to no3 in oxic environment slomp and cappellen 2004 the nutrients nitrate no3 phosphate po4 3 and ammonium nh4 in groundwater for three locations are represented in fig 7 the nutrients for seepage and surface waters were neither considered for the present study due to restriction in quantifying the sgd derived nutrients from the aquifers nutrients in location 1 follow the order no3 47 0 nh4 43 0 po4 3 10 0 the source of nutrients for location 1 is mainly due to application of fertilizers n p k and di ammonium phosphate dap in location 2 the dominance of nutrients follow the order nh4 51 0 no3 40 0 po4 3 9 0 respectively nh4 is found to be higher when compared with no3 due to contribution of nh4 from seawater by the process of seawater intrusion niencheski et al 2007 in location 3 the nutrients follow the order ofno3 44 0 po4 3 32 0 nh4 24 0 higher no3 was observed due to nitrogen n rich waste released from the aquaculture farms near the location 3 and po4 3 is found to be higher when compared with other locations might be due to the weathering of phosphatic nodules isolated in the drainage of the river coleroon vaidhyanathan et al 1989 groundwater is usually enriched in nutrients in comparison with sea water river or stream water slomp and cappellen 2004 hence even a relatively meager volumetric flux could provide significant nutrient subsidies lee et al 2010 excess addition of nutrient to the oceans triggers algal blooms red tides along with damage to coral reefs anderson et al 2002 townsend et al 2001 parsons et al 2008 in order to control or mitigate the outcomes it is essential to determine sources of nutrients to the coastal oceans along with quantification the nutrients abundance is calculated in milli mole per liter per day m moll 1d 1 of groundwater samples fig 8 the average concentration of no3 po4 3 and nh4 is documented in table 1 in location 1 nutrients no3 po4 3 and nh4 were observed with concentrations 74 2 10 5 and 232 8 m mol l 1 d 1 respectively higher nh4 in comparison with no3 and po4 3 is mainly due to dissolution and leaching of nh4 enriched fertilizers along with sediment organic matter rich in fresh groundwater discharge slomp and cappellen 2004 in location 2 the nutrients no3 po4 3 and nh4 ranges 69 3 11 1 and 293 8 m mol l 1 d 1 respectively no3 is lower than location 1 due to denitrification in anoxic environment kroeger et al 2007 since nh4 increases due to direct discharge of wastes along with organic substances in mixing zone ceazan et al 1989 the sources for po4 3 are mainly due to sea water intrusion kroeger et al 2006 in location 3 the nutrients no3 po4 3 and nh4 recorded with concentrations 164 5 78 9 and 304 9 m mol l 1 d 1 respectively po4 3 is high in location 3 when compared with location 1 and 2 mainly due to dissolution of phosphatic nodules in coleroon river estuary vaithiyanathan et al 1992 nh4 and no3 increases due to addition of seawater from coast due to over drafting and discharging of re circulated groundwater krest et al 2000 in general nutrient is found to be higher in location 3 might be due to the influence of sea water and in location 2 lower concentration noted might be due to mixing and ions exchange of freshwater with seawater in subterranean estuarine environment li et al 2013 the redfield ratio fig 9 for location 1 location 2 and location 3 were 29 2 33 0 and 5 9 respectively indicates higher ratio in away from the coast and found to be decreasing towards the coast might be due to the oxic groundwater mixing with anoxic seawater 2 6 sgd supported nutrient fluxes the main intention of the present work is to quantify the sgd driven nutrient fluxes which are influenced by factors like groundwater geochemistry land use and water residence time smith and swarzenski 2012 the broad approach to quantify sgd related nutrient flux to the coastal ocean is by multiplying the radon 222rn measured sgd fluxes with the nutrients concentrations of each points to obtain the nutrient fluxes the radon derived sgd fluxes attempted by prakash et al 2018b discussed elsewhere has been considered for the present study the following equation has been proposed for calculating the nutrient fluxes to the ocean montiel et al 2018 1 f nutrient f sgd nutrients concentration where fnutrient nutrient flux m mol m 1 l 1 fsgd groundwater flux m d 1 nutrient concentration concentration of the nutrients m mol l 1 d 1 the calculated nutrient flux is found to be varying with reference to locations and nutrients represented in tables 2 and 3 the nitrate no3 flux ranges 434 7 m mol m 1 l 1 in location 1 232 3 m mol m 1 l 1 in location 2 and 233 6 m mol m 1 l 1 in location 3 respectively higher nitrate fluxes observed in location 1 in comparison with locations 2 and 3 might be due to release from agriculture fertilizers and conversion of nh4 as no3 during nitrification in oxic aquifer joye et al 2006 jiang et al 2014 about 202 4 m mol m 1 l 1 of no3 has been removed between locations 1 and 2 might be due to the intake of no3 by phytoplankton s during denitrification process and about 1 3 m mol m 1 l 1 of no3 found to be added between locations 2 and 3 might be the release of no3 during the leaching of organic rich soils mueller et al 1996 burkart et al 2002 the phosphate po4 3 fluxes in location 1 and 2 ranges 61 7 mmol m 1 l 1 37 0 mmol m 1 l 1 respectively and in location 3 as 112 1 mmol m 1 l 1 respectively higher fluxes noted in location 3 when compared with location 1 and 2 signifies po4 3 release due to phosphatic dissolution near shore vaithiyanathan et al 1992 about 24 7 m mol m 1 l 1 of po4 3 were removed between locations 1 and 2 signifies sorption of po4 3 by sandy aquifer soils and mobilization of po4 3 during the groundwater flow wong et al 1998 harrison et al 2008 about 75 1 m mol m 1 l 1 of po4 3 has been added between locations 2 and 3 signifying release of po4 3 from sewages and fertilizer application harman et al 1996 ammonium nh4 flux in location 1 ranged 1364 4 m mol m 1 l 1 984 3 m mol m 1 l 1 in location 2 and 433 0 m mol m 1 l 1 in location 3 respectively higher fluxes in location 1 in comparison with 2 and 3 indicate the release of nh4 during agricultural activities due to application of fertilizers like ammonium nitrate ammonium chloride and ammonium sulphate ramanathan et al 1999 in general 380 1 m mol m 1l 1and 551 3 m mol m 1 l 1 of nh4 has been removed between locations1and 2 and about 551 3 m mol m 1 l 1 nh4 seems to be removed between location 2 and 3 respectively the conversion of nh4 as no3 in oxic aquifers and its decreasing tendency towards the coast in anoxic aquifer might be due to the denitrification processes liu et al 2018 the addition and removal of nitrate fluxes in the study area is illustrated in fig 10 to compare with world studies nutrients were converted as din dissolved inorganic nitrogen sum of nitrate and ammonium and dip dissolved inorganic phosphate an

variations in the nutrient flux might be due to the sources of nutrients aquifer condition oxic and anoxic rainfall biogeochemical processes in the aquifer and seasonal effects 3 conclusions the results suggest the following findings in view of nutrient fluxes due to sgd in the proposed study area the seepage surface and groundwater chemistry showed diverse chemical variations with reference to fresh discharge in location 1 subterranean estuary mixed water in location 2 and water influenced by tidal and sea water in location 3 subterranean estuary has been demarcated in location 2 about 11 km away from the coast the piper plot irrespective of samples suggested camgnak no3cl type fresh groundwater discharge to nacl type seawater with decreasing distance from the coast higher nutrients observed in location 3 indicates the discharge of recirculated groundwater and influence of sea water intrusion n p ratios were found to be lower than the redfield ratio indicating anoxic nature of aquifers upon salinization the sources for nutrients were from fertilizers sewage plumes and leaching of organic substances in the aquifer addition and removal of nutrient fluxes with respect to locations seems to be prejudiced by oxic aquifer condition of aquifers along with nitrification and de nitrification processes activated in the study area sgd derived n and p estimated fluxes vary over orders of magnitude which seems to be influenced by groundwater drafting precipitation and tidal processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

significance of submarine groundwater discharge sgd in a semi arid estuary of south india surface seepage and groundwater chemistry altered from fresh nak camg no3cl to mixed nak no3cl to saline water nacl type from upstream to outlet that connects bay of bengal we predicted abundant nitrate no3 along upstream and towards the bay due to application of fertilizers and aquaculture activities respectively elevated ammonium nh4 observed in the recirculated groundwater sea water suggests contribution from sea water intrusion and higher phosphate po4 3 noted at the outer bay suggests sources from phosphatic nodules decreasing redfield ratio towards the bay suggests anoxic aquifer condition due to salinization the sgd driven nutrient fluxes were 40 0 47 0 for no3 43 0 51 0 for nh4 and 9 0 32 0 for po4 3 from the total input fluxes the estimated nutrient fluxes showed that no3 and po4 3 discharges to the sea due to sgd and nh4 removed from the coast due to consumption by microorganisms that creates toxic algal blooms in the study area keywords submarine groundwater discharge coleroon nutrients redfield ratio and nutrient mass balance 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd is treated as a significant pathway in transporting chemical elements nutrients heavy metals organic contaminants from land to the coastal ocean taniguchi et al 2019 there are two prominent sgd types the first being the terrestrial fresh groundwater entering the ocean and the other is recirculation of sea water through the sediments both are influenced by hydraulic gradient aquifer properties density tides waves storms and seasonal influences robinson et al 2007 sawyer et al 2013 both types of sgd significantly alter the oceans chemical budget due to biogeochemical and environmental interactions that transpire between the terrestrial freshwater from aquifer and the saline water front slomp and cappellen 2004 santos et al 2009 moosdorf and oehler 2017 burnett et al 2018 sgd often discharges greater material fluxes particularly nutrients to the oceans in comparison with surface water synthetic fertilizers pesticides application and waste water discharge append nutrients like nitrogen n phosphorus p and ammonium nh4 to the oceans wang et al 2014 urquidi gaume et al 2016 the factors influencing nutrients addition are groundwater flow groundwater residence time in aquifer addition due to natural and human influences redox conditions and atmospheric sources wang et al 2018a higher nutrients leaching causes phenomenon like eutrophication aquifer is enriched with nutrients due to discharging of groundwater from the inland and it inductive excessive growth of algae blooms and phytoplankton s hwang et al 2005 mccoy et al 2011 liu et al 2018 cho et

ratio kroeger et al 2007 kim et al 2010 signifies the requirement of n p ratio of 16 1 for algal growth in coastal water the n p ratio increases by sgd due to practices like saline water intrusion into the aquifers enhanced domestic waste water release and fertilizer applications from agricultural activities due to ion exchange and other related reactions moore 1999 slomp and cappellen 2004 the variation in nitrogen and phosphorus ratio alters the production of phytoplankton biomass along the coastal zones howarth 2001 previous studies portray sgd fluxes by means of diverse techniques like water balance carter et al 2008 prakash et al 2018a darcy s law kroeger et al 2007 prakash et al 2018a numerical modeling rasmussen 1998 cohen et al 2010 vaeret et al 2012 gopinath et al 2016a 2019a

srinivasamoorthy et al 2019 quantification of submarine groundwater discharge aided by biogeochemical conditions to estimate nutrient fluxes in near shore aquifers and groundwater has been attempted globally in various settings eg waquoit bay usa charette et al 2001 jeju south korea hwang et al 2005 huntington beach usa boehm et al 2006 spencer beach hawaii street et al 2008 sarasota bay usa

past decade s nutrients from agriculture aquaculture and domestic wastes have increased drastically which poses serious threats like eutrophication red tides toxic algae and seawater intrusion in the study area ramanathan et al 1999 srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 although limited sgd studies was attempted prakash et al 2017 prakash et al 2018a b but estimation of nutrients flux associated sgd is never reported in coleroon river estuary as per the author knowledge and literatures hence the present study we have attempted to quantify sgd associated nutrient fluxes from surface water seepage water and groundwater to the bay of bengal aided with major ion chemistry attempt has also been made to compare the nutrient fluxes with red field ratio along with mass balance modeling to discuss the significance of nutrient fluxes via estuary to the bay of bengal the coleroon estuary experiences warm wet tropical climatic condition with higher atmospheric and water temperatures during summer and vice versa during winter heavy rainfall due to cyclones and depressions in bay of bengal during north east monsoon and with higher aquifer permeability the estuary is largely used for flood water outlet to the bay of bengal with an average discharge rate of 263 0 mm y 1 jain 2012 during recent years the region is considerably altered by human intervenes and hot spot for anthropogenic activities i e urbanization agriculture industrial aquaculture and land alternations that have resulted in alteration in material fluxes to the bay ramanathan et al 1999 about 176 fresh and saline water aquaculture farms reported in the study area msme 2011 5 0 metric tons of chemical fertilizers utilized for agricultural activities and 600 0 m3d 1of effluents released from industries has seriously influenced the coleroon river resulting in hypoxia vaithiyanathan et al 1992 prakash et al 2017 prakash et al 2018b reported the sgd flux in the coleroon estuary ranging between 2 4 and 7 5 m d 1 using radon 222rn isotope mass balance method however no nutrient fluxes were quantified and evaluated in this estuary hence we aim to assess submarine groundwater discharge aided with chemical constituents and nutrients fluxes and to evaluate its influence in coleroon river estuary 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area coleroon estuary situated along southeastern coastal india fig 1 is a tropical estuary the distributary of river cauvery with an outlet of about 0 7 km wide to the bay of bengal river coleroon is the northern distributary of river cauvery that splits at srirangam island at tamil nadu and traverses a total length of 160 0 km and finally configures bay of bengal at palayar near sirkali in nagapattinam district at tamil nadu latitude 11 22 n and longitude 79 49 e the average annual precipitation of the area is 1200 0 mm y 1 which is mostly during october to january imd 2015 the area is exposed to semidiurnal tidal regime with minimum and maximum tidal ranges of 0 7 m and 1 2 m respectively the estuary is well mixed due to tidal influences with average water depth 5 0 m during low tide and with 7 0 m during high tides the width of the estuary ranges between 50 0 m and 1500 0 m with sediment deposits of silt sandy and clay in nature ramanathan et al 1999 the geology of the estuary is made up of quaternary sediments with groundwater occurrences highly confined to high permeability alluvium aquifer with water depths varying between 8 0 and 18 m gopinath et al 2017 due to higher transmissivity ranges 150 0 to 3950 0 m2 d 1 cgwb 2009 the aquifers are subjected to frequent groundwater discharge due to hydraulic gradient towards the sea and also reversal in gradient due to tidal influences and groundwater extraction alters the fluxes supplied to the bay the estuary is prone to anthropogenic disturbances due to usage of pellet feed for shrimp cultivation presence of fish landing centers that dump fish wastes dredging activities usage of antifouling paints oil and its spillage extensive outflow from agricultural fields has severely degraded the habitats in the estuary with spatial and temporal heterogeneity resulting in hypoxia kalaivanan et al 2016 2 2 sampling and analytical techniques sampling of surface water n 8 seepage water n 36 and groundwater n 36 were collected from the estuary surface water samples were collected from river depth 1 0 m using submersible pump with a flow rate of 10 0 15 0 l min 1 with a total distance variance of 2 0 km seepage meters after lee 1977 were installed along transect perpendicular

continuous discharge of nutrients in coastal regions also influences the microorganism by creating algal blooms lee et al 2010 which also manipulate the ecological and environmental significance of the coastal regions the nitrogen and phosphorus ratio will limit the phytoplankton growth on a global scale the n p ratio is of the order of 16 1 which is the redfield ratio lignell et al 2008 the redfield ratio significantly varies based on the nutrients concentration nutrients cycle and environment kroeger et al 2007 the n p ratios in coastal waters are generally below the redfield ratio attributed to enhanced recycling of p relative to n slomp and cappellen 2004 in general there exists two different environments with reference to presence oxic or absence anoxic of oxygen the anoxic environment is suitable for denitrification processes and oxic is suitable for nitrification process fig 6 denitrification is a process by which nitrate gets altered as nitrogen with the help of anaerobic bacteria and their respiratory process in anoxic nature moran et al 2014 nitrification is a process by which nh4 gets converted to no2 which is unstable and hence no2 gets altered to no3 in oxic environment slomp and cappellen 2004 the nutrients nitrate no3 phosphate po4 3 and ammonium nh4 in groundwater for three locations are represented in fig 7 the nutrients for seepage and surface waters were neither considered for the present study due to restriction in quantifying the sgd derived nutrients from the aquifers nutrients in location 1 follow the order no3 47 0 nh4 43 0 po4 3 10 0 the source of nutrients for location 1 is mainly due to application of fertilizers n p k and di ammonium phosphate dap in location 2 the dominance of nutrients follow the order nh4 51 0 no3 40 0 po4 3 9 0 respectively nh4 is found to be higher when compared with no3 due to contribution of nh4 from seawater by the process of seawater intrusion niencheski et al 2007 in location 3 the nutrients follow the order ofno3 44 0 po4 3 32 0 nh4 24 0 higher no3 was observed due to nitrogen n rich waste released from the aquaculture farms near the location 3 and po4 3 is found to be higher when compared with other locations might be due to the weathering of phosphatic nodules isolated in the drainage of the river coleroon vaidhyanathan et al 1989 groundwater is usually enriched in nutrients in comparison with sea water river or stream water slomp and cappellen 2004 hence even a relatively meager volumetric flux could provide significant nutrient subsidies lee et al 2010 excess addition of nutrient to the oceans triggers algal blooms red tides along with damage to coral reefs anderson et al 2002 townsend et al 2001 parsons et al 2008 in order to control or mitigate the outcomes it is essential to determine sources of nutrients to the coastal oceans along with quantification the nutrients abundance is calculated in milli mole per liter per day m moll 1d 1 of groundwater samples fig 8 the average concentration of no3 po4 3 and nh4 is documented in table 1 in location 1 nutrients no3 po4 3 and nh4 were observed with concentrations 74 2 10 5 and 232 8 m mol l 1 d 1 respectively higher nh4 in comparison with no3 and po4 3 is mainly due to dissolution and leaching of nh4 enriched fertilizers along with sediment organic matter rich in fresh groundwater discharge slomp and cappellen 2004 in location 2 the nutrients no3 po4 3 and nh4 ranges 69 3 11 1 and 293 8 m mol l 1 d 1 respectively no3 is lower than location 1 due to denitrification in anoxic environment kroeger et al 2007 since nh4 increases due to direct discharge of wastes along with organic substances in mixing zone ceazan et al 1989 the sources for po4 3 are mainly due to sea water intrusion kroeger et al 2006 in location 3 the nutrients no3 po4 3 and nh4 recorded with concentrations 164 5 78 9 and 304 9 m mol l 1 d 1 respectively po4 3 is high in location 3 when compared with location 1 and 2 mainly due to dissolution of phosphatic nodules in coleroon river estuary vaithiyanathan et al 1992 nh4 and no3 increases due to addition of seawater from coast due to over drafting and discharging of re circulated groundwater krest et al 2000 in general nutrient is found to be higher in location 3 might be due to the influence of sea water and in location 2 lower concentration noted might be due to mixing and ions exchange of freshwater with seawater in subterranean estuarine environment li et al 2013 the redfield ratio fig 9 for location 1 location 2 and location 3 were 29 2 33 0 and 5 9 respectively indicates higher ratio in away from the coast and found to be decreasing towards the coast might be due to the oxic groundwater mixing with anoxic seawater 2 6 sgd supported nutrient fluxes the main intention of the present work is to quantify the sgd driven nutrient fluxes which are influenced by factors like groundwater geochemistry land use and water residence time smith and swarzenski 2012 the broad approach to quantify sgd related nutrient flux to the coastal ocean is by multiplying the radon 222rn measured sgd fluxes with the nutrients concentrations of each points to obtain the nutrient fluxes the radon derived sgd fluxes attempted by prakash et al 2018b discussed elsewhere has been considered for the present study the following equation has been proposed for calculating the nutrient fluxes to the ocean montiel et al 2018 1 f nutrient f sgd nutrients concentration where fnutrient nutrient flux m mol m 1 l 1 fsgd groundwater flux m d 1 nutrient concentration concentration of the nutrients m mol l 1 d 1 the calculated nutrient flux is found to be varying with reference to locations and nutrients represented in tables 2 and 3 the nitrate no3 flux ranges 434 7 m mol m 1 l 1 in location 1 232 3 m mol m 1 l 1 in location 2 and 233 6 m mol m 1 l 1 in location 3 respectively higher nitrate fluxes observed in location 1 in comparison with locations 2 and 3 might be due to release from agriculture fertilizers and conversion of nh4 as no3 during nitrification in oxic aquifer joye et al 2006 jiang et al 2014 about 202 4 m mol m 1 l 1 of no3 has been removed between locations 1 and 2 might be due to the intake of no3 by phytoplankton s during denitrification process and about 1 3 m mol m 1 l 1 of no3 found to be added between locations 2 and 3 might be the release of no3 during the leaching of organic rich soils mueller et al 1996 burkart et al 2002 the phosphate po4 3 fluxes in location 1 and 2 ranges 61 7 mmol m 1 l 1 37 0 mmol m 1 l 1 respectively and in location 3 as 112 1 mmol m 1 l 1 respectively higher fluxes noted in location 3 when compared with location 1 and 2 signifies po4 3 release due to phosphatic dissolution near shore vaithiyanathan et al 1992 about 24 7 m mol m 1 l 1 of po4 3 were removed between locations 1 and 2 signifies sorption of po4 3 by sandy aquifer soils and mobilization of po4 3 during the groundwater flow wong et al 1998 harrison et al 2008 about 75 1 m mol m 1 l 1 of po4 3 has been added between locations 2 and 3 signifying release of po4 3 from sewages and fertilizer application harman et al 1996 ammonium nh4 flux in location 1 ranged 1364 4 m mol m 1 l 1 984 3 m mol m 1 l 1 in location 2 and 433 0 m mol m 1 l 1 in location 3 respectively higher fluxes in location 1 in comparison with 2 and 3 indicate the release of nh4 during agricultural activities due to application of fertilizers like ammonium nitrate ammonium chloride and ammonium sulphate ramanathan et al 1999 in general 380 1 m mol m 1l 1and 551 3 m mol m 1 l 1 of nh4 has been removed between locations1and 2 and about 551 3 m mol m 1 l 1 nh4 seems to be removed between location 2 and 3 respectively the conversion of nh4 as no3 in oxic aquifers and its decreasing tendency towards the coast in anoxic aquifer might be due to the denitrification processes liu et al 2018 the addition and removal of nitrate fluxes in the study area is illustrated in fig 10 to compare with world studies nutrients were converted as din dissolved inorganic nitrogen sum of nitrate and ammonium and dip dissolved inorganic phosphate an attempt has also been made to compare the present sgd supported nutrients flux rates with the global studies table 3 coleroon estuary india this study location 1 din 1 7 103 mol d 1 dip 0 06 103 mol d

variations in the nutrient flux might be due to the sources of nutrients aquifer condition oxic and anoxic rainfall biogeochemical processes in the aquifer and seasonal effects 3 conclusions the results suggest the following findings in view of nutrient fluxes due to sgd in the proposed study area the seepage surface and groundwater chemistry showed diverse chemical variations with reference to fresh discharge in location 1 subterranean estuary mixed water in location 2 and water influenced by tidal and sea water in location 3 subterranean estuary has been demarcated in location 2 about 11 km away from the coast the piper plot irrespective of samples suggested camgnak no3cl type fresh groundwater discharge to nacl type seawater with decreasing distance from the coast higher nutrients observed in location 3 indicates the discharge of recirculated groundwater and influence of sea water intrusion n p ratios were found to be lower than the redfield ratio indicating anoxic nature of aquifers upon salinization the sources for nutrients were from fertilizers sewage plumes and leaching of organic substances in the aquifer addition and removal of nutrient fluxes with respect to locations seems to be prejudiced by oxic aquifer condition of aquifers along with nitrification and de nitrification processes activated in the study area sgd derived n and p estimated fluxes vary over orders of magnitude which seems to be influenced by groundwater drafting precipitation and tidal processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

1506,the sorption behaviour of sr into granite was studied with the presence or absence of typical colloids goethite bentonite and humic acid a batch technique was used to analyse the influencing process of colloids and key factors moreover scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize granite samples before and after the batch experiments the experiments showed that the presence of colloids promotes the sorption of sr in the broken granite system when goethite bentonite or humic acid ha was present the sorption capacity percentages were 1 8 2 13 and 1 93 times higher respectively than those in the granite only system as the initial sr2 concentration increased the sorption of sr increased but the sorption percentage decreased the sorption percentage reached a maximum at ph 7 and decreased as the acidity or alkalinity of the solution increased the sorption of granite may be related to the interstitial water of the hydroxyl quartz and feldspar the intergranular water of granite groups and the water molecules attached to the granite moreover the surface of the granite sample was rougher after the sorption experiment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sr ii colloid sorption granite factor geological disposal site 1 introduction with the rapid development of the nuclear industry a large amount of nuclear waste has been produced with characteristics of high radioactivity high toxicity and extremely long decay time even at relatively low concentrations nuclear waste exhibits harmful effects on human health therefore the safe disposal of nuclear waste has become the focus of global attention geological disposal is currently the most recognized and safest way to dispose of radioactive waste he et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 many countries have considered establishing deep geological reservoirs dgr to treat spent fuel or vitrified high level waste bennett and gens 2008 chapman and hooper 2012 in china the beishan area in gansu province is the most likely potential site for a high level waste hlw repository wang et al 2018a 2018b the dgrs typically involve both a natural barrier base rock such as argillite or crystalline rock and an engineering barrier such as metal containers and compacted bentonite due to its special physical properties mechanical stability low permeability high thermal conductivity and widespread geologic occurrence granite has been considered as a potential repository host rock throughout the world especially in china cao et al 2019 li et al 2019 however there are usually some fractures in the granite body when the engineering barrier is broken the fractures in the granite body will become channels for the radionuclide to migrate into the biosphere with the groundwater which will cause serious environmental contamination and will be harmful to human life over time hou et al 2018 song et al 2018 therefore studying the migration and sorption of nuclides in granite fractures is crucial for the safe disposal of high level radioactive waste in particular sr is one of the most frequently found radionuclides in the soil and groundwater at nuclear weapon test sites and nuclear waste repositories qi et al 2015 it has been identified by the international atomic energy agency as a high risk radionuclide iaea 2003 sr has a half life of 28 8 years high mobility in soil water environments and high heat generating properties ma et al 2017 it can enter the human environment through geological activities bioaccumulation and groundwater movement hou and li 2017 the chemical properties of sr are similar to those of ca and it is difficult for the human body to distinguish between sr ii and ca ii therefore sr ii can easily accumulate in the human body by replacing ca ii and cause anaemia leukaemia and other chronic illnesses wang et al 2009 due to the potential of extreme harm to the environment and the human body it is of great significance to use sr as a representative radionuclide to study the sorption of radionuclides into the groundwater environment because it is inexpensive efficient and convenient sorption with a solid adsorbent is the preferred method for removing pollutants wang et al 2009 kaçan and kütahyali 2012 colloids are common substances in groundwater systems and the increasing sorption of pollutants in the groundwater has caused widespread concern wu et al 2016 phan et al 2018 in addition the surface properties of the colloid are active so they can easily adsorb nuclides by complexation reactions ion exchange etc the most commonly studied colloids include iron oxides hydroxides bentonites and humic acids feng et al 2013 in the underground high level waste repository when steel based devices and vessels are gradually corroded iron will continue to be enriched to form goethite zänker and hennig 2014 as a stable iron oxide goethite α feooh is often present in the form of colloids in groundwater environments mccarthy and zachara 1989 bentonite is considered to be an ideal protective material for radioactive waste disposal and it can produce bentonite colloids when it comes into contact with groundwater kolomá et al 2018 humic acid ha is a product of the decomposition of soil organic matter om which is also ubiquitous in groundwater and soil environments wang et al 2015 zuo et al 2019 hence studying the sorption behaviour of sr in granite under the influence of typical colloids is significant for estimating the scope of radioactive contamination when accidental leakage of the repository occurs when there is an accidental nuclear waste leakage in the repository sr will be adsorbed by the mixed system of granite and colloids in the granite fractures the colloids are mainly goethite colloids bentonite colloids and humic acid colloids formed by damaged ground tanks buffer materials and naturally occurring soils in rock cracks under the action of groundwater most previous studies focused on the adsorption of nuclides by a single material lacking a certain system in their final results therefore in this study typical colloids and granite samples selected from typical points are used to explore the effect of colloids that may be generated during geological disposal on the sr adsorption process the sorption of sr in granite under the influence of typical colloids was studied by batch sorption experiments in addition microscopic characterization techniques were used to analyse the sr sorption mechanism in granite the results of the study are expected to provide the necessary basic data for potential site selection pollution prevention and environmental management of global high level waste geological disposal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and instruments representative granite column samples were collected from the borehole core in the typical section of the beishan site which is the most likely site for the geological disposal of high level waste in china beishan is located in the sparsely populated arid region of northwestern china its lithology is dominated by granite and fine fractures are filled with various materials such as clay fig 1 which is a typical low permeability medium it is a worldwide representative high level waste disposal site ferric nitrate potassium hydroxide humic acid and bentonite were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all of which were chemically pure strontium nitrate was purchased from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide were purchased from beijing beihua fine chemicals co ltd china strontium nitrate hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide were analytical grade the sr2 concentration in the aqueous solution was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes spectro arcos eop spectro analytical instruments gmbh usa scanning electron microscopy with an emax 350 spectrometer sem eds s 4800 ex 350 hitachi china was used to examine the morphologies of granite before and after the experiment fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nexus 670 thermo fisher scientific usa kbr powder method was used to examine the changes in the functional groups of granite before and after the experiment the resolution was set at 4 cm 1 and each spectrum was the average of 32 scans a spectrophotometer gbm australia was used to detect the concentrations of goethite bentonite and ha a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo china was used to determine the ph value a ball mill beijing greedman instrument equipment co ltd china was used to grind the samples to a particle size of 1 mm 2 2 methods 2 2 1 experimental design batch experiments were designed to investigate the sorption effect of sr onto granite in the presence or absence of typical colloids goethite bentonite and ha in addition microscopic characterization techniques sem eds and ftir were used to analyse the sorption mechanism 2 2 2 stock solutions of colloids 1 goethite colloid 100 ml of 1 0 mol l fe no3 3 and 200 ml of 4 5 mol l koh were mixed and stirred well then deionized water di water was added until the mixture reached the level of the seal the mixture was placed in an incubator at 70 c then the mixture was rinsed and centrifuged several times after the reddish brown goethite was formed after filtering the goethite precipitate was dried and ground to obtain nano sized particles of goethite 2 bentonite colloid a certain amount of bentonite was placed in an ultrasonic oscillator for ultrasonic vibration for 30 min then the bentonite was dissolved in ultrapure water the mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was extracted as the bentonite colloid 3 ha was dissolved in 0 5 mol l naoh and then the mixture was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the filtrate was supplemented with 6 mol l hydrochloric acid and the ph value was adjusted to less than 1 5 at which time the colloid precipitated the sample was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was subsequently removed the sample was dried and then it was refrigerated at 4 c 2 2 3 batch sorption experiments the experiment uses sr2 as the target solute and the experimental results are characterized by calculating the sorption capacity q t and sorption percentage y the calculation formula for q t and y is 1 q t c 0 c t m v 2 y c 0 c t c 0 100 where q t is the sorption capacity of sr2 mg g at the current time time t c 0 is the initial concentration of nuclide mg l c t is the concentration of nuclide mg l at the current time time t v is the total volume of the solution l m is the mass of the granite media g and y is the sorption percentage of sr2 determination of c t batch sorption tests of sr were carried out in sealed 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks at 25 c then a 10 kda ultrafiltration membrane was used for filtration and the sr concentration in the filtrate was measured by icp aes under different experimental conditions only the influencing parameters were changed and the other experimental parameters remained constant the following experiment only describes the case in which there are goethite colloids in the system the no colloid bentonite colloid and humic acid colloid cases were similar the specific experimental settings are shown in table 1 1 contact time a total of 4 82 mg sr no3 2 powder 1 mg goethite colloid and an appropriate capacity of di water were mixed to reach a constant volume i e 100 ml sr concentration 20 mg l then 2 g of granite powder particle size 1 mm was added and the solution was shaken well the sample was transferred to 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks for oscillation times of 60 300 600 1440 4320 7200 10 080 12 960 15 840 and 18 720 min 2 initial sr concentration one milligram of goethite colloid was added to each of seven 100 ml volumetric flasks and then appropriate amounts of sr no3 2 powder and di water were added to reach a constant volume i e 100 ml to achieve target initial concentrations of 0 5 1 5 10 50 100 and 200 mg l after shaking the samples were placed in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 2 g granite powder particle size 1 mm 3 ph value a total of 4 82 mg of sr no3 2 powder 1 mg of goethite colloid and an appropriate amount of di water were mixed to reach a constant volume i e 100 ml sr concentration 20 mg l then 100 ml aliquots were transferred to beakers and the ph values of the solutions were carefully adjusted to 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 using either 0 1 mol l hcl or 0 1 mol l naoh after shaking the samples from the beakers were transferred to 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 2 g of granite powder particle size 1 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 contact time on the sorption of sr fig 2 shows the sorption percentages of granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha colloid concentration 1 mg l c 0 20 mg l and ph 7 the sorption percentages of the four experimental cases increased rapidly within 1440 min and then slowed this rapid reaction within 1440 min was mainly dominated by chemisorption of sr on the particle surface rather than by physical sorption of sr on the particle surface xiao et al 2013 yu et al 2015 the granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha systems reached equilibrium at 15840 min 13 000 min 13 000 min and 10 000 min with sorption capacities of 0 15 mg g 0 27 mg g 0 32 mg g and 0 29 mg g and sorption percentages of 30 8 54 13 64 13 and 58 9 respectively these results show that under the same conditions the colloid granite system has a positive effect on the sorption of sr when goethite bentonite or ha was present the sorption capacity was 1 8 2 13 and 1 93 times higher respectively than that of granite alone the surface functional group of goethite colloids can easily form a coordination complex with sr2 albarran et al 2014 and the large specific surface area of bentonite colloids is also beneficial to adsorption tran et al 2018 ha has many surface functional groups in its structure e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups that act as major coordination sites for radionuclide ions zhang et al 2018 previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of ha significantly impacts the sorption of nuclides the experimental results also verified the rationality of using bentonite as a filler for the repository 3 2 effect of initial concentration of sr ii fig 3 shows the sorption percentages and sorption amounts of sr onto granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha colloid concentration 1 mg l contact time 1440 min and ph 7 the removal of sr increased as the sr concentration increased to 200 mg l however the sr sorption percentage decreased as the sr concentration increased with increasing concentrations from 0 5 to 200 mg l the sorption amount by granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha increased from 0 012 0 017 0 017 and 0 019 mg g to 0 997 3 103 3 103 and 3 255 mg g respectively in addition the sorption percentages of granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha decreased from 46 53 67 48 67 48 and 77 52 to 9 97 31 03 31 03 and 32 55 respectively the results indicate that in the presence of typical colloids goethite bentonite and ha the sorption of sr ii on system could increase with increasing sr concentrations compared with granite colloid system the sorption of sr ii on granite increases slowly in addition when the initial concentration was more than 100 mg l the increasing tendency of sr removal in granite system was slowed as the initial concentration of sr ii increased the probability of collisions occurring between sr ii and the adsorbent surface increased gradually ma et al 2011 and the active sites with higher binding energies could be fully utilized simultaneously the binding sites with lower energies gradually participated in sorption and the amount adsorbed by the particular adsorbent increased until sr ii was bound to all sorption sites the sorption percentage decreased as the concentration increased which can be explained by the increasingly strong sorption competition occurring between sr ii as the initial concentration increased the competitive sorption occurring between sr ii was aggravated then more and more available active sites in the solution were fully utilized ali et al 2016 3 3 effect of ph value fig 4 shows the sorption of sr onto granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha at ph values ranging from 3 to 10 fig 4 shows that changes in ph value have a significant impact on the sorption of granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha especially in an acidic environment ph 3 7 however in an alkaline environment ph 7 10 the effect on the sorption of granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha is minor with maximum sorption occurring at ph 7 overall an alkaline environment was more favourable for sorption than an acidic environment and the results were similar to those of other researchers tan et al 2017 ivanova and spiteller 2014 the results indicate that the sorption percentages of granite ha are all 55 from ph 4 10 and are less affected by changes in ph value therefore granite ha has good environmental adaptability the sorption percentage of granite bentonite at ph 6 is significantly higher than that of the other three sorbent cases especially at ph 7 and the sorption percentage is 64 13 which is 2 1 1 17 and 1 09 times higher than granite granite goethite and granite ha respectively these results also indicate that bentonite is more suitable as a filling material for nuclear waste disposal the solution with a strong acid environment ph 4 contains a large amount of h which will strongly compete with sr2 in sorption resulting in a lower sorption percentage of sr the goethite colloid has variable charge surfaces and the iron oxyhydroxide in aqueous solution exists in the form of feoh functional groups when the ph value is greater than its isoelectric point 4 6 5 5 the surface is negatively charged and forms a complex with sr ii to increase the sorption percentage wang et al 2018a 2018b the specific surface area of bentonite in the three colloids is relatively large and it is much larger than other specific surface areas of geological materials granodiorite mylonite or fault mud etc therefore bentonite is more conducive to the sorption of sr missana et al 2004 the presence of a negative charge on the ha colloid surface easily enables the functional group to contact sr2 which facilitates the sorption of sr2 onto the surface of the ha by ion exchange and complexation the ha colloid can stably exist and has a large adaptability range in neutral and alkaline environments however the ha colloid easily forms precipitates under a strong acid environment which is not conducive to sr sorption wang et al 2015 3 4 microscopic characterization before and after the adsorption experiments the surface microscopic morphologies fig 5 and elemental compositions and granite sample contents table 2 were obtained by sem eds before the sorption experiment fig 5a the granite has an irregular block structure with many cracks on the surface which increases the specific surface area of the granite to a certain extent and provides good conditions for adsorbing the nuclide after the sorption experiment fig 5b the surface of the granite becomes rougher a large number of tiny dissolution pores appear which is presumed to be related to the dissolution of some soluble components of the granite in addition the granite surface produces more angular structures the specific surface area of granite particles is speculated to increase during adsorption which further promotes the adsorption of sr the elemental compositions and granite sample contents obtained before and after the sorption experiment are shown in table 2 before the sorption experiment the granite was mainly composed of o and si elements and the weight percentages were 62 95 and 36 65 respectively the main elements of the granite after adsorption were still o and si and the sr element appears in the granite sample however the weight percentage was 0 54 this indicates that the adsorption capacity of granite for sr is relatively weak in the absence of colloidal involvement which is consistent with the results of static adsorption experiments to explore the characteristics of the granite functional groups before and after the sorption experiment ftir spectra were measured in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 fig 6 the wave at 670 7 cm 1 is the characteristic peak of quartz the wave at 430 cm 1 is the characteristic peak of black mica the peaks at 463 08 and 528 77 cm 1 are attributed to the si o si bending vibration the peak at 1034 67 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of si o the peak at 1629 86 cm 1 is attributed to the oh bending vibration furthermore the peak at 1629 86 cm 1 is attributed to the oh stretching vibration which corresponds to the interlayer water corresponding to granite groups and water molecules that are attached to granite the peaks at 787 13 and 830 cm 1 are attributed to si al o simonyan et al 2009 pozo antonio et al 2015 overall the waveform does not show significant changes after the experiment but the local waveform is subject to change the wave valley disappearing at 3428 32 cm 1 is attributed to the change in oh this indicates that the adsorption of granite is related to the hydroxyl groups present therein the hydroxyl group is speculated to be an effective adsorption site for the affinity of sr and the interlayer water of the granite group and the water molecules attached to the granite may adsorb sr in addition the disappearance of the trough at 1629 86 cm 1 further confirmed that the adsorption of granite may be related to hydroxyl groups the waveform also changes significantly at 1421 24 cm 1 which can be attributed to the change in the sio bond this change in the sio bond indicates that the adsorption of sr by granite may be related to quartz furthermore the waveform also slightly changed at 724 49 cm 1 which was attributed to the change in the si al o bond therefore it is speculated that the adsorption of sr by granite is also related to feldspar 4 conclusion the batch sorption experimental results show that the presence of colloids promotes the sorption of sr in the system which causes the saturated sorption time to be shorter and the sorption percentage to be higher when goethite bentonite or ha was present the sorption capacity was 1 8 2 13 and 1 93 times higher respectively than that of granite alone as the initial concentration of sr2 increased the sorption of sr increased but the sorption percentage decreased the sorption percentage reached a maximum at ph 7 and decreased as the acidity or alkalinity of the solution increased under controlled conditions the combination of a bentonite colloid and granite has the best sorption effect on sr which indicates the rationality of bentonite as a filling material for the geologic disposal of high level waste sem eds analysis shows that the surface of the granite sample was rougher after the sorption experiment there were more angular structures and a large number of tiny dissolved pores produced which increased the specific surface area and was more conducive to the sorption of sr ftir analysis shows that the sorption of granite may be related to the interstitial water of the hydroxyl quartz feldspar and intergranular water of granite groups and to the water molecules attached to the granite declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

sorption percentage reached a maximum at ph 7 and decreased as the acidity or alkalinity of the solution increased the sorption of granite may be related to the interstitial water of the hydroxyl quartz and feldspar the intergranular water of granite groups and the water molecules attached to the granite moreover the surface of the granite sample was rougher after the sorption experiment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sr ii colloid sorption granite factor geological disposal site 1 introduction with the rapid development of the nuclear industry a large amount of nuclear waste has been produced with characteristics of high radioactivity high toxicity and extremely long decay time even at relatively low concentrations nuclear waste exhibits harmful effects on human health therefore the safe disposal of nuclear waste has become the focus of global attention geological disposal is currently the most recognized and safest way to dispose of radioactive waste he et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 many countries have considered establishing deep geological reservoirs dgr to treat spent fuel or vitrified high level waste bennett and gens 2008 chapman and hooper 2012 in china the beishan area in gansu province is the most likely potential site for a high level waste hlw repository wang et al 2018a 2018b the dgrs typically involve both a natural barrier base rock such as argillite or crystalline rock and an engineering barrier such as metal containers and compacted bentonite due to its special physical properties mechanical stability low permeability high thermal conductivity and widespread geologic occurrence granite has been considered as a potential repository host rock throughout the world especially in china cao et al 2019 li et al 2019 however there are usually some fractures in the granite body when the engineering barrier is broken the fractures in the granite body will become channels for the radionuclide to migrate into the biosphere with the groundwater which will cause serious environmental contamination and will be harmful to human life over time hou et al 2018 song et al 2018 therefore studying the migration and sorption of nuclides in granite fractures is crucial for the safe disposal of high level radioactive waste in particular sr is one of the most frequently found radionuclides in the soil and groundwater at nuclear weapon test sites and nuclear waste repositories qi et al 2015 it has been identified by the international atomic energy agency as a high risk radionuclide iaea 2003 sr has a half life of 28 8 years high mobility in soil water environments and high heat generating properties ma et al 2017 it can enter the human environment through geological activities bioaccumulation and groundwater movement hou and li 2017 the chemical properties of sr are similar to those of ca and it is difficult for the human body to distinguish between sr ii and ca ii therefore sr ii can easily accumulate in the human body by replacing ca ii and cause anaemia leukaemia and other chronic illnesses wang et al 2009 due to the potential of extreme harm to the environment and the human body it is of great significance to use sr as a representative radionuclide to study the sorption of radionuclides into the groundwater environment because it is inexpensive efficient and convenient sorption with a solid adsorbent is the preferred method for removing pollutants wang et al 2009 kaçan and kütahyali 2012 colloids are common substances in groundwater systems and the increasing sorption of pollutants in the groundwater has caused widespread concern wu et al 2016 phan et al 2018 in addition the surface properties of the colloid are active so they can easily adsorb nuclides by complexation reactions ion exchange etc the most commonly studied colloids include iron oxides hydroxides bentonites and humic acids feng et al 2013 in the underground high level waste repository when steel based devices and vessels are gradually corroded iron will continue to be enriched to form goethite zänker and hennig 2014 as a stable iron oxide goethite α feooh is often present in the form of colloids in groundwater environments mccarthy and zachara 1989 bentonite is considered to be an ideal protective material for radioactive waste disposal and it can produce bentonite colloids when it comes into contact with groundwater kolomá et al 2018 humic acid ha is a product of the decomposition of soil organic matter om which is also ubiquitous in groundwater and soil environments wang et al 2015 zuo et al 2019 hence studying the sorption behaviour of sr in granite under the influence of typical colloids is significant for estimating the scope of radioactive contamination when accidental leakage of the repository occurs when there is an accidental nuclear waste leakage in the repository sr will be adsorbed by the mixed system of granite and colloids in the granite fractures the colloids are mainly goethite colloids bentonite colloids and humic acid colloids formed by damaged ground tanks buffer materials and naturally occurring soils in rock cracks under the action of groundwater most previous studies focused on the adsorption of nuclides by a single material lacking a certain system in their final results therefore in this study typical colloids and granite samples selected from typical points are used to explore the effect of colloids that may be generated during geological disposal on the sr adsorption process the sorption of sr in granite under the influence of typical colloids was studied by batch sorption experiments in addition microscopic characterization techniques were used to analyse the sr sorption mechanism in granite the results of the study are expected to provide the necessary basic data for potential site selection pollution prevention and environmental management of global high level waste geological disposal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and instruments representative granite column samples were collected from the borehole core in the typical section of the beishan site which is the most likely site for the geological disposal of high level waste in china beishan is located in the sparsely populated arid region of northwestern china its lithology is dominated by granite and fine fractures are filled with various materials such as clay fig 1 which is a typical low permeability medium it is a worldwide representative high level waste disposal site ferric nitrate potassium hydroxide humic acid and bentonite were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all of which were chemically pure strontium nitrate was purchased from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china hydrochloric acid and sodium

was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes spectro arcos eop spectro analytical instruments gmbh usa scanning electron microscopy with an emax 350 spectrometer sem eds s 4800 ex 350 hitachi china was used to examine the morphologies of granite before and after the experiment fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nexus 670 thermo fisher scientific usa kbr powder method was used to examine the changes in the functional groups of granite before and after the experiment the resolution was set at 4 cm 1 and each spectrum was the average of 32 scans a spectrophotometer gbm australia was used to detect the concentrations of goethite bentonite and ha a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo china was used to determine the ph value a ball mill beijing greedman instrument equipment co ltd china was used to grind the samples to a particle size of 1 mm 2 2 methods 2 2 1 experimental design batch experiments were designed to investigate the sorption effect of sr onto granite in the presence or absence of typical colloids goethite bentonite and ha in addition microscopic characterization techniques sem eds and ftir were used to analyse the sorption mechanism 2 2 2 stock solutions of colloids 1 goethite colloid 100 ml of 1 0 mol l fe no3 3 and 200 ml of 4 5 mol l koh were mixed and stirred well then deionized water di water was added until the mixture reached the level of the seal the mixture was placed in an incubator at 70 c then the mixture was rinsed and centrifuged several times after the reddish brown goethite was formed after filtering the goethite precipitate was dried and ground to obtain nano sized particles of goethite 2 bentonite colloid a certain amount of bentonite was placed in an ultrasonic oscillator for ultrasonic vibration for 30 min then the bentonite was dissolved in ultrapure water the mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was extracted as the bentonite colloid 3 ha was dissolved in 0 5 mol l naoh and then the mixture was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the filtrate was supplemented with 6 mol l hydrochloric acid and the ph value was adjusted to less than 1 5 at which time the colloid precipitated the sample was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was subsequently removed the sample was dried and then it was refrigerated at 4 c 2 2 3 batch sorption experiments the experiment uses sr2 as the target solute and the experimental results are characterized by calculating the sorption capacity q t and sorption percentage y the calculation formula for q t and y is 1 q t c 0 c t m v 2 y c 0 c t c 0 100 where q t is the sorption capacity of sr2 mg g at the current time time t c 0 is the initial concentration of nuclide mg l c t is the concentration of nuclide mg l at the current time time t v is the total volume of the solution l m is the mass of the granite media g and y is the sorption percentage of sr2 determination of c t batch sorption tests of sr were carried out in sealed 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks at 25 c then a 10 kda ultrafiltration membrane was used for filtration and the sr concentration in the filtrate was measured by icp aes under different experimental conditions only the influencing parameters were changed and the other experimental parameters remained constant the following experiment only describes the case in which there are goethite colloids in the system the no colloid bentonite colloid and humic acid colloid cases were similar the specific experimental settings are shown in table 1 1 contact time a total of 4 82 mg sr no3 2 powder 1 mg goethite colloid and an appropriate capacity of di water were mixed to reach a constant volume i e 100 ml sr concentration 20 mg l then 2 g of granite powder particle size 1 mm was added and the solution was shaken well the sample was transferred to 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks for oscillation times of 60 300 600 1440 4320 7200 10 080 12 960 15 840 and 18 720 min 2 initial sr concentration one milligram of goethite colloid was added to each of seven 100 ml volumetric flasks and then appropriate amounts of sr no3 2 powder and di water were added to reach a constant volume i e 100 ml to achieve target initial concentrations of 0 5 1 5 10 50 100 and 200 mg l after shaking the samples were placed in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 2 g granite powder particle size 1 mm 3 ph value a total of 4 82 mg of sr no3 2 powder 1 mg of goethite colloid and an appropriate amount of di water were mixed to reach a constant volume i e 100 ml sr concentration 20 mg l then 100 ml aliquots were transferred to beakers and the ph values of the solutions were carefully adjusted to 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 using either 0 1 mol l hcl or 0 1 mol l naoh after shaking the samples from the beakers were transferred to 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 2 g of granite powder particle size 1 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 contact time on the sorption of sr fig 2 shows the sorption percentages of granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha colloid concentration 1 mg l c 0 20 mg l and ph 7 the sorption percentages of the four experimental cases increased rapidly within 1440 min and then slowed this rapid reaction within 1440 min was mainly dominated by chemisorption of sr on the particle surface rather than by physical sorption of sr on the particle surface xiao et al 2013 yu et al 2015 the granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha systems reached equilibrium at 15840 min 13 000 min 13 000 min and 10 000 min with sorption capacities of 0 15 mg g 0 27 mg g 0 32 mg g and 0 29 mg g and sorption percentages of 30 8 54 13 64 13 and 58 9 respectively these results show that under the same conditions the colloid granite system has a positive effect on the sorption of sr when goethite bentonite or ha was present the sorption capacity was 1 8 2 13 and 1 93 times higher respectively than that of granite alone the surface functional group of goethite colloids can easily form a coordination complex with sr2 albarran et al 2014 and the large specific surface area of bentonite colloids is also beneficial to adsorption tran et al 2018 ha has many surface functional groups in its structure e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups that act as major coordination sites for radionuclide ions zhang et al 2018 previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of ha significantly impacts the sorption of nuclides the experimental results also verified the rationality of using bentonite as a filler for the repository 3 2 effect of initial concentration of sr ii fig 3 shows the sorption percentages and sorption amounts of sr onto granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha colloid concentration 1 mg l contact time 1440 min and ph 7 the removal of sr increased as the sr concentration increased to 200 mg l however the sr sorption percentage decreased as the sr concentration increased with increasing concentrations from 0 5 to 200 mg l the sorption amount by granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha increased from 0 012 0 017 0 017 and 0 019 mg g to 0 997 3 103 3 103 and 3 255 mg g respectively in addition the sorption percentages of granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha decreased from 46 53 67 48 67 48 and 77 52 to 9 97 31 03 31 03 and 32 55 respectively the results indicate that in the presence of typical colloids goethite bentonite and ha the sorption of sr ii on system could increase with increasing sr concentrations compared with granite colloid system the sorption of sr ii on granite increases slowly in addition when the initial concentration was more than 100 mg l the increasing tendency of sr removal in granite system was slowed as the initial concentration of sr ii increased the probability of collisions occurring between sr ii and the adsorbent surface increased gradually ma et al 2011 and the active sites with higher binding energies could be fully utilized simultaneously the binding sites with lower energies gradually participated in sorption and the amount adsorbed by the particular adsorbent increased until sr ii was bound to all sorption sites the sorption percentage decreased as the concentration increased which can be explained by the increasingly strong sorption competition occurring between sr ii as the initial concentration increased the competitive sorption occurring between sr ii was aggravated then more and more available active sites in the solution were fully utilized ali et al 2016 3 3 effect of ph value fig 4 shows the sorption of sr onto granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha at ph values ranging from 3 to 10 fig 4 shows that changes in ph value have a significant impact on the sorption of granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha especially in an acidic environment ph 3 7 however in an alkaline environment ph 7 10 the effect on the sorption of granite granite goethite granite bentonite and granite ha is minor with maximum sorption occurring at ph 7 overall an alkaline environment was more favourable for sorption than an acidic environment and the results were similar to those of other researchers tan et al 2017 ivanova and spiteller 2014 the results indicate that the sorption percentages of granite ha are all 55 from ph 4 10 and are less affected by changes in ph value therefore granite ha has good environmental adaptability the sorption percentage of granite bentonite at ph 6 is significantly higher than that of the other three sorbent cases especially at ph 7 and the sorption percentage is 64 13 which is 2 1 1 17 and 1 09 times higher than granite granite goethite and granite ha respectively these results also indicate that bentonite is more suitable as a filling material for nuclear waste disposal the solution with a strong acid environment ph 4 contains a large amount of h which will strongly compete with sr2 in sorption resulting in a lower sorption percentage of sr the goethite colloid has variable charge surfaces and the iron oxyhydroxide in aqueous solution exists in the form of feoh functional groups when the ph value is greater than its isoelectric point 4 6 5 5 the surface is negatively charged and forms a complex with sr ii to increase the sorption percentage wang et al 2018a 2018b the specific surface area of bentonite in the three colloids is relatively large and it is much larger than other specific surface areas of geological materials granodiorite mylonite or fault mud etc therefore bentonite is more conducive to the sorption of sr missana et al 2004 the presence of a negative charge on the ha colloid surface easily enables the functional group to contact sr2 which facilitates the sorption of sr2 onto the surface of the ha by ion exchange and complexation the ha colloid can stably exist and has a large adaptability range in neutral and alkaline environments however the ha colloid easily forms precipitates under a strong acid environment which is not conducive to sr sorption wang et al 2015 3 4 microscopic characterization before and after the adsorption experiments the surface microscopic morphologies fig 5 and elemental compositions and granite sample contents table 2 were obtained by sem eds before the sorption experiment fig 5a the granite has an irregular block structure with many cracks on the surface which increases the specific surface area of the granite to a certain extent and provides good conditions for adsorbing the nuclide after the sorption experiment fig 5b the surface of the granite becomes rougher a large number of tiny dissolution pores appear which is presumed to be related to the dissolution of some soluble components of the granite in addition the granite surface produces more angular structures the specific surface area of granite particles is speculated to increase during adsorption which further promotes the adsorption of sr the elemental compositions and granite sample contents obtained before and after the sorption experiment are shown in table 2 before the sorption experiment the granite was mainly composed of o and si elements and the weight percentages were 62 95 and 36 65 respectively the main elements of the granite after adsorption were still o and si and the sr element appears in the granite sample however the weight percentage was 0 54 this indicates that the adsorption capacity of granite for sr is relatively weak in the absence of colloidal involvement which is consistent with the results of static adsorption experiments to explore the characteristics of the granite functional groups before and after the sorption experiment ftir spectra were measured in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 fig 6 the wave at 670 7 cm 1 is the characteristic peak of quartz the wave at 430 cm 1 is the characteristic peak of black mica the peaks at 463 08 and 528 77 cm 1 are attributed to the si o si bending vibration the peak at 1034 67 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of si o the peak at 1629 86 cm 1 is attributed to the oh bending vibration furthermore the peak at 1629 86 cm 1 is attributed to the oh stretching vibration which corresponds to the interlayer water corresponding to granite groups and water molecules that are attached to granite the peaks at 787 13 and 830 cm 1 are attributed to si al o simonyan et al 2009 pozo antonio et al 2015 overall the waveform does not show significant changes after the experiment but the local waveform is subject to change the wave valley disappearing at 3428 32 cm 1 is attributed to the change in oh this indicates that the adsorption of granite is related to the hydroxyl groups present therein the hydroxyl group is speculated to be an effective adsorption site for the affinity of sr and the interlayer water of the granite group and the water molecules attached to the granite may adsorb sr in addition the disappearance of the trough at 1629 86 cm 1 further confirmed that the adsorption of granite may be related to hydroxyl groups the waveform also changes significantly at 1421 24 cm 1 which can be attributed to the change in the sio bond this change in the sio bond indicates that the adsorption of sr by granite may be related to quartz furthermore the waveform also slightly changed at 724 49 cm 1 which was attributed to the change in the si al o bond therefore it is speculated that the adsorption of sr by granite is also related to feldspar 4 conclusion the batch sorption experimental results show that the presence of colloids promotes the sorption of sr in the system which causes the saturated sorption time to be shorter and the sorption percentage to be higher when goethite bentonite or ha was present the sorption capacity was 1 8 2 13 and 1 93 times higher respectively than that of granite alone as the initial concentration of sr2 increased the sorption of sr increased but the sorption percentage decreased the sorption percentage reached a maximum at ph 7 and decreased as the acidity or alkalinity of the solution increased under controlled conditions the combination of a bentonite colloid and granite has the best sorption effect on sr which indicates the rationality of bentonite as a filling material for the geologic disposal of high level waste sem eds analysis shows that the surface of the granite sample was rougher after the sorption experiment there were more angular structures and a large number of tiny dissolved pores produced which increased the specific surface area and was more conducive to the sorption of sr ftir analysis shows that the sorption of granite may be related to the interstitial water of the hydroxyl quartz feldspar and intergranular water of granite groups and to the water molecules attached to the granite declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

safety and quality of drinking water sources is still a growing concern due to anthropogenic activities such as agriculture mining and industrial development li et al 2017 nitrate no3 has now been found as a widespread pollutant in water systems as a result of human activities the rising human and ecological health concerns of no3 in water resources have led many countries and regional blocks such as the european union to implement legislations nitrates directive 91 676 eec and the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec to monitor manage or limit their release into the environment bouraoui et

decades many studies were carried out in ghana to assess the quality of groundwater and surface water yidana et al 2012 ahialey et al 2011 gibrilla et al 2010 anku et al 2009 most of these studies reported high no3 levels in drinking water surface water and groundwater across the country however since nitrate in water originates from various sources it is very important for any monitoring program to track and apportion the no3 sources in the contaminated aquatic systems puig et al 2017 this information will provide valuable information to controlling no3 contamination improving management of water resources and targeted remediation of contaminated areas to effectively improve water quality and control measures in an attempt to resolve the issue of nitrate sources in aquatic systems various methodologies have been adopted the most widely and successfully used approach in the scientific literature is the δ15n δ18o of no3 spalding et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a sanchez et al 2017 fenech et al 2012 furthermore the coupling of isotope data with the bayesian mixing model provides a powerful tool to estimate the propositional mixing fractions of different no3 sources the model siar stable isotope analysis in r provides a framework to create several models with user friendly options governed by the user input data yang et al 2013 the siar a package in r software can apportion three or more no3 sources with only δ15n and δ18o of no3 several studies have established that the output from the siar model is able to identify the fingerprints of different no3 sources matiatos 2016 xia et al 2017 in ghana most rural and peri urban areas dwellers depend on groundwater boreholes and hand dug well and raw surface water for drinking and other domestic activities in most cases without any form of treatment quite recent studies have revealed an increasing trend of no3 contamination in groundwater due to agricultural and improper disposal of solid and liquid waste hence raising concerns about its future usage as a safe and sustainable option for drinking water anornu et al 2017 there is also a high prevalence of open defecation poor sanitation and the use of farm yard manure the use of chemical fertilizers npk urea and ammonium sulphate is also on the increased especially in areas around the irrigation dams the topography is characterized by flat and fairly undulating ground with short tress and savannah grassland currently there is no legislation or agricultural policy to regulate the use of chemical fertilizers this is because most studies on water quality in the country only report contaminant concentrations and their trends in drinking water thereby making policy formulation to safeguard water quality quite difficult it is therefore imperative to identify and apportion the potential sources of nitrate to provide evidence that will aid policy formulation for sustainable water resources management to meet the growing water demand in the country the objectives of the study were 1 to assess the extent of nitrate contamination in the white volta basin 2 to identify the origin of no3 using δ15n and δ18o and 3 use the siar model to apportion quantitatively the probable no3 sources in the study area it is envisaged that the current study will provide new and useful information that will help develop appropriate management

smallest regions in ghana it shares geogrhical boundaries westward with the upper west region northward with burkina faso eastward with togo and southward with northern region fig 1 the major rivers in the area are black white and red volta other river systems are tono siisili and tamne the area is characterized by a short rainy season between may and august with extreme rainfall events leading to flooding in most areas this is followed by a long dry season the mean annual rainfall pan evaporation and temperature are estimated to be approximately 1100 mm 2500 mm and 28 c respectively the precambrian age birimian granites and metamorphic rocks underlain the study area the eastern and western parts have few patches of phylytes tuffs greywacke and schists similarly the south eastern sections have few outcrops of the voltain palaeozoic sandstones generally the borehole depths are usually not more than 30 m in granite terrains with static water levels 10 m the yield varies from 22 to 50 l min with much higher yields obtained in highly fractured areas transmissivity varies from place to place depending on the geology joining and extent of weathering and fracturing in general the wells are beneath water level conditions ranging from 0 7 to 17 00 m with a mean value of 6 65 m the specific yield in the area is approximately 0 1 akiti 1982 2 2 well construction casing and design in the study area two types of wells exist namely drilled boreholes and hand dug wells the drilled boreholes are made up of two types these are open wells without screens in the producing zone where the hole is cased with polyvinyl chloride pvc from the surface to the top of the hard rock and lined wells full construction where the hole is cased with pvc and is screened to the bottom of the well casing refers to the lining of the drilled well to prevent the unconsolidated overburden from caving in and direct contamination of the aquifer from the surface in the design of a lined well a screen perforated pvc pipe is placed through the productive zones of the aquifer while the nonproductive zones are lined with plain pvc pipes of similar material and diameter between the annular space of the walls of the well and the pvc pipe a filter medium usually a gravel of 2 4 mm grain size is placed to about 5 m above the top of the screen finally a cement grout is poured on a thin layer of river sand above the gravel and backfilled the remaining last 4 m is also grouted fig 2a in the case of wells not screened in the producing zone a plain pipe of specified diameter is placed from the ground surface through the overburden to the hard rock to avoid collapsing of the loose soil and grouted with cement in this design the hard rock and water bearing zones are uncased and have a smaller diameter than the upper lined section fig 2b a detailed description of well designs in ghana and their advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost and sustainability have been discussed in akudago et al 2007 the traditional hdws are shallow excavations into the clayey layers of the thinly weathered zone generally in valley bottoms where they intercept shallow circulating water water is normally stored in them during the rainy seasons for use in the dry season information on these wells are extremely limited and are not equipped with a pump they are generally shallow and dry up frequently abstraction rates are on average much lower than the boreholes the major problem is that they lack construction features that provide pollution protection and can therefore be easily contaminated they are usually not considered as safe drinking water and are therefore not considered in water resources planning 2 3 field work groundwater boreholes and hand dug wells and surface water rivers streams and ponds were taken from the uer of ghana both surface water and groundwater were sampled for hydrochemistry stable isotopes 18o 2h of h2o and 15n 18o of no3 prior to sampling the boreholes were purged of stagnant waters by pumping for several minutes water samples for hydrochemistry 15n no3 and 18o no3 were filtered 0 22 μm whatman membrane filters and gathered in 500 ml and 60 ml polyethylene bottles pre cleaned respectively the samples for stable isotopes were collected directly into 60 ml bottles samples for hydrochemistry and stable isotopes were stored in a refrigerator while 15n no3 and 18o no3 were frozen prior to shipment to the ghana atomic energy commission gaec and international atomic energy agency iaea laboratories for analysis ph conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were taken on site with hand held hach multi parameter meters hach usa alkalinity hco3 was also measured on site with the aid of a digital titrator 2 4 chemical and isotopic

los gatos research dlt 100 the δ15n and δ18o of no3 were analyzed in vienna austria iaea laboratories all samples were analyzed in duplicate the precision for δ2h and δ18o of h2o are 1 and 0 2 respectively the measurement precision for 15n no3 was 0 2 and 18o no3 was 0 3 the isotopic values δ notation were defined as δ sample r sample r standard r standard 1000 where r 2h 1h 15n 14n or 18o 16o the δ2h δ18o of h2o δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 isotope ratios are reported in per mil relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and atmospheric air air respectively 2 5 source apportionment using siar model the siar package in r is a bayesian isotope mixing model the reliability and usefulness of the model to calculate the relative contribution of multiple no3 sources in groundwater and surface water have been demonstrated by several researchers matiatos 2016 zhang et al 2018b li et al 2019 the model is purely based on the mass balance approach using bayesian probability the model treats the potential no3 sources as random variables characterized by a probability function the initial distribution of the source contribution is considered a dirichlet distribution this allows the sum of the potential sources contribution to be one yang et al 2013 the measured isotopes are usually included in the posterior distribution in practice the analytical forms of the posterior distribution are difficult to obtain the siar model therefore generates several outputs for the source inputs through markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulations the output of the

parnell et al 2010 in this study two isotopes j 2 namely δ15n δ18o of no3 and four 4 most likely sources rainfall sewage manure synthetic fertilizer and nitrate from the soil which are the expected no3 sources in the area based on the available information the initial distribution of the no3 source contribution in siar can be assumed as vague informative the study adopted the initial vague approach the initial mean and variance of all possible no3 sources in the area are the same the source terms sjk is modeled by siar as gaussian random variables to satisfy the normality assumption the mean and variance of the four potential sources were independently cited from the literature the measured isotope data groundwater and surface water from the area were used as inputs in siar 3 results 3 1 major ion chemistry and hydrochemical evolution of groundwater the basic statistical descriptions of the physico chemical parameters and the stable isotopes are shown in table 1 in the uer the boreholes water bh hand dug wells hdw and surface water sw were generally weakly acidic to weakly alkaline the ph ranged from 6 7 to 8 83 6 4 to 7 85 and 5 93 to 7 38 respectively tds values in sw and hdw were generally low with mean values of 110 and 283 mg l respectively however the bh exhibited slightly higher tds with a mean value of 322 mg l based on the tds categorization of water all three types of water had tds 1000 mg l hence they can be described as fresh freeze and cherry 1979 based on the mean values of the measured parameters in table 1 the ionic abundance for the bh hdw and sw occurred in the following order na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f the hydrochemistry of the water has therefore shown that there is an interplay of anthropogenic and natural geological environment on the groundwater chemistry in the study area the classification of groundwater into groups based on their chemical properties derived from the lithology flow pattern and resident time provides a better understanding of the hydrochemical properties of the aquifers mahlnecht et al 2004 the piper diagram consisting of a diamond shaped diagram sandwich between two trilinear diagrams is most widely used for identifying water types from the piper diagram in fig 3 na mg ca hco3 referred to as the mixed water type is the most representative geochemical facies and occurs in approximately 42 68 of the sources in the area in this water type there is no dominant cation and hco3 is the main anion this is closely followed by ca mg hco3 which constitutes 41 46 this water type is an indication of groundwater undergoing dynamic recharge with relatively short residence time and is characterized by temporary hardness a few of the boreholes 7 also show the na k hco3 water type this group of waters has the characteristics of recharging alkali carbonate water resulting from the interaction between groundwater and na silicate minerals i e albite hornblende cation exchange and anaerobic decay of organic matter within the soil zone other minor water types observed were ca mg so4 5 and na k cl 1 the hand dug wells and the surface water show only two water types na mg ca hco3 representing 54 16 and 73 68 respectively and ca mg hco3 accounted for 45 83 and 26 31 respectively it is worth mentioning here that ca2 and na and the interplay of hco3 and cl greatly influence the chemistry of the waters in the area 3 2 nitrate concentration and isotopic composition the results of the no3 concentration in the uer ranged from 2 61 to 107 41 mg l 13 36 to 32 71 mg l and 3 14 to 8 17 mg l for bh hdw and sw respectively fig 4a the no3 concentration in the bh exhibited a wide variation with the highest value 107 41 mg l recorded at pusiga chief palace well without screen around bawku fig 1 in all about 40 of the bh and 60 of the hdw samples had no3 greater than the who guideline limit of 50 mg l most of the bh samples showed appreciable levels of no3 the δ15n δ18o of no3 of the bh ranged from 5 8 to 22 6 and 1 2 to 19 4 respectively the hdw δ15n no3 ranged from 6 4 to 15 8 while δ18o no3 ranged from 7 6 to 13 9 respectively in the case of sw the δ15n δ18o of no3 ranged from 5 5 to 17 1 and from 7 3 to 25 5 respectively chloride concentration of the bh and hdw ranged from 1 01 to 283 6 mg l and 2 7 to 90 45 mg l from literature δ15n no3 between 8 0 6 2 and 10 0 20 9 are typical signatures of chemical fertilizer and sewage manure respectively overall approximately 61 of the bh samples showed δ15n no3 in the range of sewage manure the hdw and sw do not show any distinct isotopic signatures 3 3 stable isotope composition the δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o are shown in table 1 the bh δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values ranged from 24 42 to 15 46 and 4 5 to 2 87 respectively fig 5 the hdw δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o ranged from 23 21 to 12 27 and from 4 30 to 2 69 in the case of sw δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were generally enriched with isotopic values ranging from 1 85 to 10 33 and 6 91 to 49 77 the plot of δ2h δ18o of h2o of the bh hdw and sw was highly significant and defined a regression line of δ2h h2o 3 80 δ18o h2o 5 79 n 28 r2 0 33 δ2h h2o 6 51δ18o h2o 4 24 n 5 r2 0 97 and δ2h h2o 4 69 δ18o h2o 0 01 n 9 r2 0 99 respectively all the bh and hdw samples plot around the global meteoric water line gmwl signifying that they are of meteoric origin fig 4b however the sw samples plotted on the upper right signifying evaporation are taking place leading to the isotopic enrichment of the water samples the positions of the bh and sw samples indicate no possible linkage or connectivity between the bh and sw 4 discussions 4 1 nitrate source identification using hydrochemistry the chemistry of groundwater is mainly governed by the extent of water rock interactions and anthropogenic activities several studies have also reported the impact of silicate carbonate weathering and nitrate on groundwater chemical buccianti et al 2014 spalding et al 2018 showers et al 2008 the extent of these processes can be assessed using the plot na k hco3 against ca2 mg2 hco3 as shown in fig 4a in this plot the na k and ca2 mg2 expressed in meq l represent their relative quantity minus the quantity of cl and so4 2 in a 1 1 ratio respectively buccianti et al 2014 in this regard fig 5a shows some samples plotted close to lines 1 and 0 in the x axis and y axis and along the ca2 mg2 na k hco3 1 in quadrant i this implies that the weathering of carbonate and dissolution of silicate minerals are important contributors to the major ion chemistry roy et al 1999 the second group of samples located in quadrant ii are characterized by ca2 mg2 na k in excess of hco3 hence it cannot be attributed to carbonate weathering and silicate dissolution a possible explanation for the cation enrichment could be anthropogenic inputs agricultural domestic and industrial effluents in this regard because no3 k na and cl usually originate from anthropogenic activities crop production animal farming and municipal sewage and industrial waste and can alter the initial chemistry of the water their molar ratios can be exploited to trace the input of anthropogenic activities mainly from the agricultural component a c and domestic effluent d e in water systems roy et al 1999 the conservative nature of chloride cl in natural waters can be exploited to provide useful information for tracking contamination sources yue et al 2013 generally cl and na sources in aquatic systems are mineral dissolution from geology road salt household and industrial effluents the chloride values in the bh samples showed a relatively higher concentration compared to the hdw and sw furthermore a positive correlation with p 01 was observed in the plot of cl and no3 in all the water types fig 5b the study area is underlain by crystalline rocks with no halite deposits similarly it far away from the coast and no road salts are used hence could not be affected by seawater intrusion and leaching from road salts the possible sources of the observed chloride in the groundwater could be due to anthropogenic sources notably sewage manure industrial domestic waste no3 emanating from different sources has been shown to have different no3 cl ratios for instance untreated effluent from manure sewage is characterized by low no3 cl ratios and high cl values on the other hand chemical fertilizers have high no3 cl ratios with small cl concentrations xia et al 2017 therefore no3 cl ratios in meq l can be used as a pointer for nitrate sources however for successful application the effect of evaporite halite should first be examined and accounted for in this study the influence of evaporite was assumed to be negligible due to the absence of halite deposits the ratios of no3 cl varied widely in all the water types the bh samples had a no3 cl ratio ranging from 0 07 to 4 77 and a mean of 1 06 in the case of hdw and sw no3 cl ratios ranged from 0 09 to 3 46 and 0 00 to 2 33 mean of 0 82 and 0 73 respectively fig 5c the wide variation of no3 cl also signifies a mixture of multiple sources studies by roy et al 1999 established that the molar ratio of no3 na for ac is close to 10 and the cl na cluster around 3 to 5 5 on the other hand inputs of d e have molar ratios of no3 na close to 0 1 and cl na 0 6 to 1 0 fig 5d shows the relationship between cl na vs no3 na along with the potential anthropogenic sources roy et al 1999 it is worth mentioning that most of the bh hdw and sw clusters around the d e region with cl na and no3 na ratio in good agreement with the results obtained by anornu et al 2017 using dual isotopes δ15n and δ18o no3 in the area a further examination of fig 5d reveals that few boreholes and hand dug wells have no3 na approaching the value of a c along a mixing line this trend and the wide variation in no3 na and cl na in the study area suggest a rising contribution of the ac chemical fertilizer pollutants to the groundwater system which are mainly around the irrigation dams the results obtained are in good agreement with field observations in the area the main economic activity of the people in the area is farming and manure is the main source of nutrients to the crops 4 2 nitrate source identification using 15n no3 and 18o no3 in addition to the hydrochemistry the dual isotope bi plot δ15n δ18o of no3 proposed by kendall 1998 was also used to identify the main no3 sources fig 6 nitrate is the most mobile form of n fertilizer and easy moves with infiltrating water through soil profile the mobility of the ammonium and urea form of n fertilizer is usually hampered because they must initially undergo microbiological conversion to nitrate this implies that if no3 preferentially undergoes goes leaching in the study area then the 18o no3 values of the bh would predictably be 8 and plot in the region of no3 fertilizer the results of fig 6 show that preferential leaching of nitrate fertilizer to the groundwater did not occur the absence of enriched δ18o no3 in the bh and hdw suggests that fertilizer nitrate is not leached past crop rooting zone this is in agreement with the early finding of anornu et al 2017 furthermore none of the 15n no3 and 18o no3 values for both bh and hdw were light enough to group in the nh3 fertilizer envelope most of the bh and hdw fall into the manure septic source window the study area is predominantly rural with animal breeding cattle sheeps goats etc and agricultural activities furthermore with the exception of a few households with pit latrines pit dug for toilet and are usually covered after they are full and new ones dug at a different location most households resort to open defecation thus manure is the most likely source of no3 most of these bh also have high cl concentrations which is consistent with the findings of showers et al 2008 for animal waste derived no3 however since there are few urban and peri urban communities with small scale industries no3 from sewage cannot be completely neglected studies by appelo and postma 2007 showed that nitrate in groundwater emanating from the soil because the decay organic matter usually ranges from 0 062 to 12 4 mg l in our study majority of the bh and hdw samples have no3 concentrations 10 mg l this leads to the inference that manure septic is the dominant source two bh samples downstream of the tono irrigation dams which showed a heavier 17 6 and 16 9 δ18o and relatively lighter 5 8 and 7 0 δ15n plotted in the overlapping area of soil n chemical fertilizer and manure septic this may reflect potential direct no3 fertilizer transport these samples also have high no3 na and cl na ratios the surface water fig 6 showed complex signatures overlapping in the areas of manure septic chemical fertilizer and soil n window based on field observations intensive agricultural activities vegetable production with the use of chemical fertilizers compost and farm yard manure is occurring around the dams tono and vea furthermore no3 concentrations ranged from 0 44 to 29 17 mg l making it more difficult to identify the predominant source in order to resolve this issue the siar was used to estimate the fractions of each of the potential sources further analysis of the potential sources in the study are is dependent upon the presence absence of denitrification dentrification process can also lead to the reduction of no3 loading and make areas affected by fertilizer contamination appear to be affected by animal or septic waste showers et al 2008 the effect of denitrification on the isotopic signals is reflected in a positive δ15n no3 vs δ18o no3 slope both theoretical computation chen and macquarrie 2005 and field studies singleton et al 2007 have proved that water undergoing denitrification will have an enrichment slope around 0 5 the slightly negative 0 15 p 01 of the δ15n no3 vs δ18o no3 of the bh does not depict enrichment during nitrification fig 7a hence fractionation of the isotopes due to denitrification appears very limited or absent in the bh samples in the case of the hand dug wells fig 7b a positive slope m 0 3 was observed for the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 enrichment in the 9 hdw however the plot of δ15n no3 vs no3 fig 8 do not show the decrease in no3 concentration as the result of the 15 n no3 enrichment to suggest fractionation via denitrification the hdw have a wide diameter and generally not covered usually the water is drawn by buckets tied with rope by three or more people at a time this creates aeration and oxygenated groundwater leading to the enrichment of the isotopes of the n and o the effect of denitrification in sw was not examined because nitrate in sw undergo additional fractionation mechanisms 4 3 no3 source apportionment with siar the use of n and o isotopes greatly improved no3 source identification in aquatic environments however some few challenges still exist because of the overlapping signatures of some of the sources to overcome this challenge the siar package in r software bayesian isotope mixing model was applied to calculate the proportional fractions of nitrate sources from four 4 potential sources namely precipitation p sewage and manure s m chemical fertilizer cf and soil nitrogen sn furthermore the model was found to be sensitive to the source n and o isotopes and the fractionation factor however the effect of isotopic fractionation can be ignored if site specific signatures of the potential sources are used zhang et al 2018b due to the unavailability of site specific n and o values in our study area different combinations of the sources 15n and 18o and fractionation factors were used to attain posterior distribution with the least uncertainty table 2 based on the siar output results fig 9 the contribution of sewage manure in the bh was the highest 65 followed by soil nitrogen 23 chemical fertilizer 10 and precipitation 2 in hdw sewage manure contributed 68 soil nitrogen 18 chemical fertilizer 11 and precipitation 3 of no3 in the entire basin the groundwater no3 source fraction rates based on the mean probable estimate mpe were in the order s m sn cf p the findings indicated that s m is the dominant source of no3 in groundwater these are in agreement with the qualitative analysis of the δ15n δ18o of no3 and field observations the platform at some of the well heads are broken leading to the collection of dirty water with animal waste this could lead to the recirculation of dirty water in the well supplementary fig 1a b and d furthermore some farmers gathered animal droppings during the dry season and spread them in their farms as manure during the farming season supplementary fig 1c based on the siar output results fig 9 the contribution of sewage manure in the bh was the highest 65 followed by soil nitrogen 23 chemical fertilizer 10 and precipitation 2 in hdw sewage manure contributed 68 soil nitrogen 18 chemical fertilizer 11 and precipitation 3 of no3 in the entire basin the groundwater no3 source fraction rates based on the mean probable estimate mpe were in the order s m sn cf p the findings indicated that s m is the dominant source of no3 in groundwater these are in agreement with the qualitative analysis of the δ15n δ18o of no3 and field observations the platform at some of the well heads are broken leading to the collection of dirty water with animal waste this could lead to the recirculation of dirty water in the well supplementary fig 1a b and d furthermore some farmers gathered animal droppings during the dry season and spread them in their farms as manure during the farming season supplementary fig 1c the major economic activities in the area are animal rearing and subsistent farming the practice of collecting cow dungs for manure is widespread and ancient practice which has been continued till date the use of chemical fertilizers is mainly localized around vea and tono irrigation dams for dry season vegetable production hence the unlikely contribution of the chemical fertilizer atmospheric deposition showed the least no3 contribution to the groundwater the study area is predominantly rural in nature with no heavy industrial and vehicular emissions into the atmosphere furthermore some studies have reported little or no no3 from atmospheric precipitation in groundwater huang et al 2019 and no3 in precipitation can be altered by microbial nitrification or storm events in forests and agricultural watersheds buda and dewalle 2009 4 4 uncertainty analysis of siar model in general the source apportionments by siar in the study area were quite reasonable and agree with the hydrochemistry and field observations however to improve the model output the following unsolved issues need to be considered in future investigations 1 the site specific potential sources signatures of n and o isotopes should be analyzed to limit the uncertainty 2 the siar model assumes that the source n no3 and o no3 isotopes are normally distributed hence the application of the model on data that is not normally distributed should be done with caution to minimize the bias 4 5 future research needs and recommendations future studies should include data from the ongoing coordinated research project crp f32008 entitled global monitoring of nitrogen isotopes in atmospheric water funded by the international atomic energy agency iaea secondly the n and o signatures of the chemical fertilizer npk urea and sulphate of nh3 representative soil samples manure especially cow dung commonly used in the area should be analyzed thirdly samples should be taken in the unsaturated zone through core drilling at selected sites with different agricultural practices at different depth this is to better understand nitrate movement determine the existence or otherwise of large quantities of nitrate in the unsaturated zone likely to contaminate the groundwater it is therefore recommended that 1 there should be a comprehensive study of no3 contamination in this study area 2 although the area is a hard terrain and open wells are no longer a general practice in ghana especially government projects their construction by individuals or some ngos should be discouraged and 3 well drilling projects should include servicing and rehabilitation 5 conclusion groundwater no3 distribution in the uer of ghana was examined with the primary objective to identify the extent of contamination sources of no3 and proportional contribution of each of the potential sources in the groundwater the study adopted an integrated approach using hydrochemistry dual isotopes and the bayesian isotope mixing model siar the results showed that no3 concentrations in the bh hdw and sw varied from place to place and were greatly influenced by localized anthropogenic activities the hydrochemistry and the dual isotope 15n and 18o no3 identified manure sewage as the dominant source of no3 in the groundwater while the sw showed complex signatures overlapping in the areas of manure septic chemical fertilizer and soil nitrogen the dual isotope approach indicate that denitrification is not a significant isotope fractionation mechanism in the bh and hdw hence cannot lead to the reduction nitrate concentrations in the groundwater the siar results suggest that the majority of the bh hdw and sw were influenced by sewage manure contributing 66 68 and 55 of no3 respectively the no3 source fraction rates based on the mean probable estimate mpe were in the order s m sn cf p to improve the siar estimates site specific 15n and 18o no3 of the potential sources should be used however in the absence of site specific data different combinations of the sources 15n and 18o no3 and fractionation factors should be used to decrease the uncertainty the study provided further insight on the state of knowledge on nitrate contamination in the area and highlighted the use of hydrochemistry isotopes and isotope mixing models for no3 source identification and apportionment this is to enable effective water resources planning to safeguard groundwater quality and control

1507,the rising food production to meet the growing human population has led to increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients such as no3 in groundwater and aquatic environments nitrate concentrations hydrochemistry and isotope data δ18o h2o δ2h h2o 15n no3 and δ18o no3 from boreholes bh hand dug wells hdw and surface water sw were analyzed the objectives of the study were to identify potential nitrate sources and their proportional contributions using an isotope mixing model siar the results showed that no3 concentrations in the bh hdw and sw were heterogeneous and controlled by localized anthropogenic activities the hydrochemistry and dual isotope 15n no3 and 18o no3 identified manure sewage as the dominant source of no3 in the groundwater while the sw showed a complex signature overlapping in the areas of manure septic chemical fertilizer and soil nitrogen the siar analysis showed that sewage manure contributed about 66 68 and 55 of no3 in the bh hdw and sw respectively in the study area the no3 source contribution based on the mean probable estimate mpe were in the order s m sn cf p shortcomings and the uncertainties associated with the siar to guide future studies have also been discussed the study also highlighted the use of hydrochemistry environmental isotopes and bayesian isotope mixing models for no3 source identification and apportionment this is to

unlabelled image keywords nitrate hydrochemistry nitrogen isotopes 15n no3 and 18o no3 source apportionment siar ghana 1 introduction provision of potable water is still a major challenge for some countries especially in sub saharan africa in recent years due to intense and sustained international efforts an estimated 2 6 billion people now have access to drinking water who 2015 nonetheless the safety and quality of drinking water sources is still a growing concern due to anthropogenic activities such as agriculture mining and industrial development li et al 2017 nitrate no3 has now been found as a widespread pollutant in water systems as a result of human activities the rising human and ecological health concerns of no3 in water resources have led many countries and regional blocks such as the european union to implement legislations nitrates directive 91 676 eec and the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec to monitor manage or limit their release into the environment bouraoui et al 2009 the presence of nitrate in aquatic systems has been reported worldwide juntakut et al 2019 spalding et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a anornu et al 2017 ako et al 2013 lasagna et al 2016 sharma et al 2016 showers et al 2008 possible sources of nitrate in aquatic systems include atmospheric precipitation synthetic fertilizers nitrogen from the soil manure and waste from industries over the past decades many studies were carried out in ghana to assess the quality of groundwater and surface water yidana et al 2012 ahialey et al 2011 gibrilla et al 2010 anku et al 2009 most of these studies reported high no3 levels in drinking water surface water and groundwater across the country however since nitrate in water originates from various sources it is very important for any monitoring program to track and apportion the no3 sources in the contaminated aquatic systems puig et al 2017 this information will provide valuable information to controlling no3 contamination improving management of water resources and targeted remediation of contaminated areas to effectively improve water quality and control measures in an attempt to resolve the issue of nitrate sources in aquatic systems various methodologies have been adopted the most widely and successfully used approach in the scientific literature is the δ15n δ18o of no3 spalding et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a sanchez et al 2017 fenech et al 2012 furthermore the coupling of isotope data with the bayesian mixing model provides a powerful tool to estimate the propositional mixing fractions of different no3 sources the model siar stable isotope analysis in r provides a framework to create several models with user friendly options governed by the user input data yang et al 2013 the siar a package in r software can apportion three or more no3 sources with only δ15n and δ18o of no3 several studies have established that the output from the siar model is able to identify the fingerprints of different no3 sources matiatos 2016 xia et al 2017 in ghana most rural and peri urban areas dwellers depend on groundwater boreholes and hand dug well and raw surface water for drinking and other domestic activities in most cases without any form of treatment quite recent studies have revealed an increasing trend of no3 contamination in groundwater due to agricultural and improper disposal of solid and liquid waste hence raising concerns about its future usage as a safe and sustainable option for drinking water anornu et al 2017 there is also a high prevalence of open defecation poor sanitation and the use of farm yard manure the use of chemical fertilizers npk urea and ammonium sulphate is also on the increased especially in areas around the irrigation dams the topography is characterized by flat and fairly undulating ground with short tress and savannah grassland currently there is no legislation or agricultural policy to regulate the use of chemical fertilizers this is because most studies on water quality in the country only report contaminant concentrations and their trends in drinking water thereby making policy formulation to safeguard water quality quite difficult it is therefore imperative to identify and apportion the potential sources of nitrate to provide evidence that will aid policy formulation for sustainable water resources management to meet the growing water demand in the country the objectives of the study were 1 to assess the extent of nitrate contamination in the white volta basin 2 to identify the origin of no3 using δ15n and δ18o and 3 use the siar model to apportion quantitatively the probable no3 sources in the study area it is envisaged that the current study will provide new and useful information that will help develop appropriate management practices for an effective no3 pollution control mechanism to provide sustainable clean water for human consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the upper east region uer is one of the smallest regions in ghana it shares geogrhical boundaries westward with the upper west region northward with burkina faso eastward with togo and southward with northern region fig 1 the major rivers in the area are black white and red volta other river systems are tono siisili and tamne the area is characterized by a short rainy season between may and august with extreme rainfall events leading to flooding in most areas this is followed by a long dry season the mean annual rainfall pan evaporation and temperature are estimated to be approximately 1100 mm 2500 mm and 28 c respectively the precambrian age birimian granites and metamorphic rocks underlain the study area the eastern and western parts have few patches of phylytes tuffs greywacke and schists similarly the south eastern sections have few outcrops of the voltain palaeozoic sandstones generally the borehole depths are usually not more than 30 m in granite terrains with static water levels 10 m the yield varies from 22 to 50 l min with much higher yields obtained in highly fractured areas transmissivity varies from place to place depending on the geology joining and extent of weathering and fracturing in general the wells are beneath water level conditions ranging from 0 7 to 17 00 m with a mean value of 6 65 m the specific yield in the area is approximately 0 1 akiti 1982 2 2 well construction casing and design in the study area two types of wells exist namely drilled boreholes and hand dug wells the drilled boreholes are made up of two types these are open wells without screens in the producing zone where the hole is cased with polyvinyl chloride pvc from the surface to the top of the hard rock and lined wells full construction where the hole is cased with pvc and is screened to the bottom of the well casing refers to the lining of the drilled well to prevent the unconsolidated overburden from caving in and direct contamination of the aquifer from the surface in the design of a lined well a screen perforated pvc pipe is placed through the productive zones of the aquifer while the nonproductive zones are lined with plain pvc pipes of similar material and diameter between the annular space of the walls of the well and the pvc pipe a filter medium usually a gravel of 2 4 mm grain size is placed to about 5 m above the top of the screen finally a cement grout is poured on a thin layer of river sand above the gravel and backfilled the remaining last 4 m is also grouted fig 2a in the case of wells not screened in the producing zone a plain pipe of specified diameter is placed from the ground surface through the overburden to the hard rock to avoid collapsing of the loose soil and grouted with cement in this design the hard rock and water bearing zones are uncased and have a smaller diameter than the upper lined section fig 2b a detailed description of well designs in ghana and their advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost and sustainability have been discussed in akudago et al 2007 the traditional hdws are shallow excavations into the clayey layers of the thinly weathered zone generally in valley bottoms where they intercept shallow circulating water water is normally stored in them during the rainy seasons for use in the dry season information on these wells are extremely limited and are not equipped with a pump they are generally shallow and dry up frequently abstraction rates are on average much lower than the boreholes the major problem is that they lack construction features that provide pollution protection and can therefore be easily contaminated they are usually not considered as safe drinking water and are therefore not considered in water resources planning 2 3 field work groundwater boreholes and hand dug wells and surface water rivers streams and ponds were taken from the uer of ghana both surface water and groundwater were sampled for hydrochemistry stable isotopes 18o 2h of h2o and 15n 18o of no3 prior to sampling the boreholes were purged of stagnant waters by pumping for several minutes water samples for hydrochemistry 15n no3 and 18o no3 were filtered 0 22 μm whatman membrane filters and gathered in 500 ml and 60 ml polyethylene bottles pre cleaned respectively the samples for stable isotopes were collected directly into 60 ml bottles samples for hydrochemistry and stable isotopes were stored in a refrigerator while 15n no3 and 18o no3 were frozen prior to shipment to the ghana atomic energy commission gaec and international atomic energy agency iaea laboratories for analysis ph conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were taken on site with hand held hach multi parameter meters hach usa alkalinity hco3 was also measured on site with the aid of a digital titrator 2 4 chemical and isotopic analysis the chemical so4 2 no3 cl na k ca2 and mg2 and isotopes δ2h and δ18o of h2o analyses were done at cnesten rabat morocco and gaec accra ghana using ion chromatography and laser spectroscopy los gatos research dlt 100 the δ15n and δ18o of no3 were analyzed in vienna austria iaea laboratories all samples were analyzed in duplicate the precision for δ2h and δ18o of h2o are 1 and 0 2 respectively the measurement precision for 15n no3 was 0 2 and 18o no3 was 0 3 the isotopic values δ notation were defined as δ sample r sample r standard r standard 1000 where r 2h 1h 15n 14n or 18o

apportionment using siar model the siar package in r is a bayesian isotope mixing model the reliability and usefulness of the model to calculate the relative contribution of multiple no3 sources in groundwater and surface water have been demonstrated by several researchers matiatos 2016 zhang et al 2018b li et al 2019 the model is purely based on the mass balance approach using bayesian probability the model treats the potential no3 sources as random variables characterized by a probability function the initial distribution of the source contribution is considered a dirichlet distribution this allows the sum of the potential sources contribution to be one yang et al 2013 the measured isotopes are usually included in the posterior distribution in practice the analytical forms of the posterior distribution are difficult to obtain the siar model therefore generates several outputs for the source inputs through markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulations the output of the posterior distribution gives the mean standard deviation quartiles etc of the potential sources contribution x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 ε ij n o σ j 2 where xij measured isotope j j 1 2 3 j of resultant mixture i i 1 2 3 n sjk source value k on isotope j k 1 2 3 k and normally distributed with mean and standard deviation μjk and ωjk respectively pk

other unaccounted deviation between individual mixtures and is normally distributed with mean o and standard deviation σj the principles and application description of the siar model are discussed in parnell et al 2010 in this study two isotopes j 2 namely δ15n δ18o of no3 and four 4 most likely sources rainfall sewage manure synthetic fertilizer and nitrate from the soil which are the expected no3 sources in the area based on the available information the initial distribution of the no3 source contribution in siar can be assumed as vague informative the study adopted the initial vague approach the initial mean and variance of all possible no3 sources in the area are the same the source terms sjk is modeled by siar as gaussian random variables to satisfy the normality assumption the mean and variance of the four potential sources were independently cited from the literature the measured isotope data groundwater and surface water from the area were used as inputs in siar 3 results 3 1 major ion chemistry and hydrochemical evolution of groundwater the basic statistical descriptions of the physico chemical parameters and the stable isotopes are shown in table 1 in the uer the boreholes water bh hand dug wells hdw and surface water sw were generally weakly acidic to weakly alkaline the ph ranged from 6 7 to 8 83 6 4 to 7 85 and 5 93 to 7 38 respectively tds values in sw and hdw were generally low with mean values of 110 and 283 mg l respectively however the bh exhibited slightly higher tds with a mean value of 322 mg l based on the tds categorization of water all three types of water had tds 1000 mg l hence they can be described as fresh freeze and cherry 1979 based on the mean values of the measured parameters in table 1 the ionic abundance for the bh hdw and sw occurred in the following order na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f the hydrochemistry of the water has therefore shown that there is an interplay of anthropogenic and natural geological environment on the groundwater chemistry in the study area the classification of groundwater into groups based on their chemical properties derived from the lithology flow pattern and resident time provides a better understanding of the hydrochemical properties of the aquifers mahlnecht et al 2004 the piper diagram consisting of a diamond shaped diagram sandwich between two trilinear diagrams is most widely used for identifying water types from the piper diagram in fig 3 na mg ca hco3 referred to as the mixed water type is the most representative geochemical facies and occurs in approximately 42 68 of the sources in the area in this water type there is no dominant cation and hco3 is the main anion this is closely followed by ca mg hco3 which constitutes 41 46 this water type is an indication of groundwater undergoing dynamic recharge with relatively short residence time and is characterized by temporary hardness a few of the boreholes 7 also show the na k hco3 water type this group of waters has the characteristics of recharging alkali carbonate water resulting from the interaction between groundwater and na silicate minerals i e albite hornblende cation exchange and anaerobic decay of organic matter within the soil zone other minor water types observed were ca mg so4 5 and na k cl 1 the hand dug wells and the surface water show only two water types na mg ca hco3 representing 54 16 and 73 68 respectively and ca mg hco3 accounted for 45 83 and 26 31 respectively it is worth mentioning here that ca2 and na and the interplay of hco3 and cl greatly influence the chemistry of the waters in the area 3 2 nitrate concentration and isotopic composition the results of the no3 concentration in the uer ranged from 2 61 to 107 41 mg l 13 36 to 32 71 mg l and 3 14 to 8 17 mg l for bh hdw and sw respectively fig 4a the no3 concentration in the bh exhibited a wide variation with the highest value 107 41 mg l recorded at pusiga chief palace well without screen around bawku fig 1 in all about 40 of the bh and 60 of the hdw samples had no3 greater than the who guideline limit of 50 mg l most of the bh samples showed appreciable levels of no3 the δ15n δ18o of no3 of the bh ranged from 5 8 to 22 6 and 1 2 to 19 4 respectively the hdw δ15n no3 ranged from 6 4 to 15 8 while δ18o no3 ranged from 7 6 to 13 9 respectively in the case of sw the δ15n δ18o of no3 ranged from 5 5 to 17 1 and from 7 3 to 25 5 respectively chloride concentration of the bh and hdw ranged from 1 01 to 283 6 mg l and 2 7 to 90 45 mg l from literature δ15n no3 between 8 0 6 2 and 10 0 20 9 are typical signatures of chemical fertilizer and sewage manure respectively overall approximately 61 of the bh samples showed δ15n no3 in the range of sewage manure the hdw and sw do not show any distinct isotopic signatures 3 3 stable isotope composition the δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o are shown in table 1 the bh δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values ranged from 24 42 to 15 46 and 4 5 to 2 87 respectively fig 5 the hdw δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o ranged from 23 21 to 12 27 and from 4 30 to 2 69 in the case of sw δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were generally enriched with isotopic values ranging from 1 85 to 10 33 and 6 91 to 49 77 the plot of δ2h δ18o of h2o of the bh hdw and sw was highly significant and defined a regression line of δ2h h2o 3 80 δ18o h2o 5 79 n 28 r2 0 33 δ2h h2o 6 51δ18o h2o 4 24 n 5 r2 0 97 and δ2h h2o 4 69 δ18o h2o 0 01 n 9 r2 0 99 respectively all the bh and hdw samples plot around the global meteoric water line gmwl signifying that they are of meteoric origin fig 4b however the sw samples plotted on the upper right signifying evaporation are taking place leading to the isotopic enrichment of the water samples the positions of the bh and sw samples indicate no possible linkage or connectivity between the bh and sw 4 discussions 4 1 nitrate source identification using hydrochemistry the chemistry of groundwater is mainly governed by the extent of water rock interactions and anthropogenic activities several studies have also reported the impact of silicate carbonate weathering and nitrate on groundwater chemical buccianti et al 2014 spalding et al 2018 showers et al 2008 the extent of these processes can be assessed using the plot na k hco3 against ca2 mg2 hco3 as shown in fig 4a in this plot the na k and ca2 mg2 expressed in meq l represent their relative quantity minus the quantity of cl and so4 2 in a 1 1 ratio respectively buccianti et al 2014 in this regard fig 5a shows some samples plotted close to lines 1 and 0 in the x axis and y axis and along the ca2 mg2 na k hco3 1 in quadrant i this implies that the weathering of carbonate and dissolution of silicate minerals are important contributors to the major ion chemistry roy et al 1999 the second group of samples located in quadrant ii are characterized by ca2 mg2 na k in excess of hco3 hence it cannot be attributed to carbonate weathering and silicate dissolution a possible explanation for the cation enrichment could be anthropogenic inputs agricultural domestic and industrial effluents in this regard because no3 k na and cl usually originate from anthropogenic activities crop production animal farming and municipal sewage and industrial waste and can alter the initial chemistry of the water their molar ratios can be exploited to trace the input of anthropogenic activities mainly from the agricultural component a c and domestic effluent d e in water systems roy et al 1999 the conservative nature of chloride cl in natural waters can be exploited to provide useful information for tracking contamination sources yue et al 2013 generally cl and na sources in aquatic systems are mineral dissolution from geology road salt household and industrial effluents the chloride values in the bh samples showed a relatively higher concentration compared to the hdw and sw furthermore a positive correlation with p 01 was observed in the plot of cl and no3 in all the water types fig 5b the study area is underlain by crystalline rocks with no halite deposits similarly it far away from the coast and no road salts are used hence could not be affected by seawater intrusion and leaching from road salts the possible sources of the observed chloride in the groundwater could be due to anthropogenic sources notably sewage manure industrial domestic waste no3 emanating from different sources has been shown to have different no3 cl ratios for instance untreated effluent from manure sewage is characterized by low no3 cl ratios and high cl values on the other hand chemical fertilizers have high no3 cl ratios with small cl concentrations xia et al 2017 therefore no3 cl ratios in meq l can be used as a pointer for nitrate sources however for successful application the effect of evaporite halite should first be examined and accounted for in this study the influence of evaporite was assumed to be negligible due to the absence of halite deposits the ratios of no3 cl varied widely in all the water types the bh samples had a no3 cl ratio ranging from 0 07 to 4 77 and a mean of 1 06 in the case of hdw and sw no3 cl ratios ranged from 0 09 to 3 46 and 0 00 to 2 33 mean of 0 82 and 0 73 respectively fig 5c the wide variation of no3 cl also signifies a mixture of multiple sources studies by roy et al 1999 established that the molar ratio of no3 na for ac is close to 10 and the cl na cluster around 3 to 5 5 on the other hand inputs of d e have molar ratios of no3 na close to 0 1 and cl na 0 6 to 1 0 fig 5d shows the relationship between cl na vs no3 na along with the potential anthropogenic sources roy et al 1999 it is worth mentioning that most of the bh hdw and sw clusters around the d e region with cl na and no3 na ratio in good agreement with the results obtained by anornu et al 2017 using dual isotopes δ15n and δ18o no3 in the area a further examination of fig 5d reveals that few boreholes and hand dug wells have no3 na approaching the value of a c along a mixing line this trend and the wide variation in no3 na and cl na in the study area suggest a rising contribution of the ac chemical fertilizer pollutants to the groundwater system which are mainly around the irrigation dams the results obtained are in good agreement with field observations in the area the main economic activity of the people in the area is farming and manure is the main source of nutrients to the crops 4 2 nitrate source identification using 15n no3 and 18o no3 in addition to the hydrochemistry the dual isotope bi plot δ15n δ18o of no3 proposed by kendall 1998 was also used to identify the main no3 sources fig 6 nitrate is the most mobile form of n fertilizer and easy moves with infiltrating water through soil profile the mobility of the ammonium and urea form of n fertilizer is usually hampered because they must initially undergo microbiological conversion to nitrate this implies that if no3 preferentially undergoes goes leaching in the study area then the 18o no3 values of the bh would predictably be 8 and plot in the region of no3 fertilizer the results of fig 6 show that preferential leaching of nitrate fertilizer to the groundwater did not occur the absence of enriched δ18o no3 in the bh and hdw suggests that fertilizer nitrate is not leached past crop rooting zone this is in agreement with the early finding of anornu et al 2017 furthermore none of the 15n no3 and 18o no3 values for both bh and hdw were light enough to group in the nh3 fertilizer envelope most of the bh and hdw fall into the manure septic source window the study area is predominantly rural with animal breeding cattle sheeps goats etc and agricultural activities furthermore with the exception of a few households with pit latrines pit dug for toilet and are usually covered after they are full and new ones dug at a different location most households resort to open defecation thus manure is the most likely source of no3 most of these bh also have high cl concentrations which is consistent with the findings of showers et al 2008 for animal waste derived no3 however since there are few urban and peri urban communities with small scale industries no3 from sewage cannot be completely neglected studies by appelo and postma 2007 showed that nitrate in groundwater emanating from the soil because the decay organic matter usually ranges from 0 062 to 12 4 mg l in our study majority of the bh and hdw samples have no3 concentrations 10 mg l this leads to the inference that manure septic is the dominant source two bh samples downstream of the tono irrigation dams which showed a heavier 17 6 and 16 9 δ18o and relatively lighter 5 8 and 7 0 δ15n plotted in the overlapping area of soil n chemical fertilizer and manure septic this may reflect potential direct no3 fertilizer transport these samples also have high no3 na and cl na ratios the surface water fig 6 showed complex signatures overlapping in the areas of manure septic chemical fertilizer and soil n window based on field observations intensive agricultural activities vegetable production with the use of chemical fertilizers compost and farm yard manure is occurring around the dams tono and vea furthermore no3 concentrations ranged from 0 44 to 29 17 mg l making it more difficult to identify the predominant source in order to resolve this issue the siar was used to estimate the fractions of each of the potential sources further analysis of the potential sources in the study are is dependent upon the presence absence of denitrification dentrification process can also lead to the reduction of no3 loading and make areas affected by fertilizer contamination appear to be affected by animal or septic waste showers et al 2008 the effect of denitrification on the isotopic signals is reflected in a positive δ15n no3 vs δ18o no3 slope both theoretical computation chen and macquarrie 2005 and field studies singleton et al 2007 have proved that water undergoing denitrification will have an enrichment slope around 0 5 the slightly negative 0 15 p 01 of the δ15n no3 vs δ18o no3 of the bh does not depict enrichment during nitrification fig 7a hence fractionation of the isotopes due to denitrification appears very limited or absent in the bh samples in the case of the hand dug wells fig 7b a positive slope m 0 3 was observed for the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 enrichment in the 9 hdw however the plot of δ15n no3 vs no3 fig 8 do not show the decrease in no3 concentration as the result of the 15 n no3 enrichment to suggest fractionation via denitrification the hdw have a wide diameter and generally not covered usually the water is drawn by buckets tied with rope by three or more people at a time this creates aeration and oxygenated groundwater leading to the enrichment of the isotopes of the n and o the effect of denitrification in sw was not examined because nitrate in sw undergo additional fractionation mechanisms 4 3 no3 source apportionment with siar the use of n and o isotopes greatly improved no3 source identification in aquatic environments however some few challenges still exist because of the overlapping signatures of some of the sources to overcome this challenge the siar package in r software bayesian isotope mixing model was applied to calculate the proportional fractions of nitrate sources from four 4 potential sources namely precipitation p sewage and manure s m chemical fertilizer cf and soil nitrogen sn furthermore the model was found to be sensitive to the source n and o isotopes and the fractionation factor however the effect of isotopic fractionation can be ignored if site specific signatures of the potential sources are used zhang et al 2018b due to the unavailability of site specific n and o values in our study area different combinations of the sources 15n and 18o and fractionation factors were used to attain posterior distribution with the least uncertainty table 2 based on the siar output results fig 9 the contribution of sewage manure in the bh was the highest 65 followed by soil nitrogen 23 chemical fertilizer 10 and precipitation 2 in hdw sewage manure contributed 68 soil nitrogen 18 chemical fertilizer 11 and precipitation 3 of no3 in the entire basin the groundwater no3 source fraction rates based on the mean probable estimate mpe were in the order s m sn cf p the findings indicated that s m is the dominant source of no3 in groundwater these are in agreement with the qualitative analysis of the δ15n δ18o of no3 and field observations the platform at some of the well heads are broken leading to the collection of dirty water with animal waste this could lead to the recirculation of dirty water in the well supplementary fig 1a b and d furthermore some farmers gathered animal droppings during the dry season and spread them in their farms as manure during the farming season supplementary fig 1c based on the siar output results fig 9 the contribution of sewage manure in the bh was the highest 65 followed by soil nitrogen 23 chemical fertilizer 10 and precipitation 2 in hdw sewage manure contributed 68 soil nitrogen 18 chemical fertilizer 11 and precipitation 3 of no3 in the entire basin the groundwater no3 source fraction rates based on the mean probable estimate mpe were in the order s m sn cf p the findings indicated that

leading to the collection of dirty water with animal waste this could lead to the recirculation of dirty water in the well supplementary fig 1a b and d furthermore some farmers gathered animal droppings during the dry season and spread them in their farms as manure during the farming season supplementary fig 1c the major economic activities in the area are animal rearing and subsistent farming the practice of collecting cow dungs for manure is widespread and ancient practice which has been continued till date the use of chemical fertilizers is mainly localized around vea and tono irrigation dams for dry season vegetable production hence the unlikely contribution of the chemical fertilizer atmospheric deposition showed the least no3 contribution to the groundwater the study area is predominantly rural in nature with no heavy industrial and vehicular emissions into the atmosphere furthermore some studies have reported little or no no3 from atmospheric precipitation in groundwater huang et al 2019 and no3 in precipitation can be altered by microbial nitrification or storm events in forests and agricultural watersheds buda and dewalle 2009 4 4 uncertainty analysis of siar model in general the source apportionments by siar in the study area were quite reasonable and agree with the hydrochemistry and field observations however to improve the model output the following unsolved issues need to be considered in future investigations 1 the site specific potential sources signatures of n and o isotopes should be analyzed to limit the uncertainty 2 the siar model assumes that the source n no3 and o no3 isotopes are normally distributed hence the application of the model on data that is not normally distributed should be done with caution to minimize the bias 4 5 future research needs and recommendations future studies should include data from the ongoing coordinated research project crp f32008 entitled global monitoring of nitrogen isotopes in atmospheric water funded by the international atomic energy agency iaea secondly the n and o signatures of the chemical fertilizer npk urea and sulphate of nh3 representative soil samples manure especially cow dung commonly used in the area should be analyzed thirdly samples should be taken in the unsaturated zone through core drilling at selected sites with different agricultural practices at different depth this is to better understand nitrate movement determine the existence or otherwise of large quantities of nitrate in the unsaturated zone likely to contaminate the groundwater it is therefore recommended that 1 there should be a comprehensive study of no3 contamination in this study area 2 although the area is a hard terrain and open wells are no longer a general practice in ghana especially government projects their construction by individuals or some ngos should be discouraged and 3 well drilling projects should include servicing and rehabilitation 5 conclusion groundwater no3 distribution in the uer of ghana was examined with the primary objective to identify the extent of contamination sources of no3 and proportional contribution of each of the potential sources in the groundwater the study adopted an integrated approach using hydrochemistry dual isotopes and the bayesian isotope mixing model siar the results showed that no3 concentrations in the bh hdw and sw varied from place to place and were greatly influenced by localized anthropogenic activities the hydrochemistry and the dual isotope 15n and 18o no3 identified manure sewage as the dominant source of no3 in the groundwater while the sw showed complex signatures overlapping in the areas of manure septic chemical fertilizer and soil nitrogen the dual isotope approach indicate that denitrification is not a significant isotope fractionation mechanism in the bh and hdw hence cannot lead to the reduction nitrate concentrations in the groundwater the siar results suggest that the majority of the bh hdw and sw were influenced by sewage manure contributing 66 68 and 55 of no3 respectively the no3 source fraction rates based on the mean probable estimate mpe were in the order s m sn cf p to improve the siar estimates site specific 15n and 18o no3 of the potential sources should be used however in the absence of site specific data different combinations of the sources 15n and 18o no3 and fractionation factors should be used to decrease the uncertainty the study provided further insight on the state of knowledge on nitrate contamination in the area and highlighted the use of hydrochemistry isotopes and isotope mixing models for no3 source identification and apportionment this is to enable effective water resources planning to safeguard groundwater quality and control

1508,transport of ten perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas was studied with one dimensional 1 d saturated column experiments using four soil types with an organic carbon fraction foc range of 0 0 045 columns were operated under conditions relevant to aqueous film forming foam afff impacted fire protection training areas to determine the ability of equilibrium transport parameters to describe 1 d pfaa transport if rate limited sorption influences pfaa transport and if kinetic parameters can be used to evaluate factors causing rate limited sorption results of initial screening of pfaa breakthrough found that over half of the breakthrough curves deviated from equilibrium transport and merited further investigation subsequent analysis showed that in many cases these deviations could be accounted for by considering the range of applicable equilibrium kd values i e based on standard deviation applicable to the solid phase thus transport of the majority of pfaas in 3 soils with foc of 0 0 017 was not impacted by rate limited sorption further low sorption led to transport that was essentially simultaneous for the majority of pfaas in these porous media exceptions were observed for long chain pfaas and also in a fourth soil with foc of 0 045 which indicated the potential for rate limited sorption to impact transport in some scenarios subsequent flow interruption experiments isolating kinetic behavior confirmed rate limited sorption caused nonequilibrium transport linear free energy relationships lfers developed in previous work to predict the inverse relationship between mass transfer coefficients k and sorption parameters i e kd were used to estimate values of k for pfaas in this study resulting k values were 10 3 to 10 8 h 1 consistent with previously measured kinetic parameters for other polar and anionic compounds models incorporating estimated k values resulted in improved predictions of breakthrough observed in nonequilibrium scenarios r2 0 83 0 98 but k values will require further validation prior to broader application this work illustrates rate limited sorption considerations are needed to describe 1 d column saturated transport for some pfaas and solid phases at field scales subsurface heterogeneity and pfaa precursor transformation may be equally or even more important in determining saturated pfaa transport but kinetic parameters in this study may help to determine relative contributions of rate limited sorption to overall transport 1 introduction poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass have been manufactured and used in a variety of industrial and consumer products and processes since the early 1960s including fluoropolymer manufacturing nonstick coatings and a special class of firefighting foam known as aqueous film forming foam afff kissa 2001 designed for fighting fuel fires afff is often utilized by fire fighting facilities the hydrocarbon industry and the military anderson et al 2016 in may 2016 the environmental protection agency epa issued drinking water health advisories of 0 07 μg l for the sum of two pfass perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos usepa 2016a usepa 2016b such low advisories are driven by concerns regarding human health risks to the developing fetus along with potential links to cancer and toxicity in the liver and kidney usepa 2016a usepa 2016b activities such as fluoropolymer manufacturing and repeat use of afff at fire protection training areas fptas have led to comparatively high occurrence of pfass in groundwater at μg l to mg l levels moody et al 2003 schultz et al 2004 mcguire et al 2014 weber et al 2017 shin et al 2011 underscoring the need for comprehensive understanding of transport of these compounds in subsurface systems afff formulations are complex proprietary and often include solvents and both fluorinated i e pfass and hydrocarbon surfactants moody and field 1999 place and field 2012 pfass include perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas e g pfos pfoa distinguishable by a fully saturated fluorocarbon tail comprised of strong carbon fluorine bonds these bonds make pfaas chemically stable and generally resistant to processes such as hydrolysis photolysis and oxidation and they are therefore extremely persistent in the environment kissa 2001 giesy and kannan 2002 giesy and kannan 2001 park et al 2016 afff formulations have historically included some pfaas e g pfos but also a substantial portion of polyfluorinated substances that can be converted to pfaas in the environment mcguire et al 2014 houtz et al 2013 because of their persistence interactions with aquifer sediment via sorption will be fundamental in determining the fate and transport of pfaas in groundwater most previous studies have focused on equilibrium batch sorption of pfaas to sediments biosolids and mineral surfaces and under conditions specifically relevant to afff impacted fptas higgins and luthy 2006 sepulvado et al 2011 tang et al 2010 guelfo and higgins 2013 additionally recent work investigated transport of pfoa in columns packed with sand under both saturated and unsaturated conditions with the objective of understanding the impact of the air water interface and co contaminants on pfas transport using a solid phase to which there is minimal sorption lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019 that data was re examined along with data for pfos to build a multi process transport model inclusive of rate limited sorption brusseau 2020 finally column studies have examined how application of chemical oxidation remediation techniques and resulting alteration of subsurface conditions may influence transport of pfaas mckenzie et al 2015 mckenzie et al 2016 however studies understanding the applicability of batch sorption studies to advective transport of pfaas are limited under water saturated equilibrium conditions pfaa transport is expected to decrease with increasing chain length for pfaas with cf3 cf2 n x where n 4 higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 similar trends were observed in experiments that studied the leaching behavior of pfaas from soil in flow through column experiments gellrich et al 2012 stahl et al 2013 vierke et al 2014 however sorption of some shorter pfaas cf3 cf2 n x where n 4 in batch systems did not follow chain length dependent trends with perfluorobutanoate pfba exhibiting stronger sorption than perfluoropentanoate pfpea or perfluorohexanoate pfhxa guelfo and higgins 2013 similarly a field study that calculated sorption parameters i e kd based on water and sediment concentrations found chain length dependent trends in kd only for cf3 cf2 n x where n 6 labadie and chevreuil 2011 additional sorption trends include nonlinear e g freundlich sorption and increasing sorption with increasing solid phase foc higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 in equilibrium transport sorption is presumed to be instantaneous under the assumption that it occurs at much faster rates than the residence time of groundwater however it has long been recognized that sorption of organic contaminants can be rate limited leading to nonequilibrium transport wu and gschwend 1986 brusseau 1994 luthy et al 1997 various mechanisms have been proposed to explain rate limited sorption behavior typically involving interactions with organic matter such as organic matter diffusion pignatello and xing 1996 rate limited sorption behavior manifests itself in different ways depending on the scale of transport in one dimensional 1 d flow through column experiments when sorption is rate limited transport is sometimes characterized by early breakthrough and or tailing of compound breakthrough curves btcs brusseau 1992 at larger scales impacts are more uncertain but can lead to plume spreading lower peak concentrations and tailing brusseau 1992 pickens et al 1981 understanding rate limited sorption can have important implications for modeling plume behavior and evaluating remedial options rate limited sorption due to mass transfer limitations can be impacted by various compound properties for many classes of neutral nonpolar hydrophobic organic compounds hocs the primary compound factors controlling mass transfer coefficients k see section 2 6 are sorbate size and hydrophobicity as evidenced by a single lfer that can describe an inverse relationship between log k and log kd across various compound classes and sorbents logk 0 301 0 668 log k d r 2 0 95 brusseau and rao 1989 deviations from the lfer occur for hocs with complex functional groups or compounds with charged moieties pesticides triazines exhibit an approximately parallel lfer logk 0 55 0 57 log k d r 2 0 89 with lower k values e g greater mass transfer limitations despite their neutral charge brusseau and rao 1991 and polar anionic compounds also can be described with another approximately parallel albeit less statistically robust lfer logk 1 789 0 62 log k d r 2 0 4 with yet lower k values brusseau and rao 1989 decreasing k values in these compound classes are potentially caused by increased hindrance of diffusion associated with more complex functional groups and or specific interactions hoc sorption is often considered to be dominated by van der waals forces but some neutral as well as anionic compounds may also exhibit specific interactions that increase mass transfer limitations relative to compounds that lack them brusseau and rao 1989 brusseau and rao 1991 previous work also found that hydrocarbon alkyl tail length has an impact on mass transfer of hocs in soils and polymers van amerongen 1964 brusseau et al 1991a in these studies k was inversely correlated with increasing tail length up through propylbenzene in soil and pentane in a polymer in soils alkylbenzenes with increasing tail length followed the hoc lfer through 4 5 carbon chains after which k remained constant in both soils and polymers tail length behavior was attributed to increasing hindrance to diffusion up through some critical tail length beyond which the molecule becomes asymmetrical in shape these results may also be relevant for cf3 cf2 n alkyl tails the effects of rate limited sorption can be difficult to distinguish from other causes of nonequilibrium transport flow interruption column experiments wherein flow through a column is stopped for a period of time to allow conditions to progress towards sorbate sorbent equilibrium and then resumed are useful in making a definitive determination of kinetic effects including rate limited sorption brusseau et al 1989 pennell et al 1993 taylor et al 2001 das et al 2004 fesch et al 1998 flow interruption experiments are also often conducted at high pore water velocities to experimentally exaggerate any kinetic effects when compounds are recalcitrant or where compound transformation is prevented drops in aqueous concentrations during the stop flow period can indicate physical or chemical nonequilibrium brusseau et al 1989 nonreactive conservative tracer tests are used to verify the absence of physical nonequilibrium in the column such that drops in concentration of the compound of interest should confirm rate limited sorption the objective of this work was to further the understanding of transport behavior of pfaas in groundwater by investigating advective transport in 1 d saturated column experiments specifically we conducted continuous flow column experiments at environmentally relevant pore water velocities to determine if previously measured batch equilibrium data could be used to mathematically model 1 d pfaa transport flow interruption experiments were completed at higher pore water velocities to determine if rate limited sorption influenced pfaa transport lastly kinetic parameters were estimated with a combination of linear free energy relationships lfers and mathematical modeling to evaluate factors that may lead to rate limited pfaa sorption 2 materials and methods

accusands unimin corp ottawa mn which had been previously characterized smits et al 2009 soils a and b were air dried and sieved 2 mm prior to use in columns soil c and sand were dry and able to pass through a 2 mm sieve upon receipt column aqueous phase for all experiments was artificial groundwater agw deionized water with ions typically found in groundwater table s3 utilized in previous studies guelfo and higgins 2013 mckenzie et al 2015 mckenzie et al 2016 2 2 column design all column experiments were conducted in 2 5 15 cm no 42400 2515 or 2 5 5 cm no 420400 2505 kontes glass chromatography columns kimble chase vineland nj with a fritted glass bed support in the influent end of the column shorter 5 cm columns were selected for the continuous flow column experiments to reduce the duration of these relatively longer experiments columns were packed in 1 cm increments each increment was vibrated and tamped to establish uniform column properties glass wool and 1 mm glass beads were used as additional bed support in caps at each end of the column to fill void space stabilize column packing material and establish uniform influent distribution across the bed during column operation following packing columns were saturated with co2 to remove residual air and subsequently saturated with agw in up flow mode bulk density and porosity of soils a c and sand were determined gravimetrically table 1 columns were attached to an ismatec high accuracy peristaltic pump and silicone tubing idex health and science oak harbor wa all columns were operated in up flow mode and column influent effluent samples were collected from 3 way valves installed at each end of the column pfaa losses if present that occurred to column tubing were accounted for by sampling the inlet concentrations via the 3 way valve which was situated after the tubing further specific surface areas of soils a c and sand 1 104 m2 pennell 2016 in this study are orders of magnitude higher than the glass surface area of the columns 10 2 m2 and tubing 10 3 m2 and this work illustrates that sorption to silica sand i e similar to glass beads is minimal table s9 collectively this shows that losses of pfaas to column materials will be minimal relative to pfaa interaction with sorbents prior to initiation of pfaa flow through experiments nonreactive bromide br tracer tests section s2 tables s4 and s5 were completed to determine hydrodynamic transport conditions table 1 in all columns and confirm the absence of physical nonequilibrium in flow interruption columns br tracer tests were conducted at higher pore water velocities 2 7 11 8 m day than pfaas but this had no adverse impact on the analysis because hydrodynamic properties were independent of flow rate under all study conditions in particular based on a peclet number analysis diffusive transport was negligible and models of pfaa transport discussed below were insensitive to dispersivity indicating that neither process significantly influenced transport e g advective processes dominated transport see section s2 following the completion of all column experiments br tests were repeated to ensure that column properties remained consistent throughout the duration of the experiments fig s1 2 3 pfaa column tests two types of saturated column experiments were used in this study to investigate pfaa transport section s3 continuous flow column experiments columns 1 4 table 1 were used to study pfaa transport under environmentally relevant groundwater flow conditions flow interruption experiments columns 5 7 were used to determine the impact of rate limited sorption on pfaa transport higher flows were used for these experiments to maximize the possibility of observing a measurable result under the assumption that measured rate constants would apply generally as observed in other flow interruption studies brusseau et al 1989 column influent consisted of a pfaa mixture 5 μg l of each pfaa prepared in agw during column experiments influent concentrations varied only 2 9 pfbs 13 3 pfda from the mean all column experiments were conducted using a mixture of 10 pfaas as previous work suggested that competitive effects of mixtures in soils used in this study are minimal guelfo and higgins 2013 and mixtures are more relevant to real world pfas releases mcguire et al 2014 weber et al 2017 spiked agw was injected in columns until the relative concentration c c0 was 1 for all pfaas in columns 5 7 flow was stopped when c c0 was 1 for a period of 36 h following the flow interruption period flow of spiked agw was resumed until c c0 reached 1 again all columns were flushed with agw until pfaa concentrations returned to background following injection of spiked agw table s5 consistent with previous work method of moments analysis was used to calculate mass recovery of all br table s4 and pfaa btcs table s6 mckenzie et al 2015 goltz and roberts 1987 2 4 sample preparation and analysis column influent and effluent samples were collected manually in 2 0 ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes and sample volumes were determined gravimetrically an aliquot of isopropanol was added to comprise 9 of the aqueous volume in the tube samples were vortexed and centrifuged accuspin micro 17 thermo fisher scientific at 17 000 relative centrifugal force rcf for 30 min as a precaution to remove any residual suspended solids prior to direct injection next 1350 μl was transferred to an autosampler vial with 150 μl of 70 30 containing 0 3 ng internal standard table s1 samples were analyzed directly via a mds sciex applied biosystems 3200 mds sciex ontario liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer lc ms ms using methods modified from previous studies sepulvado et al 2011 guelfo and higgins 2013 higgins et al 2005 the lc ms ms was used to monitor two transitions for each analyte quantitation was performed using analyst software ab sciex framingham ma limits of quantitation were analyte and run dependent but were approximately 2 9 ng l all values reported are corrected for recovery of internal standards section s1 which were generally greater than 60 for all samples and matrices 2 5 equilibrium pfaa sorption equilibrium sorption coefficients for soils a and b were measured in our previous work guelfo and higgins 2013 in some cases the aqueous concentrations measured in column experiments was lower than the range evaluated in sorption isotherms to obtain isotherm parameters applicable to the entire range of concentrations in this study original isotherms were extended by linearly extrapolating the isotherm from the lowest measured isotherm point to the lowest measured column concentration section s4 figs s2 s4 table s7 pfaa sorption has been described by the freundlich isotherm higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 1 c s k f c w n where cs is the concentration in soil cw is the concentration in water kf is the freundlich sorption coefficient and n is the linearity value values of n in previous work ranged from 0 7 to 1 1 guelfo and higgins 2013 indicating that nonlinearity is sometimes associated with pfaa sorption in general the lower portion of freundlich isotherms associated with higher energy sorption sites is linear schwarzenbach et al 2003 so we consider linear extrapolation of pfaa isotherm below the lowest measured point to be a reasonable assumption studies measuring pfaa sorption to soil c and sand were not available so limited 3 point sorption isotherms initial cw of 0 5 50 μg l were completed using methods outlined in previous work section s4 guelfo and higgins 2013 pfaa isotherms were fit with the freundlich isotherm to obtain kf and n values table s9 as in previous studies pfaa mass recoveries in the solid and aqueous phases as well as loss to the vial were used to complete mass balances in all batch reactors in some cases unacceptable mass balances of pfaas occurred due to over recovery in the lowest isotherm point table s9 when this occurred the low point was excluded from the isotherm resulting isotherm parameters should be considered estimates as with soils a and b the aqueous concentrations measured in the columns were in some cases lower than the range of the isotherms so linear extrapolation to the lowest measured column concentration was applied section s4 figs s2 s4 table s7 the method for this extrapolation and a detailed discussion of the extrapolation approaches considered is included in the supplementary material section s4 neither extrapolation of parameters nor elimination of the lowest isotherm point led to substantial changes in isotherm parameters applied in soil c or sand as sorption of the majority of pfaas to these solid phases was approximately linear 2 6 data analysis btcs c c0 vs time for br were modeled using the nonlinear least squares model cfitm van genuchten 1980 btcs for pfaas were fit with a numerical solution to the advection dispersion equation ade using hydrus 1d simunek et al 2013 dispersivities table s4 were determined from inverse fits of br tracer tests and utilized when modeling breakthrough of pfaas in hydrus 1 d hydrus 1 d was used in both inverse and forward modeling of pfaa transport because it was capable of simulating flow interruption experiments equilibrium sorption parameters kf and n from batch experiments were used to predict pfaa breakthrough in columns and results were compared to measured btcs all sorption parameters were from batch experiments using the same pfaa mixture employed in column studies which would account for any minor competitive effects of single vs mixed solute systems where applicable btcs were subsequently fit with a two site model that assumes sorption sites can be divided into two fractions and incorporated into the ade van genuchten and wagenet 1989 in this model cs is assumed to be a combination of solid phase concentrations on type 1 sites cs e mg kg and type 2 sites cs k mg kg for type 1 and type 2 sites respectively 2 c s e f c s f k f c w n 3 c s k 1 f c s 1 f k f c w n where f is the fraction of sorption sites assumed to be at equilibrium with the solute the sorption rate for type 1 sites is assumed to be instantaneous and can be described as follows 4 c s e t f c s t sorption onto type 2 sites is assumed to be a first order rate process 5 c s

experiments as well as br results from flow interruption data linear free energy relationships lfers from previous work brusseau and rao 1989 and kd values this and previous work guelfo and higgins 2013 were used to estimate k values as will be discussed pfaa flow interruption btcs were insufficient for use in obtaining modeled i e fitted parameters so they were used solely for verification of rate limited sorption effects and kinetic parameters were determined from lfers 3 results and discussion 3 1 trends with chain length and foc sorption parameters from batch equilibrium studies were used to model expected pfaa btcs in columns modeled btcs yielded information on the expected order of pfaa breakthrough based on compound chain length and soil foc which are two primary factors found to influence sorption in batch studies higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 although studies suggest that trends with foc are not consistent across all soil types li et al 2018 the modeled order of breakthrough was then compared to the order of breakthrough observed in column data figs s5 s8 this initial analysis focuses on trends i e order of breakthrough associated with chain length and foc in modeled vs measured data the analysis is supported by data shown in figs s5 s9 which are scaled to show only very early breakthrough times to enable observation of the trends discussed herein a direct comparison of full btcs with equilibrium models is presented in figs s5 s8 panel g section 3 2 fig 1 and figs s10 s13 3 1 1 trends with chain length equilibrium model predicted btcs exhibited chain length dependent trends only in soils a c foc 0 0017 0 045 figs s5 s7 a c and e some exceptions to chain length trends were observed in soils c and sand but these may be an artifact of using estimated isotherm parameters for these sorbents fig s8 a c and e batch sorption observations of stronger pfba sorption relative to pfpea and pfhxa guelfo and higgins 2013 were not evident when applied to modeled predictions of 1 d advective transport in measured data chain length dependent trends for compounds with cf3 cf2 n x where n 4 were most evident in soil b experimental btcs highest foc fig s6 b d and e compound elution appeared nearly simultaneous in the remaining solid phases for perfluoroalkyl carboxylates smaller than pfda and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates smaller than pfos e g fig s5 s6 and s7 b f in many cases breakthrough appeared to be a close approximation of conservative non sorbing transport e g fig s7 b as in models anomalous trends in pfba and pfpea sorption were not evident in measured column data this may be attributable to the nonlinear sorption of pfba relative to pfpea n 0 65 0 8 for pfba vs 0 84 1 01 for pfpea a compound with a high kf value and n 1 may exhibit slower transport i e greater retardation at low concentrations relative to a compound with a low kf and n 1 3 1 2 trends with foc organic carbon dependent sorption was evident in models to a degree breakthrough of a given pfaa in soils a c and sand foc 0 0 017 was predicted to occur at similar times but breakthrough was later in soil b which had the highest foc foc 0 045 for example pfna breakthrough was predicted to occur at 0 5 pore volumes in soil a fig s5c 2 4 pore volumes in soil c fig s7c 1 4 pore volumes in sand fig s8c and 5 2 pore volumes in soil b fig s6c in measured data btcs of pfna pfda and pfos exhibited foc dependent breakthrough fig s9 but smaller compounds did not show a trend with foc deviations of column behavior from modeled transport are further discussed in section 3 2 3 2 evaluation of equilibrium transport predicted equilibrium and measured btcs were compared table 2 fig 1 figs s10 s13 visually inspected for signs of nonequilibrium transport e g early breakthrough and or tailing and statistically evaluated using coefficients of determination r anderson et al 2016 tables s8 s9 and residuals between predicted and observed values fig s14 two factors were applied to screen btcs and identify those that should be further evaluated for nonequilibrium breakthrough visual inspection and btcs with r2 0 7 the latter was included to identify btcs that should be targeted for further investigation due to relatively poorer fits low r anderson et al 2016 despite a lack of visual evidence early breakthrough tailing of nonequilibrium transport table 2 summarizes these screening results see columns labeled screening observation screening observations are not a final determination of equilibrium or nonequilibrium transport for each pfaa sorbent combination our conclusion regarding each btc is also summarized in table 2 see columns labeled conclusion as discussed further below collectively screening results yield four types of btcs early breakthrough type i early breakthrough and tailing type ii late breakthrough and tailing type iii and no observable early breakthrough or tailing type iv nonequilibrium transport may be caused by several factors including nonlinear and rate limited sorption brusseau 1994 nonlinear sorption was addressed by use of freundlich sorption parameters when modeling predicted breakthrough type ii behavior is consistent with rate limited sorption brusseau 1994 and is further discussed in section 3 3 potential causes of types i iii and iv behavior are discussed in more detail below 3 2 1 types i and iv btcs types i and iv breakthrough were collectively characterized by low r2 values slight to no early breakthrough and no tailing table 2 applicability of either an equilibrium or a rate limited sorption assumption to these btcs was initially unclear inspection of residuals squared difference between predicted and measured values at each measured point examples provided in fig s14 illustrates that low r2 values in the majority of these cases were caused by a single measured point in the arrival wave that reached a relative concentration of unity earlier than expected and or a single measured point that eluted slightly faster was lower than expected indicating a slight shift that might be caused by lower than expected sorption e g fig s14 if these individual points are removed from the statistical analysis r2 values for these cases are greater than 0 9 small deviations in equilibrium sorption parameters may have contributed to these trends this point is illustrated by considering sorption of pfhpa in soil c when the variability i e standard deviation of measured soil and aqueous phase concentrations in the isotherms was considered log kf approximately equivalent to linear sorption in this case as n 0 99 range from 0 62 to 0 37 initially a log kf value of 0 48 was used to predict equilibrium pfhpa sorption to soil c resulting in an r2 value of 0 56 when compared to measured data table 2 when predictions were repeated with the minimum potential log kf of 0 62 the resulting comparison to measured data resulted in an r2 of 0 71 additionally isotherm parameters for soil c and sand were considered estimates collectively this suggests that types i and iv btcs may be due to the variability of the equilibrium isotherm parameters and potentially analytical variability and or an artifact of the estimated isotherm parameters as opposed to nonequilibrium transport table 2 3 2 2 type iii btcs for type iii behavior the cause of late breakthrough of pfda and pfos is unclear but the data suggest that sorption of these compounds was stronger than measured in equilibrium systems the fact that this occurred for only these two compounds and only in soils a and b foc 0 017 and 0 045 respectively suggests a relationship with chain length and foc unlike types i and iv variability in kf and n values measured in batch systems guelfo and higgins 2013 could not entirely account for the increased sorption observed in columns recent studies of pfas sorption to anion exchange resins used transmission electron microscopy tem images to illustrate that resins saturated with pfoa at a concentration of 1 mg l developed 30 200 nm aggregates zaggia et al 2016 the authors hypothesized aggregates represented pfoa hemimicelles formed at the resin surface a separate study also noted the potential for micelle or agglomeration to impact sorption of long chain pfaas to granular activated carbon mccleaf et al 2017 the critical micelle concentration cmc of pfoa is approximately 3540 mg l shinoda et al 1972 and hemimicelle formation is possible at 0 001 0 01 of the cmc schwarzenbach et al 2003 or a minimum of 3 5 mg l which is in the same order of magnitude as concentrations where aggregates were observed zaggia et al 2016 the cmcs for pfda and pfos in water are approximately 400 and 3151 mg l at 25 c shinoda et al 1972 bernett and zisman 1959 respectively though values are dependent on factors such as counterions and solution chemistry kissa 2001 hemimicelle formation would be possible at minimum concentrations of 0 4 mg l for pfda and 3 mg l for pfos which is 80 600 times higher than influent pfaa concentrations in this study however column experiments were conducted using pfaa mixtures 10 pfaas at 5 μg l each including pfuna which has the lowest cmc of those included in the study impacts of mixtures on pfaa hemimicelle formation are currently unknown since hemimicelle formation would likely be driven by the lower cmcs and stronger hydrophobic interactions of pfda and pfos relative to smaller pfaas this would explain why late breakthrough was only observed in pfos and pfda in soils with higher foc additional experiments would be needed to determine the underlying cause of type iii btcs 3 3 flow interruption experiments preliminary evaluation of equilibrium transport in continuous flow experiments showed potential for nonequilibrium pfaa transport flow interruption experiments were completed with soils a c and sand to further investigate if rate limited sorption led to these observations soil b flow interruption experiments were attempted but the fine grained nature of the soil led to overpressure and failure of the columns prior to initiation of pfaa tests flow interruption experiments were completed with br to ensure physical nonequilibrium resulting from diffusive mass transfer between mobile and immobile regions was not evident within the columns brusseau et al 1989 nonequilibrium was not observed in any of the flow interruption br tests fig s15 therefore any concentration drops observed in subsequent pfaa flow interruption experiments were solely attributed to rate limited sorption for a perturbation during the flow interruption period to be considered a concentration decrease the measured concentration following the stop flow period had to be lower than the lowest concentration measured after the columns reached a relative concentration c c0 of 1 decreases in pfaa concentrations during the stop flow period 36 h for high flow table 1 scenarios were observed for pfda and pfos in soil a pfna pfda pfhxs and pfos in soil c and pfda and pfos in sand fig 2 figs s16 s18 this illustrates that rate limited sorption impacts transport of these compounds during flow interruption experiments table 2 it also suggests that continuous flow type ii btcs for pfna and pfda in soil c and type iii btcs for pfda and pfos in soil a were at least partially caused by rate limited sorption though as discussed rate limited sorption does not typically result in late breakthrough i e type iii behavior see table 2 despite flow interruption experiments exhibiting rate limited sorption for pfda in sand and pfhxs and pfos in soil c and sand these were well described by equilibrium transport in the corresponding continuous flow experiments previous studies have observed rate limited sorption of organic contaminants in low organic carbon sorbents as well as pfoa and pfos in sand brusseau 2020 brusseau and reid 1991 it is possible that at the low flow rates used in the continuous flow experiments equilibrium conditions apply but kinetic impacts occurred at the higher flow rates used in the flow interruption experiments a lack of perturbation in concentrations during stop flow periods for pfaas exhibiting type i and ii behavior in continuous flow btcs further illustrates that those compounds primarily undergo equilibrium transport table 2 while flow interruption experiments confirmed rate limited sorption of some pfaas quantitative analysis of kinetic parameters associated with this process is useful for fate and transport predictions ideally changes in cw during the stop flow period can be modeled using inverse methods to parameterize f and k values associated with the process brusseau et al 1989 however in this data set the degree of scatter in the data around c c0 1 made it difficult to quantify with certainty the magnitude of the drop in concentration during flow interruption as a result kinetic parameters were not obtained from that data nevertheless flow experiments do confirm rate limited impacts on pfaa transport 3 4 factors impacting pfaa mass transfer herein we used a 2 site sorption model to understand nonequilibrium transport of pfaas due to rate limited sorption eqs 2 5 where equilibrium sorption parameters are used in conjunction with a mass transfer coefficient k and a fraction of type 1 sorption sites f to describe compound breakthrough the model does not carry implicit assumptions in the fundamental processes resulting in mass transfer limitations which could arise from multiple mechanisms pignatello and xing 1996 brusseau and rao 1989 brusseau et al 1991b determination of the specific diffusive mechanism or combination of mechanisms only becomes important when trying to quantitatively translate k values or explain certain qualitative trends brusseau et al 1991a determination of specific diffusive mechanisms leading to pfaa transport was not an objective of this study if a combination of mechanisms contributes to rate limited pfaa transport k values in the 2 site sorption model would represent overall mass transfer limitations caused by these effects as noted kinetic parameters could not be obtained from flow interruption data and an attempt was also made to use optimization techniques to obtain kinetic parameters from continuous flow experiments and compare them to lfers resulting model fits were not unique which may be due to scatter in btcs and or low overall sorption e g r 1 to further investigate the significance of rate limited pfaa transport values of k were estimated using the lfer for polar anionic compounds table s10 brusseau and rao 1989 this was done using kd values for pfhpa pfoa and pfna in soil b because they exhibited type ii btcs and pfna and pfda in soil c because rate limited sorption was confirmed in flow interruption experiments sorption of these compounds in soils b and c was approximately linear n 0 95 1 03 so kf kd this method of estimating k could not be applied to other rate limited compounds pfda and pfos in soils a and b because these compounds exhibited enhanced sorption relative to what was expected in batch systems rendering equilibrium sorption parameters invalid for describing breakthrough after k values were estimated from the lfer they were applied to continuous flow experiments and values of f were determined through model optimization table s9 in all cases the resulting kinetic parameters improved predictions of breakthrough relative to models assuming equilibrium sorption fig 3 fig s19 to test the robustness of the resulting kinetic parameters and their independence from pore water velocity resulting values of k and f were applied to predict observed flow interruption btcs prior to the stop flow period since soil b flow interruption experiments failed this was only possible for kinetic parameters for pfna and pfda in soil c results show that estimated parameters were capable of predicting pfaa breakthrough at higher pore water velocities fig s19 values of k were estimated using the lfer for polar anionic compounds brusseau and rao 1989 because neither the hoc nor pesticide lfers brusseau and rao 1991 were capable of predicting k values that fully captured observed breakthrough implicit in this lfer is some combination of either increased diffusive hindrance or specific interactions relative to the base lfer for hocs although pfaas were not included in the set of compounds used to develop this lfer diffusive hindrance due to anionic moieties may extend to pfaas this is in contrast to lfers for other properties such as pka where unique pfaa properties e g inductive effects can only be captured by use of relevant compounds in lfer development previous research has suggested that specific interactions do not play a significant role in pfaa sorption and that the process is the result of a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions higgins and luthy 2007 since electrostatic interactions e g interactions with metal oxides in clay are not likely to be rate limiting this may mean increased hindrance causes slower pfaa mass transfer relative to hocs however more work is needed to understand this fully this work also did not explore potential for k values to become constant above some critical fluorocarbon alkyl tail length as mentioned see introduction previous work implies that there may be a critical hydrocarbon chain length beyond which k values will not decrease further van amerongen 1964 brusseau et al 1991a but it is unknown if this critical point would be the same for perfluoroalkyl tails additionally this effect is likely to be most relevant to polymer models i e intrasorbent diffusion and the exact rate limited mechanisms that apply to pfaas have not been determined fitted values of f i e fraction of type 1 sorption sites in this study were found to increase with increasing chain length table s9 this is consistent with previous work that found values of f for a series of hocs were shown to increase with increasing kow used as a proxy for molecular size brusseau et al 1991c lee et al 1991 this is possibly due to an inability of larger compounds to access some of the internal organic matter sites typically attributed to rate limited behavior therefore of all sorption sites available to these compounds larger fractions are represented by external instantaneous sorption sites relative to a compound of smaller size brusseau et al 1991c it should be emphasized that values of f and k determined in this study are estimates and were developed to help draw inferences about the significance of rate limited behavior to overall pfaa transport additional work would be required to confirm their broader applicability 4 conclusions this study illustrates that breakthrough of some pfaas is not well represented by applying equilibrium sorption parameters and that rate limited sorption considerations are needed to fully capture 1 d transport of some pfaa sorbent combinations at environmentally relevant pore water velocities however relevance of this behavior at field scales needs to be validated transport at the field scale will be 3 d and subsurface conditions are likely to be heterogeneous relative to column transport these factors may be more important in determining overall field transport of pfaas as with other hocs brusseau et al 1991c nonetheless rate limited processes have been shown to be helpful at both explaining field scale behavior and simulating field scale data even in physically heterogeneous conditions brusseau 1992 before reaching the saturated zone pfaa transport will be influenced by the air water interface in the vadose zone lyu et al 2018 brusseau 2018 additionally afff impacted areas are likely to have other complicating factors at fptas afff impacts are likely due to multiple releases during repeat training exercises further afff formulations vary and multiple foam types may have been used some afff formulations include pfass other than pfaas some of which can serve as pfaa precursors that transform into pfaas over time harding marjanovic et al 2015 mejia avendaño and liu 2015 thus nonideal pfaa transport at field scales may include effects of rate limited sorption complex subsurface characteristics enhanced retardation in the vadose zone multiple releases and pfaa precursor transformation brusseau 2020 additional work is needed to understand which of these factors are significant in modeling pfaa transport at the field scale as models are further developed kinetic parameters determined in this work may serve as a tool for estimating relative contributions of rate limited sorption to pfaa transport and overall need for or lack thereof

1508,transport of ten perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas was studied with one dimensional 1 d saturated column experiments using four soil types with an organic carbon fraction foc range of 0 0 045 columns were operated under conditions relevant to aqueous film forming foam afff impacted fire protection training areas to determine the ability of equilibrium transport parameters to describe 1 d pfaa transport if rate limited sorption influences pfaa transport and if kinetic parameters can be used to evaluate factors causing rate limited sorption results of initial screening of pfaa breakthrough found that over half of the breakthrough curves deviated from equilibrium transport and merited further investigation subsequent analysis showed that in many cases these deviations could be accounted for by considering the range of applicable equilibrium kd values i e based on standard deviation applicable to the solid phase thus transport of the majority of pfaas in 3 soils with foc of 0 0 017 was not impacted by rate limited sorption further low sorption led to transport that was essentially simultaneous for the majority of pfaas in these porous media exceptions were observed for long chain pfaas and also in a fourth soil with foc of 0 045 which indicated the potential for rate limited sorption to impact transport in some scenarios subsequent flow interruption experiments isolating kinetic behavior confirmed rate limited sorption caused nonequilibrium transport linear free energy relationships lfers developed in previous work to predict the inverse relationship between mass transfer coefficients k and sorption parameters i e kd were used to estimate values of k for pfaas in this study resulting k values were 10 3 to 10 8 h 1 consistent with previously measured kinetic parameters for other polar and anionic compounds models incorporating estimated k values resulted in improved predictions of breakthrough observed in nonequilibrium scenarios r2 0 83 0 98 but k values will require further validation prior to broader application this work illustrates rate limited sorption considerations are needed to describe 1 d column saturated transport for some pfaas and solid phases at field scales subsurface heterogeneity and pfaa precursor transformation may be equally or even more important in determining saturated pfaa transport but kinetic parameters in this study may help to determine relative contributions of rate limited sorption to overall transport 1 introduction poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass have been manufactured and used in a variety of industrial and consumer products and processes since the early 1960s including fluoropolymer manufacturing nonstick coatings and a special class of firefighting foam known as aqueous film forming foam afff kissa 2001 designed for fighting fuel fires afff is often utilized by fire fighting facilities the hydrocarbon industry and the military anderson et al 2016 in may 2016 the environmental protection agency epa issued drinking water health advisories of 0 07 μg l for the sum of two pfass perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos usepa 2016a usepa 2016b such low advisories are driven by concerns regarding human health risks to the developing fetus along with potential links to cancer and toxicity in the liver and kidney usepa 2016a usepa 2016b activities such as fluoropolymer manufacturing and repeat use of afff at fire protection training areas fptas have led to comparatively high occurrence of pfass in groundwater at μg l to mg l levels moody et al 2003 schultz et al 2004 mcguire et al 2014 weber et al 2017 shin et al 2011 underscoring the need for comprehensive understanding of transport of these compounds in subsurface systems afff formulations are complex proprietary and often include solvents and both fluorinated i e pfass and hydrocarbon surfactants moody and field 1999 place and field 2012 pfass include perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas e g pfos pfoa distinguishable by a fully saturated fluorocarbon tail comprised of strong carbon fluorine bonds these bonds make pfaas chemically stable and generally resistant to processes such as hydrolysis photolysis and oxidation and they are therefore extremely persistent in the environment kissa 2001 giesy and kannan 2002 giesy and kannan 2001 park et al 2016 afff formulations have historically included some pfaas e g pfos but also a substantial portion of polyfluorinated substances that can be converted to pfaas in the environment mcguire et al 2014 houtz et al 2013 because of their persistence interactions with aquifer sediment via sorption will be fundamental in determining the fate and transport of pfaas in groundwater most previous studies have focused on equilibrium batch sorption of pfaas to sediments biosolids and mineral surfaces and under conditions specifically relevant to afff impacted fptas higgins and luthy 2006 sepulvado et al 2011 tang et al 2010 guelfo and higgins 2013 additionally recent work investigated transport of pfoa in columns packed with sand under both saturated and unsaturated conditions with the objective of understanding the impact of the air water interface and co contaminants on pfas transport using a solid phase to which there is minimal sorption lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019 that data was re examined along with data for pfos to build a multi process transport model inclusive of rate limited sorption brusseau 2020 finally column studies have examined how application of chemical oxidation remediation techniques and resulting alteration of subsurface conditions may influence transport of pfaas mckenzie et al 2015 mckenzie et al 2016 however studies understanding the applicability of batch sorption studies to advective transport of pfaas are limited under water saturated equilibrium conditions pfaa transport is expected to decrease with increasing chain length for pfaas with cf3 cf2 n x where n 4 higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 similar trends were observed in experiments that studied the leaching behavior of pfaas from soil in flow through column experiments gellrich et al 2012 stahl et al 2013 vierke et al 2014 however sorption of some shorter pfaas cf3 cf2 n x where n 4 in batch systems did not follow chain length dependent trends with perfluorobutanoate pfba exhibiting stronger sorption than perfluoropentanoate pfpea or perfluorohexanoate pfhxa guelfo and higgins 2013 similarly a field study that calculated sorption parameters i e kd based on water and sediment concentrations found chain length dependent trends in kd only for cf3 cf2 n x where n 6 labadie and chevreuil 2011 additional sorption trends include nonlinear e g freundlich sorption and increasing sorption with increasing solid phase foc higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 in equilibrium transport sorption is presumed to be instantaneous under the assumption that it occurs at much faster rates than the residence time of groundwater however it has long been recognized that sorption of organic contaminants can be rate limited leading to nonequilibrium transport wu and gschwend 1986 brusseau 1994 luthy et al 1997 various mechanisms have been proposed to explain rate limited sorption behavior typically involving interactions with organic matter such as organic matter diffusion pignatello and xing 1996 rate limited sorption behavior manifests itself in different ways depending on the scale of transport in one dimensional 1 d flow through column experiments when sorption is rate limited transport is sometimes characterized by early breakthrough and or tailing of compound breakthrough curves btcs brusseau 1992 at larger scales impacts are more uncertain but can lead to plume spreading lower peak concentrations and tailing brusseau 1992 pickens et al 1981 understanding rate limited sorption can have important implications for modeling plume behavior and evaluating remedial options rate limited sorption due to mass transfer limitations can be impacted by various compound properties for many classes of neutral nonpolar hydrophobic organic compounds hocs the primary compound factors controlling mass transfer coefficients k see section 2 6 are sorbate size and hydrophobicity as evidenced by a single lfer that can describe an inverse relationship between log k and log kd across various compound classes and sorbents logk 0 301 0 668 log k d r 2 0 95 brusseau and rao 1989 deviations from the lfer occur for hocs with complex functional groups or compounds with charged moieties pesticides triazines exhibit an approximately parallel lfer logk 0 55 0 57 log k d r 2 0 89 with lower k values e g greater mass transfer limitations despite their neutral charge brusseau and rao 1991 and polar anionic compounds also can be described with another approximately parallel albeit less statistically robust lfer logk 1 789 0 62 log k d r 2 0 4 with yet lower k values brusseau and rao 1989 decreasing k values in these compound classes are potentially caused by increased hindrance of diffusion associated with more complex functional groups and or specific interactions hoc sorption is often considered to be dominated by van der waals forces but some neutral as well as anionic compounds may also exhibit specific interactions that increase mass transfer limitations relative to compounds that lack them brusseau and rao 1989 brusseau and rao 1991 previous work also found that hydrocarbon alkyl tail length has an impact on mass transfer of hocs in soils and polymers van amerongen 1964 brusseau et al 1991a in these studies k was inversely correlated with increasing tail length up through propylbenzene in soil and pentane in a polymer in soils alkylbenzenes with increasing tail length followed the hoc lfer through 4 5 carbon chains after which k remained constant in both soils and polymers tail length behavior was attributed to increasing hindrance to diffusion up through some critical tail length beyond which the molecule becomes asymmetrical in shape these results may also be relevant for cf3 cf2 n alkyl tails the effects of rate limited sorption can be difficult to distinguish from other causes of nonequilibrium transport flow interruption column experiments wherein flow through a column is stopped for a period of time to allow conditions to progress towards sorbate sorbent equilibrium and then resumed are useful in making a definitive determination of kinetic effects including rate limited sorption brusseau et al 1989 pennell et al 1993 taylor et al 2001 das et al 2004 fesch et al 1998 flow interruption experiments are also often conducted at high pore water velocities to experimentally exaggerate any kinetic effects when compounds are recalcitrant or where compound transformation is prevented drops in aqueous concentrations during the stop flow period can indicate physical or chemical nonequilibrium brusseau et al 1989 nonreactive conservative tracer tests are used to verify the absence of physical nonequilibrium in the column such that drops in concentration of the compound of interest should confirm rate limited sorption the objective of this work was to further the understanding of transport behavior of pfaas in groundwater by investigating advective transport in 1 d saturated column experiments specifically we conducted continuous flow column experiments at environmentally relevant pore water velocities to determine if previously measured batch equilibrium data could be used to mathematically model 1 d pfaa transport flow interruption experiments were completed at higher pore water velocities to determine if rate limited sorption influenced pfaa transport lastly kinetic parameters were estimated with a combination of linear free energy relationships lfers and mathematical modeling to evaluate factors that may lead to rate limited pfaa sorption 2 materials and methods

perfluorohexanesulfonate pfhxs and pfos as well as stable isotope internal standards table s1 were purchased from wellington laboratories guelph ontario canada spiking solutions for all experiments were prepared from standards of pfaas purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo stock solutions of calibration standards spiking solutions purity corrected and internal standards were prepared in a 70 30 v v methanol aqueous solution all experiments utilized a spiking solution containing all 10 pfaas potassium bromide was used as a nonreactive tracer unless otherwise specified all other chemicals

variety of geochemical and physical characteristics table s2 loamy sand a foc 0 017 and loam b foc 0 045 were purchased from agvise laboratories northwood nd and have been used by the authors in a

accusands unimin corp ottawa mn which had been previously characterized smits et al 2009 soils a and b were air dried and sieved 2 mm prior to use in columns soil c and sand were dry and able to pass through a 2 mm sieve upon receipt column aqueous phase for all experiments was artificial groundwater agw deionized water with ions typically found in groundwater table s3 utilized in previous studies guelfo and higgins 2013 mckenzie et al 2015 mckenzie et al 2016 2 2 column design all column experiments were conducted in 2 5 15 cm no 42400 2515 or 2 5 5 cm no 420400 2505 kontes glass chromatography columns kimble chase vineland nj with a fritted glass bed support in the influent end of the column shorter 5 cm columns were selected for the continuous flow column experiments to reduce the duration of these relatively longer experiments columns were packed in 1 cm increments each increment was vibrated and tamped to establish uniform column properties glass wool and 1 mm glass beads were used as additional bed support in caps at each end of the column to fill void space stabilize column packing material and establish uniform influent distribution across the bed during column operation following packing columns were saturated with co2 to remove residual air and subsequently saturated with agw in up flow mode bulk density and porosity of soils a c and sand were determined gravimetrically table 1 columns were attached to an ismatec high accuracy peristaltic pump and silicone tubing idex health and science oak harbor wa all columns were operated in up flow mode and column influent effluent samples were collected from 3 way valves installed at each end of the column pfaa losses if present that occurred to column tubing were accounted for by sampling the inlet concentrations via the 3 way valve which was situated after the tubing further specific surface areas of soils a c and sand 1 104 m2 pennell 2016 in this study are orders of magnitude higher than the glass surface area of the columns 10 2 m2 and tubing 10 3 m2 and this work illustrates that sorption to silica sand i e similar to glass beads is minimal table s9 collectively this shows that losses of pfaas to column materials will be minimal relative to pfaa interaction with sorbents prior to initiation of pfaa flow through experiments nonreactive bromide br tracer tests section s2 tables s4 and s5 were completed to determine hydrodynamic transport conditions table 1 in all columns and confirm the absence of physical nonequilibrium in flow interruption columns br tracer tests were conducted at higher pore water velocities 2 7 11 8 m day than pfaas but this had no adverse impact on the analysis because hydrodynamic properties were independent of flow rate under all study conditions in particular based on a peclet number analysis diffusive transport was negligible and models of pfaa transport discussed below were insensitive to dispersivity indicating that neither process significantly influenced transport e g advective processes dominated transport see section s2 following the completion of all column experiments br tests were repeated to ensure that column properties remained consistent throughout the duration of the experiments fig s1 2 3 pfaa column tests two types of saturated column experiments were used in this study to investigate pfaa transport section s3 continuous flow column experiments columns 1 4 table 1 were used to study pfaa transport under environmentally relevant groundwater flow conditions flow interruption experiments columns 5 7 were used to determine the impact of rate limited sorption on pfaa transport higher flows were used for these experiments to maximize the possibility of observing a measurable result under the assumption that measured rate constants would apply generally as observed in other flow interruption studies brusseau et al 1989 column influent consisted of a pfaa mixture 5 μg l of each pfaa prepared in agw during column experiments influent concentrations varied only 2 9 pfbs 13 3 pfda from the mean all column experiments were conducted using a mixture of 10 pfaas as previous work suggested that competitive effects of mixtures in soils used in this study are minimal guelfo and higgins 2013 and mixtures are more relevant to real world pfas releases mcguire et al 2014 weber et al 2017 spiked agw was injected in columns until the relative concentration c c0 was 1 for all pfaas in columns 5 7 flow was stopped when c c0 was 1 for a period of 36 h following the flow interruption period flow of spiked agw was resumed until c c0 reached 1 again all columns were flushed with agw until pfaa concentrations returned to background following injection of spiked agw table s5 consistent with previous work method of moments analysis was used to calculate mass recovery of all br table s4 and pfaa btcs table s6 mckenzie et al 2015 goltz and roberts 1987 2 4 sample preparation and analysis column influent and effluent samples were collected manually in 2 0 ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes and sample volumes were determined gravimetrically an aliquot of isopropanol was added to comprise 9 of the aqueous volume in the tube samples were vortexed and centrifuged accuspin micro 17 thermo fisher scientific at 17 000 relative centrifugal force rcf for 30 min as a precaution to remove any residual suspended solids prior to direct injection next 1350 μl was transferred to an autosampler vial with 150 μl of 70 30 containing 0 3 ng internal standard table s1 samples were analyzed directly via a mds sciex applied biosystems 3200 mds sciex ontario liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer lc ms ms using methods modified from previous studies sepulvado et al 2011 guelfo and higgins 2013 higgins et al 2005 the lc ms ms was used to monitor two transitions for each analyte quantitation was performed using analyst software ab sciex framingham ma limits of quantitation were analyte and run dependent but were approximately 2 9 ng l all values reported are corrected for recovery of internal standards section s1 which were generally greater than 60 for all samples and matrices 2 5 equilibrium pfaa sorption equilibrium sorption coefficients for soils a and b were measured in our previous work guelfo and higgins 2013 in some cases the aqueous concentrations measured in column experiments was lower than the range evaluated in sorption isotherms to obtain isotherm parameters applicable to the entire range of concentrations in this study original isotherms were extended by linearly extrapolating the isotherm from the lowest measured isotherm point to the lowest measured column concentration section s4 figs s2 s4 table s7 pfaa sorption has been described by the freundlich isotherm higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 1 c s k f c w n where cs is the concentration in soil cw is the concentration in water kf is the freundlich sorption coefficient and n is the linearity value values of n in previous work ranged from 0 7 to 1 1 guelfo and higgins 2013 indicating that nonlinearity is sometimes associated with pfaa sorption in general the lower portion of freundlich isotherms associated with higher energy sorption sites is linear schwarzenbach et al 2003 so we consider linear extrapolation of pfaa isotherm below the lowest measured point to be a reasonable assumption studies measuring pfaa sorption to soil c and sand were not available so limited 3 point sorption isotherms initial cw of 0 5 50 μg l were completed using methods outlined in previous work section s4 guelfo and higgins 2013 pfaa isotherms were fit with the freundlich isotherm to obtain kf and n values table s9 as in previous studies pfaa mass recoveries in the solid and aqueous phases as well as loss to the vial were used to complete mass balances in all batch reactors in some cases unacceptable mass balances of pfaas occurred due to over recovery in the lowest isotherm point table s9 when this occurred the low point was excluded from the isotherm resulting isotherm parameters should be considered estimates as with soils a and b the aqueous concentrations measured in the columns were in some cases lower than the range of the isotherms so linear extrapolation to the lowest measured column concentration was applied section s4 figs s2 s4 table s7 the method for this extrapolation and a detailed discussion of the extrapolation approaches considered is included in the supplementary material section s4 neither extrapolation of parameters nor elimination of the lowest isotherm point led to substantial changes in isotherm parameters applied in soil c or sand as sorption of the majority of pfaas to these solid phases was approximately linear 2 6 data analysis btcs c c0 vs time for br were modeled using the nonlinear least squares model cfitm van genuchten 1980 btcs for pfaas were fit with a numerical solution to the advection dispersion equation ade using hydrus 1d simunek et al 2013 dispersivities table s4 were determined from inverse fits of br tracer tests and utilized when modeling breakthrough of pfaas in hydrus 1 d hydrus 1 d was used in both inverse and forward modeling of pfaa transport because it was capable of simulating flow interruption experiments equilibrium sorption parameters kf and n from batch experiments were used to predict pfaa breakthrough in columns and results were compared to measured btcs all sorption parameters were from batch experiments using the same pfaa mixture employed in column studies which would account for any minor competitive effects of single vs mixed solute systems where applicable btcs were subsequently fit with a two site model that assumes sorption sites can be divided into two fractions and incorporated into the ade van genuchten and wagenet 1989 in this model cs is assumed to be a combination of solid phase concentrations on type 1 sites cs e mg kg and type 2 sites cs k mg kg for type 1 and type 2 sites respectively 2 c s e f c s f k f c w n 3 c s k 1 f c s 1 f k f c w n where f is the fraction of sorption sites assumed to be at equilibrium with the solute the sorption rate for type 1 sites is assumed to be instantaneous and can be described as follows 4 c s e t f c s t sorption onto type 2 sites is assumed to be a first order rate process 5 c s k t k 1 f k f c w n c s t k where ck s t is type 2 solid phase concentration at time t and k is the mass transfer coefficient min 1 modeling efforts focused on br and pfaa results from continuous flow experiments as well as br results from flow interruption data linear free energy relationships lfers from previous work brusseau and rao 1989 and kd values this and previous work guelfo and higgins 2013 were used to estimate k values as will be discussed pfaa flow interruption btcs were insufficient for use in obtaining modeled i e fitted parameters so they were used solely for verification of rate limited sorption effects and kinetic parameters were determined from lfers 3 results and discussion 3 1 trends with chain length and foc sorption parameters from batch equilibrium studies were used to model expected pfaa btcs in columns modeled btcs yielded information on the expected order of pfaa breakthrough based on compound chain length and soil foc which are two primary factors found to influence sorption in batch studies higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 although studies suggest that trends with foc are not consistent across all soil types li et al 2018 the modeled order of breakthrough was then compared to the order of breakthrough observed in column data figs s5 s8 this initial analysis focuses on trends i e order of breakthrough associated with chain length and foc in modeled vs measured data the analysis is supported by data shown in figs s5 s9 which are scaled to show only very early breakthrough times to enable observation of the trends discussed herein a direct comparison of full btcs with equilibrium models is presented in figs s5 s8 panel g section 3 2 fig 1 and figs s10 s13 3 1 1 trends with chain length equilibrium model predicted btcs exhibited chain length dependent trends only in soils a c foc 0 0017 0 045 figs s5 s7 a c and e some exceptions to chain length trends were observed in soils c and sand but these may be an artifact of using estimated isotherm parameters for these sorbents fig s8 a c and e batch sorption observations of stronger pfba sorption relative to pfpea and pfhxa guelfo and higgins 2013 were not evident when applied to modeled predictions of 1 d advective transport in measured data chain length dependent trends for compounds with cf3 cf2 n x where n 4 were most evident in soil b experimental btcs highest foc fig s6 b d and e compound elution appeared nearly simultaneous in the remaining solid phases for perfluoroalkyl carboxylates smaller than pfda and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates smaller than pfos e g fig s5 s6 and s7 b f in many cases breakthrough appeared to be a close approximation of conservative non sorbing transport e g fig s7 b as in models anomalous trends in pfba and pfpea sorption were not evident in measured column data this may be attributable to the nonlinear sorption of pfba relative to pfpea n 0 65 0 8 for pfba vs 0 84 1 01 for pfpea a compound with a high kf value and n 1 may exhibit slower transport i e greater retardation at low concentrations relative to a compound with a low kf and n 1 3 1 2 trends with foc organic carbon dependent sorption was evident in models to a degree breakthrough of a given pfaa in soils a c and sand foc 0 0 017 was predicted to occur at similar times but breakthrough was later in soil b which had the highest foc foc 0 045 for example pfna breakthrough was predicted to occur at 0 5 pore volumes in soil a fig s5c 2 4 pore volumes in soil c fig s7c 1 4 pore volumes in sand fig s8c and 5 2 pore volumes in soil b fig s6c in measured data btcs of pfna pfda and pfos exhibited foc dependent breakthrough fig s9 but smaller compounds did not show a trend with foc deviations of column behavior from modeled transport are further discussed in section 3 2 3 2 evaluation of equilibrium transport predicted equilibrium and measured btcs were compared table 2 fig 1 figs s10 s13 visually inspected for signs of nonequilibrium transport e g early breakthrough and or tailing and statistically evaluated using coefficients of determination r anderson et al 2016 tables s8 s9 and residuals between predicted and observed values fig s14 two factors were applied to screen btcs and identify those that should be further evaluated for nonequilibrium breakthrough visual inspection and btcs with r2 0 7 the latter was included to identify btcs that should be targeted for further investigation due to relatively poorer fits low r anderson et al 2016 despite a lack of visual evidence early breakthrough tailing of nonequilibrium transport table 2 summarizes these screening results see columns labeled screening observation screening observations are not a final determination of equilibrium or nonequilibrium transport for each pfaa sorbent combination our conclusion regarding each btc is also summarized in table 2 see columns labeled conclusion as discussed further below collectively screening results yield four types of btcs early breakthrough type i early breakthrough and tailing type ii late breakthrough and tailing type iii and no observable early breakthrough or tailing type iv nonequilibrium transport may be caused by several factors including nonlinear and rate limited sorption brusseau 1994 nonlinear sorption was addressed by use of freundlich sorption parameters when modeling predicted breakthrough type ii behavior is consistent with rate limited sorption brusseau 1994 and is further discussed in section 3 3 potential causes of types i iii and iv behavior are discussed in more detail below 3 2 1 types i and iv btcs types i and iv breakthrough were collectively characterized by low r2 values slight to no early breakthrough and no tailing table 2 applicability of either an equilibrium or a rate limited sorption assumption to these btcs was initially unclear inspection of residuals squared difference between predicted and measured values at each measured point examples provided in fig s14 illustrates that low r2 values in the majority of these cases were caused by a single measured point in the arrival wave that reached a relative concentration of unity earlier than expected and or a single measured point that eluted slightly faster was lower than expected indicating a slight shift that might be caused by lower than expected sorption e g fig s14 if these individual points are removed from the statistical analysis r2 values for these cases are greater than 0 9 small deviations in equilibrium sorption parameters may have contributed to these trends this point is illustrated by considering sorption of pfhpa in soil c when the variability i e standard deviation of measured soil and aqueous phase concentrations in the isotherms was considered log kf approximately equivalent to linear sorption in this case as n 0 99 range from 0 62 to 0 37 initially a log kf value of 0 48 was used to predict equilibrium pfhpa sorption to soil c resulting in an r2 value of 0 56 when compared to measured data table 2 when predictions were repeated with the minimum potential log kf of 0 62 the resulting comparison to measured data resulted in an r2 of 0 71 additionally isotherm parameters for soil c and sand were considered estimates collectively this suggests that types i and iv btcs may be due to the variability of the equilibrium isotherm parameters and potentially analytical variability and or an artifact of the estimated isotherm parameters as opposed to nonequilibrium transport table 2 3 2 2 type iii btcs for type iii behavior the cause of late breakthrough of pfda and pfos is unclear but the data suggest that sorption of these compounds was stronger than measured in equilibrium systems the fact that this occurred for only these two compounds and only in soils a and b foc 0 017 and 0 045 respectively suggests a relationship with chain length and foc unlike types i and iv variability in kf and n values measured in batch systems guelfo and higgins 2013 could not entirely account for the increased sorption observed in columns recent studies of pfas sorption to anion exchange resins used transmission electron microscopy tem images to illustrate that resins saturated with pfoa at a concentration of 1 mg l developed 30 200 nm aggregates zaggia et al 2016 the authors hypothesized aggregates represented pfoa hemimicelles formed at the resin surface a separate study also noted the potential for micelle or agglomeration to impact sorption of long chain pfaas to granular activated carbon mccleaf et al 2017 the critical micelle concentration cmc of pfoa is approximately 3540 mg l shinoda et al 1972 and hemimicelle formation is possible at 0 001 0 01 of the cmc schwarzenbach et al 2003 or a minimum of 3 5 mg l which is in the same order of magnitude as concentrations where aggregates were observed zaggia et al 2016 the cmcs for pfda and pfos in water are approximately 400 and 3151 mg l at 25 c shinoda et al 1972 bernett and zisman 1959 respectively though values are dependent on factors such as counterions and solution chemistry kissa 2001 hemimicelle formation would be possible at minimum concentrations of 0 4 mg l for pfda and 3 mg l for pfos which is 80 600 times higher than influent pfaa concentrations in this study however column experiments were conducted using pfaa mixtures 10 pfaas at 5 μg l each including pfuna which has the lowest cmc of those included in the study impacts of mixtures on pfaa hemimicelle formation are currently unknown since hemimicelle formation would likely be driven by the lower cmcs and stronger hydrophobic interactions of pfda and pfos relative to smaller pfaas this would explain why late breakthrough was only observed in pfos and pfda in soils with higher foc additional experiments would be needed to determine the underlying cause of type iii btcs 3 3 flow interruption experiments preliminary evaluation of equilibrium transport in continuous flow experiments showed potential for nonequilibrium pfaa transport flow interruption experiments were completed with soils a c and sand to further investigate if rate limited sorption led to these observations soil b flow interruption experiments were attempted but the fine grained nature of the soil led to overpressure and failure of the columns prior to initiation of pfaa tests flow interruption experiments were completed with br to ensure physical nonequilibrium resulting from diffusive mass transfer between mobile and immobile regions was not evident within the columns brusseau et al 1989 nonequilibrium was not observed in any of the flow interruption br tests fig s15 therefore any concentration drops observed in subsequent pfaa flow interruption experiments were solely attributed to rate limited sorption for a perturbation during the flow interruption period to be considered a concentration decrease the measured concentration following the stop flow period had to be lower than the lowest concentration measured after the columns reached a relative concentration c c0 of 1 decreases in pfaa concentrations during the stop flow period 36 h for high flow table 1 scenarios were observed for pfda and pfos in soil a pfna pfda pfhxs and pfos in soil c and pfda and pfos in sand fig 2 figs s16 s18 this illustrates that rate limited sorption impacts transport of these compounds during flow interruption experiments table 2 it also suggests that continuous flow type ii btcs for pfna and pfda in soil c and type iii btcs for pfda and pfos in soil a were at least partially caused by rate limited sorption though as discussed rate limited sorption does not typically result in late breakthrough i e type iii behavior see table 2 despite flow interruption experiments exhibiting rate limited sorption for pfda in sand and pfhxs and pfos in soil c and sand these were well described by equilibrium transport in the corresponding continuous flow experiments previous studies have observed rate limited sorption of organic contaminants in low organic carbon sorbents as well as pfoa and pfos in sand brusseau 2020 brusseau and reid 1991 it is possible that at the low flow rates used in the continuous flow experiments equilibrium conditions apply but kinetic impacts occurred at the higher flow rates used in the flow interruption experiments a lack of perturbation in concentrations during stop flow periods for pfaas exhibiting type i and ii behavior in continuous flow btcs further illustrates that those compounds primarily undergo equilibrium transport table 2 while flow interruption experiments confirmed rate limited sorption of some pfaas quantitative analysis of kinetic parameters associated with this process is useful for fate and transport predictions ideally changes in cw during the stop flow period can be modeled using inverse methods to parameterize f and k values associated with the process brusseau et al 1989 however in this data set the degree of scatter in the data around c c0 1 made it difficult to quantify with certainty the magnitude of the drop in concentration during flow interruption as a result kinetic parameters were not obtained from that data nevertheless flow experiments do confirm rate limited impacts on pfaa transport 3 4 factors impacting pfaa mass transfer herein we used a 2 site sorption model to understand nonequilibrium transport of pfaas due to rate limited sorption eqs 2 5 where equilibrium sorption parameters are used in conjunction with a mass transfer coefficient k and a fraction of type 1 sorption sites f to describe compound breakthrough the model does not carry implicit assumptions in the fundamental processes resulting in mass transfer limitations which could arise from multiple mechanisms pignatello and xing 1996 brusseau and rao 1989 brusseau et al 1991b determination of the specific diffusive mechanism or combination of mechanisms only becomes important when trying to quantitatively translate k values or explain certain qualitative trends brusseau et al 1991a determination of specific diffusive mechanisms leading to pfaa transport was not an objective of this study if a combination of mechanisms contributes to rate limited pfaa transport k values in the 2 site sorption model would represent overall mass transfer limitations caused by these effects as noted kinetic parameters could not be obtained from flow interruption data and an attempt was also made to use optimization techniques to obtain kinetic parameters from continuous flow experiments and compare them to lfers resulting model fits were not unique which may be due to scatter in btcs and or low overall sorption e g r 1 to further investigate the significance of rate limited pfaa transport values of k were estimated using the lfer for polar anionic compounds table s10 brusseau and rao 1989 this was done using kd values for pfhpa pfoa and pfna in soil b because they exhibited type ii btcs and pfna and pfda in soil c because rate limited sorption was confirmed in flow interruption experiments sorption of these compounds in soils b and c was approximately linear n 0 95 1 03 so kf kd this method of estimating k could not be applied to other rate limited compounds pfda and pfos in soils a and b because these compounds exhibited enhanced sorption relative to what was expected in batch systems rendering equilibrium sorption parameters invalid for describing breakthrough after k values were estimated from the lfer they were applied to continuous flow experiments and values of f were determined through model optimization table s9 in all cases the resulting kinetic parameters improved predictions of breakthrough relative to models assuming equilibrium sorption fig 3 fig s19 to test the robustness of the resulting kinetic parameters and their independence from pore water velocity resulting values of k and f were applied to predict observed flow interruption btcs prior to the stop flow period since soil b flow interruption experiments failed this was only possible for kinetic parameters for pfna and pfda in soil c results show that estimated parameters were capable of predicting pfaa breakthrough at higher pore water velocities fig s19 values of k were estimated using the lfer for polar anionic compounds brusseau and rao 1989 because neither the hoc nor pesticide lfers brusseau and rao 1991 were capable of predicting k values that fully captured observed breakthrough implicit in this lfer is some combination of either increased diffusive hindrance or specific interactions relative to the base lfer for hocs although pfaas were not included in the set of compounds used to develop this lfer diffusive hindrance due to anionic moieties may extend to pfaas this is in contrast to lfers for other properties such as pka where unique pfaa properties e g inductive effects can only be captured by use of relevant compounds in lfer development previous research has suggested that specific interactions do not play a significant role in pfaa sorption and that the process is the result of a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions higgins and luthy 2007 since electrostatic interactions e g interactions with metal oxides in clay are not likely to be rate limiting this may mean increased hindrance causes slower pfaa mass transfer relative to hocs however more work is needed to understand this fully this work also did not explore potential for k values to become constant above some critical fluorocarbon alkyl tail length as mentioned see introduction previous work implies that there may be a critical hydrocarbon chain length beyond which k values will not decrease further van amerongen 1964 brusseau et al 1991a but it is unknown if this critical point would be the same for perfluoroalkyl tails additionally this effect is likely to be most relevant to polymer models i e intrasorbent diffusion and the exact rate limited mechanisms that apply to pfaas have not been determined fitted values of f i e fraction of type 1 sorption sites in this study were found to increase with increasing chain length table s9 this is consistent with previous work that found values of f for a series of hocs were shown to increase with increasing kow used as a proxy for molecular size brusseau et al 1991c lee et al 1991 this is possibly due to an inability of larger compounds to access some of the internal organic matter sites typically attributed to rate limited behavior therefore of all sorption sites available to these compounds larger fractions are represented by external instantaneous sorption sites relative to a compound of smaller size brusseau et al 1991c it should be emphasized that values of f and k determined in this study are estimates and were developed to help draw inferences about the significance of rate limited behavior to overall pfaa transport additional work would be required to confirm their broader applicability 4 conclusions this study illustrates that breakthrough of some pfaas is not well represented by applying equilibrium sorption parameters and that rate limited sorption considerations are needed to fully capture 1 d transport of some pfaa sorbent combinations at environmentally relevant pore water velocities however relevance of this behavior at field scales needs to be validated transport at the field scale will be 3 d and subsurface conditions are likely to be heterogeneous relative to column transport these factors may be more important in determining overall field transport of pfaas as with other hocs brusseau et al 1991c nonetheless rate limited processes have been shown to be helpful at both explaining field scale behavior and simulating field scale data even in physically heterogeneous conditions brusseau 1992 before reaching the saturated zone pfaa transport will be influenced by the air water interface in the vadose zone lyu et al 2018 brusseau 2018 additionally afff impacted areas are likely to have other complicating factors at fptas afff impacts are likely due to multiple releases during repeat training exercises further afff formulations vary and multiple foam types may have been used some afff formulations include pfass other than pfaas some of which can serve as pfaa precursors that transform into pfaas over time harding marjanovic et al 2015 mejia avendaño and liu 2015 thus nonideal pfaa transport at field scales may include effects of rate limited sorption complex subsurface characteristics enhanced retardation in the vadose zone multiple releases and pfaa precursor transformation brusseau 2020 additional work is needed to understand which of these factors are significant in modeling pfaa transport at the field scale as models are further developed kinetic parameters determined in this work may serve as a tool for estimating relative contributions of rate limited sorption to pfaa transport and overall need for or lack thereof

1509,experimental results on barium transport in dolomite are used to formulate calibrate and validate a reactive transport model of produced water disposal into dolomite saline aquifers the model accounts for sorption dissolution precipitation reactions of minerals dolomite calcite barite gypsum and witherite and complexation and acid base reactions of most abundant ionic species h hco3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 and cl in produced waters including ba2 which is the most common and abundant heavy metal present in produced water from oil and gas reservoirs the model is applied to determine the chemical controls of barium transport in arbuckle dolomite aquifers the simulated scenario corresponds to produced water disposal through a class ii injection well located near an abandoned well that can facilitate the transport of barium to underground sources of drinking water usdw simulation results reveal that most suitable dolomite aquifers to prevent the contamination of usdw by barium are dolomite aquifers of high so4 2 content 1000 mg l the mobility of barium which is promoted by the formation of ba cl and competition of cations ca2 and mg2 for hydration sites of dolomite can be suppressed by the precipitation of barium as barite in dolomite saline aquifers of high so4 2 content a sensitivity analysis conducted using a two level factorial design of experiments indicates that barium transport can be controlled by the initial concentration of a single ionic specie mostly so4 2 or the concentration of various ionic species e g so4 2 cl and mg2 this depends on the chemical composition of both the dolomite saline aquifer and injection produced water this work highlights the potentiality of a reactive transport simulation approach to conduct compatibility analysis of dolomite saline aquifers and produced waters to select dolomite aquifers and or decide on treatment methods to prevent the contamination of usdw by barium keywords reactive transport sensitive analysis produced water dolomite saline aquifer barium 1 introduction recent technological advances combining horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing have led to a boom in the development of shale gas and tight sand reservoirs arthur et al 2009 engle et al 2014 hydraulic fracturing involves the high pressure injection of a fluid containing primarily water proppant and multiple inorganic and organic additives such as solvents gels biocides scale inhibitors friction reduces surfactants and other biodegradable organic additives ferrer and thurman 2015 stringfellow et al 2014 typically a large fraction of the injected hydraulic fracturing fluid infiltrates into the reservoir while only 10 15 of the hydraulic fracturing fluid flows back to the surface when pressure is released jiang et al 2014 produced water from hydraulically fractured reservoirs is characterized by variable concentrations of organic compounds akob et al 2015 cluff et al 2014 orem et al 2014 strong et al 2013 and high total dissolved solids tds 1 2 105 mg l which includes heavy metals whose concentrations are in many cases hundreds of times above the us drinking water standards engle and rowan 2014 haluszczak et al 2013 high concentrations of heavy metals in huge volumes of produced water from oil and gas reservoirs along with common occurrence of permeable pathways e g induced natural fractures and mechanical failures of well tubulars or cement overlying saline aquifers where produced water is commonly disposed is raising concern regarding the possibility of underground sources of drinking water usdw contamination by heavy metals reservoir rocks are typically composed of clay iron oxide silicate carbonate and sulfide minerals and organic matters shaw and weaver 1965 which bear heavy metals e g ba sr as and u the leachability of heavy metals e g ba co pb rb and sr from reservoir rocks has been studied using synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluids composed of commonly employed organic and inorganic additives marcon et al 2017 piszcz et al 2014 renock et al 2016 stuckman et al 2015 wang et al 2016 wilke et al 2015 the results of these studies suggest that high concentrations of heavy metals in produced water might originate from the leaching of fractured reservoir rocks rather than from the infiltration of basinal brine blauch et al 2009 haluszczak et al 2013 renock et al 2016 abandoned and failed wells constitute the most potential pathway for the upward migration of disposed produced water transporting heavy metals to usdw in fact improperly sealed abandoned wells have been reported to cause local usdw contamination in many states including oklahoma kharak et al 2013 numerical simulation studies have been conducted to predict the migration of shale gas brines if a connecting pathway faults and deteriorated wells exists between shale gas reservoirs and a shallow aquifers birdsell et al 2015 reagan et al 2015 although these simulation studies have accounted for important aspects of brine migration such as capillary trapping and buoyant flow due to the mixing of waters of different salinity density they have not accounted for the transport of dissolved compounds one of the major shortcomings in performing simulation studies accounting for the transport of dissolved compounds such as heavy metals is the lack of knowledge regarding the factors that control the mobility and transport of heavy metals in deep saline aquifers where produced water is commonly disposed among the many heavy metals commonly found in produced water e g ba sr as and u the focus of this work is on barium barium is the most common and abundant heavy metal found in produced water from oil and gas reservoirs rozell and reaven 2012 the maximum concentration level mcl set by u s environmental protection agency ape for drinking water is 2 0 mg l ba2 can cause an increase in blood pressure gastrointestinal problems muscle weakness and effects the nervous and circulatory system oskarsson 2015 in previous studies on the disposal of produced water into deep saline aquifers we elucidated the chemical and physicochemical factors salinity competition of cations ph temperature and mineral composition that control the mobility and transport of barium in porous and fractured dolomite and sandstone aquifers the experimental approach consisted of batch sorption and core flooding experiments were conducted using dolomite and sandstones collected from dolomite and sandstone geological formations where produced water is commonly disposed in the u s we found that at typical concentrations of cl ca2 and mg2 in produced water barium sorption in dolomite and sandstones is inhibited by the formation of chloride complexes e g ba cl and competition of cations ca2 and mg2 for hydration sites the inhibition of barium sorption by both mechanisms is greater in dolomite than in sandstones this was reflected by a larger decrease in the breakthrough times of barium through dolomite than through sandstones we also found that the presence of organic hydraulic fracturing additives such as guar gum has little influence on the sorption of barium in dolomite and sandstones and that different from most heavy metals barium sorption in dolomite and sandstones decreases with increasing temperature however the reducing effect of temperature on barium sorption is relevant only at low salinity conditions ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018a ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018b ebrahimi and vilcáez 2019 prior to these studies information on the factors that control barium transport in dolomite were constrained to sorption reactions at low salinity conditions e g ghaemi et al 2011 based on the newly gained knowledge on the chemical and physicochemical factors that control the mobility and transport of barium in dolomite saline aquifers here we introduce a new reactive transport model to simulate the long term risk of usdw contamination by barium on a case by case basis the reactive transport model is developed using toughreact reactive transport program xu et al 2006 as framework toughreact accounts for important reactions such as the kinetic dissolution precipitation of minerals and aqueous phase and surface complexation reactions toughreact has been used before as framework to simulate various reactive transport processes associated with the disposal of produced water and geological storage of co2 in deep geological formations under biotic kuramochi et al 2013 vilcáez 2015a b vilcáez et al 2018 and abiotic attavitkamthorn et al 2013 shabani and vilcáez 2018 shabani and vilcáez 2017 2019 conditions the rest of the paper is structured as follows the formulation of the reactive transport model is followed by the validation and calibration of the model with batch sorption and core flooding experimental results first the model is used to determine the effect of formation water and produced water compositions as well as the effect of ph on barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers to this aim field scale simulations are conducted of five types of produced water injection into three types of arbuckle dolomite aquifers then the model is used to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine which ionic specie cl hco3 so4 2 na ca2 or mg2 affects most barium transport in arbuckle dolomite aquifers finally implications of the obtained results are discussed in the context of the long term risk of usdw contamination by barium 2 reactive transport model 2 1 aqueous and mineral phase reactions cl hco3 so4 2 na ca2 and mg2 comprises 90 of the total dissolved solids tds in produced water neff et al 2011 heavy metals present in much smaller concentrations in produced water undergo many complexation reactions with cl hco3 and so4 2 table 1 shows all acid base and complexation reactions considered to determine the transport of barium as an ionic e g ba cl bahco3 and ba2 and nonionic e g baco3 aq witherite and barite specie in dolomite aquifers in toughreact the concentrations of secondary species e g ba cl are calculated as a function of the concentration of primary species cl and ba2 according to the following thermodynamic expression 1 x i k i 1 γ i 1 j 1 n c γ j c j ν ij where cj is the concentration of j th primary specie xi is the concentration of i th secondary specie ki is the equilibrium constant γi and γj are the activity coefficient for i th and j th primary and secondary species nc is the number of primary spices involved in the reaction and νij is the stoichiometric coefficient of the reaction accounting for complexation reactions is important because at typical concentrations of cl in produced water formation of ba cl ca cl and mg cl complexes reduce the availability of ba2 ca2 and mg2 to form surface complexes with hydration sites of dolomite the formulated aqueous phase reaction model does not include oxidation reduction reactions and complexation reactions involving dissolved organic matter barium as most alkaline earth metals does not undergo redox reactions under natural conditions and our experimental results showed that complexation reactions between organic polymers e g guar gum and barium play a secondary role to complexation reactions between cl and ba2 ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018a ion exchange reactions are neither included because they are relevant only at trace concentrations of heavy metals however the formulated aqueous phase reaction model does account for the possibility of ba ca and mg bearing minerals precipitation dissolution table 2 shows included precipitation dissolution reactions of ba ca and mg bearing minerals except for dolomite all other minerals reaction are equilibrium reactions meaning that whether barium dissolves or precipitates depends on the saturation index ω of the reaction 2 ω iap k where iap is the ion activity product and k the reaction equilibrium constant table 2 the rate of dolomite dissolution precipitation rdol min is represented by the kinetic model formulated by applying the transition state theory tst 3 r dol min a h 0 5 k 1 ω where a is the surface area of the mineral and k is the kinetic coefficient of the reaction 2 2 surface complexation sorption reactions barium sorption in dolomite does not only depend on the concentration of ba2 but also on the ph of the aqueous phase and competition of cations for hydration sites of dolomite ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018b this dependency can be expressed by the surface complexation model scm proposed by van cappellen et al 1993 according to this model there are three primary hydration sites caoho mgoho and co3ho on dolomite surface which can form complexes with ca2 mg2 and h surface complexation sorption reactions of these ions along with the corresponding intrinsic stability constants kint s are shown in table 3 to be able to account for surface complexation reaction of ba2 kint s for ba2 has been estimated by fitting batch sorption experimental and simulated results it is noteworthy that reaction 5 and 6 in table 3 were originally written in terms of co3 2 for compatibility with toughreact this equation is rewritten in terms of hco3 and kint s was recalculated using the k value of reaction co3 2 h hco3 table 1 briefly the intrinsically stability constant of ba2 ca2 and mg2 is given by 4 k int s c o 3 ms h c o 3 h 0 ms 2 where denotes the activity of ba2 ca2 and mg2 at the mineral solution interface pokrovsky et al 2000 however because the activities of ba2 ca2 and mg2 at the mineral solution interface are impractical to measure

calculated according to eq 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification and calibration of the model before conducting field scale simulations of barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers injected with produced water the formulated reactive transport model implemented using toughreact is calibrated and verified with batch and core flooding experimental results specifically batch sorption experimental results are used to estimate the intrinsic stability constant kint s of barium sorption in dolomite and core flooding experimental results are used to verify the prediction capabilities of the reactive transport model table 4 summarizes all known and collected parameters from literature that were used to estimate kint s for ba2 for consistency with the kint s values for ca2 and mg2 kint s for ba2 is estimated using sorption data obtained at zero salinity i 0 the estimated kint s for ba2 ion is 3 2 table 3 to verify that retardation effect of water rock reactions on barium transport simulations are conducted with the inclusion of an artificial tracer compound of the same initial concentration of barium toughreact allows for the inclusion of artificial tracer compounds whose physical properties and initial concentration can be made equal to that of the compound of interests barium in this work fig 1 compares measured and simulated barium sorption levels attained in a batch system at different salinity conditions the employed scm captures the inhibitory effect of cl ca2 and mg2 on ba2 sorption the subtle differences between experimental and numerical results can be attributed to experimental errors and parameters which correspond to dolomite from different origin fig 2 compares breakthrough curves of barium through a synthetic dolomite core prepared following the procedure described in ebrahimi and vilcaez 2018 for consistency the synthetic dolomite core was prepared using dolomite of the same grain size as in the batch sorption experiments fig 1 numerical and experimental breakthrough curves perfectly match indicating that the reactive transport model formulated based on the scm proposed by pokrovsky et al 2000 is suitable to simulate the reactive transport of barium in dolomite saline aqufiers fig 2 also includes simulated breakthrough curves of barium transport using the freundlich sorption isotherm model eq 10 instead of a scm eq 6 the employed barium sorption coefficient ks 0 176 l kg with eq 10 correspond to the batch sorption experiment results obtained at 180 00 mg nacl l salinity fig 1 10 k s c o 3 ba ba 2 the inability of the freundlich sorption isotherm model to predict the barium transport through the dolomite core highlights that sorption isotherm models e g eq 10 which are only function of the sorbant concentrations in the solid and aqueous phases are not suitable to simulate barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers barium sorption in dolomite saline aquifers needs to be represented by a scm function of the concentration of ba2 competing cations ca2 and mg2 for hydration sites and ph e g eq 6 moreover accounting for the effect of competing of cations and ph is imperative given the relatively high reactivity of dolomite table 2 3 2 field scale application of the model few usdw contamination incidents have been associated with the accidental spill of produced water a riskier scenario which is examined in this work is the upward migration of produced water from a class ii injection well to failed abandoned wells 3 2 1 geological model arbuckle aquifers are composed of mostly of dolomite fritz et al 2012 therefore the 3 d geological model used for simulations is composed entirely of dolomite and 32 layers of different porosity permeability properties porosity ranges from 10 to 30 and permeability from 10 to 100 md these values correspond to arbuckle facies containing little to no vuggy porosity but intercrystalline and moldic porosities franseen et al 2004 franseen et al 2003 initial pressure distribution corresponds to a hydrostatic pressure gradient of 1 47 psi m produced water is injected at the bottom of the aquifer through a class ii injection well a hypothetical abandoned well is located at the top of the aquifer 450 m away from the injection point fig 3 the effect of temperature has been found to play a secondary role to salinity ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018b hence for consistency with the measured and estimated intrinsic equilibrium constants table 3 simulations are conducted for a constant temperature of 25 c produced water is commonly disposed into arbuckle aquifers murray 2013 walsh and zoback 2015 between 2011 and 2015 reported maximum volume of produced water disposed into arbuckle aquifers through a single class ii injection well was 68 003 574 gal per month 100 kg s fractracker alliance 2019 based on this information simulations are conducted for 50 of this injection rate 50 kg s carbonate rocks including dolomite are characterized by having a complex pore microstructure surface area relationship bust et al 2011 vilcáez et al 2017 therefore to determine the effect of surface area on barium transport simulations are conducted using reactive surface areas of 39 000 cm2 cm3 13 732 cm2 g mineral and 8500 cm2 cm3 2992 cm2 g mineral estimated for arbuckle dolomite by sem analysis smith et al 2017 for simplicity the reactive surface area used to compute dissolution precipitation reactions of minerals are assumed to be equal to the sorption surface area to be able to assess the effect of water rock reactions sorption desorption and dissolution precipitation as well as the composition of dolomite aquifers and injection produced water on barium transport simulations are conducted for the injection of five hypothetical types of produced water into three types of dolomite saline aquifers selection of the five types of produced water is done based on their different tds mostly nacl so4 2 and hardness ca2 and mg2 concentrations as well as on their different ph simulations of produced waters type i ii iii and iv injection into the three types of dolomite saline aquifers aims to analyze the effect of tds so4 2 and hardness ca2 and mg2 on barium transport whereas simulations of produced water type ii and v injection into the three dolomite aquifers aims to analyze the effect of ph on barium transport previous researches have shown that hardness of produced water decreases with increasing the concentration of sodium and vice versa guerra et al 2011 therefore for the sake of realism produced water type ii has different hardness from produced water type v but similar so4 2 content the initial composition of the three dolomite aquifers correspond to compositions reported by rall and wright 1953 for arbuckle saline aquifers table 5 to verify the retardation effect of water rock reactions on barium transport an artificial tracer compound of the same initial concentration as that of barium is included in all simulations injection of produced water takes place for 10 years 3 2 2 simulation results fig 4 shows simulated breakthrough curves of barium when produced waters type i ii iii and iv are injected into the three types of dolomite saline aquifers through a class ii injection well contrary to expectations based on previous results showing that high concentrations of nacl and hardness ca2 and mg2 promotes barium transport in dolomite ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018a the concentration fraction of barium that reaches the abandoned well cout cin decreases with increasing the concentration of nacl and hardness of the dolomite saline aquifer apparently this behavior is due to the presence of so4 2 in the dolomite saline aquifer fig 5 shows the volume fraction of barite overtime at the bottomhole of the injection and abandoned wells the formation of barite increases proportionally to the concentrations of so4 2 in the dolomite saline aquifer and barium in the injection produced water for instance the injection of produced water type i of high barium content 810 mg l into dolomite saline aquifer type i of low so4 2 content 10 mg l results in a negligible amount of barite formation at the bottomhole of the injection well fig 5a and a very small amount of barite formation at the bottomhole of the abandoned well 2 5 10 7 volume fraction fig 5b this is reflected by a fast rate of barium transport fig 4a whereas the injection of the same type of produced water into dolomite saline aquifer type iii of high so4 2 content 7600 mg l results in high amounts of barite formation at the bottomhole of the injection well 0 021 volume fraction fig 5c and a negligible amount of barite formation at the bottomhole of the abandoned well 3 3 10 4 volume fraction fig 5d this is reflected by a very slow rate of barium transport fig 4c sometimes so4 2 content of saline aquifers increases with increasing tds thus barium transport appears to increases with increasing tds of the dolomite saline aquifer guerra et al 2011 the volume fractions of witherite remained zero at all tested produced water and dolomite saline aquifers compositions hence retardation of barium transport in the three dolomite aquifers cannot be attributed to the formation of witherite likewise within the range of ca2 and so4 2 concentrations in the three types of arbuckle dolomite saline aquifers injected with all four types of produced water gypsum formation remained zero therefore gypsum formation could not affect barite precipitation these simulation results reveal that the mobility of barium which is promoted by the formation of ba cl and competition of cations ca2 and mg2 for hydration sites can be suppressed by the precipitation of barium as barite in dolomite saline aquifers of high so4 2 content for instance the injection of produced water type i into dolomite saline aquifer type i of low so4 2 10 mg l content results in practically the same cout cin for barium and the tracer compound 0 3 fig 4a whereas the injection of the same type of produced water into dolomite saline aquifer type ii of high so4 2 1720 mg l content results in cout cin for barium of 0 0002 fig 4b consequently in dolomite saline aquifers of high so4 2 content the surface area of dolomite which determines its sorption capacity appears to play a secondary role to so4 2 content of the aquifer as indicated by practically the same breakthrough curves of barium obtained using reaction surface areas of 13 732 cm2 g dolomite and 2992 cm2 g dolomite however it is noteworthy that the trend of barium transport in dolomite aquifers type ii and iii is not only controlled by the so4 2 content of the dolomite aquifer but also by the so4 2 content of the injection produced water barium transport in dolomite aquifers type ii and iii increases with increasing the so4 2 content of the injection produced water suggesting that barium transport in dolomite aquifers of high so4 2 content is also a function of the so4 2 content and ph of the injection produced water fig 6 shows simulated breakthrough curves of barium when produced water type ii of acidic ph and produced water type v of alkaline ph are injected into the three types of dolomite saline aquifers through a class ii injection well as expected based on previous results ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018b showing that the competition of h and ba2 for hydration sites on dolomite acidic ph levels high h concentration facilitated barium transport results show lower cout cin with the injection of produced water type v of ph 8 2 than with the injection of produced water type ii of ph 4 8 the injection of produced water type ii into dolomite saline aquifer type i of ph 6 0 results in cout cin for barium of 0 024 fig 6a and the injection of produced water type v into the same dolomite aquifer results in cout cin for barium of only 0 012 fig 6b faster barium transport with the injection of produced waters type ii than with the injection of produced water type v cannot be attributed to the so4 2 content of produced waters type ii and v because of their similar so4 2 content therefore apparently although the retarding effect of so4 2 can surpass the promoting effect of not only nacl and hardness the retarding effect of so4 2 decreases with decreasing the ph of the injection produced water the obtained results demonstrate the applicability of the formulated reactive transport model to determine the effect of formation water and produced water compositions as well as the effect of ph on barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers to determine the applicability of the model to determine which ion or ions affects most the transport of barium in the dolomite saline aquifer on a case by case basis a sensitivity analysis of the reactive transport model is conducted for the injection of the four types of produced waters into an arbuckle dolomite aquifer of two possible compositions arbuckle aquifers type i and ii 3 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the reactive transport model to five factors concentrations of hco3 ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 in dolomite aquifers is conducted using a two level factorial design of experiments table 6 levels correspond to the concentrations of hco3 ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 reported for arbuckle dolomite aquifers type i and ii table 5 the initial concentration of hco3 is included as a factor because of its involvement in dolomite dissolution precipitation reactions the initial concentration of ba2 in the dolomite aquifer is zero and the concentration of na is obtained by charge balance table 7 shows the full factorial design matrix and simulated responses yi obtained for each possible combination of factors simulated responses consist of barium percentage that reaches the abandoned well after 10 years of produced water injection through the class ii injection well fig 3 10 y i ba out ba in 100 where i denotes the produced water type for the injection of the of produced water types i ii iii and iv at all possible combinations of the two levels 1 and 1 of hco3 ca2 mg2 and cl with the high level 1 of so4 2 barium concentration at the abandoned well does not exceed 1 0 of barium concentration at the class ii injection well whereas at all possible combinations of the two levels of hco3 ca2 mg2 and cl with the low level 1 of so4 2 barium concentration at the abandoned well increases with decreasing the concentration of so4 2 in the injection produced water 2 0 3 1 for produced water type ii 207 mg so4 2 l 23 24 for produced water type iii 25 mg so4 2 l 22 25 for produced water type iv 9 0 mg so4 2 l and 29 31 for produced water type i 0 0 mg so4 2 l confirming that barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers is more sensitive to the concentration of so4 2 than to the concentration of hco3 ca2 mg2 and cl in the dolomite aquifer and that barium transport is function of the initial concentration of so4 2 in both the aquifer and the injection produced water to be able to compare quantitatively the sensitivity of barium transport to the five selected factors concentrations of hco3 ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 in dolomite aquifers we calculate main and interaction effects according to 11 effect y n y n where n and n refer to the number of responses at 1 and 1 levels and y and y refer to the associated responses shown in table 7 main effect in this case refers to the effect of a single factor whereas interaction effect refers to the combined effect of factors table 8 shows representative all main and interaction effects calculated for the injection of produced water type iii fig 7 compares all main and interaction effects for the injection of produced water types i ii iii and iv for the four types of produced water the concentration of so4 2 b exerts the largest effect followed by the concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 bc and the concentration of cl e in the dolomite aquifer as expected main and interaction effects of these factors b bc and e is different depending on the composition of the injection produced water note that the interaction effect of the concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 is larger than the main effect of cl and that the interaction effect of the concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 is smaller than the main effect of the concentration of so4 2 this can be explained by the relatively low concentration of so4 2 that is required to precipitate barium as barite compared to the relatively high concentration of cl required to inhibit barium sorption in dolomite as well as by the formation of caso4 which reduced the availability of so4 2 to precipitate barium as barite the main and interaction effect of the concentrations of hco3 a and mg2 d for the four types of produced water is practically null depending on the composition of the injection produced water the different main and interaction effects of the concentrations of cl hco3 ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 on barium transport obtained with four types of produced waters demonstrate the applicability the reactive transport model to determine the factor and or combination of factors that influence most the transport of barium in dolomite saline aquifers on a case by case basis this information can be used as an indicator to determine the compatibility of between dolomite aquifers and injection produced waters such that usdw contamination with barium can be prevented for instance from the conducted sensitivity analysis one can conclude that to prevent the contamination of usdw by barium produced waters should be disposed in dolomite saline

are main conclusions regarding the formulation and application of the model to determine the controls of barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers barium sorption in dolomite saline aquifers can be represented by a surface complexation model that accounts for changes of ph due to water rock dissolution precipitation reactions and competition of cations for hydration sites while cl and divalent cations ca2 and mg2 promotes barium transport by inhibiting barium sorption in dolomite so4 2 retards barium transport by precipitating barium as barite baso4 accounting for the formation of chloride complexes in the aqueous phase and precipitation of barium as barite is important to determine which reaction e g sorption or mineralization controls barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers the reaction of ba2 with so4 2 to form barite mineralization reaction constitutes the main water rock reaction that controls barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers of high so4 2 content e g 1720 mg l the mobilizing effect of salinity on barium transport is relevant only in dolomite saline aquifers of low so4 2 content e g 10 mg l the amounts of baco3 witherite precipitation was zero at all tested produced water and dolomite saline aquifer compositions therefore witherite does not significantly affect barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers the initial concentration of so4 2 ions in the dolomite saline aquifer constitutes the factor that most affects barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers however depending on the composition of the injection produced water barium transport can be greatly affected by the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and cl in the dolomite saline aquifer and injection produced water while barium mobilization effect of cl and divalent cations ca2 and mg2 is relevant at high salinity conditions barium mobilization effect of so4 2 is relevant at orders of magnitude lower concentrations than cl and divalent cations the compatibility between dolomite

1509,experimental results on barium transport in dolomite are used to formulate calibrate and validate a reactive transport model of produced water disposal into dolomite saline aquifers the model accounts for sorption dissolution precipitation reactions of minerals dolomite calcite barite gypsum and witherite and complexation and acid base reactions of most abundant ionic species h hco3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 and cl in produced waters including ba2 which is the most common and abundant heavy metal present in produced water from oil and gas reservoirs the model is applied to determine the chemical controls of barium transport in arbuckle dolomite aquifers the simulated scenario corresponds to produced water disposal through a class ii injection well located near an abandoned well that can facilitate the transport of barium to underground sources of drinking water usdw simulation results reveal that most suitable dolomite aquifers to prevent the contamination of usdw by barium are dolomite aquifers of high so4 2 content 1000 mg l the mobility of barium which is promoted by the formation of ba cl and competition of cations ca2 and mg2 for hydration sites of dolomite can be suppressed by the precipitation of barium as barite in dolomite saline aquifers of high so4 2 content a sensitivity analysis conducted using a two level factorial design of experiments indicates that barium transport can be controlled by the initial concentration of a single ionic specie mostly so4 2 or the concentration of various ionic species e g so4 2 cl and mg2 this depends on the chemical composition of both the dolomite saline aquifer and injection produced water this work highlights the potentiality of a reactive transport simulation approach to conduct compatibility analysis of dolomite saline aquifers and produced waters to select dolomite aquifers and or decide on treatment methods to prevent the contamination of usdw by barium keywords reactive transport sensitive analysis produced water dolomite saline aquifer barium 1 introduction recent technological advances combining horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing have led to a boom in the development of shale gas and tight sand reservoirs arthur et al 2009 engle et al 2014 hydraulic fracturing involves the high pressure injection of a fluid containing primarily water proppant and multiple inorganic and organic additives such as solvents gels biocides scale inhibitors friction reduces surfactants and other biodegradable organic additives ferrer and thurman 2015 stringfellow et al 2014 typically a large fraction of the injected hydraulic fracturing fluid infiltrates into the reservoir while only 10 15 of the hydraulic fracturing fluid flows back to the surface when pressure is released jiang et al 2014 produced water from hydraulically fractured reservoirs is characterized by variable concentrations of organic compounds akob et al 2015 cluff et al 2014 orem et al 2014 strong et al 2013 and high total dissolved solids tds 1 2 105 mg l which includes heavy metals whose concentrations are in many cases hundreds of times above the us drinking water standards engle and rowan 2014 haluszczak et al 2013 high concentrations of heavy metals in huge volumes of produced water from oil and gas reservoirs along with common occurrence of permeable pathways e g induced natural fractures and mechanical failures of well tubulars or cement overlying saline aquifers where produced water is commonly disposed is raising concern regarding the possibility of underground sources of drinking water usdw contamination by heavy metals reservoir rocks are typically composed of clay iron oxide silicate carbonate and sulfide minerals and organic matters shaw and weaver 1965 which bear heavy metals e g ba sr as and u the leachability of heavy metals e g ba co pb rb and sr from reservoir rocks has been studied using synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluids composed of commonly employed organic and inorganic additives marcon et al 2017 piszcz et al 2014 renock et al 2016 stuckman et al 2015 wang et al 2016 wilke et al 2015 the results of these studies suggest that high concentrations of heavy metals in produced water might originate from the leaching of fractured reservoir rocks rather than from the infiltration of basinal brine blauch et al 2009 haluszczak et al 2013 renock et al 2016 abandoned and failed wells constitute the most potential pathway for the upward migration of disposed produced water transporting heavy metals to usdw in fact improperly sealed abandoned wells have been reported to cause local usdw contamination in many states including oklahoma kharak et al 2013 numerical simulation studies have been conducted to predict the migration of shale gas brines if a connecting pathway faults and deteriorated wells exists between shale gas reservoirs and a shallow aquifers birdsell et al 2015 reagan et al 2015 although these simulation studies have accounted for important aspects of brine migration such as capillary trapping and buoyant flow due to the mixing of waters of different salinity density they have not accounted for the transport of dissolved compounds one of the major shortcomings in performing simulation studies accounting for the transport of dissolved compounds such as heavy metals is the lack of knowledge regarding the factors that control the mobility and transport of heavy metals in deep saline aquifers where produced water is commonly disposed among the many heavy metals commonly found in produced water e g ba sr as and u the focus of this work is on barium barium is the most common and abundant heavy metal found in produced water from oil and gas reservoirs rozell and reaven 2012 the maximum concentration level mcl set by u s environmental protection agency ape for drinking water is 2 0 mg l ba2 can cause an increase in blood pressure gastrointestinal problems muscle weakness and effects the nervous and circulatory system oskarsson 2015 in previous studies on the disposal of produced water into deep saline aquifers we elucidated the chemical and physicochemical factors salinity competition of cations ph temperature and mineral composition that control the mobility and transport of barium in porous and fractured dolomite and sandstone aquifers the experimental approach consisted of batch sorption and core flooding experiments were conducted using dolomite and sandstones collected from dolomite and sandstone geological formations where produced water is commonly disposed in the u s we found that at typical concentrations of cl ca2 and mg2 in produced water barium sorption in dolomite and sandstones is inhibited by the formation of chloride complexes e g ba cl and competition of cations ca2 and mg2 for hydration sites the inhibition of barium sorption by both mechanisms is greater in dolomite than in sandstones this was reflected by a larger decrease in the breakthrough times of barium through dolomite than through sandstones we also found that the presence of organic hydraulic fracturing additives such as guar gum has little influence on the sorption of barium in dolomite and sandstones and that different from most heavy metals barium sorption in dolomite and sandstones decreases with increasing temperature however the reducing effect of temperature on barium sorption is relevant only at low salinity conditions ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018a ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018b ebrahimi and vilcáez 2019 prior to these studies information on the factors that control barium transport in dolomite were constrained to sorption reactions at low salinity conditions e g ghaemi et al 2011 based on the newly gained knowledge on the chemical and physicochemical factors that control the mobility and transport of barium in dolomite saline aquifers here we introduce a new reactive transport model to simulate the long term risk of usdw contamination by barium on a case by case basis the reactive transport model is developed using toughreact reactive transport program xu et al 2006 as framework toughreact accounts for important reactions such as the kinetic dissolution precipitation of minerals and aqueous phase and surface complexation reactions toughreact has been used before as framework to simulate various reactive transport processes associated with the disposal of produced water and geological storage of co2 in deep geological formations under biotic kuramochi et al 2013 vilcáez 2015a b vilcáez et al 2018 and abiotic attavitkamthorn et al 2013 shabani and vilcáez 2018 shabani and vilcáez 2017 2019 conditions the rest of the paper is structured as follows the formulation of the reactive transport model is followed by the validation and calibration of the model with batch sorption and core flooding experimental results first the model is used to determine the effect of formation water and produced water compositions as well as the effect of ph on barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers to this aim field scale simulations are conducted of five types of produced water injection into three types of arbuckle dolomite aquifers then the model is used to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine which ionic specie cl hco3 so4 2 na ca2 or mg2 affects most barium transport in arbuckle dolomite aquifers finally implications of the obtained results are discussed in the context of the long term risk of usdw contamination by barium 2 reactive transport model 2 1 aqueous and mineral phase reactions cl hco3 so4 2 na ca2 and mg2 comprises 90 of the total dissolved solids tds in produced water neff et al 2011 heavy metals present in much smaller concentrations in produced water undergo many complexation reactions with cl hco3 and so4 2 table 1 shows all acid base and complexation reactions considered to determine the transport of barium as an ionic e g ba cl bahco3 and ba2 and nonionic e g baco3 aq witherite and barite specie in dolomite aquifers in toughreact the concentrations of secondary species e g ba cl are calculated as a function of the concentration of primary species cl and ba2 according to the following thermodynamic expression 1 x i k i 1 γ i 1 j 1 n c γ j c j ν ij where cj is the concentration of j th primary specie xi is the concentration of i th secondary specie ki is the equilibrium constant γi and γj are the activity coefficient for i th and j th primary and secondary species nc is the number of primary spices involved in the reaction and νij is the stoichiometric coefficient of the reaction accounting for complexation reactions is important because at typical concentrations of cl in produced water formation of ba cl ca cl and mg cl complexes reduce the availability of ba2 ca2 and mg2 to form surface complexes with hydration sites of dolomite the formulated aqueous phase reaction model does not include oxidation reduction reactions and complexation reactions involving dissolved organic matter barium as most alkaline earth metals does not undergo redox reactions under natural conditions and our experimental results showed that complexation reactions between organic polymers e g guar gum and barium play a secondary role to complexation reactions between cl and ba2 ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018a ion exchange reactions are neither included because they are relevant only at trace concentrations of heavy metals however the formulated aqueous phase reaction model does account for the possibility of ba ca and mg bearing minerals precipitation dissolution table 2 shows included precipitation dissolution reactions of ba ca and mg bearing minerals except for dolomite all other minerals reaction are equilibrium reactions meaning that whether barium dissolves or precipitates depends on the saturation index ω of the reaction 2 ω iap k where iap is the ion activity product and k the reaction equilibrium constant table 2 the rate of dolomite dissolution precipitation rdol min is represented by the kinetic model formulated by applying the transition state theory tst 3 r dol min a h 0 5 k 1 ω where a is the surface area of the mineral and k is the kinetic coefficient of the reaction 2 2 surface complexation sorption reactions barium sorption in dolomite does not only depend on the concentration of ba2 but also on the ph of the aqueous phase and competition of cations for hydration sites of dolomite ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018b this dependency can be expressed by the surface complexation model scm proposed by van cappellen et al 1993 according to this model there are three primary hydration sites caoho mgoho and co3ho on dolomite surface which can form complexes with ca2 mg2 and h surface complexation sorption reactions of these ions along with the corresponding intrinsic stability constants kint s are shown in table 3 to be able to account for surface complexation reaction of ba2 kint s for ba2 has been estimated by fitting batch sorption experimental and simulated results it is noteworthy that reaction 5 and 6 in table 3 were originally written in terms of co3 2 for compatibility with toughreact this equation is rewritten in terms of hco3 and kint s was recalculated using the k value of reaction co3 2 h hco3 table 1 briefly the intrinsically stability constant of ba2 ca2 and mg2 is given by 4 k int s c o 3 ms h c o 3 h 0 ms 2 where denotes the activity of ba2 ca2 and mg2 at the mineral solution interface pokrovsky et al 2000 however because the activities of ba2 ca2 and mg2 at the mineral solution interface are impractical to measure

calculated according to eq 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification and calibration of the model before conducting field scale simulations of barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers injected with produced water the formulated reactive transport model implemented using toughreact is calibrated and verified with batch and core flooding experimental results specifically batch sorption experimental results are used to estimate the intrinsic stability constant kint s of barium sorption in dolomite and core flooding experimental results are used to verify the prediction capabilities of the reactive transport model table 4 summarizes all known and collected parameters from literature that were used to estimate kint s for ba2 for consistency with the kint s values for ca2 and mg2 kint s for ba2 is estimated using sorption data obtained at zero salinity i 0 the estimated kint s for ba2 ion is 3 2 table 3 to verify that retardation effect of water rock reactions on barium transport simulations are conducted with the inclusion of an artificial tracer compound of the same initial concentration of barium toughreact allows for the inclusion of artificial tracer compounds whose physical properties and initial concentration can be made equal to that of the compound of interests barium in this work fig 1 compares measured and simulated barium sorption levels attained in a batch system at different salinity conditions the employed scm captures the inhibitory effect of cl ca2 and mg2 on ba2 sorption the subtle differences between experimental and numerical results can be attributed to experimental errors and parameters which correspond to dolomite from different origin fig 2 compares breakthrough curves of barium through a synthetic dolomite core prepared following the procedure described in ebrahimi and vilcaez 2018 for consistency the synthetic dolomite core was prepared using dolomite of the same grain size as in the batch sorption experiments fig 1 numerical and experimental breakthrough curves perfectly match indicating that the reactive transport model formulated based on the scm proposed by pokrovsky et al 2000 is suitable to simulate the reactive transport of barium in dolomite saline aqufiers fig 2 also includes simulated breakthrough curves of barium transport using the freundlich sorption isotherm model eq 10 instead of a scm eq 6 the employed barium sorption coefficient ks 0 176 l kg with eq 10 correspond to the batch sorption experiment results obtained at 180 00 mg nacl l salinity fig 1 10 k s c o 3 ba ba 2 the inability of the freundlich sorption isotherm model to predict the barium transport through the dolomite core highlights that sorption isotherm models e g eq 10 which are only function of the sorbant concentrations in the solid and aqueous phases are not suitable to simulate barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers barium sorption in dolomite saline aquifers needs to be represented by a scm function of the concentration of ba2 competing cations ca2 and mg2 for hydration sites and ph e g eq 6 moreover accounting for the effect of competing of cations and ph is imperative given the relatively high reactivity of dolomite table 2 3 2 field scale application of the model few usdw contamination incidents have been associated with the accidental spill of produced water a riskier scenario which is examined in this work is the upward migration of produced water from a class ii injection well to failed abandoned wells 3 2 1 geological model arbuckle aquifers are composed of mostly of dolomite fritz et al 2012 therefore the 3 d geological model used for simulations is composed entirely of dolomite and 32 layers of different porosity permeability properties porosity ranges from 10 to 30 and permeability from 10 to 100 md these values correspond to arbuckle facies containing little to no vuggy porosity but intercrystalline and moldic porosities franseen et al 2004 franseen et al 2003 initial pressure distribution corresponds to a hydrostatic pressure gradient of 1 47 psi m produced water is injected at the bottom of the aquifer through a class ii injection well a hypothetical abandoned well is located at the top of the aquifer 450 m away from the injection point fig 3 the effect of temperature has been found to play a secondary role to salinity ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018b hence for consistency with the measured and estimated intrinsic equilibrium constants table 3 simulations are conducted for a constant temperature of 25 c produced water is commonly disposed into arbuckle aquifers murray 2013 walsh and zoback 2015 between 2011 and 2015 reported maximum volume of produced water disposed into arbuckle aquifers through a single class ii injection well was 68 003 574 gal per month 100 kg s fractracker alliance 2019 based on this information simulations are conducted for 50 of this injection rate 50 kg s carbonate rocks including dolomite are characterized by having a complex pore microstructure surface area relationship bust et al 2011 vilcáez et al 2017 therefore to determine the effect of surface area on barium transport simulations are conducted using reactive surface areas of 39 000 cm2 cm3 13 732 cm2 g mineral and 8500 cm2 cm3 2992 cm2 g mineral estimated for arbuckle dolomite by sem analysis smith et al 2017 for simplicity the reactive surface area used to compute dissolution precipitation reactions of minerals are assumed to be equal to the sorption surface area to be able to assess the effect of water rock reactions sorption desorption and dissolution precipitation as well as the composition of dolomite aquifers and injection produced water on barium transport simulations are conducted for the injection of five hypothetical types of produced water into three types of dolomite saline aquifers selection of the five types of produced water is done based on their different tds mostly nacl so4 2 and hardness ca2 and mg2 concentrations as well as on their different ph simulations of produced waters type i ii iii and iv injection into the three types of dolomite saline aquifers aims to analyze the effect of tds so4 2 and hardness ca2 and mg2 on barium transport whereas simulations of produced water type ii and v injection into the three dolomite aquifers aims to analyze the effect of ph on barium transport previous researches have shown that hardness of produced water decreases with increasing the concentration of sodium and vice versa guerra et al 2011 therefore for the sake of realism produced water type ii has different hardness from produced water type v but similar so4 2 content the initial composition of the three dolomite aquifers correspond to compositions reported by rall and wright 1953 for arbuckle saline aquifers table 5 to verify the retardation effect of water rock reactions on barium transport an artificial tracer compound of the same initial concentration as that of barium is included in all simulations injection of produced water takes place for 10 years 3 2 2 simulation results fig 4 shows simulated breakthrough curves of barium when produced waters type i ii iii and iv are injected into the three types of dolomite saline aquifers through a class ii injection well contrary to expectations based on previous results showing that high concentrations of nacl and hardness ca2 and mg2 promotes barium transport in dolomite ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018a the concentration fraction of barium that reaches the abandoned well cout cin decreases with increasing the concentration of nacl and hardness of the dolomite saline aquifer apparently this behavior is due to the presence of so4 2 in the dolomite saline aquifer fig 5 shows the volume fraction of barite overtime at the bottomhole of the injection and abandoned wells the formation of barite increases proportionally to the concentrations of so4 2 in the dolomite saline aquifer and barium in the injection produced water for instance the injection of produced water type i of high barium content 810 mg l into dolomite saline aquifer type i of low so4 2 content 10 mg l results in a negligible amount of barite formation at the bottomhole of the injection well fig 5a and a very small amount of barite formation at the bottomhole of the abandoned well 2 5 10 7 volume fraction fig 5b this is reflected by a fast rate of barium transport fig 4a whereas the injection of the same type of produced water into dolomite saline aquifer type iii of high so4 2 content 7600 mg l results in high amounts of barite formation at the bottomhole of the injection well 0 021 volume fraction fig 5c and a negligible amount of barite formation at the bottomhole of the abandoned well 3 3 10 4 volume fraction fig 5d this is reflected by a very slow rate of barium transport fig 4c sometimes so4 2 content of saline aquifers increases with increasing tds thus barium transport appears to increases with increasing tds of the dolomite saline aquifer guerra et al 2011 the volume fractions of witherite remained zero at all tested produced water and dolomite saline aquifers compositions hence retardation of barium transport in the three dolomite aquifers cannot be attributed to the formation of witherite likewise within the range of ca2 and so4 2 concentrations in the three types of arbuckle dolomite saline aquifers injected with all four types of produced water gypsum formation remained zero therefore gypsum formation could not affect barite precipitation these simulation results reveal that the mobility of barium which is promoted by the formation of ba cl and competition of cations ca2 and mg2 for hydration sites can be suppressed by the precipitation of barium as barite in dolomite saline aquifers of high so4 2 content for instance the injection of produced water type i into dolomite saline aquifer type i of low so4 2 10 mg l content results in practically the same cout cin for barium and the tracer compound 0 3 fig 4a whereas the injection of the same type of produced water into dolomite saline aquifer type ii of high so4 2 1720 mg l content results in cout cin for barium of 0 0002 fig 4b consequently in dolomite saline aquifers of high so4 2 content the surface area of dolomite which determines its sorption capacity appears to play a secondary role to so4 2 content of the aquifer as indicated by practically the same breakthrough curves of barium obtained using reaction surface areas of 13 732 cm2 g dolomite and 2992 cm2 g dolomite however it is noteworthy that the trend of barium transport in dolomite aquifers type ii and iii is not only controlled by the so4 2 content of the dolomite aquifer but also by the so4 2 content of the injection produced water barium transport in dolomite aquifers type ii and iii increases with increasing the so4 2 content of the injection produced water suggesting that barium transport in dolomite aquifers of high so4 2 content is also a function of the so4 2 content and ph of the injection produced water fig 6 shows simulated breakthrough curves of barium when produced water type ii of acidic ph and produced water type v of alkaline ph are injected into the three types of dolomite saline aquifers through a class ii injection well as expected based on previous results ebrahimi and vilcáez 2018b showing that the competition of h and ba2 for hydration sites on dolomite acidic ph levels high h concentration facilitated barium transport results show lower cout cin with the injection of produced water type v of ph 8 2 than with the injection of produced water type ii of ph 4 8 the injection of produced water type ii into dolomite saline aquifer type i of ph 6 0 results in cout cin for barium of 0 024 fig 6a and the injection of produced water type v into the same dolomite aquifer results in cout cin for barium of only 0 012 fig 6b faster barium transport with the injection of produced waters type ii than with the injection of produced water type v cannot be attributed to the so4 2 content of produced waters type ii and v because of their similar so4 2 content therefore apparently although the retarding effect of so4 2 can surpass the promoting effect of not only nacl and hardness the retarding effect of so4 2 decreases with decreasing the ph of the injection produced water the obtained results demonstrate the applicability of the formulated reactive transport model to determine the effect of formation water and produced water compositions as well as the effect of ph on barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers to determine the applicability of the model to determine which ion or ions affects most the transport of barium in the dolomite saline aquifer on a case by case basis a sensitivity analysis of the reactive transport model is conducted for the injection of the four types of produced waters into an arbuckle dolomite aquifer of two possible compositions arbuckle aquifers type i and ii 3 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the reactive transport model to five factors concentrations of hco3 ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 in dolomite aquifers is conducted using a two level factorial design of experiments table 6 levels correspond to the concentrations of hco3 ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 reported for arbuckle dolomite aquifers type i and ii table 5 the initial concentration of hco3 is included as a factor because of its involvement in dolomite dissolution precipitation reactions the initial concentration of ba2 in the dolomite aquifer is zero and the concentration of na is obtained by charge balance table 7 shows the full factorial design matrix and simulated responses yi obtained for each possible combination of factors simulated responses consist of barium percentage that reaches the abandoned well after 10 years of produced water injection through the class ii injection well fig 3 10 y i ba out ba in 100 where i denotes the produced water type for the injection of the of produced water types i ii iii and iv at all possible combinations of the two levels 1 and 1 of hco3 ca2 mg2 and cl with the high level 1 of so4 2 barium concentration at the abandoned well does not exceed 1 0 of barium concentration at the class ii injection well whereas at all possible combinations of the two levels of hco3 ca2 mg2 and cl with the low level 1 of so4 2 barium concentration at the abandoned well increases with decreasing the concentration of so4 2 in the injection produced water 2 0 3 1 for produced water type ii 207 mg so4 2 l 23 24 for produced water type iii 25 mg so4 2 l 22 25 for produced water type iv 9 0 mg so4 2 l and 29 31 for produced water type i 0 0 mg so4 2 l confirming that barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers is more sensitive to the concentration of so4 2 than to the concentration of hco3 ca2 mg2 and cl in the dolomite aquifer and that barium transport is function of the initial concentration of so4 2 in both the aquifer and the injection produced water to be able to compare quantitatively the sensitivity of barium transport to the five selected factors concentrations of hco3 ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 in dolomite aquifers we calculate main and interaction effects according to 11 effect y n y n where n and n refer to the number of responses at 1 and 1 levels and y and y refer to the associated responses shown in table 7 main effect in this case refers to the effect of a single factor whereas interaction effect refers to the combined effect of factors table 8 shows representative all main and interaction effects calculated for the injection of produced water type iii fig 7 compares all main and interaction effects for the injection of produced water types i ii iii and iv for the four types of produced water the concentration of so4 2 b exerts the largest effect followed by the concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 bc and the concentration of cl e in the dolomite aquifer as expected main and interaction effects of these factors b bc and e is different depending on the composition of the injection produced water note that the interaction effect of the concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 is larger than the main effect of cl and that the interaction effect of the concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 is smaller than the main effect of the concentration of so4 2 this can be explained by the relatively low concentration of so4 2 that is required to precipitate barium as barite compared to the relatively high concentration of cl required to inhibit barium sorption in dolomite as well as by the formation of caso4 which reduced the availability of so4 2 to precipitate barium as barite the main and interaction effect of the concentrations of hco3 a and mg2 d for the four types of produced water is practically null depending on the composition of the injection produced water the different main and interaction effects of the concentrations of cl hco3 ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 on barium transport obtained with four types of produced waters demonstrate the applicability the reactive transport model to determine the factor and or combination of factors that influence most the transport of barium in dolomite saline aquifers on a case by case basis this information can be used as an indicator to determine the compatibility of between dolomite aquifers and injection produced waters such that usdw contamination with barium can be prevented for instance from the conducted sensitivity analysis one can conclude that to prevent the contamination of usdw by barium produced waters should be disposed in dolomite saline aquifers of high so4 2 content or the concentration of ca2 in the injection produced waters should be reduced by for instance treating the injection produced water with nahco3 to form insoluble caco3 typically the compatibility between the formation water and injection produced water is analyzed by conducting flask experiments without taking into account the effect of water rock reactions osode et al 2015 spatial and temporal variability of the injection produced water and uncertainty regarding the composition of targeted dolomite aquifers here we are showing an alternative computational approach which can account for all these factors overcoming limitations of conventional flask experiments the same analysis could be done to determine which operation factors e g injection flow rate and petrophysical properties of e g porosity permeability influence most the transport of barium in dolomite saline aquifers given the infinite number of possible scenarios this task as well as an analysis of variance anova is left to the model users 4 conclusions we have formulated and verified a new reactive transport model of produced water disposal into dolomite saline aquifers following are main conclusions regarding the formulation and application of the model to determine the controls of barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers barium sorption in dolomite saline aquifers can be represented by a surface complexation model that accounts for changes of ph due to water rock dissolution precipitation reactions and competition of cations for hydration sites while cl and divalent cations ca2 and mg2 promotes barium transport by inhibiting barium sorption in dolomite so4 2 retards barium transport by precipitating barium as barite baso4 accounting for the formation of chloride complexes in the aqueous phase and precipitation of barium as barite is important to determine which reaction e g sorption or mineralization controls barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers the reaction of ba2 with so4 2 to form barite mineralization reaction constitutes the main water rock reaction that controls barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers of high so4 2 content e g 1720 mg l the mobilizing effect of salinity on barium transport is relevant only in dolomite saline aquifers of low so4 2 content e g 10 mg l the amounts of baco3 witherite precipitation was zero at all tested produced water and dolomite saline aquifer compositions therefore witherite does not significantly affect barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers the initial concentration of so4 2 ions in the dolomite saline aquifer constitutes the factor that most affects barium transport in dolomite saline aquifers however depending on the composition of the injection produced water barium transport can be greatly affected by the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and cl in the dolomite saline aquifer and injection produced water while barium mobilization effect of cl and divalent cations ca2 and mg2 is relevant at high salinity conditions barium mobilization effect of so4 2 is relevant at orders of magnitude lower concentrations than cl and divalent cations the compatibility between dolomite aquifers and injection produced water can be analyzed by conducting reactive transport simulations reactive transport simulations can be used to conduct compatibility analysis of dolomite saline aquifers and produced waters to select dolomite aquifers and or decide on treatment methods to prevent the contamination of usdw by barium declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
