3375,lake shrinkage is a frequent water resource problem in arid and semi arid regions that can affect the hydrological cycle and damage the local aquatic environment since the 1990 s many lakes in inner mongolia have shrunk significantly however the causes of the shrinkage and long term storage trends of lakes in inner mongolia are still poorly understood using observations from multi mission satellites we analyzed water storage changes in six major lakes in inner mongolia over the past 30 years and explored the underlying causes the results reveal divergent changes between the two lake categories for each of the tectonic lakes including lake hulun lake dalinuoer lake daihai and lake hongjiannao the water storage has continuously decreased with annual rates of 0 067 km3 yr 0 012 km3 yr 0 021 km3 yr and 0 01 km3 yr respectively in contrast for oxbow lakes including lake hasuhai and lake wuliangsuhai the storage trends were insignificant 0 001 km3 yr for both human activities were the most significant driving factors especially coal mining agricultural irrigation and grazing which explained more than 70 of the storage changes in lake hulun lake dalinuoer and lake hasuhai among the natural factors evapotranspiration and runoff were secondary influences on these lake storage changes this study provides a systematic analysis and attribution of water storage changes for major lakes in inner mongolia and provides scientific guidance for local water resource management and planning our method provides a useful example of using multi mission satellite data for estimating water storage changes keywords water storage change cause analysis satellite altimetry inner mongolia 1 introduction lakes are an important part of freshwater resources and provide habitats for the migration of some endangered species and birds they are essential for the reproduction of organisms and biodiversity conservation feng et al 2016 liu et al 2013 tao et al 2015 however rapid climate change precipitation and temperature and global warming have dramatically impacted lake changes over the last few decades bai et al 2011 han et al 2019 hu et al 2020 liao et al 2013 xu et al 2018 2022 in addition rapidly growing populations and rapid economic development have contributed significantly to the shrinkage of lakes and wetlands zhou and lei 2020 lake changes have a significant influence on human production and life lakes are a substantial component of surface water especially in arid and semi arid areas that are sensitive to climate change zhang et al 2017 therefore the dynamics of lakes in arid and semi arid areas have received much attention chang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 hou et al 2017 inner mongolia is a major arid and semi arid region in china with a lake area accounting for approximately 6 8 of the country s lake area ma et al 2010 previous studies have determined that lakes in inner mongolia have undergone drastic shrinkage in recent decades chang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2015 which has exacerbated the deterioration of the regional ecological environment and poses a great threat to the habitat of migratory birds and the livelihood of residents tao et al 2015 the influence of natural factors is critical as a region that is sensitive to climate change with the gradual development of industry and agriculture in inner mongolia tao et al 2015 agricultural irrigation and domestic water consumption will greatly increase the depletion of water resources leading to variations in surface runoff groundwater storage and lake water storage throughout the region meanwhile adverse environmental changes in lakes will affect local hydrological cycles as well as human production and life li et al 2022 sun et al 2020 yin et al 2021 resulting in frequent water problems therefore monitoring the dynamic changes of lakes in inner mongolia and analyzing their causes are vital for managing and protecting lake water resources across the region however to date few studies have been conducted in this area in recent decades with the rapid development of remote sensing technology it has become possible to observe lakes from space which makes it convenient to monitor the dynamic changes of lakes and enables large scale water resource monitoring particularly in remote and inaccessible mountain regions abileah et al 2011 cooley et al 2017 2021 crétaux et al 2011 feng et al 2012 han et al 2021 long et al 2014 2017 2020 song et al 2013 wada et al 2010 xu et al 2021 buchroithner and bolch 2014 among all the satellite sensors landsat sensors are known for their longest satellite monitoring capability the entire satellite series spans over 40 years and a 30 meter resolution which has produced numerous research achievements masocha et al 2018 özelkan 2020 zhang et al 2019 satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for the dynamic monitoring of lakes the most common methods for calculating lake water storage changes are based on the lake surface area as obtained from optical images and the water level obtained from altimetric satellites however because of the different shapes and sizes of lakes the ability of altimetry satellites to access the water level of small lakes is minimal huang et al 2018a 2018b 2019 ke et al 2015 ke et al 2020 in addition the acquisition of long term water level series is also greatly restricted because the water levels from different satellites are discontinuous li et al 2019 therefore monitoring long term changes in lake water storage remains a significant challenge in this study we analyzed the changes in water storage in major lakes throughout inner mongolia over the past 30 years 1989 2018 and provided detailed explanations for the causes of the changes in the context of climate change and human activities based on landsat imagery changes in the lake water area were extracted and calculated a new water level interpolation method was proposed to reconstruct the lakes long term water level series data using the water level from hydroweb and altimetric satellites changes in the water storage of six major lakes across the entire study area were calculated based on the lake water level and lake water area subsequently detailed spatial and temporal analyses were conducted to determine the changes in the water area and water storage in the six lakes this study conducted a systematic analysis of the water storage changes in major lakes in inner mongolia for the first time providing a scientific reference for future management protection planning and decision making regarding lake water resources in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the inner mongolia autonomous region is located in northern china 37 24 53 23 n 97 12 126 04e with an area of 1 18 million km2 an average altitude of more than 1 000 m and a terrain that is higher in the southwest than in the northeast wen et al 2016 inner mongolia has a monsoon climate of medium latitudes with more evapotranspiration than precipitation hence water resources play a key role in local production and livelihoods rivers lakes reservoirs and other surface waters account for 0 8 of the overall regional area wen et al 2016 there are six major lakes in inner mongolia with areas ranging from 30 km2 to 2200 km2 and the area of these six lakes accounts for 50 7 of the total area of lakes in inner mongolia lake hulun 48 30 49 20 n 117 00 117 42 e and lake dalinuoer 43 10 43 30 n 116 24 117 45 e are located in the northeast and lake daihai 40 32 40 42 n 112 32 112 48 e lake hongjiannao 39 2 39 10 n 109 44 110 00 e lake hasuhai 40 30 40 40 n 110 55 e 111 2 e and lake wuliangsuhai 40 40 41 10 n 108 25 109 10 e are located in central and southwest mongolia fig 1 2 2 data 2 2 1 landsat images all landsat 5 7 and 8 tier 1 surface reflectance data in inner mongolia were obtained through 130 000 images and 100 000 images with 50 cloud coverage from 1989 to 2018 fig 2 a to demonstrate that all lakes have a sufficient number of images we plotted the spatial distribution of effective images cloud cover below 50 for each lake basin over the past 30 years fig 2b 2c 2d 2e and 2f a total of 4576 landsat images were used in this study including 912 scenes from lake hulun 1001 scenes from lake dalinuoer 958 scenes from lake daihai 492 scenes from lake hongjinnao 627 scenes from lake hasuhai and 586 scenes from lake wuliangsuhai landsat 5 landsat 7 and landsat 8 images were used to between data from january 1 1989 to may 5 2012 may 6 2012 to april 10 2013 and april 11 2013 to december 31 2018 respectively landsat 5 and landsat 8 data were obtained from the google earth engine https earthengine google com however landsat 7 lost data strips after the onboard scan line corrector slc failed on may 31 2003 warner and roberts 2013 the 2012 data needed to be processed separately the images were downloaded for the entire year of 2012 from the united states geological survey usgs website https glovis usgs gov the downloaded images were uploaded to the google earth engine after strip restoration and radiometric calibration using envi version 5 3 finally the processed images were used for water extraction calculations and the other images table 1 provides details of the selected remote sensing images and other data in this study the lake water area was extracted on a google earth engine platform for each image the de clouding and de snowing processes were performed to remove the influence of clouds and snow the extent of the six lakes in the region was also refined by visual interpretation to reduce the partial interference of mountain shadows and artificial features which improved the extraction accuracy of lake water bodies 2 2 2 sentinel 2 images sentinel 2 launched on june 23 2015 is a new program of the european space agency esa wang et al 2016 sentinel 2 images provide four 10 m bands and six 20 m bands which are generally better than landsat series satellites 30 m drusch et al 2012 therefore sentinel 2 msi images were used to validate the accuracy of the water extraction a total of 1030 scenes of sentinel 2 images from june 23 2015 to december 31 2018 were used including 162 scenes from lake hulun 149 scenes from lake dalinuoer 160 scenes from lake daihai 155 scenes from lake hongjinnao 288 scenes from lake hasuhai and 116 scenes from lake wuliangsuhai all sentinel images were downloaded from the google earth engine and the clouds and snow of each image were removed before processing 2 2 3 multi source altimetry data to obtain long term lake water level information this study combined icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetry satellite data and the water level obtained from the official hydroweb website to reconstruct the water level series of the lakes as shown in fig s1 the icesat 1 glah14 datasets available from the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org were used for lake dalinuoer from november 2003 to december 2008 fig s1 the cryosat 2 gdr dataset provided by the esa https science pds cryosat esa int was used for lake dalinuoer from june 2010 to october 2015 in addition hydroweb monthly water level data from october 1992 to december 2018 were used for lake hulun while the data from march 2016 to december 2018 were used for lake dalinuoer fig s1 table 1 hydroweb dataset is an accessible online repository created by laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos https hydroweb theia land fr in 2003 based on multi source altimetric satellite data topex poseidon gfo ers 2 jason 1 jason 2 and envisat it provides long term water level series information for 230 lakes and water storage change information for approximately 100 lakes crétaux et al 2016 the dataset has undergone base error corrections for orbital dry wet ionospheric tropospheric polar and solid tides crétaux et al 2011 in addition to eliminate the errors between the altimetric satellite water levels and hydroweb water levels an error correction was added to the icesat 1 and cryosat 2 water levels the detailed process is described in section 3 1 2 2 4 digital elevation model currently digital elevation model dem data with various spatial resolutions can be freely downloaded and processed on a google earth engine platform this study used void filling shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem data with a spatial resolution of 30 m provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl https lpdaac usgs gov products srtmgl1v003 farr et al 2007 to obtain accurate dem data of the lakes this study extracted lake dem information based on the basin boundary from the hydrological data and maps based onshuttleelevationderivatives at multiplescales hydrosheds https www hydrosheds org downloads which can provide hydrological information on regional and global scales e g river networks basin boundaries river flow directions lehner et al 2013 table 1 2 2 5 terrestrial water storage grace and grace fo satellites and a global land surface model pcraster global water balance pcr globwb were used to investigate the relationship between lake water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia for the grace and grace fo satellites this study used level 3 data provided by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl german research center gfz and center for space research csr at the university of texas at austin https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files because the data processing and algorithms of the three institutions are different the arithmetic mean of the data from the three institutions was beneficial for reducing the noise of the gravity field sakumura et al 2014 therefore the arithmetic means of the three institutions grace and grace fo level 3 rl06 data were used for the final terrestrial water storage anomalies from april 2002 to december 2018 pcr globwb available from sutanudjaja et al 2018 uses process based equations to simulate the water exchange between soil atmosphere and groundwater the pcr globwb v 2 used in this study was a global monthly scale dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 5 which contained the snow water equivalent vegetation canopy water surface water soil water groundwater and anthropogenic water use among others with a period from january 1981 to december 2015 2 2 6 era5 data in this study precipitation evapotranspiration temperature snow water equivalent runoff and vegetation coverage were used as natural drivers to investigate the effects of natural climate change on the water storage changes in lakes in inner mongolia precipitation evapotranspiration temperature snow water equivalent and runoff were derived from the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era5 dataset https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp search type dataset this dataset is advantageous as it has a detailed record of the global atmosphere land surface and waves since 1950 and a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km compared with 80 km for era interim and its temporal resolution was 1 h which is higher compared to era interim dee et al 2011 hersbach et al 2020 the era5 climate factors used in this study were monthly data from january 1989 to december 2018 2 2 7 vegetation coverage variation in vegetation coverage is an important factor in lake water storage change based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi we calculated the vegetation coverage whose value represents the vegetation coverage rate of a certain area detailed calculation process provided in text s1 the gridded daily ndvi dataset was obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate data record cdr of the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr https doi org 10 7289 v5pz56r6 which provides measurements of the surface vegetation coverage activity with a resolution of 0 05 from 1981 to the present vermote et al 2014 2 2 8 human activities this study used urbanization grazing number of goats and sheep coal mining annual coal production and irrigation area of irrigated croplands to represent the effects of human activities on the water storage changes in the lakes urbanization was represented using the global artificial impervious area dataset produced by gong et al 2020 this dataset contains the annual change in the global impervious area from 1985 to 2018 with a spatial resolution of 30 m data on grazing coal mining and irrigation were obtained from the municipal statistical yearbook msyb for each city in inner mongolia the period of these data was consistent with that of the global artificial impervious area data 2 3 method 2 3 1 extraction of lake water area in this study the lake water area was extracted using the modified normalized difference water index mndwi method proposed by xu 2005 based on the normalized difference water index ndwi compared with ndwi mndwi can suppress urban features highlight water body information and distinguish shadows and water bodies more efficiently the mndwi was calculated using equation 1 1 m n d w i ρ green ρ swir ρ green ρ swir where ρ green and ρ swir represent the green and mid infrared bands in landsat 5 7 8 and sentinel 2 remote sensing images respectively the results obtained from the mdnwi method contain considerable interference information so the simple and widely used otsu method ostu et al 1979 which maximizes the inter class variance was used to determine a threshold to separate water bodies and backgrounds du et al 2012 yang et al 2020 yao et al 2019 this method automated the determination of thresholds and greatly overcomes the limitations of single global thresholding pixel grouping and visual inspection were then used to remove the fragmentation noise around the lakes first based on the connected domain method yan et al 2016 the binary images derived from the mndwi and otsu methods were grouped by pixel second the water body groups that were smaller than a certain threshold were removed finally manual visual correction using arcgis 10 6 was performed based on the original remote sensing images from the same period to remove redundant non water information around lakes obtain the target lake water body and calculate its area 2 3 2 calculation of lake water storage changes because the lakes in inner mongolia are generally small among the six major lakes five are small except for lake hulun which is approximately 2 000 km2 the orbit of the altimetry satellite does not cover all the lakes therefore to obtain the 30 years of water storage changes of the six lakes the traditional area water level formula could not be used directly this study used two methods for different lakes to reconstruct the long term series of water storage change information altimetric satellite orbits cover lake hulun and lake dalinuoer e g topex poseidon jason 2 jason 3 icesat 1 cryosat 2 so the area water level empirical formula could be used to estimate the lake water storage changes song et al 2013 the area was calculated from the remote sensing images while hydroweb provided partial monthly water level information for lake hulun and lake dalinuoer these two lakes complete long term water level series from 1989 to 2018 could be reconstructed by combining the hydroweb water levels with icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetry satellite water levels see section 3 1 and fig 3 we calculated the lake water storage changes for the lakes lake daihai lake hasuhai lake hongjiannao and lake wuliangsuhai that have little or no altimetry satellite orbits through the statistical relationship between the area and water storage changes qiao et al 2019 see section 2 3 3 2 and fig 3 2 3 2 1 calculation of lake water storage changes based on area water level lake water storage changes based on the area the water level are calculated using the linear relationship between the area and water level complete information on the water level of lakes is crucial to determine the final changes in water storage here the whole lake water level was reconstructed in a three step process 1 the hydroweb water level was integrated with the icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetric satellite water levels 2 the water level was extended for the periods with no data 3 the water level was interpolated for the missing data months the detailed water level reconstruction process is described in section 3 1 and fig 3 the complete long term water level series was reconstructed for lake hulun and lake dalinuoer subsequently the lake water storage changes were calculated using the following method yuan et al 2018 assuming a historical minimum value of water level h 0 in a lake the water volume v of the lake at a certain time can be calculated in two parts the fixed water volume below the h 0 v 0 and the variation in the water volume above h 0 v a when the difference between the lowest value h 0 and the water level h i reaches h the variation in the water volume above h 0 v a can then be calculated using equations 2 and 3 2 v a h 0 a d h 3 a f h where a and h are the area and water levels above h 0 respectively the area can be further expressed as a function of the water level which can be established by the linear relationship between the area and water level fig 4 2 3 2 2 calculation of lake water storage changes based on area dem the method of calculating the lake water storage changes based on the area dem is essentially applying the area water level empirical formula the area and water level derived from the dem were used to calculate lake water storage changes based on equations 2 and 3 the relationship between the area and water storage changes was then constructed using an empirical formula the empirical formula could then be applied directly to calculate lake water storage changes in the area extracted by landsat imagery from 1989 to 2018 yang et al 2016 used the area dem method to calculate lake water storage changes in five lakes on the tibetan plateau the largest lake namucuo reaches 2020 9 km2 and the smallest lake gyado co is 42 72 km2 with an average error of 4 98 this method was divided into five steps step 1 lake basin dems were extracted based on the hydrosheds basin boundaries step 2 dem was converted to a vector surface with elevation values areas with the same elevation value were merged together using arcgis 10 6 so that the area of each elevation value could be calculated second column of table 2 the lake surface area with elevation hi was calculated by summing the area of each elevation value below hi third column of table 2 thus a series of water levels elevation at intervals of 1 m and their corresponding lake surface areas was obtained table 2 further the statistical relationship between the lake surface area and water levels was calculated fig s2 step 3 using the linear relationship changes in lake water storage at water level intervals of 1 m were calculated based on equations 2 and 3 fourth column of table 2 step 4 because the srtm dem was obtained in 2000 the water level in january 2000 was used as the initial value h0 when the difference between hi and the initial water level h0 is h the water storage changes can be calculated by accumulating all the changes in water storage at water level intervals of 1 m between 0 and h fifth column of table 2 then a relationship between the change in water storage and lake surface area was obtained for a water level difference ofh the statistical relationship between the lake surface area and water storage change was constructed as an empirical formula fig s3 step 5 finally the empirical formula was applied directly to calculate lake water storage changes using the lake surface area extracted by landsat imagery from 1989 to 2018 using lake daihai as an example the correspondence between water level elevation and lake surface area obtained in step 2 is provided in table 2 r2 0 999 p 0 001 where the water level of lake daihai was 1 218 m as per the dem in january 2000 thus the water storage changes in lake daihai relative to the water storage in january 2000 could be calculated using equations 2 and 3 for example the water storage change when the water level reaches 1 221 m is the sum of the water storage change when the water level increases from 1 218 1 219 m 1 219 1 220 m and 1 220 1 221 m therefore an empirical formula between the lake surface area and the water storage change for lake daihai was established and the water storage changes from 1989 to 2018 could be calculated by combining this empirical formula and the lake surface area extracted by landsat imagery 2 3 3 selection of driving factors to systematically analyze the causes of lake water storage changes seven variables including precipitation evapotranspiration runoff temperature snow water equivalent vegetation coverage and artificial impervious area were selected as alternative factors subsequently the most significant factors were screened from these alternative factors combined with linear correlation analysis and random forest methods first the factors that did not pass the significance test were removed by calculating the pearson correlation coefficients between the water storage changes and all the alternative factors second to exclude the influence of additional confounding factors and extract the dominant factors based on the results of the linear correlation analysis the importance of the factors that passed the significance test was ranked using the random forest method edwards et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the results indicate that the higher the importance of the factor the stronger the overall explanation of the factor for the water storage changes and vice versa in addition cross validation was performed for all factors that passed the significance test in the linear correlation analysis to select the appropriate number of driving factors the function of cross validation is to divide the original data to obtain different training sets so that separate sets can be used to train and validate the model this is done to address the problem that the individual testing results are too one sided and the training data are insufficient the model fitting error was obtained through multiple cross validations as the number of factors increased thus the optimal number of main driving factors was selected when the model fitting error reached a minimum the above method can provide a more intuitive reference when significant factors are chosen owing to the relatively small number of factors cross validation does not have sufficient data for training therefore the final number of selected factors must be combined with the final overall variance explanation rate of the random forest model to discriminate the variance explanation rate is the overall explanatory ability of the random forest model constructed using the selected variables for the target variable water storage changes when the variance explanation rate is higher it reflects the critical influences on the water storage changes finally the factors and their numbers corresponding to the highest variance explanation rate were identified as the main factors affecting lake water storage changes 3 results 3 1 reconstruction of long term lake level time series a rigorous water level reconstruction process was designed which included three main steps fig 3 1 integration of hydroweb water levels with altimetric satellite water levels the water level obtained from the icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetric satellites detailed calculation process provided in text s2 could be fused into the hydroweb water level as supplementary data in addition considering that the processing and method of hydroweb water level is different from that of the water level derived from the icesat 1 and cryosat 2 satellites equation 4 was used to eliminate the systematic error between them the water level derived from hydroweb was selected as the reference time series the water level derived from icesat 1 and cryosat 2 at time t i corrected for system differences was obtained as chen and liao 2020 described 4 s e r i e s 2 cor t i s e r i e s 2 ini t i s e r i e s 1 ref s e r i e s 2 ini where s e r i e s 1 ref is the mean value of the water level time series from the reference hydroweb water level s e r i e s 2 ini is the mean value of the icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetric satellite water level time series s e r i e s 2 ini t i and s e r i e s 2 cor t i are the uncorrected and corrected icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetric satellite water level time series respectively 2 water levels for the periods with no data were extended because the integrated water level did not cover all the years from 1989 to 2018 the linear relationship between the area and water level was used as an empirical formula to extend the lake water level corresponding to the area in the period without lake water level data bai et al 2020 fig 4 3 for water level interpolation for those months in which the water level was still missing an interpolation method was used to supplement the data due to the comprehensive impact of climate environment and hydrology the lake water level showed a seasonal fluctuation trend in the long term therefore the lake water level can be decomposed into three components seasonal fluctuations linear trends and residuals chen and liao 2020 gao et al 2013 wang et al 2006 based on this theory a residual based interpolation method for the water level is designed as follows the water level is decomposed into three components fig 5 5 h t a b t c s i n π 6 t φ d s i n π 3 t φ v t where h t is the water level in month t a b t is the linear trend c s i n π 6 t φ d s i n π 3 t φ is the seasonal fluctuation v t is the residual a is a constant b is the coefficient of the linear trend c and d are the coefficients of the cyclic seasonal fluctuation and φ is the possible seasonal delay the seasonal fluctuation and linear trend in equation 5 can be fitted using least squares fig 5b and 5e thus the residuals for month t can be calculated using equation 6 6 v t h t a b t c s i n π 6 t φ d s i n π 3 t φ using equation 6 the residual for month t in the original water level was calculated for the entire period fig 5c and 5f a random forest method was used for the obtained residuals to interpolate the values for the missing months stekhoven and buhlmann 2012 and the results are presented in fig 6 a and 6d combining the residual values of the missing months as obtained by interpolation with the seasonal fluctuations and linear trends derived from the least squares fig 6b and 6e the water level of the missing months was inverted using equation 7 7 h t miss a b t miss c s i n π 6 t miss φ d s i n π 3 t miss φ v t miss where h t miss is the water level of the missing month a b c d and φ are the parameters calculated in equation 5 and v t miss is the residual of the missing month obtained by interpolation with the above water level interpolation method the complete monthly water level time series was obtained for lake hulun and lake dalinuoer from 1989 to 2018 fig 6c and 6f 3 2 water area changes and water storage changes of lakes in inner mongolia 3 2 1 temporal variation of these lakes there are two predominant types of lakes in inner mongolia one is formed by crustal tectonic movement named tectonic lakes whose primary water source is external rivers such lakes include lake hulun lake dalinuoer lake daihai and lake hongjiannao the second type is formed by the realignment of yellow river over time oxbow lakes these lakes have no stable external river for water supply they include lake hasuhai and lake wuliangsuhai the long term dynamics of water area changes and water storage changes in these two types of lakes varied significantly for tectonic lakes water area changes and water storage changes were relatively consistent with significant declines throughout the entire study period fig 7 a 7b 7c and 7d the decreasing water area and water storage were 58 km2 with 1 93 km2 yr and 2 01 km3 with 0 067 km3 yr for lake hulun 28 km2 with 0 93 km2 yr and 0 37 km3 with 0 012 km3 yr for lake dalinuoer 66 km2 with 2 2 km2 yr and 0 69 km3 with 0 021 km3 yr for lake daihai 17 km2 with 0 57 km2 yr and 0 297 km3 with 0 01 km3 yr for lake hongjiannao from 1989 to 2018 respectively in particular from 2000 to 2012 the shrinkage of these lakes was substantial fig 7a 7b 7c and 7d in contrast a stable or slightly decreasing trend was observed in the oxbow lakes fig 7e and 7f where the variational water area and water storage were 4 km2 with 0 13 km2 yr and 0 026 km3 with 0 001 km3 yr for lake hasuhai 10 km2 with 0 33 km2 yr and 0 023 km3 with 0 001 km3 yr for lake wuliangsuhai from 1989 to 2018 respectively water area and water storage in six lakes decreased and their changes occurred predominantly within four periods 1989 2000 2000 2012 2012 2016 and 2016 2018 fig 7 3 2 2 spatial variation of these lakes using the lake water area extracted from landsat imagery to map the monthly inundation frequency over 30 years and the inundation area of the six lakes for some years fig 8 there were significant differences in the spatial variation of each lake the inundation frequency of lake hulun is low in the southwest and high near the northeast consistent with fan et al 2021 so the variation in lake hulun was primarily concentrated in the southwest throughout the entire period fig 8a after nearly disappearing in 2012 the southwestern part of lake hulun began to recover at a rapidly increasing rate with water storage in 2016 similar to that in 1989 fig 7a and fig 8a the inundation frequency in eastern lake dalinuoer is lower than that in the central and western regions fig 8b thus the water bodies along its eastern lakeshores would disappear or transform into smaller marshes when the water storage decreased fig 8b the inundation frequency in the northeast and the center of lake daihai is higher than that in the southwest thus the dynamic changes in lake daihai are predominantly concentrated in the southwest and the lakeshores fig 8c from 1989 to 2018 lake daihai shrunk at a visible rate fig 8c lake hongjiannao is a typical indented lake with a low inundation frequency in the lakeshores fig 8d therefore when the lake shrank the water storage of lake hongjiannao decreased almost uniformly toward the center of the lake fig 8d the composition of the water bodies in lake hasuhai was irregular fig 8e when the water storage was sufficient the water bodies in the northwest and southeast were connected fig 8e the water bodies of lake wuliangsuhai were highly irregular and were composed of numerous marshes of different sizes fig 8f the water storage changes in lake wuliangsuhai were almost stable throughout the entire period fig 7f and fig 8f the expansion and shrinkage of lake wuliangsuhai were primarily concentrated in the northeast fig 8f which may be due to the lack of a stable water resource recharge in the northeast the artificial channel is located in the middle and south sections of lake wuliangsuhai fig 1f 3 3 cause analysis to investigate the water storage changes of different lakes in inner mongolia the cause analysis for each lake was performed as follows 3 3 1 key driving factors of lake water storage changes the correlations between the water storage changes and all factors are illustrated in fig 9 precipitation r 0 43 p 0 05 evapotranspiration r 0 58 p 0 001 runoff r 0 58 p 0 001 and snow water equivalent r 0 33 p 0 1 passed the significance test for lake hulun evapotranspiration and runoff were highly correlated with water storage changes while precipitation and snow water equivalent were poorly correlated with water storage changes after excluding the factors that did not pass the significance test using the above method the correlation coefficient of the impact factors was also ranked for the other five lakes and the details are presented in table 3 furthermore based on the results of the linear correlation analysis in the previous step the random forest method was used to obtain the importance ranking of the factors that passed the significance test and the results of the cross validation as shown in fig 10 the results indicate that evapotranspiration runoff and snow water equivalent explain 48 69 of the water storage changes in lake hulun fig 10a runoff and evapotranspiration explained 69 59 of the water storage changes in lake dalinuoer fig 10b artificial impervious areas runoff and vegetation cover accounted for 45 83 of the water storage changes in lake daihai fig 10c artificial impervious areas runoff and vegetation coverage explained 60 47 of the water storage changes in lake hongjiannao fig 10d the artificial impervious area runoff and temperature explained 45 17 of the water storage changes in lake hasuhai fig 10e moreover evapotranspiration precipitation runoff artificial impervious area and snow water equivalent explained 60 47 of the water storage changes in lake wuliangsuhai fig 10f in general evapotranspiration and runoff were the key factors affecting water storage changes in lake hulun and lake dalinuoer the artificial impervious area was the most substantial factor for lake daihai lake hongjiannao and lake hasuhai however the influences of evapotranspiration precipitation runoff and artificial impervious areas on lake wuliangsuhai were relatively balanced the predicted lake water storage changes can be calculated using the random forest method based on the selected factors therefore comparing the predicted lake water storage changes with the actual lake water storage changes original lake water storage changes the accuracy of the random forest model built using the derived factors could be validated fig 11 the results demonstrate that the predicted lake water storage changes are relatively consistent with the valid values r2 0 9 p 0 05 fig 11 which indicates the feasibility of using the random forest to explain lake water storage changes 3 3 2 explanation of key driving factors the key driving factors selected are listed in table 4 the impact factors of the water storage changes for each lake differed significantly for lake hulun runoff r 0 58 p 0 and water storage changes was significantly positively correlated while evapotranspiration r 0 58 p 0 and snow water equivalent r 0 33 p 0 05 were negatively correlated table 4 for lake dalinuoer runoff r 0 74 p 0 was positive for the increase in lake water storage while evapotranspiration r 0 67 p 0 was negative table 4 lake daihai is not only influenced by natural climate change but also responds strongly to human activities for lake daihai the artificial impervious area was significantly negatively correlated to water storage changes r 0 65 p 0 while runoff r 0 61 p 0 and vegetation coverage r 0 33 p 0 08 were significantly positively correlated table 4 for lake hongjiannao artificial impervious area r 0 70 p 0 was the key factor contributing to the decrease in water storage consistent with cao et al 2021 while vegetation coverage r 0 51 p 0 and runoff r 0 42 p 0 02 primarily played a role in delaying the shrinkage of water storage table 4 for lake hasuhai the artificial impervious area r 0 60 p 0 and runoff r 0 63 p 0 exhibited the strongest responses to the water storage changes with significant negative and positive correlations respectively table 4 the temperature r 0 36 p 0 05 was weakly negatively correlated with water storage changes in lake hasuhai table 4 for lake wuliangsuhai there were four driving factors that responded to water storage changes precipitation r 0 58 p 0 and runoff r 0 63 p 0 were positive for the increase in lake water storage while evapotranspiration r 0 58 p 0 and artificial impervious areas r 0 51 p 0 were negative table 4 in general among these existing factors evapotranspiration and runoff among natural climate change and artificial impervious areas among human activities have significant effects on lake water storage changes however due to the limitation of data sources we could not consider the influence of more factors on the water storage changes such as anthropogenic water withdrawal from the lakes yellow river pumping and other factors that can affect the water storage of lakes therefore to have a deeper understanding of the causes of lake water storage changes other factors are discussed in section 4 2 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis this study used two methods to calculate the lake water storage changes the lake water area is used in both methods and directly affects the results thus ensuring high accuracy of the extracted lake water area is critical for the reconstructed water level the hydroweb water level established by legos is reliable crétaux et al 2011 the accuracy of the reconstructed water level primarily depends on the accuracy of the water level interpolation therefore the validation of the water level interpolation is also essential in addition the method for calculating the lake water storage changes based on area dem has been applied universally and the validation can be found in qiao et al 2019 and yang et al 2016 4 1 1 accuracy of extracted lake water area the lake water areas of six lakes extracted from sentinel 2 images and landsat imagery were compared and the results are displayed in fig 12 the correlation coefficient r2 and mean relative error mre were used to evaluate the final results the lake water area extracted from landsat imagery was almost the same as that extracted from the sentinel 2 images r2 0 9 mre 2 fig 12 this indicates that the lake water areas extracted from landsat imagery are reliable 4 1 2 accuracy of water level interpolation the accuracy of the water level interpolation was evaluated using the following steps first the months of missing values were removed from the original water level data to construct a continuous time series this continuous time series was used as the reference dataset second a testing dataset was constructed by randomly removing the continuous time series data at a specific rate the same as the missing rate of the original water level finally a random forest interpolation method was applied to the testing dataset and the results were compared with those of the reference dataset the root mean square error rmse was used to evaluate accuracy the results are presented in fig 13 compared with the rmse of 0 26 m for the water level of lake hulun which was derived based on altimetric satellites by yuan et al 2018 the rmse values for our results are only 0 151 m for lake hulun and 0 093 m for lake dalinuoer based on the water level interpolation fig 13 indicating that the interpolation method for the water level is feasible 4 2 other driving factors of lake water storage changes in section 3 3 several dominant factors affect the water storage changes of six lakes in inner mongolia including natural and anthropogenic factors some lakes were significantly affected by human activities e g lake hasuhai lake daihai and lake hongjiannao fig 10 therefore in order to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of human activities on lake water storage changes the driving factors used in zhou et al 2019 to analyze lake water area changes in the mongolian plateau were referenced in this study including irrigation grazing and coal mining therefore irrigation grazing and coal mining were extended to the random forest model as representative human activity factors however because the statistical yearbook could not provide complete data for all cities irrigation and grazing data were collected for lake hulun lake dalinuoer and lake hasuhai in contrast coal mining data were collected only for lake hulun and lake dalinuoer after adding irrigation grazing and coal mining the random forest model was used to perform a contribution analysis of the lake water storage changes once again the variance explanation rate obtained from the random forest model was significantly improved the variance explanation rate reached 85 51 for lake hulun and over 70 for the other lakes fig 14 d 14e and 14f this suggests that the contribution of human activities irrigation grazing and coal mining to the water storage changes of lakes in inner mongolia is critical tao et al 2015 for lake hulun lake dalinuoer and lake hasuhai the impact of human activities exceeds climate change the effects of irrigation grazing and coal mining on lake water storage changes in inner mongolia were also substantial over long periods fig 14a 14b and 14c firstly for lake hulun grazing increased from 2 74 million to 10 18 million with an annual growth rate of 316 040 head yr from 1989 to 2015 fig 14a and the irrigation area increased from 7 36 million mu 1 mu 666 67 m2 in 1989 to 29 29 million mu in 2017 with an annual growth rate of 819 000 mu yr fig 14a this evidence suggests that the rapid growth of irrigation and grazing are critical factors in the dramatic shrinkage of lake hulun interestingly the changes in coal mining and water storage changes in lake hulun present an opposite trend over all four periods 1989 2000 2000 2012 2012 2016 and 2016 2018 fig 14a this indicates that the rapid development of coal mining in the lake hulun region has greatly limited the expansion of water storage and has led to a sharp shrinkage of the lake shen et al 2021 found that the process of coal mining generates artificial extraction of groundwater which leads to a reduction in groundwater reserves and a decline in the local vegetation coverage as a result the shrinkage of lake hulun occurred because of a lack of groundwater recharge secondly for lake dalinuoer coal mining increased from 9 51 million tons in 1989 to 34 6 million tons in 2013 with an annual growth rate of 1 03 mt yr fig 14b the annual growth increased from 6 52 million head from 1989 to 12 07 million head in 2016 with an annual growth rate of 178 800 head yr fig 14b and the annual growth rate of the irrigation area from 1989 to 2018 was 1 457 900 mu yr fig 14b this evidence indicates that during the continuous shrinkage of lake dalinuoer agriculture and industry developed rapidly as a result a large portion of the water resources of lake dalinuoer were consumed which lead to a rapid decrease in lake storage previous studies have demonstrated that the water consumption for agricultural irrigation and water harvesting from groundwater may be other factors causing lake shrinkage in the agricultural area of inner mongolia blanc et al 2014 tao et al 2015 which is consistent with the findings of this study finally for lake hasuhai the irrigation area and grazing numbers increased slowly fig 14c their annual growth rates were 50 300 and 46 600 head yr from 1989 to 2018 respectively fig 14c these two factors contributed to the slow shrinkage of lake hasuhai especially grazing which exhibited a completely opposite trend to the water storage changes in 1989 2015 and 2015 2018 fig 14c therefore agriculture and livestock development inhibit the expansion of water storage in lake hasuhai synthesizing the results presented in section 3 3 we found that these six lakes in inner mongolia were the most significantly affected by human activities the most dominant factors were grazing for lake hulun fig 14d coal mining for lake dalinuoer fig 14e artificial impervious area for lake daihai fig 10c artificial impervious area for lake hongjiannao fig 10d and irrigation for lake hasuhai fig 14f although the artificial impervious area is not the most dominant factor for lake wuliangsuhai its importance is comparable to those of the first three factors fig 10f in contrast natural factors play a supporting role therefore controlling the impact of human activities on lakes is the most substantial measure to ensure the recovery of lake water storage in inner mongolia 4 3 relationship between lake water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies the dynamics of lakes play a key role in terrestrial water storage anomalies jiang et al 2020 demonstrated a highly consistent relationship between lake water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies in the tibetan plateau and the relationship between the water storage changes in six lakes and the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia was investigated in time and space the terrestrial water storage anomalies for inner mongolia from 1989 to 2018 were obtained from the grace satellite 2002 2018 and the pcr globwb hydrological model 1989 2015 the terrestrial water storage anomalies calculated by grace called grace twsa and terrestrial water storage anomalies calculated by pcr globwb called pcr twsa were highly consistent during 2002 2015 demonstrating the same trend and minor numerical differences r2 0 75 p 0 001 fig 15 hence integrating grace twsa and pcr twsa for analysis is feasible temporally the water storage changes of the six lakes and the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia were highly consistent figs 15 and 16 present the relationship between the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia and the water storage changes of the six lakes the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia have been decreasing over the last 30 years with an overall decrease rate of 3 18 mm yr for grace twsa and 3 64 mm yr for pcr twsa fig 15 the same changes also occurred in these lakes of inner mongolia where the total water storage of these lakes is continuously decreasing with an overall decrease rate of 0 11 km3 yr from 1989 to 2018 fig 15 the variation trends of the lake water storage changes and those of terrestrial water storage anomalies are consistent with r2 of 0 48 p 0 01 for grace twsa and water storage changes and 0 89 p 0 001 for pcr twsa and water storage changes from 1989 to 2018 in addition to better describe the relationship between the terrestrial water storage anomalies and lake water storage changes the divisional correlation coefficient was also used to quantitatively explain their connection fig 15 from the results we found that the water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies were highly consistent before 2012 with r2 of 0 88 p 0 001 for the grace twsa and water storage changes and 0 93 p 0 001 for the pcr twsa and water storage changes fig 15 however the correlation of the water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies became weak with r2 of 0 01 p 0 05 for the grace twsa and water storage changes and 0 38 p 0 05 for the pcr twsa and water storage changes after 2012 fig 15 this is because lake hulun as the largest lake in inner mongolia contributes the most to the lake water storage changes 60 2 of the total water storage changes therefore the expansion of lake hulun after 2012 fig 7a would have a significant impact on the trend of the total lake water storage changes spatially the water storage changes of the six lakes and the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia were also highly consistent fig 16 from 2002 to 2018 the terrestrial water storage anomalies in southern inner mongolia significantly decreased it slightly increased in the northeast similar to the spatial variations in lake water storage changes fig 16a notably the terrestrial water storage anomalies in the lake hulun region had decreased however the water storage of lake hulun exhibited an increasing trend with an annual growth rate of 0 007 km3 yr from 2002 to 2018 fig 16a considering that the water storage recovery in lake hulun after 2012 fig 7a impacted the total water storage changes the relationship between the terrestrial water storage anomalies and water storage changes in the lake hulun region from 2012 to 2018 is shown in fig 16b the terrestrial water storage anomalies in the lake hulun region increased from 2012 to 2018 fig 16b especially in the eastern region of this area fig 16b the water storage of lake hulun was also increasing with an annual growth rate of 0 069 km3 yr from 2012 to 2018 fig 16b in addition from 1989 to 2015 the spatial variation in the water storage changes of the six lakes and the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia were consistent for example a significant decrease in the terrestrial water storage anomalies occurred in the lake hulun region and the lake water storage decreased significantly fig s4 in general lake water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies were consistent in inner mongolia from 1989 to 2018 the contribution of total lake water storage changes to terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia is critical 5 conclusions based on landsat imagery altimetric satellites hydroweb water level and dem changes in the water area and water storage in six major lakes in inner mongolia were analyzed over the past 30 years in general these lakes can be divided into two types one type is a tectonic lake demonstrating a significant downward trend the annual decreasing water storage rates were 0 067 km3 yr for lake hulun 0 012 km3 yr for lake dalinuoer 0 021 km3 yr for lake daihai and 0 01 km3 yr for lake hongjiannao from 1989 to 2018 the other type is oxbow lakes they fluctuate smoothly the annual rate of water storage changes in both lake hasuhai and lake wuliangsuhai was 0 001 km3 yr from 1989 to 2018 spatially the variations in each lake reflect different characteristics and the locations of shrinkage expansion varied for each lake in addition linear correlation analysis and random forest analysis were combined to determine the driving factors of lake water storage change the results indicate that human activities are the predominant factors driving lake water storage changes especially grazing irrigation and coal mining which explained 85 51 85 34 and 72 69 of the water storage changes for lakes hulun dalinuoer and hasuhai respectively natural factors only played a supporting role and the impacts of evaporation and runoff were the most substantial finally the relationship between the water storage changes of the six lakes and terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia was discussed there was good agreement in the temporal and spatial variations between the lake water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies especially before 2012 r2 0 88 p 0 001 for the grace twsa and water storage changes and r2 0 93 p 0 001 for the pcr twsa and water storage changes our study still has limitations which are mainly reflected in two points first the grazing irrigation and coal mining used for cause analysis did not cover all lakes leading to one sided results in our analysis second the extraction algorithm for the lake surface area can be further improved using the currently popular machine learning and deep learning for image classification and extracting lake masks from the classification images may further improve the confidence of our results in recent decades with the aggravation of drought in inner mongolia the shrinkage of lakes has also intensified coupled with the rapid development of local industry and agriculture the reasons for the dynamics of lakes have become complex and diverse for the first time we studied six major lakes in inner mongolia and systematically analyzed the causes of these changes from water storage changes the findings can provide a basis for local lake water resource management decision making and future analysis of the dynamic evolution of the lakes our method provides a practical example of using multi mission satellite data for estimating water storage

3375,lake shrinkage is a frequent water resource problem in arid and semi arid regions that can affect the hydrological cycle and damage the local aquatic environment since the 1990 s many lakes in inner mongolia have shrunk significantly however the causes of the shrinkage and long term storage trends of lakes in inner mongolia are still poorly understood using observations from multi mission satellites we analyzed water storage changes in six major lakes in inner mongolia over the past 30 years and explored the underlying causes the results reveal divergent changes between the two lake categories for each of the tectonic lakes including lake hulun lake dalinuoer lake daihai and lake hongjiannao the water storage has continuously decreased with annual rates of 0 067 km3 yr 0 012 km3 yr 0 021 km3 yr and 0 01 km3 yr respectively in contrast for oxbow lakes including lake hasuhai and lake wuliangsuhai the storage trends were insignificant 0 001 km3 yr for both human activities were the most significant driving factors especially coal mining agricultural irrigation and grazing which explained more than 70 of the storage changes in lake hulun lake dalinuoer and lake hasuhai among the natural factors evapotranspiration and runoff were secondary influences on these lake storage changes this study provides a systematic analysis and attribution of water storage changes for major lakes in inner mongolia and provides scientific guidance for local water resource management and planning our method provides a useful example of using multi mission satellite data for estimating water storage changes keywords water storage change cause analysis satellite altimetry inner mongolia 1 introduction lakes are an important part of freshwater resources and provide habitats for the migration of some endangered species and birds they are essential for the reproduction of organisms and biodiversity conservation feng et al 2016 liu et al 2013 tao et al 2015 however rapid climate change precipitation and temperature and global warming have dramatically impacted lake changes over the last few decades bai et al 2011 han et al 2019 hu et al 2020 liao et al 2013 xu et al 2018 2022 in addition rapidly growing populations and rapid economic development have contributed significantly to the shrinkage of lakes and wetlands zhou and lei 2020 lake changes have a significant influence on human production and life lakes are a substantial component of surface water especially in arid and semi arid areas that are sensitive to climate change zhang et al 2017 therefore the dynamics of lakes in arid and semi arid areas have received much attention chang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 hou et al 2017 inner mongolia is a major arid and semi arid region in china with a lake area accounting for approximately 6 8 of the country s lake area ma et al 2010 previous studies have determined that lakes in inner mongolia have undergone drastic shrinkage in recent decades chang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2015 which has exacerbated the deterioration of the regional ecological environment and poses a great threat to the habitat of migratory birds and the livelihood of residents tao et al 2015 the influence of natural factors is critical as a region that is sensitive to climate change with the gradual development of industry and agriculture in inner mongolia tao et al 2015 agricultural irrigation and domestic water consumption will greatly increase the depletion of water resources leading to variations in surface runoff groundwater storage and lake water storage throughout the region meanwhile adverse environmental changes in lakes will affect local hydrological cycles as well as human production and life li et al 2022 sun et al 2020 yin et al 2021 resulting in frequent water problems therefore monitoring the dynamic changes of lakes in inner mongolia and analyzing their causes are vital for managing and protecting lake water resources across the region however to date few studies have been conducted in this area in recent decades with the rapid development of remote sensing technology it has become possible to observe lakes from space which makes it convenient to monitor the dynamic changes of lakes and enables large scale water resource monitoring particularly in remote and inaccessible mountain regions abileah et al 2011 cooley et al 2017 2021 crétaux et al 2011 feng et al 2012 han et al 2021 long et al 2014 2017 2020 song et al 2013 wada et al 2010 xu et al 2021 buchroithner and bolch 2014 among all the satellite sensors landsat sensors are known for their longest satellite monitoring capability the entire satellite series spans over 40 years and a 30 meter resolution which has produced numerous research achievements masocha et al 2018 özelkan 2020 zhang et al 2019 satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for the dynamic monitoring of lakes the most common methods for calculating lake water storage changes are based on the lake surface area as obtained from optical images and the water level obtained from altimetric satellites however because of the different shapes and sizes of lakes the ability of altimetry satellites to access the water level of small lakes is minimal huang et al 2018a 2018b 2019 ke et al 2015 ke et al 2020 in addition the acquisition of long term water level series is also greatly restricted because the water levels from different satellites are discontinuous li et al 2019 therefore monitoring long term changes in lake water storage remains a significant challenge in this study we analyzed the changes in water storage in major lakes throughout inner mongolia over the past 30 years 1989 2018 and provided detailed explanations for the causes of the changes in the context of climate change and human activities based on landsat imagery changes in the lake water area were extracted and calculated a new water level interpolation method was proposed to reconstruct the lakes long term water level series data using the water level from hydroweb and altimetric satellites changes in the water storage of six major lakes across the entire study area were calculated based on the lake water level and lake water area subsequently detailed spatial and temporal analyses were conducted to determine the changes in the water area and water storage in the six lakes this study conducted a systematic analysis of the water storage changes in major lakes in inner mongolia for the first time providing a scientific reference for future management protection planning and decision making regarding lake water resources in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the inner mongolia autonomous region is located in northern china 37 24 53 23 n 97 12 126 04e with an area of 1 18 million km2 an average altitude of more than 1 000 m and a terrain that is higher in the southwest than in the northeast wen et al 2016 inner mongolia has a monsoon climate of medium latitudes with more evapotranspiration than precipitation hence water resources play a key role in local production and livelihoods rivers lakes reservoirs and other surface waters account for 0 8 of the overall regional area wen et al 2016 there are six major lakes in inner mongolia with areas ranging from 30 km2 to 2200 km2 and the area of these six lakes accounts for 50 7 of the total area of lakes in inner mongolia lake hulun 48 30 49 20 n 117 00 117 42 e and lake dalinuoer 43 10 43 30 n 116 24 117 45 e are located in the northeast and lake daihai 40 32 40 42 n 112 32 112 48 e lake hongjiannao 39 2 39 10 n 109 44 110 00 e lake hasuhai 40 30 40 40 n 110 55 e 111 2 e and lake wuliangsuhai 40 40 41 10 n 108 25 109 10 e are located in central and southwest mongolia fig 1 2 2 data 2 2 1 landsat images all landsat 5 7 and 8 tier 1 surface reflectance data in inner mongolia were obtained through 130 000 images and 100 000 images with 50 cloud coverage from 1989 to 2018 fig 2 a to demonstrate that all lakes have a sufficient number of images we plotted the spatial distribution of effective images cloud cover below 50 for each lake basin over the past 30 years fig 2b 2c 2d 2e and 2f a total of 4576 landsat images were used in this study including 912 scenes from lake hulun 1001 scenes from lake dalinuoer 958 scenes from lake daihai 492 scenes from lake hongjinnao 627 scenes from lake hasuhai and 586 scenes from lake wuliangsuhai landsat 5 landsat 7 and landsat 8 images were used to between data from january 1 1989 to may 5 2012 may 6 2012 to april 10 2013 and april 11 2013 to december 31 2018 respectively landsat 5 and landsat 8 data were obtained from the google earth engine https earthengine google com however landsat 7 lost data strips after the onboard scan line corrector slc failed on may 31 2003 warner and roberts 2013 the 2012 data needed to be processed separately the images were downloaded for the entire year of 2012 from the united states geological survey usgs website https glovis usgs gov the downloaded images were uploaded to the google earth engine after strip restoration and radiometric calibration using envi version 5 3 finally the processed images were used for water extraction calculations and the other images table 1 provides details of the selected remote sensing images and other data in this study the lake water area was extracted on a google earth engine platform for each image the de clouding and de snowing processes were performed to remove the influence of clouds and snow the extent of the six lakes in the region was also refined by visual interpretation to reduce the partial interference of mountain shadows and artificial features which improved the extraction accuracy of lake water bodies 2 2 2 sentinel 2 images sentinel 2 launched on june 23 2015 is a new program of the european space agency esa wang et al 2016 sentinel 2 images provide four 10 m bands and six 20 m bands which are generally better than landsat series satellites 30 m drusch et al 2012 therefore sentinel 2 msi images were used to validate the accuracy of the water extraction a total of 1030 scenes of sentinel 2 images from june 23 2015 to december 31 2018 were used including 162 scenes from lake hulun 149 scenes from lake dalinuoer 160 scenes from lake daihai 155 scenes from lake hongjinnao 288 scenes from lake hasuhai and 116 scenes from lake wuliangsuhai all sentinel images were downloaded from the google earth engine and the clouds and snow of each image were removed before processing 2 2 3 multi source altimetry data to obtain long term lake water level information this study combined icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetry satellite data and the water level obtained from the official hydroweb website to reconstruct the water level series of the lakes as shown in fig s1 the icesat 1 glah14 datasets available from the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org were used for lake dalinuoer from november 2003 to december 2008 fig s1 the cryosat 2 gdr dataset provided by the esa https science pds cryosat esa int was used for lake dalinuoer from june 2010 to october 2015 in addition hydroweb monthly water level data from october 1992 to december 2018 were used for lake hulun while the data from march 2016 to december 2018 were used for lake dalinuoer fig s1 table 1 hydroweb dataset is an

the dataset has undergone base error corrections for orbital dry wet ionospheric tropospheric polar and solid tides crétaux et al 2011 in addition to eliminate the errors between the altimetric satellite water levels and hydroweb water levels an error correction was added to the icesat 1 and cryosat 2 water levels the detailed process is described in section 3 1 2 2 4 digital elevation model

used to investigate the relationship between lake water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia for the grace and grace fo satellites this study used level 3 data provided by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl german research center gfz and center for space research csr at the university of texas at austin https podaac tools jpl nasa gov drive files because the data processing and algorithms of the three institutions are different the arithmetic mean of the data from the three institutions was beneficial for reducing the noise of the gravity field sakumura et al 2014 therefore the arithmetic means of the three institutions grace and grace fo level 3 rl06 data were used for the final terrestrial water storage anomalies from april 2002 to december 2018 pcr globwb available from sutanudjaja et al 2018 uses process based equations to simulate the water exchange between soil atmosphere and groundwater the pcr globwb v 2 used in this study was a global monthly scale dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 5 which contained the snow water equivalent vegetation canopy water surface water soil water groundwater and anthropogenic water use among others with a period from january 1981 to december 2015 2 2 6 era5 data in this study precipitation evapotranspiration temperature snow water equivalent runoff and vegetation coverage were used as natural drivers to investigate the effects of natural climate change on the water storage changes in lakes in inner mongolia precipitation evapotranspiration temperature snow water equivalent and runoff were derived from the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era5 dataset https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp search type dataset this dataset is advantageous as it has a detailed record of the global atmosphere land surface and waves since 1950 and a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km compared with 80 km for era interim and its temporal resolution was 1 h which is higher compared to era interim dee et al 2011 hersbach et al 2020 the era5 climate factors used in this study were monthly data from january 1989 to december 2018 2 2 7 vegetation coverage variation in vegetation coverage is an important factor in lake water storage change based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi we calculated the vegetation coverage whose value represents the vegetation coverage rate of a certain area detailed calculation process provided in text s1 the gridded daily ndvi dataset was obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate data record cdr of the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr https doi org 10 7289 v5pz56r6 which provides measurements of the surface vegetation coverage activity with a resolution of 0 05 from 1981 to the present vermote et al 2014 2 2 8 human activities this study used urbanization grazing number of goats and sheep coal mining annual coal production and irrigation area of irrigated croplands to represent the effects of human activities on the water storage changes in the lakes urbanization was represented using the global artificial impervious area dataset produced by gong et al 2020 this dataset contains the annual change in the global impervious area from 1985 to 2018 with a spatial resolution of 30 m data on grazing coal mining and irrigation were obtained from the municipal statistical yearbook msyb for each city in inner mongolia the period of these data was consistent with that of the global artificial impervious area data 2 3 method 2 3 1 extraction of lake water area in this study the lake water area was extracted using the modified normalized difference water index mndwi method proposed by xu 2005 based on the normalized difference water index ndwi compared with ndwi mndwi can suppress urban features highlight water body information and distinguish shadows and water bodies more efficiently the mndwi was calculated using equation 1 1 m n d w i ρ green ρ swir ρ green ρ swir where ρ green and ρ swir represent the green and mid infrared bands in landsat 5 7 8 and sentinel 2 remote sensing images respectively the results obtained from the mdnwi method contain considerable interference information so the simple and widely used otsu method ostu et al 1979 which maximizes the inter class variance was used to determine a threshold to separate water bodies and backgrounds du et al 2012 yang et al 2020 yao et al 2019 this method automated the determination of thresholds and greatly overcomes the limitations of single global thresholding pixel grouping and visual inspection were then used to remove the fragmentation noise around the lakes first based on the connected domain method yan et al 2016 the binary images derived from the mndwi and otsu methods were grouped by pixel second the water body groups that were smaller than a certain threshold were removed finally manual visual correction using arcgis 10 6 was performed based on the original remote sensing images from the same period to remove redundant non water information around lakes obtain the target lake water body and calculate its area 2 3 2 calculation of lake water storage changes because the lakes in inner mongolia are generally small among the six major lakes five are small except for lake hulun which is approximately 2 000 km2 the orbit of the altimetry satellite does not cover all the lakes therefore to obtain the 30 years of water storage changes of the six lakes the traditional area water level formula could not be used directly this study used two methods for different lakes to reconstruct the long term series of water storage change information altimetric satellite orbits cover lake hulun and lake dalinuoer e g topex poseidon jason 2 jason 3 icesat 1 cryosat 2 so the area water level empirical formula could be used to estimate the lake water storage changes song et al 2013 the area was calculated from the remote sensing images while hydroweb provided partial monthly water level information for lake hulun and lake dalinuoer these two lakes complete long term water level series from 1989 to 2018 could be reconstructed by combining the hydroweb water levels with icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetry satellite water levels see section 3 1 and fig 3 we calculated the lake water storage changes for the lakes lake daihai lake hasuhai lake hongjiannao and lake wuliangsuhai that have little or no altimetry satellite orbits through the statistical relationship between the area and water storage changes qiao et al 2019 see section 2 3 3 2 and fig 3 2 3 2 1 calculation of lake water storage changes based on area water level lake water storage changes based on the area the water level are calculated using the linear relationship between the area and water level complete information on the water level of lakes is crucial to determine the final changes in water storage here the whole lake water level was reconstructed in a three step process 1 the hydroweb water level was integrated with the icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetric satellite water levels 2 the water level was extended for the periods with no data 3 the water level was interpolated for the missing data months the detailed water level reconstruction process is described in section 3 1 and fig 3 the complete long term water level series was reconstructed for lake hulun and lake dalinuoer subsequently the lake water storage changes were calculated using the following method yuan et al 2018 assuming a historical minimum value of water level h 0 in a lake the water volume v of the lake at a certain time can be calculated in two parts the fixed water volume below the h 0 v 0 and the variation in the water volume above h 0 v a when the difference between the lowest value h 0 and the water level h i reaches h the variation in the water volume above h 0 v a can then be calculated using equations 2 and 3 2 v a h 0 a d h 3 a f h where a and h are the area and water levels above h 0 respectively the area can be further expressed as a function of the water level which can be established by the linear relationship between the area and water level fig 4 2 3 2 2 calculation of lake water storage changes based on area dem the method of calculating the lake water storage changes based on the area dem is essentially applying the area water level empirical formula the area and water level derived from the dem were used to calculate lake water storage changes based on equations 2 and 3 the relationship between the area and water storage changes was then constructed using an empirical formula the empirical formula could then be applied directly to calculate lake water storage changes in the area extracted by landsat imagery from 1989 to 2018 yang et al 2016 used the area dem method to calculate lake water storage changes in five lakes on the tibetan plateau the largest lake namucuo reaches 2020 9 km2 and the smallest lake gyado co is 42 72 km2 with an average error of 4 98 this method was divided into five steps step 1 lake basin dems were extracted based on the hydrosheds basin boundaries step 2 dem was converted to a vector surface with elevation values areas with the same elevation value were merged together using arcgis 10 6 so that the area of each elevation value could be calculated second column of table 2 the lake surface area with elevation hi was calculated by summing the area of each elevation value below hi third column of table 2 thus a series of water levels elevation at intervals of 1 m and their corresponding lake surface areas was obtained table 2 further the statistical relationship between the lake surface area and water levels was calculated fig s2 step 3 using the linear relationship changes in lake water storage at water level intervals of 1 m were calculated based on equations 2 and 3 fourth column of table 2 step 4 because the srtm dem was obtained in 2000 the water level in january 2000 was used as the initial value h0 when the difference between hi and the initial water level h0 is h the water storage changes can be calculated by accumulating all the changes in water storage at water level intervals of 1 m between 0 and h fifth column of table 2 then a relationship between the change in water storage and lake surface area was obtained for a water level difference ofh the statistical relationship between the lake surface area and water storage change was constructed as an empirical formula fig s3 step 5 finally the empirical formula was applied directly to calculate lake water storage changes using the lake surface area extracted by landsat imagery from 1989 to 2018 using lake daihai as an example the correspondence between water level elevation and lake surface area obtained in step 2 is provided in table 2 r2 0 999 p 0 001 where the water level of lake daihai was 1 218 m as per the dem in january 2000 thus the water storage changes in lake daihai relative to the water storage in january 2000 could be calculated using equations 2 and 3 for example the water storage change when the water level reaches 1 221 m is the sum of the water storage change when the water level increases from 1 218 1 219 m 1 219 1 220 m and 1 220 1 221 m therefore an empirical formula between the lake surface area and the water storage change for lake daihai was established and the water storage changes from 1989 to 2018 could be calculated by combining this empirical formula and the lake surface area extracted by landsat imagery 2 3 3 selection of driving factors to systematically analyze the causes of lake water storage changes seven variables including precipitation evapotranspiration runoff temperature snow water equivalent vegetation coverage and artificial impervious area were selected as alternative factors subsequently the most significant factors were screened from these alternative factors combined with linear correlation analysis and random forest methods first the factors that did not pass the significance test were removed by calculating the pearson correlation coefficients between the water storage changes and all the alternative factors second to exclude the influence of additional confounding factors and extract the dominant factors based on the results of the linear correlation analysis the importance of the factors that passed the significance test was ranked using the random forest method edwards et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the results indicate that the higher the importance of the factor the stronger the overall explanation of the factor for the water storage changes and vice versa in addition cross validation was performed for all factors that passed the significance test in the linear correlation analysis to select the appropriate number of driving factors the function of cross validation is to divide the original data to obtain different training sets so that separate sets can be used to train and validate the model this is done to address the problem that the individual testing results are too one sided and the training data are insufficient the model fitting error was obtained through multiple cross validations as the number of factors increased thus the optimal number of main driving factors was selected when the model fitting error reached a minimum the above method can provide a more intuitive reference when significant factors are chosen owing to the relatively small number of factors cross validation does not have sufficient data for training therefore the final number of selected factors must be combined with the final overall variance explanation rate of the random forest model to discriminate the variance explanation rate is the overall explanatory ability of the random forest model constructed using the selected variables for the target variable water storage changes when the variance explanation rate is higher it reflects the critical influences on the water storage changes finally the factors and their numbers corresponding to the highest variance explanation rate were identified as the main factors affecting lake water storage changes 3 results 3 1 reconstruction of long term lake level time series a rigorous water level reconstruction process was designed which included three main steps fig 3 1 integration of hydroweb water levels with altimetric satellite water levels the water level obtained from the icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetric satellites detailed calculation process provided in text s2 could be fused into the hydroweb water level as supplementary data in addition considering that the processing and method of hydroweb water level is different from that of the water level derived from the icesat 1 and cryosat 2 satellites equation 4 was used to eliminate the systematic error between them the water level derived from hydroweb was selected as the reference time series the water level derived from icesat 1 and cryosat 2 at time t i corrected for system differences was obtained as chen and liao 2020 described 4 s e r i e s 2 cor t i s e r i e s 2 ini t i s e r i e s 1 ref s e r i e s 2 ini where s e r i e s 1 ref is the mean value of the water level time series from the reference hydroweb water level s e r i e s 2 ini is the mean value of the icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetric satellite water level time series s e r i e s 2 ini t i and s e r i e s 2 cor t i are the uncorrected and corrected icesat 1 and cryosat 2 altimetric satellite water level time series respectively 2 water levels for the periods with no data were extended because the integrated water level did not cover all the years from 1989 to 2018 the linear relationship between the area and water level was used as an empirical formula to extend the lake water level corresponding to the area in the period without lake water level data bai et al 2020 fig 4 3 for water level interpolation for those months in which the water level was still missing an interpolation method was used to supplement the data due to the comprehensive impact of climate environment and hydrology the lake water level showed a seasonal fluctuation trend in the long term therefore the lake water level can be decomposed into three components seasonal fluctuations linear trends and residuals chen and liao 2020 gao et al 2013 wang et al 2006 based on this theory a residual based interpolation method for the water level is designed as follows the water level is decomposed into three components fig 5 5 h t a b t c s i n π 6 t φ d s i n π 3 t φ v t where h t is the water level in month t a b t is the linear trend c s i n π 6 t φ d s i n π 3 t φ is the seasonal fluctuation v t is the residual a is a constant b is the coefficient of the linear trend c and d are the coefficients of the cyclic seasonal fluctuation and φ is the possible seasonal delay the seasonal fluctuation and linear trend in equation 5 can be fitted using least squares fig 5b and 5e thus the residuals for month t can be calculated using equation 6 6 v t h t a b t c s i n π 6 t φ d s i n π 3 t φ using equation 6 the residual for month t in the original water level was calculated for the entire period fig 5c and 5f a random forest method was used for the obtained residuals to interpolate the values for the missing months stekhoven and buhlmann 2012 and the results are presented in fig 6 a and 6d combining the residual values of the missing months as obtained by interpolation with the seasonal fluctuations and linear trends derived from the least squares fig 6b and 6e the water level of the missing months was inverted using equation 7 7 h t miss a b t miss c s i n π 6 t miss φ d s i n π 3 t miss φ v t miss where h t miss is the water level of the missing month a b c d and φ are the parameters calculated in equation 5 and v t miss is the residual of the missing month obtained by interpolation with the above water level interpolation method the complete monthly water level time series was obtained for lake hulun and lake dalinuoer from 1989 to 2018 fig 6c and 6f 3 2 water area changes and water storage changes of lakes in inner mongolia 3 2 1 temporal variation of these lakes there are two predominant types of lakes in inner mongolia one is formed by crustal tectonic movement named tectonic lakes whose primary water source is external rivers such lakes include lake hulun lake dalinuoer lake daihai and lake hongjiannao the second type is formed by the realignment of yellow river over time oxbow lakes these lakes have no stable external river for water supply they include lake hasuhai and lake wuliangsuhai the long term dynamics of water area changes and water storage changes in these two types of lakes varied significantly for tectonic lakes water area changes and water storage changes were relatively consistent with significant declines throughout the entire study period fig 7 a 7b 7c and 7d the decreasing water area and water storage were 58 km2 with 1 93 km2 yr and 2 01 km3 with 0 067 km3 yr for lake hulun 28 km2 with 0 93 km2 yr and 0 37 km3 with 0 012 km3 yr for lake dalinuoer 66 km2 with 2 2 km2 yr and 0 69 km3 with 0 021 km3 yr for lake daihai 17 km2 with 0 57 km2 yr and 0 297 km3 with 0 01 km3 yr for lake hongjiannao from 1989 to 2018 respectively in particular from 2000 to 2012 the shrinkage of these lakes was substantial fig 7a 7b 7c and 7d in contrast a stable or slightly decreasing trend was observed in the oxbow lakes fig 7e and 7f where the variational water area and water storage were 4 km2 with 0 13 km2 yr and 0 026 km3 with 0 001 km3 yr for lake hasuhai 10 km2 with 0 33 km2 yr and 0 023 km3 with 0 001 km3 yr for lake wuliangsuhai from 1989 to 2018 respectively water area and water storage in six lakes decreased and their changes occurred predominantly within four periods 1989 2000 2000 2012 2012 2016 and 2016 2018 fig 7 3 2 2 spatial variation of these lakes using the lake water area extracted from landsat imagery to map the monthly inundation frequency over 30 years and the inundation area of the six lakes for some years fig 8 there were significant differences in the spatial variation of each lake the inundation frequency of lake hulun is low in the southwest and high near the northeast consistent with fan et al 2021 so the variation in lake hulun was primarily concentrated in the southwest throughout the entire period fig 8a after nearly disappearing in 2012 the southwestern part of lake hulun began to recover at a rapidly increasing rate with water storage in 2016 similar to that in 1989 fig 7a and fig 8a the inundation frequency in eastern lake dalinuoer is lower than that in the central and western regions fig 8b thus the water bodies along its eastern lakeshores would disappear or transform into smaller marshes when the water storage decreased fig 8b the inundation frequency in the northeast and the center of lake daihai is higher than that in the southwest thus the dynamic changes in lake daihai are predominantly concentrated in the southwest and the lakeshores fig 8c from 1989 to 2018 lake daihai shrunk at a visible rate fig 8c lake hongjiannao is a typical indented lake with a low inundation frequency in the lakeshores fig 8d therefore when the lake shrank the water storage of lake hongjiannao decreased almost uniformly toward the center of the lake fig 8d the composition of the water bodies in lake hasuhai was irregular fig 8e when the water storage was sufficient the water bodies in the northwest and southeast were connected fig 8e the water bodies of lake wuliangsuhai were highly irregular and were composed of numerous marshes of different sizes fig 8f the water storage changes in lake wuliangsuhai were almost stable throughout the entire period fig 7f and fig 8f the expansion and shrinkage of lake wuliangsuhai were primarily concentrated in the northeast fig 8f which may be due to the lack of a stable water resource recharge in the northeast the artificial channel is located in the middle and south sections of lake wuliangsuhai fig 1f 3 3 cause analysis to investigate the water storage changes of different lakes in inner mongolia the cause analysis for each lake was performed as follows 3 3 1 key driving factors of lake water storage changes the correlations between the water storage changes and all factors are illustrated in fig 9 precipitation r 0 43 p 0 05 evapotranspiration r 0 58 p 0 001 runoff r 0 58 p 0 001 and snow water equivalent r 0 33 p 0 1 passed the significance test for lake hulun evapotranspiration and runoff were highly correlated with water storage changes while precipitation and snow water equivalent were poorly correlated with water storage changes after excluding the factors that did not pass the significance test using the above method the correlation coefficient of the impact factors was also ranked for the other five lakes and the details are presented in table 3 furthermore based on the results of the linear correlation analysis in the previous step the random forest method was used to obtain the importance ranking of the factors that passed the significance test and the results of the cross validation as shown in fig 10 the results indicate that evapotranspiration runoff and snow water equivalent explain 48 69 of the water storage changes in lake hulun fig 10a runoff and evapotranspiration explained 69 59 of the water storage changes in lake dalinuoer fig 10b artificial impervious areas runoff and vegetation cover accounted for 45 83 of the water storage changes in lake daihai fig 10c artificial impervious areas runoff and vegetation coverage explained 60 47 of the water storage changes in lake hongjiannao fig 10d the artificial impervious area runoff and temperature explained 45 17 of the water storage changes in lake hasuhai fig 10e moreover evapotranspiration precipitation runoff artificial impervious area and snow water equivalent explained 60 47 of the water storage changes in lake wuliangsuhai fig 10f in general evapotranspiration and runoff were the key factors affecting water storage changes in lake hulun and lake dalinuoer the artificial impervious area was the most substantial factor for lake daihai lake hongjiannao and lake hasuhai however the influences of evapotranspiration precipitation runoff and artificial impervious areas on lake wuliangsuhai were relatively balanced the predicted lake water storage changes can be calculated using the random forest method based on the selected factors therefore comparing the predicted lake water storage changes with the actual lake water storage changes original lake water storage changes the accuracy of the random forest model built using the derived factors could be validated fig 11 the results demonstrate that the predicted lake water storage changes are relatively consistent with the valid values r2 0 9 p 0 05 fig 11 which indicates the feasibility of using the random forest to explain lake water storage changes 3 3 2 explanation of key driving factors the key driving factors selected are listed in table 4 the impact factors of the water storage changes for each lake differed significantly for lake hulun runoff r 0 58 p 0 and water storage changes was significantly positively correlated while evapotranspiration r 0 58 p 0 and snow water equivalent r 0 33 p 0 05 were negatively correlated table 4 for lake dalinuoer runoff r 0 74 p 0 was positive for the increase in lake water storage while evapotranspiration r 0 67 p 0 was negative table 4 lake daihai is not only influenced by natural climate change but also responds strongly to human activities for lake daihai the artificial impervious area was significantly negatively correlated to water storage changes r 0 65 p 0 while runoff r 0 61 p 0 and vegetation coverage r 0 33 p 0 08 were significantly positively correlated table 4 for lake hongjiannao artificial impervious area r 0 70 p 0 was the key factor contributing to the decrease in water storage consistent with cao et al 2021 while vegetation coverage r 0 51 p 0 and runoff r 0 42 p 0 02 primarily played a role in delaying the shrinkage of water storage table 4 for lake hasuhai the artificial impervious area r 0 60 p 0 and runoff r 0 63 p 0 exhibited the strongest responses to the water storage changes with significant negative and positive correlations respectively table 4 the temperature r 0 36 p 0 05 was weakly negatively correlated with water storage changes in lake hasuhai table 4 for lake wuliangsuhai there were four driving factors that responded to water storage changes precipitation r 0 58 p 0 and runoff r 0 63 p 0 were positive for the increase in lake water storage while evapotranspiration r 0 58 p 0 and artificial impervious areas r 0 51 p 0 were negative table 4 in general among these existing factors evapotranspiration and runoff among natural climate change and artificial impervious areas among human activities have significant effects on lake water storage changes however due to the limitation of data sources we could not consider the influence of more factors on the water storage changes such as anthropogenic water withdrawal from the lakes yellow river pumping and other factors that can affect the water storage of lakes therefore to have a deeper understanding of the causes of lake water storage changes other factors are discussed in section 4 2 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis this study used two methods to calculate the lake water storage changes the lake water area is used in both methods and directly affects the results thus ensuring high accuracy of the extracted lake water area is critical for the reconstructed water level the hydroweb water level established by legos is reliable crétaux et al 2011 the accuracy of the reconstructed water level primarily depends on the accuracy of the water level interpolation therefore the validation of the water level interpolation is also essential in addition the method for calculating the lake water storage changes based on area dem has been applied universally and the validation can be found in qiao et al 2019 and yang et al 2016 4 1 1 accuracy of extracted lake water area the lake water areas of six lakes extracted from sentinel 2 images and landsat imagery were compared and the results are displayed in fig 12 the correlation coefficient r2 and mean relative error mre were used to evaluate the final results the lake water area extracted from landsat imagery was almost the same as that extracted from the sentinel 2 images r2 0 9 mre 2 fig 12 this indicates that the lake water areas extracted from landsat imagery are reliable 4 1 2 accuracy of water level interpolation the accuracy of the water level interpolation was evaluated using the following steps first the months of missing values were removed from the original water level data to construct a continuous time series this continuous time series was used as the reference dataset second a testing dataset was constructed by randomly removing the continuous time series data at a specific rate the same as the missing rate of the original water level finally a random forest interpolation method was applied to the testing dataset and the results were compared with those of the reference dataset the root mean square error rmse was used to evaluate accuracy the results are presented in fig 13 compared with the rmse of 0 26 m for the water level of lake hulun which was derived based on altimetric satellites by yuan et al 2018 the rmse values for our results are only 0 151 m for lake hulun and 0 093 m for lake dalinuoer based on the water level interpolation fig 13 indicating that the interpolation method for the water level is feasible 4 2 other driving factors of lake water storage changes in section 3 3 several dominant factors affect the water storage changes of six lakes in inner mongolia including natural and anthropogenic factors some lakes were significantly affected by human activities e g lake hasuhai lake daihai and lake hongjiannao fig 10 therefore in order to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of human activities on lake water storage changes the driving factors used in zhou et al 2019 to analyze lake water area changes in the mongolian plateau were referenced in this study including irrigation grazing and coal mining therefore irrigation grazing and coal mining were extended to the random forest model as representative human activity factors however because the statistical yearbook could not provide complete data for all cities irrigation and grazing data were collected for lake hulun lake dalinuoer and lake hasuhai in contrast coal mining data were collected only for lake hulun and lake dalinuoer after adding irrigation grazing and coal mining the random forest model was used to perform a contribution analysis of the lake water storage changes once again the variance explanation rate obtained from the random forest model was significantly improved the variance explanation rate reached 85 51 for lake hulun and over 70 for the other lakes fig 14 d 14e and 14f this suggests that the contribution of human activities irrigation grazing and coal mining to the water storage changes of lakes in inner mongolia is critical tao et al 2015 for lake hulun lake dalinuoer and lake hasuhai the impact of human activities exceeds climate change the effects of irrigation grazing and coal mining on lake water storage changes in inner mongolia were also substantial over long periods fig 14a 14b and 14c firstly for lake hulun grazing increased from 2 74 million to 10 18 million with an annual growth rate of 316 040 head yr from 1989 to 2015 fig 14a and the irrigation area increased from 7 36 million mu 1 mu 666 67 m2 in 1989 to 29 29 million mu in 2017 with an annual growth rate of 819 000 mu yr fig 14a this evidence suggests that the rapid growth of irrigation and grazing are critical factors in the dramatic shrinkage of lake hulun interestingly the changes in coal mining and water storage changes in lake hulun present an opposite trend over all four periods 1989 2000 2000 2012 2012 2016 and 2016 2018 fig 14a this indicates that the rapid development of coal mining in the lake hulun region has greatly limited the expansion of water storage and has led to a sharp shrinkage of the lake shen et al 2021 found that the process of coal mining generates artificial extraction of groundwater which leads to a reduction in groundwater reserves and a decline in the local vegetation coverage as a result the shrinkage of lake hulun occurred because of a lack of groundwater recharge secondly for lake dalinuoer coal mining increased from 9 51 million tons in 1989 to 34 6 million tons in 2013 with an annual growth rate of 1 03 mt yr fig 14b the annual growth increased from 6 52 million head from 1989 to 12 07 million head in 2016 with an annual growth rate of 178 800 head yr fig 14b and the annual growth rate of the irrigation area from 1989 to 2018 was 1 457 900 mu yr fig 14b this evidence indicates that during the continuous shrinkage of lake dalinuoer agriculture and industry developed rapidly as a result a large portion of the water resources of lake dalinuoer were consumed which lead to a rapid decrease in lake storage previous studies have demonstrated that the water consumption for agricultural irrigation and water harvesting from groundwater may be other factors causing lake shrinkage in the agricultural area of inner mongolia blanc et al 2014 tao et al 2015 which is consistent with the findings of this study finally for lake hasuhai the irrigation area and grazing numbers increased slowly fig 14c their annual growth rates were 50 300 and 46 600 head yr from 1989 to 2018 respectively fig 14c these two factors contributed to the slow shrinkage of lake hasuhai especially grazing which exhibited a completely opposite trend to the water storage changes in 1989 2015 and 2015 2018 fig 14c therefore agriculture and livestock development inhibit the expansion of water storage in lake hasuhai synthesizing the results presented in section 3 3 we found that these six lakes in inner mongolia were the most significantly affected by human activities the most dominant factors were grazing for lake hulun fig 14d coal mining for lake dalinuoer fig 14e artificial impervious area for lake daihai fig 10c artificial impervious area for lake hongjiannao fig 10d and irrigation for lake hasuhai fig 14f although the artificial impervious area is not the most dominant factor for lake wuliangsuhai its importance is comparable to those of the first three factors fig 10f in contrast natural factors play a supporting role therefore controlling the impact of human activities on lakes is the most substantial measure to ensure the recovery of lake water storage in inner mongolia 4 3 relationship between lake water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies the dynamics of lakes play a key role in terrestrial water storage anomalies jiang et al 2020 demonstrated a highly consistent relationship between lake water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies in the tibetan plateau and the relationship between the water storage changes in six lakes and the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia was investigated in time and space the terrestrial water storage anomalies for inner mongolia from 1989 to 2018 were obtained from the grace satellite 2002 2018 and the pcr globwb hydrological model 1989 2015 the terrestrial water storage anomalies calculated by grace called grace twsa and terrestrial water storage anomalies calculated by pcr globwb called pcr twsa were highly consistent during 2002 2015 demonstrating the same trend and minor numerical differences r2 0 75 p 0 001 fig 15 hence integrating grace twsa and pcr twsa for analysis is feasible temporally the water storage changes of the six lakes and the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia were highly consistent figs 15 and 16 present the relationship between the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia and the water storage changes of the six lakes the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia have been decreasing over the last 30 years with an overall decrease rate of 3 18 mm yr for grace twsa and 3 64 mm yr for pcr twsa fig 15 the same changes also occurred in these lakes of inner mongolia where the total water storage of these lakes is continuously decreasing with an overall decrease rate of 0 11 km3 yr from 1989 to 2018 fig 15 the variation trends of the lake water storage changes and those of terrestrial water storage anomalies are consistent with r2 of 0 48 p 0 01 for grace twsa and water storage changes and 0 89 p 0 001 for pcr twsa and water storage changes from 1989 to 2018 in addition to better describe the relationship between the terrestrial water storage anomalies and lake water storage changes the divisional correlation coefficient was also used to quantitatively explain their connection fig 15 from the results we found that the water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies were highly consistent before 2012 with r2 of 0 88 p 0 001 for the grace twsa and water storage changes and 0 93 p 0 001 for the pcr twsa and water storage changes fig 15 however the correlation of the water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies became weak with r2 of 0 01 p 0 05 for the grace twsa and water storage changes and 0 38 p 0 05 for the pcr twsa and water storage changes after 2012 fig 15 this is because lake hulun as the largest lake in inner mongolia contributes the most to the lake water storage changes 60 2 of the total water storage changes therefore the expansion of lake hulun after 2012 fig 7a would have a significant impact on the trend of the total lake water storage changes spatially the water storage changes of the six lakes and the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia were also highly consistent fig 16 from 2002 to 2018 the terrestrial water storage anomalies in southern inner mongolia significantly decreased it slightly increased in the northeast similar to the spatial variations in lake water storage changes fig 16a notably the terrestrial water storage anomalies in the lake hulun region had decreased however the water storage of lake hulun exhibited an increasing trend with an annual growth rate of 0 007 km3 yr from 2002 to 2018 fig 16a considering that the water storage recovery in lake hulun after 2012 fig 7a impacted the total water storage changes the relationship between the terrestrial water storage anomalies and water storage changes in the lake hulun region from 2012 to 2018 is shown in fig 16b the terrestrial water storage anomalies in the lake hulun region increased from 2012 to 2018 fig 16b especially in the eastern region of this area fig 16b the water storage of lake hulun was also increasing with an annual growth rate of 0 069 km3 yr from 2012 to 2018 fig 16b in addition from 1989 to 2015 the spatial variation in the water storage changes of the six lakes and the terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia were consistent for example a significant decrease in the terrestrial water storage anomalies occurred in the lake hulun region and the lake water storage decreased significantly fig s4 in general lake water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies were consistent in inner mongolia from 1989 to 2018 the contribution of total lake water storage changes to terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia is critical 5 conclusions based on landsat imagery altimetric satellites hydroweb water level and dem changes in the water area and water storage in six major lakes in inner mongolia were analyzed over the past 30 years in general these lakes can be divided into two types one type is a tectonic lake demonstrating a significant downward trend the annual decreasing water storage rates were 0 067 km3 yr for lake hulun 0 012 km3 yr for lake dalinuoer 0 021 km3 yr for lake daihai and 0 01 km3 yr for lake hongjiannao from 1989 to 2018 the other type is oxbow lakes they fluctuate smoothly the annual rate of water storage changes in both lake hasuhai and lake wuliangsuhai was 0 001 km3 yr from 1989 to 2018 spatially the variations in each lake reflect different characteristics and the locations of shrinkage expansion varied for each lake in addition linear correlation analysis and random forest analysis were combined to determine the driving factors of lake water storage change the results indicate that human activities are the predominant factors driving lake water storage changes especially grazing irrigation and coal mining which explained 85 51 85 34 and 72 69 of the water storage changes for lakes hulun dalinuoer and hasuhai respectively natural factors only played a supporting role and the impacts of evaporation and runoff were the most substantial finally the relationship between the water storage changes of the six lakes and terrestrial water storage anomalies in inner mongolia was discussed there was good agreement in the temporal and spatial variations between the lake water storage changes and terrestrial water storage anomalies especially before 2012 r2 0 88 p 0 001 for the grace twsa and water storage changes and r2 0 93 p 0 001 for the pcr twsa and water storage changes our study still has limitations which are mainly reflected in two points first the grazing irrigation and coal mining used for cause analysis did not cover all lakes leading to one sided results in our analysis second the extraction algorithm for the lake surface area can be further improved using the currently popular machine learning and deep learning for image classification and extracting lake masks from the classification images may further improve the confidence of our results in recent decades with the aggravation of drought in inner mongolia the shrinkage of lakes has also intensified coupled with the rapid development of local industry and agriculture the reasons for the dynamics of lakes have become complex and diverse for the first time we studied six major lakes in inner mongolia and systematically analyzed the causes of these changes from water storage changes the findings can provide a basis for local lake water resource management decision making and future analysis of the dynamic evolution of the lakes our method provides a practical example of using multi mission satellite data for estimating water storage

3376,the risk of urban inundation has been increasing worldwide the integrated green gray blue iggb drainage system is considered to have great potential in urban areas as it has not only the resilience and sustainability of green and blue infrastructure but also the reliability of gray infrastructure on stormwater drainage this study aims to identify whether there is synergistic effect in iggb drainage system and how to optimize it an automatic optimization tool is needed for scenario generation and optimal decision making because of the diversity complicacy and decentrality of iggb drainage system so far existing optimization frameworks focus on green infrastructure which cannot be applied to explore synergistic effect of iggb drainage system this paper proposed an integrated framework to combine hydrological model and optimization algorithm based on this framework seven optimization strategies including green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue were established with the optimization objectives of flood risk reduction rate frrr life cycle cost lcc and land occupied lo a case study was conducted in dongying shandong province china based on the pareto fronts of the seven optimization strategies the average frrrs of green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue strategy under the 24 hour rainfall with 30 year return period are 56 0 7 7 14 5 66 1 78 3 18 4 and 85 5 respectively the green gray blue strategy shows the best performance then the existence of synergistic effect in iggb drainage system is confirmed the synergistic effect of green gray green blue and green gray blue optimization strategies was 5 7 9 7 and 10 6 respectively however synergistic effect was not generated in the gray blue optimization strategy in this study the synergistic effect is influenced by the hydrological mechanism of synergistic effect and the law of diminishing marginal utility the results provide more evidence for the outstanding performance of the green gray blue integrated urban drainage system and provide technical support and greater clarity to decision makers on how to integrate the green gray and blue infrastructure keywords urban inundation integrated green gray blue drainage system synergistic effect multi objective optimization 1 introduction a large scale urbanization is unfolding around the world liu et al 2019 a large amount of natural surface is covered by urban impermeable surfaces which prevents rainwater from infiltrating into the ground the total amount of runoff and peak flow has surged causing urban inundation which is a severe challenge at present oudin et al 2018 in the context of climate change the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events have shown an increasing trend which has exacerbated the risk of urban inundation hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 the traditional mode of urban separated stormwater drainage system includes stormwater pipe networks pumping stations and storage tanks etc dong et al 2017 it is called gray infrastructure because it is composed predominantly of concrete and steel tavakol davani et al 2015 gray infrastructure is generally placed in underground spaces with a single goal of rapidly draining rainwater out of the city however if urban districts upstream drain stormwater too quickly it may cause urban flooding downstream brears 2018 meanwhile a large amount of rainwater is directly drained away without effective use green infrastructure proposed as a supplement to traditional gray infrastructure is a decentralized stormwater management practice which emphasis on stormwater management at the source simulating the natural hydrological cycle regulating the hydrological cycle process in urbanized areas and reducing stormwater runoff li et al 2019 casal campos et al 2018 green infrastructure can also provide a variety of environmental ecological economic and social benefits or services hansen and pauleit 2014 including mitigating runoff pollution mitigating cso regulating microclimate increasing biodiversity enhancing carbon sequestration via vegetation landscaping etc however as a source control infrastructure green infrastructure has some drawbacks in mitigating the risk of urban flooding the installation of green infrastructure often requires space which can be very limited in intensely developing catchments so the design objective for green infrastructure is usually based on small and medium rainfall events palanisamy and chui 2015 the design objective of green infrastructure usually is the water quality volume wqv nordman et al 2018 o sullivan et al 2015 wqv is employed so that only portion of the runoff i e first flush will be treated and captured by green infrastructure and the remaining runoff should be bypassed lee et al 2010 for example the objective of wqv in michigan united states is 0 8 1 0 in nordman et al 2018 wang et al 2020 conducted an evaluation of status of the implementation of green infrastructure in chinese sponge city and showed that the flood inundation prevention capacity of green infrastructure only accounts for 13 8 of the entire urban drainage system blue infrastructure generally refers to large wetlands ponds or water bodies in cities blue infrastructure is usually large and located at the end of the catchment used to store the excessive stormwater runoff which stormwater pipes cannot handle and thus alleviate urban flooding some definitions incorporate blue infrastructure into green infrastructure as they are both natural solutions ghofrani et al 2017 the term blue green infrastructure bgi is also used albeit less frequently richard et al 2018 the combination of green gray blue infrastructure has received some attention the reliability resilience and sustainability are considered the three key elements for evaluating the robustness of urban drainage systems butler et al 2016 the integration of green gray blue infrastructure has advantages in this regard joyce et al 2018 constructed a resilience metric to predict the adaptive capacity of a green gray blue drainage system under extreme weather events casal campos et al 2018 analyzed a number of gray green and green gray combined scenarios and pointed out that the gray infrastructure strategy has the limitations of lacking resilience and sustainability in economy environment and society by implementing hybrid strategies that combine green and gray solutions these limitations have been overcome haghighatafshar et al 2017 evaluated a blue green renovation project and found that the green retrofits upstream reduced the peak flows and leveled out the runoff which is a substantial advantage for downstream pipe bound catchments alves et al 2019 pointed out through a series of scenario analysis that a mix of green blue and gray infrastructure is likely to result in the best adaptation strategy as these three alternatives tend to complement each other with the best effect on flood risk reduction and provide a variety of comprehensive benefits more studies are needed to focus on how to integrate green gray and blue infrastructure for urban stormwater management to more effectively manage urban flood risks and meanwhile achieve a variety of comprehensive benefits although the above mentioned research has made some effective and positive progress and conclusions on the combination of green gray and blue infrastructure the synergistic effect among green gray and blue infrastructure has not been much discussed whether there is synergistic effect between integration of facilities and the sum of individual facility integrated benefits sum of individual benefits and how to optimize the synergistic effect to achieve the maximum benefit at minimum cost have not been discussed in depth besides the limited scenario analysis methods can no longer meet the needs of decision makers and multi stakeholders for maximizing comprehensive benefits new method is to obtain the pareto front solutions by introducing an optimization algorithm and performing automatic search on huge number of alternatives so far relevant studies have focused on optimizing the type size and location of green or blue infrastructure at different scales eckart et al 2018 huang et al 2018 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the parameters of gray infrastructure are usually used as invariant condition not decision variables although bakhshipour et al 2019 tried the optimization of a mixed green blue gray decentralized urban drainage system its optimization strategy was carried out in two steps which not under the same multi objective optimization framework first the gray infrastructure was optimized and then the green blue infrastructure was optimized meanwhile the type and size of green infrastructure and blue infrastructure is not considered in the optimization scheme only the location of green infrastructure and blue infrastructure is optimized there is still a lack of an optimization framework to achieve the overall optimum integration of green gray and blue infrastructure bakhshipour et al 2019 above all this study tries to analyze the mechanism of synergistic effect of the integration of green gray and blue infrastructure furthermore this study tries to propose a multi objective simulation optimization framework to integrate hydrological model and optimization algorithm seven optimization strategies including green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue are establish based on case study to compare and analyze the optimization results and synergistic effect of them under the same optimization objective functions to provide technical support and greater clarity to decision makers to make better informed choices to the layout and design of urban drainage system 2 methodology the overall framework of this study is shown in fig 1 firstly a method to analyze the hydrological mechanism of synergistic effect of iggb drainage system is proposed secondly a multi objective optimization model was established to explore synergistic effect among green gray and blue infrastructure thirdly the pareto fronts of optimization strategies and the synergistic effect of green gray and blue infrastructure were analyzed fig 1 illustrates mechanism by which synergies occur different composition of urban drainage system and different distribution of individual facilities could lead to different spatial temporal urban hydrological process this will result in different allocations of stormwater runoff thus this will have an impact on urban flood risk the aformentioned mechanism provide the theoretical basis for the generation of synergistic effect however there is still a need for quantitative support on whether the integration of facilities will mutually enhance the effectiveness of flood risk control of individual facilities in order to understand the synergistic effect with a comprehensive perspective a simulation optimization model was established a mathematical model including the decision variables objective functions and constraints was established based on the actual optimization problem the decision variables were the key design parameters of different facilities of green gray and blue infrastructure the decision variables of green infrastructure are type size and location while gray and blue infrastructure are size assuming that the location and type are determined two optimization objectives maximization of flood risk reduction rate and minimization of life cycle cost were selected as optimization objectives huang et al 2018 aminjavaheri and nazif 2017 wang et al 2017 moreover compared with gray infrastructure the main difficulty for promotion of green and blue infrastructure in urban area is the occupation of land palanisamy and chui 2015 wild et al 2017 especially in highly urbanized areas considering the availability of space and the value of the land land occupation is also a key factor that decision makers have to face although it is advocated that green and blue infrastructure practices should be implemented as much as possible in urban area it is reasonable that the scenario which achieve more multi benefits with less occupation of land is better than those occupy more land as projects with less renovation are easier to implement therefore the minimization of land occupied by green and blue infrastructure is taken as the third optimization objective the characteristics advantages and limitations of the three types of infrastructure and the trade off of corresponding objectives are shown in fig 2 volume capture ratio of annual rainfall vcrar of green infrastructure was considered as a constraint vcrar is one of the design standards of green infrastructure proposed by the chinese sponge city strategy and it usually corresponds to wqv li et al 2018 meanwhile the suitability indices are constructed based on the site conditions of study area mainly including land use type slope building buffer hydrologic soil groups reduction factor the maximum of decision variables are restricted based on the suitability indices the python based hydrological model framework called pyswmm mcdonnell et al 2020 and a python based genetic algorithm framework called geatpy g core team 2020 are integrated to conduct the optimization process of this study the application programming interfaces were implemented by using python programming language 2 1 study area the study area is located in dongying city northeast of shandong province china the selected catchment is located in the built up part with a total area of 395 88 ha dongying city has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 550 600 mm the time distribution of precipitation is uneven most of precipitation is concentrated in summer the rainfall from july to august accounts for about half of the annual rainfall the urban drainage system is under great pressure in summer and it is easy to cause flood disasters soil type of study area is hydrologic soil group c the location land use dem and drainage system of the study area are shown in fig 3 data sources are shown in table 1 2 2 establishment and calibration of hydrological model the study catchment was divided into 25 sub catchments swmm model of the study area was established stormwater pipe network was reasonably simplified to 24 pipelines and 24 nodes first of all combined adjacent pipelines of the same diameter without branches on the same straight road second nodes were set at the joints of pipe segments of different diameter and road bends third the overall topology of the pipe network model was checked to ensure that it is consistent with the topology before simplification the topological relationship of the sub catchments and stormwater pipe network are shown in fig 4 to better simulate stormwater pipe network overflow and street flooding in a realistic manner a dual drainage model fig 5 was used by setting streets as channel objects into the swmm model which takes into account not only the runoff through the stormwater pipe network but also the runoff on the surface randall et al 2017 parameters setting of various green infrastructure in surface layer soil layer pavement layer drainage mat layer storage layer and drain layer were referred to chui et al 2016 and huang et al 2018 as shown in table 2 the stormwater pond was set as the storage unit in swmm model the swmm model in the study area was calibrated by using historical rainfall data of typhoon rumbia fig 6 the statistical period of typhoon rumbia is from 0 00 to 24 00 on august 19 2018 and the total rainfall is 270 5 mm two streets inundation depth were continuously monitored at 0 5 hour interval the 24 hour rainfall with 30 year return period was used as design rainfall for optimizing usage total rainfall of which is 195 3 mm and the time history distribution of 24 hour rainfall was carried out by using the chicago hydrology method silveira 2016 fig 6 the calibration results of the two monitoring points are shown in fig 7 the nash efficiency coefficients of the two water accumulation points are 0 75 and 0 85 respectively which shows that the established swmm model can basically characterize the rainfall runoff process and the street inundation process in the study area 2 3 mathematization of optimization problem 2 3 1 optimization algorithm in the past optimization practice of green infrastructure the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ⅱ nsga ⅱ was the most widely used wang et al 2020 which was based on the crowded comparison operator deb et al 2002 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii based on reference point selection operator proposed by deb and jain 2014 and fellow et al 2014 to solve the many objective more than three optimization problem was used in this study nsga iii following nsga ⅱ framework which maintains the diversity of the population by introducing widely distributed reference points which was able to successfully find a well converged pareto front under many objective optimization problems deb and jain 2014 2 3 2 decision variables three kinds of commonly used green infrastructure were selected in this study including green roofs permeable pavements and bioretention sells the type size and location of these green infrastructure devices were used as decision variables for gray infrastructure this study took stormwater pipes as the main optimization objects the diameter of which were used as decision variables for blue infrastructure stormwater pond was proposed to collect inundation water from streets in view of that blue infrastructure was usually located in low lying areas and required large open space the location of the stormwater pond was determined in advance through the land use and the dem which was set as a fixed value in optimization model the volume of the stormwater pond was used as decision variable the decision variables were expressed as follows 1 x a ij i 1 3 j 1 25 d k k 1 24 v p where x is the vector of decision variables of simulated scenario the number i represents the type of green infrastructure the number j represents the sub catchment and aij represents the area of green infrastructure i in sub catchment j the number k represents the stormwater pipe and dk represents the diameter of stormwater pipe k vp represents the volume of stormwater pond 2 3 3 objective functions multi objective optimization has become a popular method that has tradeoff solutions liu et al 2016 as mentioned above this study took flood risk reduction rate life cycle cost and land occupied as the optimization objectives to optimize the urban drainage systems 1 flood risk reduction rate frrr the flood risk reduction rate frrr was calculated using eq 2 2 fr fd l r fr x f r b f r x fr b 100 where number l represents the street fdl represents the maximum flooding depth of street l which was obtained from the results of the swmm model and fr represents the flood risk of the simulated scenario frb represents the flood risk of baseline scenario fr x represents the flood risk of the simulated scenario x rfr x represents frrr of simulated scenario x 2 life cycle cost lcc life cycle cost lcc is defined as the process of determining the sum of all expenses associated with the complete life cycle of a product system including material acquisition installation operation maintenance and disposal cost xu et al 2019 lcc was calculated using eq 3 3 l c c x lcc green x lcc grey x lcc blue x where lcc x represents lcc of simulated scenario x lccgreen x represents lcc of green infrastructure in simulated scenario x lccgray x represents lcc of gray infrastructure in simulated scenario x lccblue x represents lcc of blue infrastructure in simulated scenario x the lccs of green infrastructure gray infrastructure and blue infrastructure were calculated using eq 4 4 lcc green x i 1 3 j 1 25 ulcc i a ij lcc gray x ulcc d k l k lcc blue x ulcc p v p where ulcci represents the unit life cycle cost ulcc of green infrastructure i ulccdk represents the ulcc of stormwater pipe k with diameter dk gray infrastructure lk represents the length of stormwater pipe k ulccp represents the ulcc of stormwater pond blue infrastructure life cycle and lcc of green gray and blue infrastructure often have a significant range of uncertainty the calculation methods of lcc and ulcc in this study were referred to mei et al 2018 the replacement cost was not taken into account in the construction cost lcc and ulcc were calculated using eq 5 5 lcc c c c o m c s c o m t 0 n f r t c o m t f r t 1 1 r t c s f r n 1 1 n c o m 0 c o m 0 p c c where cc is the construction cost in the initial period c o m is the operation and maintenance cost cs salvage value f r t is the present value factor of discount rate r in year t c o m t is the operation and maintenance cost in year t f r n is the present value factor of discount rate r in the end year n of the design life p is the ratio of operation and maintenance cost to construction cost the construction cost of different device was referred to mohurd 2018 parameter assumptions for life cycle calculation of different device are shown in table 3 3 land occupied lo the land occupied lo was calculated using eq 6 6 l x a ij v p d p where l x represents lo of simulated scenario x d p represents the average depth of stormwater pond which was set to 3 m in this study 2 3 4 constraints some suitability indices are considered as the constraints to identify suitable locations to locate green infrastructure the area of the suitable locations of each green infrastructure practice in each sub catchment is the maximum of decision variables the threshold values of each green infrastructure practice are determined based on the site conditions of each sub catchment the factors that should be considered include land use dem slope hydrologic soil groups permeability building buffer etc specific constraints of each green infrastructure are shown in table 4 it could be noted that green roofs are subject to the bearing capacity of roofs and the occupation of roof equipment however it was impossible to confirm which parts have the problem mentioned above from the land use map without more information therefore a reduction factor was set as the basis for determining the threshold of the green roofs according to a summary of municipal green roof policy in different countries requirements of green roof coverage is 20 70 shiah 2011 so the reduction factor of green roof is set as 0 7 in this study similar problems exist in locating of permeable pavement which are not suitable for the motorway with large traffic restricted by load bearing permeable pavement is generally set in non motorized lanes according to a 2019 statistical yearbook of china non motorized lanes take up 20 30 of the road area in several provinces national bureau of statistics prc 2019 so the reduction factor of permeable pavement is set as 0 3 in this study regarding the stormwater pipe network the design standard of urban stormwater pipe network is generally low due to the rapid urbanization in china in recent years wang et al 2020 therefore in the optimization process the current diameter of stormwater pipe was taken as the minimum value moreover the diameter of downstream pipe was limited to be no less than that of the upstream pipe for stormwater ponds the threshold is determined based on the available space at selected location one goal of green infrastructure is to keep rainwater in the site as much as possible before it enters to stormwater pipe network therefore green infrastructure in cities is rigid demand in terms of protecting and restoring the natural hydrological cycle therefore this study took vcrar as another constraint which is one of the design standards for green infrastructure in china mohurd 2014 vcrar was calculated based on the analysis of long series daily rainfall statistics for years and is used to determine the overall size of all green infrastructure practices it refers to the percentage of the total annual rainfall within the site that is controlled by green infrastructure not discharged to stormwater pipe network in the whole year vcrar of dongying city is 75 85 mohurd 2014 the topological relationship of the stormwater pipe network was constrained to ensure that the diameter of the downstream stormwater pipe was not less than that of the upstream stormwater pipe in addition the stormwater pipe was only allowed to increase two grades on the basis of the current pipe diameter constraints were expressed as follow 7 0 a ij m a x a ij d k d k o 200 d up d down α 75 where a ij represents the area of green infrastructure i in sub catchment j max a ij represents the maximum area of green infrastructure i in sub catchment j calculated by the suitability indices dk represents the diameter of stormwater pipe k dk o represents the original diameter of stormwater pipe k dup represents the diameter of upstream stormwater pipe ddown represents the diameter of downstream stormwater pipe α represents the vcrar 2 4 simulation optimization model integration swmm model and nsga iii algorithm were integrated to optimize three optimization strategies of green green gray green gray blue and to generate pareto front solutions the flowchart of simulation optimization model integration process is shown in fig 8 first to mathematize the actual optimization problem and determine the decision variables objective functions and constraints of the optimization problem as mentioned above second to set the initial value of the decision variables third to set the parameters of the swmm model and the nsga iii algorithm itself respectively and then carry out the integrated simulation optimization model the optimization algorithm was used to generate sample populations of decision variable scenarios and compute the objective functions to obtain optimal results while the swmm model was used to help computing the objective functions with the sample populations created by optimization algorithm when the number of iterations reached the set maximum value the simulation optimization model ends and finally the pareto front solutions were obtained 3 results 3 1 pareto front results the initial population size of the optimization algorithm was set as 2000 and the number of iterations was 150 a total of 300 000 sample populations were calculated for each strategy the pareto front solutions under green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue optimization strategies are shown in fig 9 the results show that under the same optimization objective function and constraints frrr of the seven strategies is rank in the order of green gray blue strategy green blue strategy green gray strategy green strategy blue strategy gray strategy especially in all the optimizing strategies which include green infrastructure the results show that under the conditions of the same objective function values of lcc and lo frrr of the four strategies is rank in the order of green gray blue strategy green blue strategy green gray strategy green strategy fig 9 b the results indicate that there is significant benefit in using the integrated optimization strategies 3 2 synergistic effect analysis further statistical analysis was conducted on these pareto front points as shown in fig 10 the average frrr of green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue optimization strategies are 56 0 7 7 14 5 66 1 78 3 18 4 and 85 5 respectively synergistic effect was analyzed as shown in fig 11 the sum of the average frrr of gray and blue strategy is 22 2 and the average frrr of gray blue strategy is 18 4 the sum of the average frrr of green and gray strategy is 63 7 and the average frrr of green gray strategy is 66 1 the sum of the average frrr of green and blue strategy is 71 0 and the average frrr of green blue strategy is 78 3 the sum of the average frrr of green gray and blue strategy is 78 2 and the average frrr of green gray blue strategy is 85 5 the synergistic effect of green gray green blue and green gray blue optimization strategies is 5 7 9 7 and 10 6 respectively however synergistic effect is not generated in the gray blue optimization strategy in this study 4 discussion 4 1 potential mitigation of urban inundation via green gray blue urban drainage systems in this study a simulation optimization framework based on swmm model and nsga iii algorithm is proposed to carry out the urban drainage system optimization for inundation prevention and control which provides an effective trade off tool for decision makers and stakeholders based on this framework green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue strategies were established and the optimization results confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of green gray blue strategy as it had the best flood risk control effect and the largest synergistic effect in previous studies gray infrastructure was usually used as the invariant condition not the decision variable of the model which ignored the potential synergistic effect of urban drainage system 4 2 factors affecting synergistic effect of urban drainage system the synergistic effect was generated in green gray green blue and green gray blue optimization strategies but not generated in gray blue optimization strategy in this study these results were mainly influenced by two factors of the aformentioned hydrological mechanism of synergistic effect and the law of diminishing marginal utility from the hydrological mechanism of synergistic effects there are synergies in all the integrated optimization strategies that include green infrastructure it is because green infrastructure is distributed in each sub catchment which effectively regulate the hydrological process at the source which provides the greatest hydrological possibility for the generation of synergistic effects however gray and blue strategy are generally end of pipe or terminal treatment the regulation effect on the hydrological process of early surface runoff is limited and the ability to achieve synergistic effect is limited some extent the result of this study shows that gray strategy achieves the lowest frrr of the seven strategies fig 10 it should be noted that this result does not mean that the pipe network has the lowest flood risk control capacity it can be explained by the law of diminishing marginal utility take green and gray infrastructure as an example fig 12 the gray infrastructure pipe network is optimized on the basis of existing background conditions which is located in the middle or back segment of the marginal benefit curve with low marginal benefit green infrastructure is grown from scratch which is located in the front segment of the marginal benefit curve with high marginal benefit this is another reason why gray blue strategy did not generate synergies 4 3 limitations and future research directions this study has some limitations for swmm model calibration and validation this study used a dual drainage model which set the street as channel objects into the swmm model in the case of no flow monitoring data of pipeline but the street inundation depth data this approach increases the uncertainty of the swmm model however the goal of this study was the trade off among green gray blue infrastructure and synergistic effect of their integrated patterns and all scenarios were carried out under the same baseline conditions so the results are still highly reliable moreover the uncertain impact of future climate change and urban development were not considered is this study ghodsi et al 2019 studied the optimization of green infrastructure based on climate change scenarios liu et al 2016 and liu et al 2017 studied the optimization of green infrastructure based on future scenarios of land use change and climate change studies considering future uncertainties are still focused on green infrastructure at present and the optimization of green gray blue strategy based on future scenarios is the further research direction 5 conclusions with the purpose of identifying synergistic effect in urban drainage system for urban inundation control this study established a multi objective simulation optimization framework of urban drainage system to integrate hydrological model and optimization algorithm based on this framework seven optimization strategies of green gray blue green gray green blue and green gray blue were analyzed and the optimization results of flood risk reduction rate life cycle cost and land occupied were obtained based on a case study in dongying china the conclusions can be derived as following under the same optimization objective function and constraints flood risk reduction rate of the seven strategies is rank in the order of green gray blue strategy green blue strategy green gray strategy green strategy blue strategy gray strategy in the whole objective functions value space the average flood risk reduction rates of green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue optimization strategies are 56 0 7 7 14 5 66 1 78 3 18 4 and 85 5 respectively the green gray blue strategy shows the best performance the synergistic effect of green gray green blue and green gray blue optimization strategies was 5 7 9 7 and 10 6 respectively however synergistic effect was not generated in the gray blue optimization strategy in this study synergistic effect of urban drainage system was affected by hydrological mechanism of synergistic effect and the law of diminishing marginal utility the quantitative results of this study are case dependent which cannot be directly transferred to another study area with different site conditions however the proposed framework is a technical support tool which can be applied

3376,the risk of urban inundation has been increasing worldwide the integrated green gray blue iggb drainage system is considered to have great potential in urban areas as it has not only the resilience and sustainability of green and blue infrastructure but also the reliability of gray infrastructure on stormwater drainage this study aims to identify whether there is synergistic effect in iggb drainage system and how to optimize it an automatic optimization tool is needed for scenario generation and optimal decision making because of the diversity complicacy and decentrality of iggb drainage system so far existing optimization frameworks focus on green infrastructure which cannot be applied to explore synergistic effect of iggb drainage system this paper proposed an integrated framework to combine hydrological model and optimization algorithm based on this framework seven optimization strategies including green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue were established with the optimization objectives of flood risk reduction rate frrr life cycle cost lcc and land occupied lo a case study was conducted in dongying shandong province china based on the pareto fronts of the seven optimization strategies the average frrrs of green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue strategy under the 24 hour rainfall with 30 year return period are 56 0 7 7 14 5 66 1 78 3 18 4 and 85 5 respectively the green gray blue strategy shows the best performance then the existence of synergistic effect in iggb drainage system is confirmed the synergistic effect of green gray green blue and green gray blue optimization strategies was 5 7 9 7 and 10 6 respectively however synergistic effect was not generated in the gray blue optimization strategy in this study the synergistic effect is influenced by the hydrological mechanism of synergistic effect and the law of diminishing marginal utility the results provide more evidence for the outstanding performance of the green gray blue integrated urban drainage system and provide technical support and greater clarity to decision makers on how to integrate the green gray and blue infrastructure keywords urban inundation integrated green gray blue drainage system synergistic effect multi objective optimization 1 introduction a large scale urbanization is unfolding around the world liu et al 2019 a large amount of natural surface is covered by urban impermeable surfaces which prevents rainwater from infiltrating into the ground the total amount of runoff and peak flow has surged causing urban inundation which is a severe challenge at present oudin et al 2018 in the context of climate change the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events have shown an increasing trend which has exacerbated the risk of urban inundation hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 the traditional mode of urban separated stormwater drainage system includes stormwater pipe networks pumping stations and storage tanks etc dong et al 2017 it is called gray infrastructure because it is composed predominantly of concrete and steel tavakol davani et al 2015 gray infrastructure is generally placed in underground spaces with a single goal of rapidly draining rainwater out of the city however if urban districts upstream drain stormwater too quickly it may cause urban flooding downstream brears 2018 meanwhile a large amount of rainwater is directly drained away without effective use green infrastructure proposed as a supplement to traditional gray infrastructure is a decentralized stormwater management practice which emphasis on stormwater management at the source simulating the natural hydrological cycle regulating the hydrological cycle process in urbanized areas and reducing stormwater runoff li et al 2019 casal campos et al 2018 green infrastructure can also provide a variety of environmental ecological economic and social benefits or services hansen and pauleit 2014 including mitigating runoff pollution mitigating cso regulating microclimate increasing biodiversity enhancing carbon sequestration via vegetation landscaping etc however as a source control infrastructure green infrastructure has some drawbacks in mitigating the risk of urban flooding the installation of green infrastructure often requires space which can be very limited in intensely developing catchments so the design objective for green infrastructure is usually based on small and medium rainfall events palanisamy and chui 2015 the design objective of green infrastructure usually is the water quality volume wqv nordman et al 2018 o sullivan et al 2015 wqv is employed so that only portion of the runoff i e first flush will be treated and captured by green infrastructure and the remaining runoff should be bypassed lee et al 2010 for example the objective of wqv in michigan united states is 0 8 1 0 in nordman et al 2018 wang et al 2020 conducted an evaluation of status of the implementation of green infrastructure in chinese sponge city and showed that the flood inundation prevention capacity of green infrastructure only accounts for 13 8 of the entire urban drainage system blue infrastructure generally refers to large wetlands ponds or water bodies in cities blue infrastructure is usually large and located at the end of the catchment used to store the excessive stormwater runoff which stormwater pipes cannot handle and thus alleviate urban flooding some definitions incorporate blue infrastructure into green infrastructure as they are both natural solutions ghofrani et al 2017 the term blue green infrastructure bgi is also used albeit less frequently richard et al 2018 the combination of green gray blue infrastructure has received some attention the reliability resilience and sustainability are considered the three key elements for evaluating the robustness of urban drainage systems butler et al 2016 the integration of green gray blue infrastructure has advantages in this regard joyce et al 2018 constructed a resilience metric to predict the adaptive capacity of a green gray blue drainage system under extreme weather events casal campos et al 2018 analyzed a number of gray green and green gray combined scenarios and pointed out that the gray infrastructure strategy has the limitations of lacking resilience and sustainability in economy environment and society by implementing hybrid strategies that combine green and gray solutions these limitations have been overcome haghighatafshar et al 2017 evaluated a blue green renovation project and found that the green retrofits upstream reduced the peak flows and leveled out the runoff which is a substantial advantage for downstream pipe bound catchments alves et al 2019 pointed out through a series of scenario analysis that a mix of green blue and gray infrastructure is likely to result in the best adaptation strategy as these three alternatives tend to complement each other with the best effect on flood risk reduction and provide a variety of comprehensive benefits more studies are needed to focus on how to integrate green gray and blue infrastructure for urban stormwater management to more effectively manage urban flood risks and meanwhile achieve a variety of comprehensive benefits although the above mentioned research has made some effective and positive progress and conclusions on the combination of green gray and blue infrastructure the synergistic effect among green gray and blue infrastructure has not been much discussed whether there is synergistic effect between integration of facilities and the sum of individual facility integrated benefits sum of individual benefits and how to optimize the synergistic effect to achieve the maximum benefit at minimum cost have not been discussed in depth besides the limited scenario analysis methods can no longer meet the needs of decision makers and multi stakeholders for maximizing comprehensive benefits new method is to obtain the pareto front solutions by introducing an optimization algorithm and performing automatic search on huge number of alternatives so far relevant studies have focused on optimizing the type size and location of green or blue infrastructure at different scales eckart et al 2018 huang et al 2018 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the parameters of gray infrastructure are usually used as invariant condition not decision variables although bakhshipour et al 2019 tried the optimization of a mixed green blue gray decentralized urban drainage system its optimization strategy was carried out in two steps which not under the same multi objective optimization framework first the gray infrastructure was optimized and then the green blue infrastructure was optimized meanwhile the type and size of green infrastructure and blue infrastructure is not considered in the optimization scheme only the location of green infrastructure and blue infrastructure is optimized there is still a lack of an optimization framework to achieve the overall optimum integration of green gray and blue infrastructure bakhshipour et al 2019 above all this study tries to analyze the mechanism of synergistic effect of the integration of green gray and blue infrastructure furthermore this study tries to propose a multi objective simulation optimization framework to integrate hydrological model and optimization algorithm seven optimization strategies including green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue are establish based on case study to compare and analyze the optimization results and synergistic effect of them under the same optimization objective functions to provide technical support and greater clarity to decision makers to make better informed choices to the layout and design of urban drainage system 2 methodology the overall framework of this study is shown in fig 1 firstly a method to analyze the hydrological mechanism of synergistic effect of iggb drainage system is proposed secondly a multi objective optimization model was established to explore synergistic effect among green gray and blue infrastructure thirdly the pareto fronts of optimization strategies and the synergistic effect of green gray and blue infrastructure were analyzed fig 1 illustrates mechanism by which synergies occur different composition of urban drainage system and different distribution of individual facilities could lead to different spatial temporal urban hydrological process this will result in different allocations of stormwater runoff thus this will have an impact on urban flood risk the aformentioned mechanism provide the theoretical basis for the generation of synergistic effect however there is still a need for quantitative support on whether the integration of facilities will mutually enhance the effectiveness of flood risk control of individual facilities in order to understand the synergistic effect with a comprehensive perspective a simulation optimization model was established a mathematical model including the decision variables objective functions and constraints was established based on the actual optimization problem the decision variables were the key design parameters of different facilities of green gray and blue infrastructure the decision variables of green infrastructure are type size and location while gray and blue infrastructure are size assuming that the location and type are determined two optimization objectives maximization of flood risk reduction rate and minimization of life cycle cost were selected as optimization objectives huang et al 2018 aminjavaheri and nazif 2017 wang et al 2017 moreover compared with gray infrastructure the main difficulty for promotion of green and blue infrastructure in urban area is the occupation of land palanisamy and chui 2015 wild et al 2017 especially in highly urbanized areas considering the availability of space and the value of the land land occupation is also a key factor that decision makers have to face although it is advocated that green and blue infrastructure practices should be implemented as much as possible in urban area it is reasonable that the scenario which achieve more multi benefits with less occupation of land is better than those occupy more land as projects with less renovation are easier to implement therefore the minimization of land occupied by green and blue infrastructure is taken as the third optimization objective the characteristics advantages and limitations of the three types of infrastructure and the trade off of corresponding objectives are shown in fig 2 volume capture ratio of annual rainfall vcrar of green infrastructure was considered as a constraint vcrar is one of the design standards of green infrastructure proposed by the chinese sponge city strategy and it usually corresponds to wqv li et al 2018 meanwhile the suitability indices are constructed based on the site conditions of study area mainly including land use type slope building buffer hydrologic soil groups reduction factor the maximum of decision variables are restricted based on the suitability indices the python based hydrological model framework called pyswmm mcdonnell et al 2020 and a python based genetic algorithm framework called geatpy g core team 2020 are integrated to conduct the optimization process of this study the application programming interfaces were implemented by using python programming language 2 1 study area the study area is located in dongying city northeast of shandong province china the selected catchment is located in the built up part with a total area of 395 88 ha dongying city has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 550 600 mm the time distribution of precipitation is uneven most of precipitation is concentrated in summer the rainfall from july to august accounts for about half of the annual rainfall the urban drainage system is under great pressure in summer and it is easy to cause flood disasters soil type of study area is hydrologic soil group c the location land use dem and drainage system of the study area are shown in fig 3 data sources are shown in table 1 2 2 establishment and calibration of hydrological model the study catchment was divided into 25 sub catchments swmm model of the study area was established stormwater pipe network was reasonably simplified to 24 pipelines and 24 nodes first of all combined adjacent pipelines of the same diameter without branches on the same straight road second nodes were set at the joints of pipe segments of different diameter and road bends third the overall topology of the pipe network model was checked to ensure that it is consistent with the topology before simplification the topological relationship of the sub catchments and stormwater pipe network are shown in fig 4 to better simulate stormwater pipe network overflow and street flooding in a realistic manner a dual drainage model fig 5 was used by setting streets as channel objects into the swmm model which takes into account not only the runoff through the stormwater pipe network but also the runoff on the surface randall et al 2017 parameters setting of various green infrastructure in surface layer soil layer pavement layer drainage mat layer storage layer and drain layer were referred to chui et al 2016 and huang et al 2018 as shown in table 2 the stormwater pond was set as the storage unit in swmm model the swmm model in the study area was calibrated by using historical rainfall data of typhoon rumbia fig 6 the statistical period of typhoon rumbia is from 0 00 to 24 00 on august 19 2018 and the total rainfall is 270 5 mm two streets inundation depth were continuously monitored at 0 5 hour interval the 24 hour rainfall with 30 year return period was used as design rainfall for optimizing usage total rainfall of which is 195 3 mm and the time history distribution of 24 hour rainfall was carried out by using the chicago hydrology method silveira 2016 fig 6 the calibration results of the two monitoring points are shown in fig 7 the nash efficiency coefficients of the two water accumulation points are 0 75 and 0 85 respectively which shows that the established swmm model can basically characterize the rainfall runoff process and the street inundation process in the study area 2 3 mathematization of optimization problem 2 3 1 optimization algorithm in the past optimization practice of green infrastructure the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ⅱ nsga ⅱ was the most widely used wang et al 2020 which was based on the crowded comparison operator deb et al 2002 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii based on reference point selection operator proposed by deb and jain 2014 and fellow et al 2014 to solve the many objective more than three optimization problem was used in this study nsga iii following nsga ⅱ framework which maintains the diversity of the population by introducing widely distributed reference points which was able to successfully find a well converged pareto front under many objective optimization problems deb and jain 2014 2 3 2 decision variables three kinds of commonly used green infrastructure were selected in this study including green roofs permeable pavements and bioretention sells the type size and location of these green infrastructure devices were used as decision variables for gray infrastructure this study took stormwater pipes as the main optimization objects the diameter of which were used as decision variables for blue infrastructure stormwater pond was proposed to collect inundation water from streets in view of that blue infrastructure was usually located in low lying areas and required large open space the location of the stormwater pond was determined in advance through the land use and the dem which was set as a fixed value in optimization model the volume of the stormwater pond was used as decision variable the decision variables were expressed as follows 1 x a ij i 1 3 j 1 25 d k k 1 24 v p where x is the vector of decision variables of simulated scenario the number i represents the type of green infrastructure the number j represents the sub catchment and aij represents the area of green infrastructure i in sub catchment j the number k represents the stormwater pipe and dk represents the diameter of stormwater pipe k vp represents the volume of stormwater pond 2 3 3 objective functions multi objective optimization has become a popular method that has tradeoff solutions liu et al 2016 as mentioned above this study took flood risk reduction rate life cycle cost and land occupied as the optimization objectives to optimize the urban drainage systems 1 flood risk reduction rate frrr the flood risk reduction rate frrr was calculated using eq 2 2 fr fd l r fr x f r b f r x fr b 100 where number l represents the street fdl represents the maximum flooding depth of street l which was obtained from the results of the swmm model and fr represents the flood risk of the simulated scenario frb represents the flood risk of baseline scenario fr x represents the flood risk of the simulated scenario x rfr x represents frrr of simulated scenario x 2 life cycle cost lcc life cycle cost lcc is defined as the process of determining the sum of all expenses associated with the complete life cycle of a product system including material acquisition installation operation maintenance and disposal cost xu et al 2019 lcc was calculated using eq 3 3 l c c x lcc green x lcc grey x lcc blue x where lcc x represents lcc of simulated scenario x lccgreen x represents lcc of green infrastructure in simulated scenario x lccgray x represents lcc of gray infrastructure in simulated scenario x lccblue x represents lcc of blue infrastructure in simulated scenario x the lccs of green infrastructure gray infrastructure and blue infrastructure were calculated using eq 4 4 lcc green x i 1 3 j 1 25 ulcc i a ij lcc gray x ulcc d k l k lcc blue x ulcc p v p where ulcci represents the unit life cycle cost ulcc of green infrastructure i ulccdk represents the ulcc of stormwater pipe k with diameter dk gray infrastructure lk represents the length of stormwater pipe k ulccp represents the ulcc of stormwater pond blue infrastructure life cycle and lcc of green gray and blue infrastructure often have a significant range of uncertainty the calculation methods of lcc and ulcc in this study were referred to mei et al 2018 the replacement cost was not taken into account in the construction cost lcc and ulcc were calculated using eq 5 5 lcc c c c o m c s c o m t 0 n f r t c o m t f r t 1 1 r t c s f r n 1 1 n c o m 0 c o m 0 p c c where cc is the construction cost in the initial period c o m is the operation and maintenance cost cs salvage value f r t is the present value factor of discount rate r in year t c o m t is the operation and maintenance cost in year t f r n is the present value factor of discount rate r in the end year n of the design life p is the ratio of operation and maintenance cost to construction cost the construction cost of different device was referred to mohurd 2018 parameter assumptions for life cycle calculation of different device are shown in table 3 3 land occupied lo the land occupied lo was calculated using eq 6 6 l x a ij v p d p where l x represents lo of simulated scenario x d p represents the average depth of stormwater pond which was set to 3 m in this study 2 3 4 constraints some suitability indices are considered as the constraints to identify suitable locations to locate green infrastructure the area of the suitable locations of each green infrastructure practice in each sub catchment is the maximum of decision variables the threshold values of each green infrastructure practice are determined based on the site conditions of each sub catchment the factors that should be considered include land use dem slope hydrologic soil groups permeability building buffer etc specific constraints of each green infrastructure are shown in table 4 it could be noted that green roofs are subject to the bearing capacity of roofs and the occupation of roof equipment however it was impossible to confirm which parts have the problem mentioned above from the land use map without more information therefore a reduction factor was set as the basis for determining the threshold of the green roofs according to a summary of municipal green roof policy in different countries requirements of green roof coverage is 20 70 shiah 2011 so the reduction factor of green roof is set as 0 7 in this study similar problems exist in locating of permeable pavement which are not suitable for the motorway with large traffic restricted by load bearing permeable pavement is generally set in non motorized lanes according to a 2019 statistical yearbook of china non motorized lanes take up 20 30 of the road area in several provinces national bureau of statistics prc 2019 so the reduction factor of permeable pavement is set as 0 3 in this study regarding the stormwater pipe network the design standard of urban stormwater pipe network is generally low due to the rapid urbanization in china in recent years wang et al 2020 therefore in the optimization process the current diameter of stormwater pipe was taken as the minimum value moreover the diameter of downstream pipe was limited to be no less than that of the upstream pipe for stormwater ponds the threshold is determined based on the available space at selected location one goal of green infrastructure is to keep rainwater in the site as much as possible before it enters to stormwater pipe network therefore green infrastructure in cities is rigid demand in terms of protecting and restoring the natural hydrological cycle therefore this study took vcrar as another constraint which is one of the design standards for green infrastructure in china mohurd 2014 vcrar was calculated based on the analysis of long series daily rainfall statistics for years and is used to determine the overall size of all green infrastructure practices it refers to the percentage of the total annual rainfall within the site that is controlled by green infrastructure not discharged to stormwater pipe network in the whole year vcrar of dongying city is 75 85 mohurd 2014 the topological relationship of the stormwater pipe network was constrained to ensure that the diameter of the downstream stormwater pipe was not less than that of the upstream stormwater pipe in addition the stormwater pipe was only allowed to increase two grades on the basis of the current pipe diameter constraints were expressed as follow 7 0 a ij m a x a ij d k d k o 200 d up d down α 75 where a ij represents the area of green infrastructure i in sub catchment j max a ij represents the maximum area of green infrastructure i in sub catchment j calculated by the suitability indices dk represents the diameter of stormwater pipe k dk o represents the original diameter of stormwater pipe k dup represents the diameter of upstream stormwater pipe ddown represents the diameter of downstream stormwater pipe α represents the vcrar 2 4 simulation optimization model integration swmm model and nsga iii algorithm were integrated to optimize three optimization strategies of green green gray green gray blue and to generate pareto front solutions the flowchart of simulation optimization model integration process is shown in fig 8 first to mathematize the actual optimization problem and determine the decision variables objective functions and constraints of the optimization problem as mentioned above second to set the initial value of the decision variables third to set the parameters of the swmm model and the nsga iii algorithm itself respectively and then carry out the integrated simulation optimization model the optimization algorithm was used to generate sample populations of decision variable scenarios and compute the objective functions to obtain optimal results while the swmm model was used to help computing the objective functions with the sample populations created by optimization algorithm when the number of iterations reached the set maximum value the simulation optimization model ends and finally the pareto front solutions were obtained 3 results 3 1 pareto front results the initial population size of the optimization algorithm was set as 2000 and the number of iterations was 150 a total of 300 000 sample populations were calculated for each strategy the pareto front solutions under green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue optimization strategies are shown in fig 9 the results show that under the same optimization objective function and constraints frrr of the seven strategies is rank in the order of green gray blue strategy green blue strategy green gray strategy green strategy blue strategy gray strategy especially in all the optimizing strategies which include green infrastructure the results show that under the conditions of the same objective function values of lcc and lo frrr of the four strategies is rank in the order of green gray blue strategy green blue strategy green gray strategy green strategy fig 9 b the results indicate that there is significant benefit in using the integrated optimization strategies 3 2 synergistic effect analysis further statistical analysis was conducted on these pareto front points as shown in fig 10 the average frrr of green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue optimization strategies are 56 0 7 7 14 5 66 1 78 3 18 4 and 85 5 respectively synergistic effect was analyzed as shown in fig 11 the sum of the average frrr of gray and blue strategy is 22 2 and the average frrr of gray blue strategy is 18 4 the sum of the average frrr of green and gray strategy is 63 7 and the average frrr of green gray strategy is 66 1 the sum of the average frrr of green and blue strategy is 71 0 and the average frrr of green blue strategy is 78 3 the sum of the average frrr of green gray and blue strategy is 78 2 and the average frrr of green gray blue strategy is 85 5 the synergistic effect of green gray green blue and green gray blue optimization strategies is 5 7 9 7 and 10 6 respectively however synergistic effect is not generated in the gray blue optimization strategy in this study 4 discussion 4 1 potential mitigation of urban inundation via green gray blue urban drainage systems in this study a simulation optimization framework based on swmm model and nsga iii algorithm is proposed to carry out the urban drainage system optimization for inundation prevention and control which provides an effective trade off tool for decision makers and stakeholders based on this framework green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue strategies were established and the optimization results confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of green gray blue strategy as it had the best flood risk control effect and the largest synergistic effect in previous studies gray infrastructure was usually used as the invariant condition not the decision variable of the model which ignored the potential synergistic effect of urban drainage system 4 2 factors affecting synergistic effect of urban drainage system the synergistic effect was generated in green gray green blue and green gray blue optimization strategies but not generated in gray blue optimization strategy in this study these results were mainly influenced by two factors of the aformentioned hydrological mechanism of synergistic effect and the law of diminishing marginal utility from the hydrological mechanism of synergistic effects there are synergies in all the integrated optimization strategies that include green infrastructure it is because green infrastructure is distributed in each sub catchment which effectively regulate the hydrological process at the source which provides the greatest hydrological possibility for the generation of synergistic effects however gray and blue strategy are generally end of pipe or terminal treatment the regulation effect on the hydrological process of early surface runoff is limited and the ability to achieve synergistic effect is limited some extent the result of this study shows that gray strategy achieves the lowest frrr of the seven strategies fig 10 it should be noted that this result does not mean that the pipe network has the lowest flood risk control capacity it can be explained by the law of diminishing marginal utility take green and gray infrastructure as an example fig 12 the gray infrastructure pipe network is optimized on the basis of existing background conditions which is located in the middle or back segment of the marginal benefit curve with low marginal benefit green infrastructure is grown from scratch which is located in the front segment of the marginal benefit curve with high marginal benefit this is another reason why gray blue strategy did not generate synergies 4 3 limitations and future research directions this study has some limitations for swmm model calibration and validation this study used a dual drainage model which set the street as channel objects into the swmm model in the case of no flow monitoring data of pipeline but the street inundation depth data this approach increases the uncertainty of the swmm model however the goal of this study was the trade off among green gray blue infrastructure and synergistic effect of their integrated patterns and all scenarios were carried out under the same baseline conditions so the results are still highly reliable moreover the uncertain impact of future climate change and urban development were not considered is this study ghodsi et al 2019 studied the optimization of green infrastructure based on climate change scenarios liu et al 2016 and liu et al 2017 studied the optimization of green infrastructure based on future scenarios of land use change and climate change studies considering future uncertainties are still focused on green infrastructure at present and the optimization of green gray blue strategy based on future scenarios is the further research direction 5 conclusions with the purpose of identifying synergistic effect in urban drainage system for urban inundation control this study established a multi objective simulation optimization framework of urban drainage system to integrate hydrological model and optimization algorithm based on this framework seven optimization strategies of green gray blue green gray green blue and green gray blue were analyzed and the optimization results of flood risk reduction rate life cycle cost and land occupied were obtained based on a case study in dongying china the conclusions can be derived as following under the same optimization objective function and constraints flood risk reduction rate of the seven strategies is rank in the order of green gray blue strategy green blue strategy green gray strategy green strategy blue strategy gray strategy in the whole objective functions value space the average flood risk reduction rates of green gray blue green gray green blue gray blue and green gray blue optimization strategies are 56 0 7 7 14 5 66 1 78 3 18 4 and 85 5 respectively the green gray blue strategy shows the best performance the synergistic effect of green gray green blue and green gray blue optimization strategies was 5 7 9 7 and 10 6 respectively however synergistic effect was not generated in the gray blue optimization strategy in this study synergistic effect of urban drainage system was affected by hydrological mechanism of synergistic effect and the law of diminishing marginal utility the quantitative results of this study are case dependent which cannot be directly transferred to another study area with different site conditions however the proposed framework is a technical support tool which can be applied

3377,two dimensional 2 d discrete fracture networks dfns are widely used to study the hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses there are few studies on the reliability of 2 d dfns reflecting the hydraulic properties of three dimensional 3 d rock masses this study provides a new perspective based on percolation theory to study the interconnectivity between 3 d and 2 d dfns quantitatively for isotropic fractured rock masses the corresponding value of the number of fractures in per sampled volume p 30 when 3 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold is theoretically derived additionally the corresponding value of p 30 of the original 3 d model when its 2 d dfns on cutting planes achieve the percolation threshold is also derived for comparison these theoretical formulas show that a the corresponding values of p 30 at percolation threshold for both 3 d and 2 d dfns are only related to the fracture diameter and inversely proportional to its third power and b the corresponding value of p 30 when 2 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold is 6 5 times of the corresponding value of p 30 when its original 3 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold numerical codes and experiments based on particle flow code and matlab are developed to verify the derived theoretical equations and the results show that the theoretical equations are validated keywords connectivity percolation threshold discrete fracture network rock mass hydraulic property 1 introduction the hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses play an important role in various geoscience and engineering projects lang et al

categories he et al 2013 selroos et al 2002 a the equivalent continuum ec model hsieh et al 1985 oda 1986 b the discrete fracture dfn model bour and davy 1997 de dreuzy et al 2001 c the dual porosity

al 2019 and zheng et al 2020b presented comprehensive summaries including the assumptions main input parameters advantages disadvantages and applicability of the those models in ec model the rock mass is represented by a continuum medium with a parameter of equivalent permeability tensor figueiredo et al 2016 it has high computational efficiency and is convenient for application however the equivalent permeability tensor is difficult to be obtained with good accurate in dp model flow occurs in fractures rock matrix acts as only fluid storage and the fracture and matrix domains are linked to each other through an exchange term that connects each fracture cell to its corresponding matrix cell in a grid block moinfar at al 2011 this model is close to the actual rock mass and the simulation results are accurate but the input parameters are complex and the computational workload is enormous for dp model in cn model flow and transport occur primarily in preferential paths in the fracture plane figueiredo et al 2016 there are many input parameters and they are not easy to obtain for cn model as for dfm model it attempts to strike a balance between loss of accuracy by upscaling and geometric complexity berre at al 2019 it allows for integrating fractures of a length much smaller than the size of the domain into the porous matrix however the methods to decide which fracture assign to fracture part and matrix part are not well developed to have a better measurement on permeability of fractured rock masses many researchers adopt dfn model min et al 2004 used dfn model to obtain the hydraulic representative elementary volume rev size of fractured rock masses wang et al 2018 estimated the rev size and equivalent permeability coefficient of fractured rock masses comparing the radial and unidirectional flow configuration liu et al 2019 presented a predictive model correlating permeability to two dimensional 2 d fracture network parameters including mass density of fractures average number of intersections per meter at the inlet and outlet boundaries and connectivity zheng et al 2020b used 2 d dfns to validate their proposed new analytical method for determining the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses which was developed based on the orientation and linear frequency of fractures along with a value of the permeability in any direction it should be noted that most of the studies on the hydraulic properties are based on 2 d dfns in an actual rock mass fractures obviously develop in the three dimensional 3 d space however the hydraulic analysis of a 3 d dfn is much more difficult than that of a 2 d one on the one hand it is not easy to obtain the accurate 3 d geometric properties of fractures since the outcrop information of fractures is usually 2 d zheng et al 2020a 2017 on the other hand the computational cost of 3 d dfn is also much larger than that of a 2 d one the time to calculate the hydraulic properties of a 3 d dfn is huge itasca consulting group inc 2016 in a word due to simplicity and high efficiency it is common for researchers engineers to perform hydraulic analysis of a rock mass based on the 2 d dfn though actual fractures are distributed in 3 d space not unnaturally one needs to know whether the hydraulic analysis results of a 2 d dfn may reflect the actual situation of a 3 d rock mass unfortunately few studies discussed the relationship between the hydraulic properties of dfns in 2 d and 3 d space to the best of our knowledge only lang at al 2014 and huang et al 2017 tried to explore the relationship of hydraulic properties between 2 d and 3 d dfns by numerical experiments lang et al 2014 found that the reduction from 3 d to 2 d analysis of the permeability of a fractured rock mass introduced errors in both the magnitude and direction of principal permeabilities huang et al 2017 found the permeability of 2 d dfns that are cut from an original 3 d model underestimates the permeability of 3 d dfns by approximately 10 45 80 92 in isotropic fractured rock masses the main aim of this study is to investigate the relationship on hydraulic properties between a 3 d dfn and its corresponding 2 d dfns on cutting planes from the perspective of the connecting status connected or disconnected of networks in order to accomplish this aim the percolation theory of rock masses is used based on this theory a dfn is connected i e permeable when its percolation index reaches the percolation threshold in this study the number of the fractures in per cubic meter i e p 30 is selected as the percolation parameter the corresponding value of p 30 when 3 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold is theoretically derived and the corresponding value of p 30 of the original 3 d model when its 2 d dfns on cutting planes achieve the percolation threshold is also derived for comparison the relationship between them is discussed additionally numerical codes and experiments based on particle flow code and matlab are conducted to verify these theoretical equations 2 connectivity and percolation theory as stated above in the study the percolation theory is adopted to study the connectivity of a 3 d dfn and its corresponding 2 d dfns on cutting planes percolation theory links the global properties connectivity to an average measure of its geometrical properties using a percolation parameter p bour and davy 1997 in this theory when the percolation parameter increases the permeable fractures connect to others more frequently and form a bigger fracture cluster with the growing of the fracture cluster a impervious rock mass begins to become permeable li et al 2020 a percolation threshold p c is defined to describe the critical state where the unconnected system begins to become connected for a dfn there are two different connected definitions one is the fracture cluster links all six surfaces of the cube in 3 d space or all four sides of square in 2 d space and the other is the fracture cluster links a pair of opposite surfaces in 3 d space or the opposite sides in 2 d space balberg et al 1991 since the percolation parameters are very close in the two situations for isotropic fractured rock masses robinson 1984 in this paper the connecting state is defined with the latter for a determined inflow surface or side when p p c the fracture cluster cannot link two opposite surfaces or sides fig 1 and when p p c the fracture cluster can link two opposite surfaces or sides and the dfn is connected fig 1 when using percolation theory to describe the connectivity of dfn the value of p c should be determined in the past studies several different indexes of p c have been proposed zhang and sanderson 2002 used the linear frequency of fractures as percolation parameter bour and davy 1997 proposed the following parameter as percolation parameter 1 p l min l max n l l 2 l 2 d l where l is fracture trace length l max and l min are maximum and minimum values of fracture trace length respectively n l is the number of fractures with a length in the range l l dl and l is the side length of the fractured rock mass the aforementioned two percolation parameters are applicable to 2 d dfns robinson 1984 proposed the average intersection per fracture i as the percolation parameter which is widely used in latter studies huseby et al 1997 the average number intersections per fracture at percolation threshold which is denoted as i c have relatively fixed values for different rock masses and are equal to 3 57 balberg et al 1984 or 3 7 robinson 1983 for 2 d dfns and 2 26 for 3 d dfns huseby et al 1997 for simplicity the i c3d and i c2d are defined as the specific i at percolation threshold in 3 d dfns and 2 d dfns respectively so i c2d 3 57 or 3 7 balberg et al 1984 and i c3d 2 26 huseby et al 1997 since i plays an import role in the connectivity of dfns it is meaningful to investigate the influence factors on the value of i based on the concept of exclude volume area one may theoretically calculate the value of i a exclude volume v ex exclude area a ex of an object is defined as the volume area surrounding it in which the center of another object must be in order for them to intersect thovert et al 2017 the exclude volume area was first introduced by balberg et al 1984 and continuously improved in the following decades balberg et al 1984 derived the average a ex of lines and average v ex of discs de dreuzy et al 2000 expanded it for the ellipses fracture with widely scattered distributions of eccentricity and size thovert at al 2017 made it possible to calculate the v ex for fractures with arbitrary size and shape distributions it should be noted that the following assumptions are proposed in this study a the fractured rock masses in this study is isotropic b all fractures are considered as thin and flat discs c the fracture centers are randomly and independently distributed in the 3 d space following a poisson process d the distribution of fracture orientation and fracture diameters are independent of each other and f each 2 d dfn is cut from the 3 d model which has a corresponding 3 d dfn based on the assumptions above in the 2 d space the average a ex can be expressed as balberg et al 1984 2 a ex 2 π e 2 l where is the statistical average e is the expected value of the function within the parentheses as for 3 d dfns the average v ex can be calculated as follows thovert et al 2017 3 v ex 1 2 a p 1 8 π 2 e 2 d e d where a and p are the area and the perimeter of fracture disc fracture disc respectively d is the fracture diameter when the standard deviation of d is small eq 3 can be approximately expressed as 4 v ex 1 8 π 2 e 3 d hence the intersections per fracture i can be calculated by thovert et al 2017 5 i p 20 a ex 6 i p 30 v ex where p 20 and p 30 are the fracture intensities p 20 is the number of fractures on per square meter eq 5 in the 2 d space and p 30 is the number of fractures in per cubic meter eq 6 in the 3 d space the substitution of eq 2 into eq 5 can give 7 i 2 π p 20 e 2 l similarly the substitution of eq 4 into eq 6 can give 8 i 1 8 p 30 π 2 e 3 d from eqs 7 and 8 it can be seen that the value of i varies as the values of the fracture intensity and size vary eq 8 shows that i is determined by p 30 and d for 3 d dfns as well as eq 7 shows that i is determined by p 20 and l for 2 d dfns since 2 d dfns are cut from the 3 d models l and p 20 are influenced by d and p 30 of its original 3 d dfn therefore i of both 3 d dfns and 2 d dfns are controlled by p 30 and d of 3 d dfns therefore when the fracture diameter is certain the values of p 30 can be used to judge whether the 3 d or 2 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold since p 30 is more commonly used in engineering in this study p 30 is selected as the percolation parameter 3 theoretical derivation of p 30 at percolation threshold in 3 d and 2 d dfns as stated above p 30 is selected as the percolation threshold for both 3 d and 2 d dfns when the 3 d dfns achieved the percolation threshold the corresponding value of p 30 is denoted as p 30c3d similarly when the 2 d dfns achieved the percolation threshold the corresponding value of p 30 of the original 3 d dfns is denoted as p 30c2d in this section the theoretical p 30c3d and p 30c2d are proposed by derivation and the relationship between them are investigated 3 1 theoretical p 30c3d the 3 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold when the intersections per fracture i equals to 2 26 huseby et al 1997 eq 8 shows the theoretical calculation method of i which is controlled by p 30 and e d substituting i c3d 2 26 into eq 8 gives 9 p 30c3d 1 8 e 3 d eq 9 shows that the p 30c3d is only related to e d and inversely proportional to its third power 3 2 theoretical p 30c2d for 2 d dfns the intersections per fracture i is determined by p 20 and trace length l as stated above since the 2 d dfns are from cutting planes of an original 3 d dfn p 20 of a 2 d dfn is related to p 30 of the original 3 d dfn as well as l is related to the fracture diameter d when the relationships between the above parameters are clear the intersections per fracture i can be calculated by the parameters of the original 3 d model directly therefore it is possible to describe the percolation threshold of 2 d dfns by p 30c2d firstly the relationship between l and d is studied warburton 1980 considered that the fracture trace length l is the chord length when the disc intersects a certain plane the probability density function pdf of the fracture diameter is c d and the pdf of the trace length is obtained as 10 f l 1 d l c d d d d 2 l 2 where d represents the statistical average value of d however when eq 10 takes the lower limit of the integral the function is singular and requires a special solution and the solution is difficult zhang 2005 in this case a simplified method of finding the diameter by measuring the length of the trace is adopted when the fracture intersects the observation plane the trace can be seen on the plane set the trace the length is l be a chord of the disc as shown in fig 2 the fracture can intersect the plane only when y d 2 and the centers of discs satisfy the uniform distribution zhang 2010 the pdf of y is expressed as 11 f y 1 d 2 y d 2 the average value of y can be obtained by zhang 2005 12 y 0 d 2 2 y d d y d 4 therefore the relationship between the average trace length l and the fracture diameter d can be described as following equation zhang 2010 13 l 3 2 d if the trace length l and fracture diameter d follows a pdf eq 13 can be expressed as 14 e l 3 2 e d eq 14 shows the relationship between trace length l of a 2 d dfn and the fracture diameter d of its original 3 d dfns to describe the percolation threshold of 2 d dfns by p 30c2d the next step is to build the relationship between p 20 and p 30 warburton 1980 derived relationship between p 20 and p 30 when the fracture discs are parallel to each other i e all fractures have a same orientation the analysis model is shown in fig 3 a it should be noted that a n represents the normal vector of the fracture disc and b i represents the vector which is parallel to the plane sampling windows and normal to the trace line in this model the sampling window represents the plane section and intercepted by a skew box warburton 1980 proposed the following statements a the front and back of the box are on the opposite sides and they are both parallel to the sampling window and have a distance d 2 cosθ away from the sampling window if the center of the fracture disc is at the distance the fracture would just touch the sampling window consequently if the fracture disc is to intersect the sampling window its center must be somewhere between the front and back of the box b all the other faces of the box are parallel to the line between the center of the fracture disc and the midpoint of its trace it follows that if the center of the fracture disc is inside the box the midpoint of trace line must be in the portion of the sampling window intercepted by the box see fig 3 b since the intercepted portion are denoted as unit area it is easy to build the relationship between p 30 and p 20 warburton 1980 15 p 20 p 30 0 df d d d cos θ where d is the fracture diameter and f d represents the pdf of fracture diameter θ is the angle of intersection between n and i where n represents the normal vector of fracture disc and i represents the vector which is parallel to the plane and normal to the trace line it should be noted that in warburton s formula eq 15 all the fractures have a same orientation and the angle θ can be considered as a fix value in our study the distribution of fracture orientation is considered and the pdf of θ is denoted as g θ according to eq 15 p 20 can be expressed as 16 p 20 p 30 0 df d d d 0 2 π cos θ g θ d θ the fracture orientations are considered as a uniform distribution on a sphere in our study so eq 16 can be derived as 17 p 20 2 π p 30 e d eq 17 shows that p 20 of 2 d dfns can be represented by p 30 and e d of the original 3 d dfn when p 30 of a 3 d dfn is certain p 20 of its 2 d cutting plane is related to the average fracture diameter e d therefore the relationship between trace length l and fracture diameter d see eq 14 and the relationship between p 20 and p 30 see eq 17 are both clear eq 7 from section 3 shows that intersections per fracture i of a 2 d dfn is controlled by p 20 and l when the 2 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold i c2d 3 57 balberg et al 1984 thus p 30c2d which can describe the percolation threshold of 2 d dfn by the intensity of its original 3 d model is derived by bringing eq 14 eq 17 and i c2d 3 57 into eq 7 18 p 30c2d 11 7 e 3 d eq 18 shows that p 30c2d is only related to e d and inversely proportional to its third power 3 3 relationship between p 30c2d and p 30c3d the theoretical p 30c3d and p 30c2d have been expressed as eq 9 and 18 respectively as the result of the derivation both p 30c3d and p 30c2d are only related to e d and inversely proportional to its third power hence the ratio between them can be expressed as a fix value by combining eq 9 and 18 19 p 30c2d p 30c3d 6 5 eq 19 shows that the corresponding value of p 30 when the 2 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold is much larger than the corresponding value of p 30 when its original 3 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold 4 proposal of verification method to verify the derived theoretical p 30c3d and p 30c2d a series of procedures for the validation by numerical modeling is proposed in this section the fracture diameter is assumed following a uniform distribution particle flow code pfc cundall and strack 1979 and matlab are used in the study 4 1 construction of dfn models the 3 d dfns can be constructed using the dfn module of pfc pfc is a powerful program based on discrete element method and its dfn module provide mature technology to generate dfns in the pfc a l l l box was built as our analysis zone with a same center of the box a dfn was created in a range of 2l 2l 2l note that the generated zone for fractures were expanded to 8 times to reduce the boundary effect zheng et al 2015 the fracture disc center follows the poisson distribution in the zone and its intensity is denoted as p 30 the orientation of fractures obeys a uniform distribution on a sphere the diameter of fracture discs has a normal distribution with a mean diameter of d and a standard deviation of σ d 10 d after the generation of dfns in the box of 2l 2l 2l the whole or the part of fractures that are out of the box of l l l were deleted fig 4 after obtaining the generated 3 d dfn a pair of opposite boundaries is defined as inflow and outflow boundaries fig 5 as shown in fig 5 three cutting planes were respectively set at the top middle and bottom of the box the intersection of a fracture and a cutting plane is a trace and all the traces on a cutting plane form the 2 d dfn 4 2 connectivity analysis as introduced in section 2 the percolation threshold can be determined by judging if a dfn is connected or not as stated above in this study p 30 is selected as the percolation parameter with the increase of p 30 a 3 d dfn and its corresponding 2 d dfns on a cutting plane may become connected from a disconnected state the critical value of p 30 when a dfn turns connected from the disconnected state is the percolation threshold of p 30 the following parts introduce the methods to determine the values of p 30c3d and p 30c2d for a 3 d dfn the algorithm is developed using the fish language of the pfc software to judge if a dfn is connected or not firstly the aim is to search out the all fractures intersected with the inflow boundary after that the computer searches out all fractures intersected with the fractures searched out in the first step for each subsequent step the purpose is to search out all fractures intersected with the fractures searched out in the previous step to ensure the search is full let the number of the iteration be equal to the number n of the fractures since in the extreme case where the fractures are connected one by one n iterations are required all the fractures searched out in any steps are named fracture clusters fig 6 which are marked by displaying the all marked fractures fracture clusters in pfc a connection between the inflow and outflow planes are determined by visual inspection if the clusters intersect the outflow boundary there is a trace on it at least which means the 3 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold fig 6 a otherwise the 3 d dfn is disconnected fig 6 b it is worth noting that there are some existing algorithms which can also accomplish the aforementioned function such as converting the dfn to a graph representation huseby et al 1997 and determining whether vertices representing inflow and outflow fractures exist in the same connected component for a 2 d model the dfn is consisted of traces which are the intersections of fracture discs and a cutting plane since a trace is not a subject which can be directly marked in pfc the trace information was exported to matlab and the code for judging connected states of a 2 d dfn was developed in matlab the same algorithm has been used for 2 d models to search out all the traces direct or indirect connected the inflow boundary all the traces searched out in any steps are named trace clusters fig 7 which are marked by displaying the all marked traces trace clusters in matlab a connection between the inflow and outflow planes are determined by visual inspection if the clusters intersect the outflow boundary the 2 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold fig 7 a otherwise the 2 d dfn is disconnected fig 7 b in this study five 3 d dfn models were repeatedly generated for a specific p 30 for each 3 d dfn model three cutting planes were used to obtain three 2 d dfn models and hence fifteen 2 d dfn models were obtained with respect to each p 30 percolation threshold may be variable in a certain range to determine the percolation threshold p 30c3d and p 30c2d the connected ratio is usually defined as the proportion of connected models to the all 3 d or 2 d models li et al 2020 suggested assigning 50 to the connected ratio i e when 50 3 d models are connected the corresponding value of p 30 is p 30c3d and when 50 2 d models are connected the corresponding value of p 30 is p 30c2d since in this study there are only five and fifteen 3 d and 2 d models respectively both of which are not large the connected ratio is assigned as 100 there are two steps to determinate the p 30c3d and p 30c2d in the first step δp 30i is set as a relatively large value note that δp 30i is the increment of p 30 of each iteration step with the increase of p 30 the 3d and 2d dfns become connected and a rough p 30c3d and p 30c2d have been obtained respectively however the above p 30c3d and p 30c2d may not accurate since δp 30d is large the second step is to obtain a specific p 30c3d and p 30c2d in this step δp 30d is set as a relatively small value not that δp 30d is the decrement of p 30 of each iteration step the decrement begins from above p 30c3d and p 30c2d respectively if when p 30 x connected ratio is 100 as well as when p 30 x δp 30d connected ratio is less than 100 x is regarded as the specific percolation threshold the reason for us rather having two steps to obtain the specific percolation threshold than using a small δp 30i is to reduce the amount of data calculation 5 validation of theoretical p 30 at percolation threshold of 3 d and 2 d dfns 5 1 numerical models to verify the theoretical p 30c3d and p 30c2d proposed in section 3 the procedures introduced in section 4 are used the length of analysis zone l is assigned as 10 m different fracture sizes are adopted in the numerical experiments the fracture diameters in each group of models satisfy the normal distribution with mean values d 1 1 5 and 2 m and standard deviation σ d 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 m for each group the 3 d dfn model are repeatedly generated with 5 different random seed note that there are three groups of geometric parameters of fractures and with respect to each group five 3 d dfn models are repeatedly generated after determining the above parameters only the value of p 30 is required to be determined for a dfn the initial p 30 starts from 0 5 m 3 the increment δp 30i is set as 0 5 m 3 and the decrement δp 30d is set as 0 1 m 3 the parameters for 3 d dfn models of groups 1 3 are summarized in table 1 5 2 results and analysis for three different analysis group table 1 the predicted values of p 30c3d and p 20c3d along with the real values are given in figs 8 and 9 it should be noted that a the predicted values of p 30c3d are obtained by eq 9 b the predicted values of p 30c2d are given by eq 20 and c the calculated p 30c3d and p 30c2d are regard as their real values the procedures to obtain p 30 at percolation threshold are mentioned in section 4 according to these two figures it is not difficult to find that the predicted results are quite fit to further quantitatively compare the predicted and real values the error rates of p 30c3d and p 30c2d are computed and the results are plotted in fig 10 fig 10 shows that the error rates are around 10 except for the predicted value of p 30c3d when d 2 m when d 2 m the error rate of predicted values of p 30c3d is 25 but the actual value of difference between predicted value and real value is only 0 075 m 3 fig 8 the reason for this large error rate is that the decrement of step 2 δp 30d see section 4 is relatively not small enough other error rates are around 10 which are regarded to be acceptable fig 11 shows the predicted and real values of p 30c2d p 30c3d note that the predicted values are given by eq 21 it is worth noting that the values from numerical model regard as the real value from fig 11 the predicted and real values are close when d 1 or 1 5 m when d 2 m the real values are relatively lower because of the same reason on the large error rate of p 30c3d in the same situation 6 conclusion because of the difficulty of hydraulic analysis for 3 d dfns most studies focus on the hydraulic behavior of fractured rock masses using 2 d dfns the finding from 2 d dfns may not well reflect the hydraulic properties of a 3 d rock mass this study focuses on the relationship on the interconnectivity between the 3 d dfn and its 2 d cutting planes in this paper we compared the percolation threshold of a 3 d dfn and its corresponding three 2 d dfns from the perspective of percolation since p 30 is a commonly used parameter for a dfn model it is selected as the percolation parameter in this study the theoretical p 30 at percolation threshold for 3 d dfns and its 2 d cutting planes of isotropic fractured rock masses are introduced both of which are only related to the diameter of fracture discs based on that the theoretical relationship between the percolation threshold of 3 d dfn and its 2 d cutting planes are discussed the theoretical formulas show that a p 30 at percolation threshold are inversely proportional to the third power of the expected value of the fracture diameter and b the corresponding value of p 30 when 2 d dfns achieves the percolation threshold is 6 5 times of the corresponding value of p 30 when its original 3 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold a procedure was developed in pfc and matlab to test 3d dfn realizations and 2d cuts and the conclusion is that the numerical results reflected the theoretical values within 10 the fractured rock masses in our study are considered as tight where the rock matrix itself contributes negligibly to flow the fracture in our study is isotropic and we will expend our research to anisotropic fractured rock masses in

3377,two dimensional 2 d discrete fracture networks dfns are widely used to study the hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses there are few studies on the reliability of 2 d dfns reflecting the hydraulic properties of three dimensional 3 d rock masses this study provides a new perspective based on percolation theory to study the interconnectivity between 3 d and 2 d dfns quantitatively for isotropic fractured rock masses the corresponding value of the number of fractures in per sampled volume p 30 when 3 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold is theoretically derived additionally the corresponding value of p 30 of the original 3 d model when its 2 d dfns on cutting planes achieve the percolation threshold is also derived for comparison these theoretical formulas show that a the corresponding values of p 30 at percolation threshold for both 3 d and 2 d dfns are only related to the fracture diameter and inversely proportional to its third power and b the corresponding value of p 30 when 2 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold is 6 5 times of the corresponding value of p 30 when its original 3 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold numerical codes and experiments based on particle flow code and matlab are developed to verify the derived theoretical equations and the results show that the theoretical equations are validated keywords connectivity percolation threshold

and geometric complexity berre at al 2019 it allows for integrating fractures of a length much smaller than the size of the domain into the porous matrix however the methods to decide which fracture assign to fracture part and matrix part are not well developed to have a better measurement on permeability of fractured rock masses many researchers adopt dfn model min et al 2004 used dfn model to obtain the hydraulic representative elementary volume rev size of fractured rock masses wang et al 2018 estimated the rev size and equivalent permeability coefficient of fractured rock masses comparing the radial and unidirectional flow configuration liu et al 2019 presented a predictive model correlating permeability to two dimensional 2 d fracture network parameters including mass density of fractures average number of intersections per meter at the inlet and outlet boundaries and connectivity zheng et al 2020b used 2 d dfns to validate their proposed new analytical method for determining the permeability tensor of fractured rock masses which was developed based on the orientation and linear frequency of fractures along with a value of the permeability in any direction it should be noted that most of the studies on the hydraulic properties are based on 2 d dfns in an actual rock mass fractures obviously develop in the three dimensional 3 d space however the hydraulic analysis of a 3 d dfn is much more difficult than that of a 2 d one on the one hand it is not easy to obtain the accurate 3 d geometric properties of fractures since the outcrop information of fractures is usually 2 d zheng et al 2020a 2017 on the other hand the computational cost of 3 d dfn is also much larger than that of a 2 d one the time to calculate the hydraulic properties of a 3 d dfn is huge itasca consulting group inc 2016 in a word due to simplicity and high efficiency it is common for researchers engineers to perform hydraulic analysis of a rock mass based on the 2 d dfn though actual fractures are distributed in 3 d space not unnaturally one needs to know whether the hydraulic analysis results of a 2 d dfn may reflect the actual situation of a 3 d rock mass unfortunately few studies discussed the relationship between the hydraulic properties of dfns in 2 d and 3 d space to the best of our knowledge only lang at al 2014 and huang et al 2017 tried to explore the relationship of hydraulic properties between 2 d and 3 d dfns by numerical experiments lang et al 2014 found that the reduction from 3 d to 2 d analysis of the permeability of a fractured rock mass introduced errors in both the magnitude and direction of principal permeabilities huang et al 2017 found the permeability of 2 d dfns that are cut from an original 3 d model underestimates the permeability of 3 d dfns by approximately 10 45 80 92 in isotropic fractured rock masses the main aim of this study is to investigate the relationship on hydraulic properties between a 3 d dfn and its corresponding 2 d dfns on cutting planes from the perspective of the connecting status connected or disconnected of networks in order to accomplish this aim the percolation theory of rock masses is used based on this theory a dfn is connected i e permeable when its percolation index reaches the percolation threshold in this study the number of the fractures in per cubic meter i e p 30 is selected as the percolation parameter the corresponding value of p 30 when 3 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold is theoretically derived and the corresponding value of p 30 of the original 3 d model when its 2 d dfns on cutting planes achieve the percolation threshold is also derived for comparison the relationship between them is discussed additionally numerical codes and experiments based on particle flow code and matlab are conducted to verify these theoretical equations 2 connectivity and percolation theory as stated above in the study the percolation theory is adopted to study the connectivity of a 3 d dfn and its corresponding 2 d dfns on cutting planes percolation theory links the global properties connectivity to an average measure of its geometrical properties using a percolation parameter p bour and davy 1997 in this theory when the percolation parameter increases the permeable fractures connect to others more frequently and form a bigger fracture cluster with the growing of the fracture cluster a impervious rock mass begins to become permeable li et al 2020 a percolation threshold p c is defined to describe the critical state where the unconnected system begins to become connected for a dfn there are two different connected definitions one is the fracture cluster links all six surfaces of the cube in 3 d space or all four sides of square in 2 d space and the other is the fracture cluster links a pair of opposite surfaces in 3 d space or the opposite sides in 2 d space balberg et al 1991 since the percolation parameters are very close in the two situations for isotropic fractured rock masses robinson 1984 in this paper the connecting state is defined with the latter for a determined inflow surface or side when p p c the fracture cluster cannot link two opposite surfaces or sides fig 1 and when p p c the fracture cluster can link two opposite surfaces or sides and the dfn is connected fig 1 when using percolation theory to describe the connectivity of dfn the value of p c should be determined in the past studies several different indexes of p c have been proposed zhang and sanderson 2002 used the linear frequency of fractures as percolation parameter bour and davy 1997 proposed the following parameter as percolation parameter 1 p l min l max n l l 2 l 2 d l where l is fracture trace length l max and l min are maximum and minimum values of fracture trace length respectively n l is the number of fractures with a length in the range l l dl and l is the side length of the fractured rock mass the aforementioned two percolation parameters are applicable to 2 d dfns robinson 1984 proposed the average intersection per fracture i as the percolation parameter which is widely used in latter studies huseby et al 1997 the average number intersections per fracture at percolation threshold which is denoted as i c have relatively fixed values for different rock masses and are equal to 3 57 balberg et al 1984 or 3 7 robinson 1983 for 2 d dfns and 2 26 for 3 d dfns huseby et al 1997 for simplicity the i c3d and i c2d are defined as the specific i at percolation threshold in 3 d dfns and 2 d dfns respectively so i c2d 3 57 or 3 7 balberg et al 1984 and i c3d 2 26 huseby et al 1997 since i plays an import role in the connectivity of dfns it is meaningful to investigate the influence factors on the value of i based on the concept of exclude volume area one may theoretically calculate the value of i a exclude volume v ex exclude area a ex of an object is defined as the volume area surrounding it in which the center of another object must be in order for them to intersect thovert et al 2017 the exclude volume area was first introduced by balberg et al 1984 and continuously improved in the following decades balberg et al 1984 derived the average a ex of lines and average v ex of discs de dreuzy et al 2000 expanded it for the ellipses fracture with widely scattered distributions of eccentricity and size thovert at al 2017 made it possible to calculate the v ex for fractures with arbitrary size and shape distributions it should be noted that the following assumptions are proposed in this study a the fractured rock masses in this study is isotropic b all fractures are considered as thin and flat discs c the fracture centers are randomly and independently distributed in the 3 d space following a poisson process d the distribution of fracture orientation and fracture diameters are independent of each other and f each 2 d dfn is cut from the 3 d model which has a corresponding 3 d dfn based on the assumptions above in the 2 d space the average a ex can be expressed as balberg et al 1984 2 a ex 2 π e 2 l where is the statistical average e is the expected value of the function within the parentheses as for 3 d dfns the average v ex can be calculated as follows thovert et al 2017 3 v ex 1 2 a p 1 8 π 2 e 2 d e d where a and p are the area and the perimeter of fracture disc fracture disc respectively d is the fracture diameter when the standard deviation of d is small eq 3 can be approximately expressed as 4 v ex 1 8 π 2 e 3 d hence the intersections per fracture i can be calculated by thovert et al 2017 5 i p 20 a ex 6 i p 30 v ex where p 20 and p 30 are the fracture intensities p 20 is the number of fractures on per square meter eq 5 in the 2 d space and p 30 is the number of fractures in per cubic meter eq 6 in the 3 d space the substitution of eq 2 into eq 5 can give 7 i 2 π p 20 e 2 l similarly the substitution of eq 4 into eq 6 can give 8 i 1 8 p 30 π 2 e 3 d from eqs 7 and 8 it can be seen that the value of i varies as the values of the fracture intensity and size vary eq 8 shows that i is determined by p 30 and d for 3 d dfns as well as eq 7 shows that i is determined by p 20 and l for 2 d dfns since 2 d dfns are cut from the 3 d models l and p 20 are influenced by d and p 30 of its original 3 d dfn therefore i of both 3 d dfns and 2 d dfns are controlled by p 30 and d of 3 d dfns therefore when the fracture diameter is certain the values of p 30 can be used to judge whether the 3 d or 2 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold since p 30 is more commonly used in engineering in this study p 30 is selected as the percolation parameter 3 theoretical derivation of p 30 at percolation threshold in 3 d and 2 d dfns as stated above p 30 is selected as the percolation threshold for both 3 d and 2 d dfns when the 3 d dfns achieved the percolation threshold the corresponding value of p 30 is denoted as p 30c3d similarly when the 2 d dfns achieved the percolation threshold the corresponding value of p 30 of the original 3 d dfns is denoted as p 30c2d in this section the theoretical p 30c3d and p 30c2d are proposed by derivation and the relationship between them are investigated 3 1 theoretical p 30c3d the 3 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold when the intersections per fracture i equals to 2 26 huseby et al 1997 eq 8 shows the theoretical calculation method of i which is controlled by p 30 and e d substituting i c3d 2 26 into eq 8 gives 9 p 30c3d 1 8 e 3 d eq 9 shows that the p 30c3d is only related to e d and inversely proportional to its third power 3 2 theoretical p 30c2d for 2 d dfns the intersections per fracture i is determined by p 20 and trace length l as stated above since the 2 d dfns are from cutting planes of an original 3 d dfn p 20 of a 2 d dfn is related to p 30 of the original 3 d dfn as well as l is related to the fracture diameter d when the relationships between the above parameters are clear the intersections per fracture i can be calculated by the parameters of the original 3 d model directly therefore it is possible to describe the percolation threshold of 2 d dfns by p 30c2d firstly the relationship between l and d is studied warburton 1980 considered that the fracture trace length l is the chord length when the disc intersects a certain plane the probability density function pdf of the fracture diameter is c d and the pdf of the trace length is obtained as 10 f l 1 d l c d d d d 2 l 2 where d represents the statistical average value of d however when eq 10 takes the lower limit of the integral the function is singular and requires a special solution and the solution is difficult zhang 2005 in this case a simplified method of finding the diameter by measuring the length of the trace is adopted when the fracture intersects the observation plane the trace can be seen on the plane set the trace the length is l be a chord of the disc as shown in fig 2 the fracture can intersect the plane only when y d 2 and the centers of discs satisfy the uniform distribution zhang 2010 the pdf of y is expressed as 11 f y 1 d 2 y d 2 the average value of y can be obtained by zhang 2005 12 y 0 d 2 2 y d d y d 4 therefore the relationship between the average trace length l and the fracture diameter d can be described as following equation zhang 2010 13 l 3 2 d if the trace length l and fracture diameter d follows a pdf eq 13 can be expressed as 14 e l 3 2 e d eq 14 shows the relationship between trace length l of a 2 d dfn and the fracture diameter d of its original 3 d dfns to describe the percolation threshold of 2 d dfns by p 30c2d the next step is to build the relationship between p 20 and p 30 warburton 1980 derived relationship between p 20 and p 30 when the fracture discs are parallel to each other i e all fractures have a same orientation the analysis model is shown in fig 3 a it should be noted that a n represents the normal vector of the fracture disc and b i represents the vector which is parallel to the plane sampling windows and normal to the trace line in this model the sampling window represents the plane section and intercepted by a skew box warburton 1980 proposed the following statements a the front and back of the box are on the opposite sides and they are both parallel to the sampling window and have a distance d 2 cosθ away from the sampling window if the center of the fracture disc is at the distance the fracture would just touch the sampling window consequently if the fracture disc is to intersect the sampling window its center must be somewhere between the front and back of the box b all the other faces of the box are parallel to the line between the center of the fracture disc and the midpoint of its trace it follows that if the center of the fracture disc is inside the box the midpoint of trace line must be in the portion of the sampling window intercepted by the box see fig 3 b since the intercepted portion are denoted as unit area it is easy to build the relationship between p 30 and p 20 warburton 1980 15 p 20 p 30 0 df d d d cos θ where d is the fracture diameter and f d represents the pdf of fracture diameter θ is the angle of intersection between n and i where n represents the normal vector of fracture disc and i represents the vector which is parallel to the plane and normal to the trace line it should be noted that in warburton s formula eq 15 all the fractures have a same orientation and the angle θ can be considered as a fix value in our study the distribution of fracture orientation is considered and the pdf of θ is denoted as g θ according to eq 15 p 20 can be expressed as 16 p 20 p 30 0 df d d d 0 2 π cos θ g θ d θ the fracture orientations are considered as a uniform distribution on a sphere in our study so eq 16 can be derived as 17 p 20 2 π p 30 e d eq 17 shows that p 20 of 2 d dfns can be represented by p 30 and e d of the original 3 d dfn when p 30 of a 3 d dfn is certain p 20 of its 2 d cutting plane is related to the average fracture diameter e d therefore the relationship between trace length l and fracture diameter d see eq 14 and the relationship between p 20 and p 30 see eq 17 are both clear eq 7 from section 3 shows that intersections per fracture i of a 2 d dfn is controlled by p 20 and l when the 2 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold i c2d 3 57 balberg et al 1984 thus p 30c2d which can describe the percolation threshold of 2 d dfn by the intensity of its original 3 d model is derived by bringing eq 14 eq 17 and i c2d 3 57 into eq 7 18 p 30c2d 11 7 e 3 d eq 18 shows that p 30c2d is only related to e d and inversely proportional to its third power 3 3 relationship between p 30c2d and p 30c3d the theoretical p 30c3d and p 30c2d have been expressed as eq 9 and 18 respectively as the result of the derivation both p 30c3d and p 30c2d are only related to e d and inversely proportional to its third power hence the ratio between them can be expressed as a fix value by combining eq 9 and 18 19 p 30c2d p 30c3d 6 5 eq 19 shows that the corresponding value of p 30 when the 2 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold is much larger than the corresponding value of p 30 when its original 3 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold 4 proposal of verification method to verify the derived theoretical p 30c3d and p 30c2d a series of procedures for the validation by numerical modeling is proposed in this section the fracture diameter is assumed following a uniform distribution particle flow code pfc cundall and strack 1979 and matlab are used in the study 4 1 construction of dfn models the 3 d dfns can be constructed using the dfn module of pfc pfc is a powerful program based on discrete element method and its dfn module provide mature technology to generate dfns in the pfc a l l l box was built as our analysis zone with a same center of the box a dfn was created in a range of 2l 2l 2l note that the generated zone for fractures were expanded to 8 times to reduce the boundary effect zheng et al 2015 the fracture disc center follows the poisson distribution in the zone and its intensity is denoted as p 30 the orientation of fractures obeys a uniform distribution on a sphere the diameter of fracture discs has a normal distribution with a mean diameter of d and a standard deviation of σ d 10 d after the generation of dfns in the box of 2l 2l 2l the whole or the part of fractures that are out of the box of l l l were deleted fig 4 after obtaining the generated 3 d dfn a pair of opposite boundaries is defined as inflow and outflow boundaries fig 5 as shown in fig 5 three cutting planes were respectively set at the top middle and bottom of the box the intersection of a fracture and a cutting plane is a trace and all the traces on a cutting plane form the 2 d dfn 4 2 connectivity analysis as introduced in section 2 the percolation threshold can be determined by judging if a dfn is connected or not as stated above in this study p 30 is selected as the percolation parameter with the increase of p 30 a 3 d dfn and its corresponding 2 d dfns on a cutting plane may become connected from a disconnected state the critical value of p 30 when a dfn turns connected from the disconnected state is the percolation threshold of p 30 the following parts introduce the methods to determine the values of p 30c3d and p 30c2d for a 3 d dfn the algorithm is developed using the fish language of the pfc software to judge if a dfn is connected or not firstly the aim is to search out the all fractures intersected with the inflow boundary after that the computer searches out all fractures intersected with the fractures searched out in the first step for each subsequent step the purpose is to search out all fractures intersected with the fractures searched out in the previous step to ensure the search is full let the number of the iteration be equal to the number n of the fractures since in the extreme case where the fractures are connected one by one n iterations are required all the fractures searched out in any steps are named fracture clusters fig 6 which are marked by displaying the all marked fractures fracture clusters in pfc a connection between the inflow and outflow planes are determined by visual inspection if the clusters intersect the outflow boundary there is a trace on it at least which means the 3 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold fig 6 a otherwise the 3 d dfn is disconnected fig 6 b it is worth noting that there are some existing algorithms which can also accomplish the aforementioned function such as converting the dfn to a graph representation huseby et al 1997 and determining whether vertices representing inflow and outflow fractures exist in the same connected component for a 2 d model the dfn is consisted of traces which are the intersections of fracture discs and a cutting plane since a trace is not a subject which can be directly marked in pfc the trace information was exported to matlab and the code for judging connected states of a 2 d dfn was developed in matlab the same algorithm has been used for 2 d models to search out all the traces direct or indirect connected the inflow boundary all the traces searched out in any steps are named trace clusters fig 7 which are marked by displaying the all marked traces trace clusters in matlab a connection between the inflow and outflow planes are determined by visual inspection if the clusters intersect the outflow boundary the 2 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold fig 7 a otherwise the 2 d dfn is disconnected fig 7 b in this study five 3 d dfn models were repeatedly generated for a specific p 30 for each 3 d dfn model three cutting planes were used to obtain three 2 d dfn models and hence fifteen 2 d dfn models were obtained with respect to each p 30 percolation threshold may be variable in a certain range to determine the percolation threshold p 30c3d and p 30c2d the connected ratio is usually defined as the proportion of connected models to the all 3 d or 2 d models li et al 2020 suggested assigning 50 to the connected ratio i e when 50 3 d models are connected the corresponding value of p 30 is p 30c3d and when 50 2 d models are connected the corresponding value of p 30 is p 30c2d since in this study there are only five and fifteen 3 d and 2 d models respectively both of which are not large the connected ratio is assigned as 100 there are two steps to determinate the p 30c3d and p 30c2d in the first step δp 30i is set as a relatively large value note that δp 30i is the increment of p 30 of each iteration step with the increase of p 30 the 3d and 2d dfns become connected and a rough p 30c3d and p 30c2d have been obtained respectively however the above p 30c3d and p 30c2d may not accurate since δp 30d is large the second step is to obtain a specific p 30c3d and p 30c2d in this step δp 30d is set as a relatively small value not that δp 30d is the decrement of p 30 of each iteration step the decrement begins from above p 30c3d and p 30c2d respectively if when p 30 x connected ratio is 100 as well as when p 30 x δp 30d connected ratio is less than 100 x is regarded as the specific percolation threshold the reason for us rather having two steps to obtain the specific percolation threshold than using a small δp 30i is to reduce the amount of data calculation 5 validation of theoretical p 30 at percolation threshold of 3 d and 2 d dfns 5 1 numerical models to verify the theoretical p 30c3d and p 30c2d proposed in section 3 the procedures introduced in section 4 are used the length of analysis zone l is assigned as 10 m different fracture sizes are adopted in the numerical experiments the fracture diameters in each group of models satisfy the normal distribution with mean values d 1 1 5 and 2 m and standard deviation σ d 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 m for each group the 3 d dfn model are repeatedly generated with 5 different random seed note that there are three groups of geometric parameters of fractures and with respect to each group five 3 d dfn models are repeatedly generated after determining the above parameters only the value of p 30 is required to be determined for a dfn the initial p 30 starts from 0 5 m 3 the increment δp 30i is set as 0 5 m 3 and the decrement δp 30d is set as 0 1 m 3 the parameters for 3 d dfn models of groups 1 3 are summarized in table 1 5 2 results and analysis for three different analysis group table 1 the predicted values of p 30c3d and p 20c3d along with the real values are given in figs 8 and 9 it should be noted that a the predicted values of p 30c3d are obtained by eq 9 b the predicted values of p 30c2d are given by eq 20 and c the calculated p 30c3d and p 30c2d are regard as their real values the procedures to obtain p 30 at percolation threshold are mentioned in section 4 according to these two figures it is not difficult to find that the predicted results are quite fit to further quantitatively compare the predicted and real values the error rates of p 30c3d and p 30c2d are computed and the results are plotted in fig 10 fig 10 shows that the error rates are around 10 except for the predicted value of p 30c3d when d 2 m when d 2 m the error rate of predicted values of p 30c3d is 25 but the actual value of difference between predicted value and real value is only 0 075 m 3 fig 8 the reason for this large error rate is that the decrement of step 2 δp 30d see section 4 is relatively not small enough other error rates are around 10 which are regarded to be acceptable fig 11 shows the predicted and real values of p 30c2d p 30c3d note that the predicted values are given by eq 21 it is worth noting that the values from numerical model regard as the real value from fig 11 the predicted and real values are close when d 1 or 1 5 m when d 2 m the real values are relatively lower because of the same reason on the large error rate of p 30c3d in the same situation 6 conclusion because of the difficulty of hydraulic analysis for 3 d dfns most studies focus on the hydraulic behavior of fractured rock masses using 2 d dfns the finding from 2 d dfns may not well reflect the hydraulic properties of a 3 d rock mass this study focuses on the relationship on the interconnectivity between the 3 d dfn and its 2 d cutting planes in this paper we compared the percolation threshold of a 3 d dfn and its corresponding three 2 d dfns from the perspective of percolation since p 30 is a commonly used parameter for a dfn model it is selected as the percolation parameter in this study the theoretical p 30 at percolation threshold for 3 d dfns and its 2 d cutting planes of isotropic fractured rock masses are introduced both of which are only related to the diameter of fracture discs based on that the theoretical relationship between the percolation threshold of 3 d dfn and its 2 d cutting planes are discussed the theoretical formulas show that a p 30 at percolation threshold are inversely proportional to the third power of the expected value of the fracture diameter and b the corresponding value of p 30 when 2 d dfns achieves the percolation threshold is 6 5 times of the corresponding value of p 30 when its original 3 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold a procedure was developed in pfc and matlab to test 3d dfn realizations and 2d cuts and the conclusion is that the numerical results reflected the theoretical values within 10 the fractured rock masses in our study are considered as tight where the rock matrix itself contributes negligibly to flow the fracture in our study is isotropic and we will expend our research to anisotropic fractured rock masses in

3378,water shortages are becoming increasingly serious around the world the concept of the water footprint provides a new method for evaluating the consumption of regional water resources we evaluated the spatial variation in the level of urbanisation for provinces in china and analysed the influences of urbanisation on regional water footprints from the perspectives of both production and consumption our results indicated that 1 the urbanisation evaluation score was highest for guangdong 0 759 and lowest for tibet 0 071 and the values were 0 424 0 270 and 0 179 for eastern central and western china respectively 2 the water footprint of production was largest for xinjiang 35 55 109 m3 the water footprint of consumption was largest for shandong 8 03 109 m3 and the agricultural sector consumed the most water in 80 of the provinces and 3 most urbanisation indicators were significantly correlated with the water footprints and the impacts of urbanisation indices on specific sectors water footprints were different the urbanisation development in china could be influenced by natural resources population industrial structure policy etc to achieve a relative balance development the focus of local government should be specific considering the significant role of the agricultural sector in regional water consumption measures such as planting new water saving varieties and using advanced irrigation technologies could be adapted the level of urbanisation will likely increase in the future so more water resources will be needed for production and consumption measures such as improving water use efficiency controlling land expansion and adjusting industrial structure should be taken this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of urbanisation on regional water consumption and will contribute to the development of better practices for managing water resources keywords urbanisation water footprint production consumption china 1 introduction water is of great significance for human survival and regional sustainable development while the gap between water supply and water demand is becoming larger and larger for many regions around the world kummu et al 2016 hoekstra et al 2011 proposed the concept of the water footprint which provided a new way to analyse the blue green and grey water consumption for specific regions a country a province a city or others during a certain time period one year or others from the perspectives of both production and consumption the water footprint of production is defined as the volume of water consumed for the production of products or for services within a study area and the water footprint of consumption is defined as the volume of water used to produce the products or services consumed by the inhabitants of a study area ercin et al 2013 hoekstra et al 2011 liu et al 2015 many studies have tried to analyse the impacts of various variables on regional water resources using the concept of the water footprint govere et al 2020 explored the influence of climate change on the blue water consumption considering the crop cultivation process nouri et al 2019 evaluated the role of mulching and drip irrigation in decreasing the volume of the blue water footprint palhares et al 2021 established the water footprint of the animal production system and considered the influence of diet pattern for china the largest developing country its water footprint has been studied across different sectors fan et al 2019 lee et al 2021 pang et al 2021 yu and ding 2021 zhao et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 and three water resource types have been included ma et al 2018a b zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 xu et al 2020 analysed the influence of socio economic pathway on future water footprint sun et al 2021 evaluated the influence of carbon taxes on regional water footprint with the help of an input output model in addition the impacts of climate factors ye et al 2019 agricultural input chen et al 2020 and plastic mulching wang et al 2022 on the volume of water footprint in crop cultivation in china were estimated the urbanisation rate of china is accelerating and many studies about the urbanisation of china have been conducted cui et al 2019 evaluated the sustainability of urbanization ahmad et al 2019 explored the interactions between urbanization and energy consumption economic growth and co2 emissions in addition the influences of urbanization on environmental pollution and ecosystem services were studied by liang and yang 2019 and wang et al 2019 respectively however few studies have demonstrated the influence of urbanisation on regional water footprints considering both production and consumption perspectives at the same time we first analysed the spatial variation in the level of urbanisation for provinces in china and four urbanisation indices population economic land and social urbanisation were included we then calculated the water footprints of production and consumption by sectors lastly we determined the impacts of urbanisation on the water footprint of production and the water footprint of consumption this study could contribute to the development of better practices for managing water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 methods 2 1 1 urbanisation evaluation score in this study the urbanisation evaluation score could represent the regional urbanisation level showing the transformation from a traditional rural society dominated by agriculture to a modern urban society dominated by industry and service industry due to the development of science and technology the adjustment of industrial structure etc li 2014 the urbanisation evaluation score is ranged from 0 to 1 the higher the score the higher the regional urbanisation level we analysed the urbanisation level from four perspectives population economic land and social urbanisation indices evaluating urbanisation level were chosen based on previous studies chen et al 2009 zeng et al 2020 and data availability table 1 the urbanisation evaluation score was calculated based on the normalised value for each index and the corresponding weight chen 2021 liang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 1 s i j 1 m x ij w j where s i is the urbanisation evaluation score for province i and i 1 2 3 n x ij is the normalised value for index j in province i and j 1 2 3 m w j is the weight of index j the data were normalised using 2 x ij x ij min x 1 j x nj max x 1 j x nj min x 1 j x nj where x ij is the original value for index j in province i i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 m the weight for each index was determined using the entropy method chen 2021 liang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 the weight for index j depends on the value of its entropy e j the smaller the entropy the larger the weight 3 w j 1 e j j 1 m 1 e j the entropy for index j e j was calculated as 4 e j i 1 n p ij ln p ij ln n 5 p ij x ij i 1 n x ij where p ij is the proportion of normalised value in province i to the total value in all provinces for index j 2 1 2 water footprints of production and consumption the water footprint of production was calculated as follows hoekstra et al 2011 and four sectors were included 6 w f pro w f pro agr w f pro ind w f pro dom w f pro eco where w f pro is the total water footprint of production m3 while w f pro agr w f pro ind w f pro dom and w f pro eco are the water footprints of production for the agricultural industrial domestic and ecological sectors respectively m3 in this study the water footprint of the ecological sector means the water consumed due to artificial recharge to some rivers lakes and wetlands for environmental and ecological use ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 7 w f pro agr i 1 n k 1 r v w c ki o ki where vw c ki is the virtual water content for product k in province i m3 kg whose value was based on mekonnen and hoekstra 2010a b o ki is the output volume for product k in province i kg and r is the kind of product in this study nine types of farm products wheat corn rice beans tubers oil bearing crops sugar crops vegetables fruits and six types animal products pork beef mutton poultry milk and eggs were included and 99 of output for farm and animal products was occupied by these 15 kinds of products 8 w f pro ind w w ind δ ind w f pro dom w w dom δ dom w f pro eco w w eco δ eco where w w ind w w dom and w w eco are the water withdrawals for the industrial domestic and ecological sectors respectively and δ ind δ dom and δ eco are the coefficients of water consumption for these three sectors respectively the water footprint of consumption was calculated as hoekstra et al 2011 9 w f con w f con agr w f con ind w f con dom w f con eco where w f con is the total water footprint of consumption m3 w f con agr w f con ind w f con dom and w f con eco are the water footprints of consumption for the agricultural industrial domestic and ecological sectors respectively m3 due to the fact that consumed agricultural products could be supplied locally or be traded from other areas the water footprint of consumption for the agricultural sector could be obtained by summing two parts 10 w f con agr i 1 n k 1 r v w c

i m3 kg the agricultural products considered here were as same as those in the calculation of the water footprint of production considering the data availability in this study we assumed that when the product consumption could not be met locally product trading occurs only trades between provinces of china were considered in this study considering the data availability vw c ki could be calculated as follows 11 vw c ki i 1 n k 1 r v w c ki max o ki c ki 0 i 1 n k 1 r max o ki c ki 0 for the industrial domestic and ecological sectors the water footprint of consumption could be calculated as 12 w

we assumed that the volume of water embedded in industrial production was proportional to its value hoekstra et al 2011 liu et al 2018a all water consumption for the domestic and ecological sectors was assumed to be related to the consumption behaviour of local habitants due to the lack of data 2 2 data sources the national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2016 provided the data on population urbanisation proportion of urban population of the total population economic urbanisation gross regional product percentage of secondary and tertiary industries of the gross regional product land urbanisation area of built up districts per capita public green areas per capita area of paved roads and social urbanisation number of public transportation vehicles per 10 000 population collections of public libraries owned per person beds of medical institutions per 1000 population number of students per 100 000 population for higher educational levels data on the production and consumption of products the living expenditure and the revenue from sales of industrial products were also obtained from the national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2016 and the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 2015 data on water withdrawals and the water consumption ratio were obtained from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 3 results 3 1 urbanisation evaluation score fig 1 shows the level of urbanisation for regions in china the urbanisation evaluation score was highest for guangdong 0 759 followed by jiangsu 0 677 and shandong 0 651 about 2 3 of the provinces had an urbanisation evaluation score 0 30 the urbanisation level was lowest for tibet with an urbanisation evaluation score of 0 071 population economic land and social urbanisation were included to demonstrate the regional levels of urbanisation guangdong and tibet had the highest and lowest evaluation scores based on population respectively considering the regional economic level the largest and smallest score owners were same eight provinces had economic urbanisation evaluation scores 0 10 and seven provinces had population urbanisation scores 0 10 the land urbanisation evaluation score was highest for guangdong 0 250 and lowest for qinghai 0 020 the social urbanisation evaluation score was highest for shanghai 0 207 followed by beijing and tianjin the urbanisation levels in the regions of china differed greatly with the urbanisation evaluation score more than ten fold higher for guangdong than for tibet thus two different grouping methods were used to analyse the urbanisation level of china fig 2 which might be helpful in forming relative general policies or suggestions in fig 2 a the provinces of china were divided into three groups eastern central and western china the comprehensive urbanisation level was highest for eastern china 0 424 followed by central china 0 270 and was lowest for western china 0 179 for population economic and land urbanisation levels the situations were the same as that for the comprehensive urbanisation level an anova analysis of variance for different urbanisation indices in eastern central and western china was conducted and the results are shown in table 2 as can be seen from the p value the differences for comprehensive population and economic urbanisation levels among eastern central and western china were significant at the 0 01 level the differences for land and social urbanisation levels among eastern central and western china were significant at the 0 05 level the comprehensive urbanisation scores for southern and northern china were 0 319 and 0 269 respectively fig 2 b considering the population economic land and social urbanisation levels the differences between southern and northern china were relatively small which were 0 017 0 024 0 009 and 0 001 respectively the p values in table 3 were 0 05 demonstrating that the differences for urbanisation level among southern and northern china were not significant 3 2 water footprints of production and consumption fig 3 presents the spatial distributions of the water footprints of production in china xinjiang had the largest water footprint of production 35 55 109 m3 nine other provinces shandong henan hebei jiangsu heilongjiang inner mongolia anhui sichuan and hubei had water footprints of production 10 109 m3 accounting for about two thirds of the consumption of water resources associated with production the water footprints of production for tibet and qinghai were 1 109 m3 most of the water consumption was related to agricultural production for regions of china beijing shanghai zhejiang fujian and guangdong excluded comparing the values of the water footprint of production for different sectors the values of the water footprint of production for the industrial sector ranged from 32 48 106 m3 tibet to 5 54 109 m3 jiangsu the largest water footprints of production for the domestic and ecological sectors were in guangdong and inner mongolia respectively the water footprint of consumption was largest for shandong 8 03 109 m3 followed by guangdong 8 00 109 m3 fig 4 four provinces had water footprints of consumption 10 109 m3 ningxia hainan qinghai and tibet the total water footprint of consumption for these four regions was no more than one third of that for shandong for the agricultural sector the largest and smallest water footprints of consumption were 6 71 109 m3 in xinjiang and 0 19 109 m3 in tibet most of the provinces of china had a water footprint 1 109 m3 due to consumption in the industrial or ecological sector the smallest water footprint of consumption for the domestic sector in tibet was 2 of the largest value in guangdong 3 3 impacts of the urbanisation indices on the water footprints the correlation between the water footprint of production and the comprehensive urbanisation index was significant at p 0 05 table 4 population and economic urbanisation were significantly correlated with water consumption due to production the correlation between land urbanisation and the water footprint of production was significant at p 0 01 the water footprint of consumption was significantly correlated with the comprehensive urbanisation index at p 0 001 correlations were similar between the water footprint of consumption and population economic and land urbanisation in tables 5 and 6 linear regression analyses were conduct for urbanisation indices and water footprint for specific sectors the impacts of different urbanisation indices on specific sectors water footprints could be positive or negative which can be seen from the values for coefficients of different urbanisation indices comparing the absolute values for these coefficients we can find that the water footprint due to industrial production was mainly related to economic urbanisation 1 917 while the water footprint of production for the domestic sector was mainly related to population urbanisation 1 058 table 5 for the water footprint of consumption related to the industrial sector the role of land urbanisation was larger than population economic and social urbanisation table 6 4 discussion the urbanisation levels in the provinces of china differed greatly and eastern china has a relatively higher level than central and western china which is mainly due to the fact that most of the natural resources people and industries are located in eastern china policies such as the reform and opening up policy have also made a contribution to the urbanisation development in eastern china meng et al 2020 comparing the values of population economic land and social urbanisation indices we found that the index with the lowest value differed amongst the provinces for tibet it was the population urbanisation index while for shanghai and beijing it was the land urbanisation index to achieve a relative balance development the focus of the local governments should be specific for example more industrial factories could be built in provinces such as qinghai and ningxia which could contribute to the increase in regional gross domestic product and the improvement of economic urbanisation level in addition the regional urbanisation process should be matched with the distribution of natural resources such as the water and land resources for sustainable urbanisation development liu et al 2018b tang et al 2020 the water consumptions for china from both the production perspective and the consumption perspective were calculated in this study and the values for specific sectors have been included according to our study the total water footprint of production was 271 49 109 m3 and the result for wang and yang 2018 was 0 25 1012 m3 the former was 8 60 larger than the latter in the study of wang and yang 2018 the input output analysis was used and 26 sectors were considered which was different from our sector classification method the water footprints related to the production of wheat and corn in the north china plain hebei beijing and tianjin were estimated by ge et al 2010 and the values were 102 5 108 m3 and 26 92 108 m3 respectively in our study the values were 103 22 108 m3 and 25 46 108 m3 respectively denoting a difference of 0 70 and 5 44 considering the significant role of the agricultural sector in regional water consumption measures such as planting new water saving varieties and using advanced irrigation technologies could be adopted liu et al 2017 vanham et al 2016 yang et al 2016 for the perspective of consumption zheng et al 2019 found that the water footprint due to food consumption was 639 8 108 m3 for china in 2015 and it was 624 11 108 m3 in our study with a difference of 2 45 compared with our study china was treated as a whole and the differences in virtual water content for each kind of food among the provinces were ignored by zheng et al 2019 which may have contributed to the difference between the results the comprehensive urbanisation index was positively correlated with both the water footprint of production and that water footprint of consumption this was mainly due to the fact that with the increasing regional urbanisation level more and more products and services were needed by the inhabitants and the types of products and services the inhabitants wanted might have changed from water extensive ones to water intensive ones as a result more water resources were consumed both from the production perspective and the consumption perspective this could be observed from the change in food pattern in china ercin and hoekstra 2014 kim et al 2020 how to balance the limited water resources and the rapid regional urbanisation development should be paid more attention the influences of different urbanisation indices on specific sectors water footprints were different thus different measures should be taken in controlling the water footprints of certain sectors for the agricultural sector more attention should be paid to the land expansion including that caused by the increasing of water use efficiency which is known as jevons paradox alcott 2005 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 for the industrial sector the adjustment of industrial structure is one of the measures that we could take the indices that we used in this study to calculate regional urbanisation level were chosen based on previous studies and data availability thus the results for urbanisation level may be different due to the change in urbanisation indices for the calculation of water footprint the industrial domestic and ecological sectors were treated as a whole in future research more details should be considered in addition the trade patterns for agricultural products were assumed to be ideal due to the data availability which may be different from the actual situation in addition only blue water was included in this study considering its important role in china s water management zhang et al 2020 in future green water schyns et al 2019 and grey water chini et al 2020 should also be taken into account 5 conclusions we evaluated the spatial variations in urbanisation level and water footprints for the provinces of china and then determined the impact of urbanisation on the water footprints the highest and lowest urbanisation scores were for guangdong and tibet respectively the comprehensive urbanisation level was in the order of eastern china central china western china and southern china northern china the urbanisation development in china could be influenced by natural resources population industrial structure policy etc to achieve a relative balance development the focus of the local governments should be specific about two thirds of the water consumed for production were in provinces where the water footprint was 10 109 m3 the water footprint of consumption was largest for shandong and agriculture was the largest water consumer in most provinces in terms of both the production and consumption perspectives measures such as planting new water saving varieties and using advanced irrigation technologies could be adopted most of the urbanisation indices were significantly positively correlated with the regional water footprint and the impacts of urbanisation indices on specific sectors water footprints were different the level of urbanisation will likely increase in the future so more water resources will be needed for production and consumption measures such as improving water use efficiency controlling land expansion and adjusting industrial structure should be taken funding this work was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china no

3378,water shortages are becoming increasingly serious around the world the concept of the water footprint provides a new method for evaluating the consumption of regional water resources we evaluated the spatial variation in the level of urbanisation for provinces in china and analysed the influences of urbanisation on regional water footprints from the perspectives of both production and consumption our results indicated that 1 the urbanisation evaluation score was highest for guangdong 0 759 and lowest for tibet 0 071 and the values were 0 424 0 270 and 0 179 for eastern central and western china respectively 2 the water footprint of production was largest for xinjiang 35 55 109 m3 the water footprint of consumption was largest for shandong 8 03 109 m3 and the agricultural sector consumed the most water in 80 of the provinces and 3 most urbanisation indicators were significantly correlated with the water footprints and the impacts of urbanisation indices on specific sectors water footprints were different the urbanisation development in china could be influenced by natural resources population industrial structure policy etc to achieve a relative balance development the focus of local government should be specific considering the significant role of the agricultural sector in regional water consumption measures such as planting new water saving varieties and using advanced irrigation technologies could be adapted the level of urbanisation will likely increase in the future so more water resources will be needed for production and consumption measures such as improving water use efficiency controlling land expansion and adjusting industrial structure should be taken this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of urbanisation on regional water consumption and will contribute to the development of better practices for managing water resources keywords urbanisation water footprint production consumption china 1 introduction water is of great significance for human survival and regional sustainable development while the gap between water supply and water demand is becoming larger and larger for many regions around the world kummu et al 2016 hoekstra et al 2011 proposed the concept of the water footprint which provided a new way to analyse the blue green and grey water consumption for specific regions a country a province a city or others during a certain time period one year or others from the perspectives of both production and consumption the water footprint of production is defined as the volume of water consumed for the production of products or for services within a study area and the water footprint of consumption is defined as the volume of water used to produce the products or services consumed by the inhabitants of a study area ercin et al 2013 hoekstra et al 2011 liu et al 2015 many studies have tried to analyse the impacts of various variables on regional water resources using the concept of the water footprint govere et al 2020 explored the influence of climate change on the blue water consumption considering the crop cultivation process nouri et al 2019 evaluated the role of mulching and drip irrigation in decreasing the volume of the blue water footprint palhares et al 2021 established the water footprint of the animal production system and considered the influence of diet pattern for china the largest developing country its water footprint has been studied across different sectors fan et al 2019 lee et al 2021 pang et al 2021 yu and ding 2021 zhao et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 and three water resource types have been included ma et al 2018a b zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 xu et al 2020 analysed the influence of socio economic pathway on future water footprint sun et al 2021 evaluated the influence of carbon taxes on regional water footprint with the help of an input output model in addition the impacts of climate factors ye et al 2019 agricultural input chen et al 2020 and plastic mulching wang et al 2022 on the volume of water footprint in crop cultivation in china were estimated the urbanisation rate of china is accelerating and many studies about the urbanisation of china have been conducted cui et al 2019 evaluated the sustainability of urbanization ahmad et al 2019 explored the interactions between urbanization and energy consumption economic growth and co2 emissions in addition the influences of urbanization on environmental pollution and ecosystem services were studied by liang and yang 2019 and wang et al 2019 respectively however few studies have demonstrated the influence of urbanisation on regional water footprints considering both production and consumption perspectives at the same time we first analysed the spatial variation in the level of urbanisation for provinces in china and four urbanisation indices population economic land and social urbanisation were included we then calculated the water footprints of production and consumption by sectors lastly we determined the impacts of urbanisation on the water footprint of production and the water footprint of consumption this study could contribute to the development of better practices for managing water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 methods 2 1 1 urbanisation evaluation score in this study the urbanisation evaluation score could represent the regional urbanisation level showing the transformation from a traditional rural society dominated by agriculture to a modern urban society dominated by industry and service industry due to the development of science and technology the adjustment of industrial structure etc li 2014 the urbanisation evaluation score is ranged from 0 to 1 the higher the score the higher the regional urbanisation level we analysed the urbanisation level from four perspectives population economic land and social urbanisation indices evaluating urbanisation level were chosen based on previous studies chen et al 2009 zeng et al 2020 and data availability table 1 the urbanisation evaluation score was calculated based on the normalised value for each index and the corresponding weight chen 2021 liang et al 2019 wu et al

the data were normalised using 2 x ij x ij min x 1 j x nj max x 1 j x nj min x 1 j x nj where x ij is the original value for index j in province i i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 m the weight for each index was determined using the entropy method chen 2021 liang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 the weight for index j depends on the value of its entropy e j the smaller the entropy the larger the weight 3 w j 1 e j j 1 m 1 e j the entropy for index j e j was calculated as 4 e j i 1 n p ij ln p ij ln n 5 p ij x ij i 1 n x ij where p ij is the proportion of normalised value in province i to the total value in all provinces for index j 2 1 2 water footprints of production and consumption the water footprint of production was calculated as follows hoekstra et al 2011 and four sectors were included 6 w f pro w f

for the agricultural industrial domestic and ecological sectors respectively m3 in this study the water footprint of the ecological sector means the water consumed due to artificial recharge to some rivers lakes and wetlands for environmental and ecological use ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 7 w f pro agr i 1 n k 1 r v w c ki o ki where vw c ki is the virtual water content for product k in province i m3 kg whose value was based on mekonnen and hoekstra 2010a b o ki is the output volume for product k in province i kg and r is the kind of product in this study nine types of farm products wheat corn rice beans tubers oil bearing crops sugar crops vegetables fruits and six types animal products pork beef mutton poultry milk and eggs were included and 99

the water withdrawals for the industrial domestic and ecological sectors respectively and δ ind δ dom and δ eco are the coefficients of water consumption for these three sectors respectively the water footprint of consumption was calculated as hoekstra et al 2011 9 w f con w f con agr w f con ind w f con dom w f con eco where w f con is the total water footprint of consumption m3 w f con agr w f con ind w f con dom and w f con eco are the water footprints of consumption for the agricultural industrial domestic and ecological sectors respectively m3 due to the fact that consumed agricultural products could be supplied locally or be traded from other areas the water footprint of consumption for the agricultural sector could be obtained by summing two parts 10 w f con agr i 1 n k 1 r v w c

we assumed that the volume of water embedded in industrial production was proportional to its value hoekstra et al 2011 liu et al 2018a all water consumption for the domestic and ecological sectors was assumed to be related to the consumption behaviour of local habitants due to the lack of data 2 2 data sources the national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2016 provided the data on population urbanisation proportion of urban population of the total population economic urbanisation gross regional product percentage of secondary and tertiary industries of the gross

population urbanisation scores 0 10 the land urbanisation evaluation score was highest for guangdong 0 250 and lowest for qinghai 0 020 the social urbanisation evaluation score was highest for shanghai 0 207 followed by beijing and tianjin the urbanisation levels in the regions of china differed greatly with the urbanisation evaluation score more than ten fold higher for guangdong than for tibet thus two different grouping methods were used to analyse the urbanisation level of china fig 2 which might be helpful in forming relative general policies or suggestions in fig 2 a the provinces of china were divided into three groups eastern central and western china the comprehensive urbanisation level was highest for eastern china 0 424 followed by central china 0 270 and was lowest for western china 0 179 for population economic and land urbanisation levels the situations were the same as that for the comprehensive urbanisation level an anova analysis of variance for different urbanisation indices in eastern central and western china was conducted and the results are shown in table 2 as can be seen from the p value the differences for comprehensive population and economic urbanisation levels among eastern central and western china were significant at the 0 01 level the differences for land and social urbanisation levels among eastern central and western china were significant at the 0 05 level the comprehensive urbanisation scores for southern and northern china were 0 319 and 0 269 respectively fig 2 b considering the population economic land and social urbanisation levels the differences between southern and northern china were relatively small which were 0 017 0 024 0 009 and 0 001 respectively the p values in table 3 were 0 05 demonstrating that the differences for urbanisation level among southern and northern china were not significant 3 2 water footprints of production and consumption fig 3 presents the spatial distributions of the water footprints of production in china xinjiang had the largest water footprint of production 35 55 109 m3 nine other provinces shandong henan hebei jiangsu heilongjiang inner mongolia anhui sichuan and hubei had water footprints of production 10 109 m3 accounting for about two thirds of the consumption of water resources associated with production the water footprints of production for tibet and qinghai were 1 109 m3 most of the water consumption was related to agricultural production for regions of china beijing shanghai zhejiang fujian and guangdong excluded comparing the values of the water footprint of production for different sectors the values of the water footprint of production for the industrial sector ranged from 32 48 106 m3 tibet to 5 54 109 m3 jiangsu the largest water footprints of production for the domestic and ecological sectors were in guangdong and inner mongolia respectively the water footprint of consumption was largest for shandong 8 03 109 m3 followed by guangdong 8 00 109 m3 fig 4 four provinces had water footprints of consumption 10 109 m3 ningxia hainan qinghai and tibet the total water footprint of consumption for these four regions was no more than one third of that for shandong for the agricultural sector the largest and smallest water footprints of consumption were 6 71 109 m3 in xinjiang and 0 19 109 m3 in tibet most of the provinces of china had a water footprint 1 109 m3 due to consumption in the industrial or ecological sector the smallest water footprint of consumption for the domestic sector in tibet was 2 of the largest value in guangdong 3 3 impacts of the urbanisation indices on the water footprints the correlation between the water footprint of production and the comprehensive urbanisation index was significant at p 0 05 table 4 population and economic urbanisation were significantly correlated with water consumption due to production the correlation between land urbanisation and the water footprint of production was significant at p 0 01 the water footprint of consumption was significantly correlated with the comprehensive urbanisation index at p 0 001 correlations were similar between the water footprint of consumption and population economic and land urbanisation in tables 5 and 6 linear regression analyses were conduct for urbanisation indices and water footprint for specific sectors the impacts of different urbanisation indices on specific sectors water footprints could be positive or negative which can be seen from the values for coefficients of different urbanisation indices comparing the absolute values for these coefficients we can find that the water footprint due to industrial production was mainly related to economic urbanisation 1 917 while the water footprint of production for the domestic sector was mainly related to population urbanisation 1 058 table 5 for the water footprint of consumption related to the industrial sector the role of land urbanisation was larger than population economic and social urbanisation table 6 4 discussion the urbanisation levels in the provinces of china differed greatly and eastern china has a relatively higher level than central and western china which is mainly due to the fact that most of the natural resources people and industries are located in eastern china policies such as the reform and opening up policy have also made a contribution to the urbanisation development in eastern china meng et al 2020 comparing the values of population economic land and social urbanisation indices we found that the index with the lowest value differed amongst the provinces for tibet it was the population urbanisation index while for shanghai and beijing it was the land urbanisation index to achieve a relative balance development the focus of the local governments should be specific for example more industrial factories could be built in provinces such as qinghai and ningxia which could contribute to the increase in regional gross domestic product and the improvement of economic urbanisation level in addition the regional urbanisation process should be matched with the distribution of natural resources such as the water and land resources for sustainable urbanisation development liu et al 2018b tang et al 2020 the water consumptions for china from both the production perspective and the consumption perspective were calculated in this study and the values for specific sectors have been included according to our study the total water footprint of production was 271 49 109 m3 and the result for wang and yang 2018 was 0 25 1012 m3 the former was 8 60 larger than the latter in the study of wang and yang 2018 the input output analysis was used and 26 sectors were considered which was different from our sector classification method the water footprints related to the production of wheat and corn in the north china plain hebei beijing and tianjin were estimated by ge et al 2010 and the values were 102 5 108 m3 and 26 92 108 m3 respectively in our study the values were 103 22 108 m3 and 25 46 108 m3 respectively denoting a difference of 0 70 and 5 44 considering the significant role of the agricultural sector in regional water consumption measures such as planting new water saving varieties and using advanced irrigation technologies could be adopted liu et al 2017 vanham et al 2016 yang et al 2016 for the perspective of consumption zheng et al 2019 found that the water footprint due to food consumption was 639 8 108 m3 for china in 2015 and it was 624 11 108 m3 in our study with a difference of 2 45 compared with our study china was treated as a whole and the differences in virtual water content for each kind of food among the provinces were ignored by zheng et al 2019 which may have contributed to the difference between the results the comprehensive urbanisation index was positively correlated with both the water footprint of production and that water footprint of consumption this was mainly due to the fact that with the increasing regional urbanisation level more and more products and services were needed by the inhabitants and the types of products and services the inhabitants wanted might have changed from water extensive ones to water intensive ones as a result more water resources were consumed both from the production perspective and the consumption perspective this could be observed from the change in food pattern in china ercin and hoekstra 2014 kim et al 2020 how to balance the limited water resources and the rapid regional urbanisation development should be paid more attention the influences of different urbanisation indices on specific sectors water footprints were different thus different measures should be taken in controlling the water footprints of certain sectors for the agricultural sector more attention should be paid to the land expansion including that caused by the increasing of water use efficiency which is known as jevons paradox alcott 2005 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 for the industrial sector the adjustment of industrial structure is one of the measures that we could take the indices that we used in this study to calculate regional urbanisation level were chosen based on previous studies and data availability thus the results for urbanisation level may be different due to the change in urbanisation indices for the calculation of water footprint the industrial domestic and ecological sectors were treated as a whole in future research more details should be considered in addition the trade patterns for agricultural products were assumed to be ideal due to the data availability which may be different from the actual situation in addition only blue water was included in this study considering its important role in china s water management zhang et al 2020 in future green water schyns et al 2019 and grey water chini et al 2020 should also be taken into account 5 conclusions we evaluated the spatial variations in urbanisation level and water footprints for the provinces of china and then determined the impact of urbanisation on the water footprints the highest and lowest urbanisation scores were for guangdong and tibet respectively the comprehensive urbanisation level was in the order of eastern china central china western china and southern china northern china the urbanisation development in china could be influenced by natural resources population industrial structure policy etc to achieve a relative balance development the focus of the local governments should be specific about two thirds of the water consumed for production were in provinces where the water footprint was 10 109 m3 the water footprint of consumption was largest for shandong and agriculture was the largest water consumer in most provinces in terms of both the production and consumption perspectives measures such as planting new water saving varieties and using advanced irrigation technologies could be adopted most of the urbanisation indices were significantly positively correlated with the regional water footprint and the impacts of urbanisation indices on specific sectors water footprints were different the level of urbanisation will likely increase in the future so more water resources will be needed for production and consumption measures such as improving water use efficiency controlling land expansion and adjusting industrial structure should be taken funding this work was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china no

3379,the quantitative study of vadose zone water i e the water contained in the rock formation between the ground surface and the groundwater level is of vital importance for understanding the groundwater flow mechanism mass exchange and circulation however the vadose zone is closely related to the saturated zone and it is difficult to directly observe the vadose zone water causing the quantitative separation of the vadose zone water storage to be a challenging problem considering the insufficient spatial resolution of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace we draw on the practice of converting the observed groundwater level changes into the water storage changes in the study of groundwater storage changes using grace data and propose a new method for implementing the quantitative separation of vadose zone water storage changes based on a single superconducting gravimeter and groundwater level observation data this new method is validated with measurement data collected using a superconducting gravimeter gwr c032 at the national geodetic observation station in wuhan china wuhan sg station and groundwater level observation data obtained during the same period the calculation results show that the changes in the vadose zone water storage obtained using the superconductive gravity technique are in good agreement with that obtained using the local hydrological modeling method indicating that the quantitative separation of the changes in the local vadose zone water storage can be achieved using superconductive gravity and groundwater level observations during the study period from may 2008 to april 2010 the peak to peak changes of the vadose zone water storage at wuhan sg station reached 1580 mm and the seasonal variations were the inverse of the variations of the total groundwater storage changes and the saturated zone water storage changes indicating that the vadose zone plays a pronounced role in slowing down the total groundwater storage changes keywords quantitative separation of groundwater storage changes vadose zone superconductive gravity technique hydrological gravity effect of groundwater storage changes groundwater level observations 1 introduction the vadose zone also known as the unsaturated zone is usually defined as the porous medium between the ground surface and the groundwater level in the first unconfined aquifer stephens 2018 the vadose zone serves as a bridge and link between water systems such as atmospheric water vegetation water surface water and groundwater and thus the quantitative study of its water storage changes is of great significance for groundwater recharge water quality protection and regional and even global water mass exchange and circulation mayfield et al 2021 arora et al 2019 nimmo 2006 however it is difficult to accurately quantify the vadose zone water storage changes wscvz using soil water measurements from only a limited number of locations in the vadose zone because the subsurface space is not fully accessible christiansen et al 2011b this could also not be accomplished simply relying on groundwater table levels or the total water storage below the soil surface the currently available instruments for measuring the water content and flow in the vadose zone including tensiometers soil moisture meters and suction lysimeters can only measure small spatial extents of tens to hundreds of cubic centimeters izbicki et al 2008 moreover equipment and labor costs usually limit the installation depth of these instruments to very near the surface 1 2 m binley et al 2015 therefore traditional subsurface observations are limited in scale and are unable to cover the entire spatial extents of the vadose zone thus failing to reflect the spatial inhomogeneity of the water content in this zone this issue and the limitations on the depth of instrument placement have made the quantitative estimation of deep wscvz an intractable problem kennedy et al 2016 creutzfeldt et al 2010a currently quantitative estimations of wscvz using global or local hydrological models are faced with the following two difficulties 1 it is difficult to apply global hydrological models to the quantitative study of vadose zones water storage changes in a local scale for example the noah model in the global land data assimilation system gldas can be used to assess changes in the global environment including precipitation snowfall evapotranspiration soil moisture surface runoff and subsurface runoff with a spatial resolution of up to 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 h providing very valuable model data for earth science research rodell et al 2004 however the depth of the soil water in this model is only 0 to 200 cm and the spatial resolution is approximately 30 km neither of which is sufficient for the quantitative calculation of the local wscvz 2 local hydrological models strongly rely on detailed hydrogeological structures accurate hydrogeological parameters and abundant hydrometeorological observation data therefore although local hydrological models can be used to numerically simulate the distribution and flow of regional groundwater hinderer et al 2020 reich et al 2019 mikolaj et al 2019 leirião et al 2009 and thus to obtain the wscvz this method is referred to as the local hydrological modeling method the high spatial heterogeneity of the above information makes it very difficult to comprehensively and accurately observe this information ultimately leading to a large uncertainty in the quantitative calculation results of wscvz the superconductive gravity technique offers the possibility of addressing these two difficulties in the quantitative estimation of water storage changes in vadose zones the temporal changes in the gravity field contain information about the mass transport of subsurface materials therefore changes in the total groundwater storage sum of the water storage in the vadose zone and in the saturated zone can be monitored in a noninvasive manner through high precision time varying gravity observations which cannot be achieved by traditional surface hydrological observations or probe monitoring creutzfeldt et al 2010b with the development of the superconductive gravity technique for high precision observation and the continuous improvement of the effects of other non hydrological gravity signal corrections mikolaj et al 2019 warburton et al 2010 boy and hinderer 2006 the superconductive gravity technique has become an effective method for quantifying the changes in regional groundwater storage and has gained increasing attention in groundwater monitoring and modeling studies voigt et al 2021 mouyen et al 2019 champollion et al 2018 chen et al 2018 kennedy et al 2016 lien et al 2014 christiansen et al 2011b creutzfeldt et al 2010a the sensitivity of gravity changes to changes in material mass allows one to obtain a quantitative estimate of groundwater storage changes through gravity observations but this quantitative estimate includes the total changes in groundwater storage in both the saturated and vadose zones therefore appropriate methods are needed to separate the two in order to quantify the wscvz because the gravity observations themselves are subjected to the combined effect of various factors and the depth of the vadose zone changes over time the water storage in the saturated zone was not explicitly separated from that in the vadose zone in most previous studies of groundwater storage changes using the gravity technique kennedy et al 2016 and thus the separation of the two remains a challenging task van camp et al 2017 christiansen et al 2011a the collection of simultaneous observations using two superconducting gravimeters sgs separated by a certain distance or depth help solve this problem van camp et al 2017 mouyen et al 2019 kennedy et al 2014 for example kennedy et al 2014 used two igrav sgs separated by 13 m to form a gravity gradient baseline to estimate the groundwater seepage velocity and soil water content unfortunately this type of experimental observation is only an individual case with an experimental condition that is not available at all stations so it cannot be applied extensively to address the above problem in this study a new method for the quantitative separation of the local wscvz based on a single superconducting gravimeter sg and groundwater level observation data is proposed the new method draws on the soil specific yield parameter which is commonly used in the study of groundwater storage changes and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data to convert the observed groundwater level changes into water storage changes usually expressed as an equivalent water height feng et al 2013 rodell and famiglietti 2002 the following procedure is proposed to obtain the wscvz first the saturated zone water storage changes wscsz are estimated using the soil porosity parameters and the groundwater level observation data then the total groundwater storage changes are extracted from the gravity observations obtained using the sg ws c total sg finally the wscsz are subtracted from the ws c total sg to obtain the wscvz thus achieving the quantitative separation of the two this new method is validated using as an example with the gravity observations collected using the sg gwr c032 at the wuhan geodetic observation station in wuhan china wuhan sg station the calculation and implementation process of the method are described finally the calculated results are analyzed and compared with the results obtained using the local hydrological modeling method and the gldas global hydrological model 2 various types of data required for the quantitative separation of the vadose zone water storage changes in this study the sg observation station in wuhan china was used as an example of the separation of the water storage changes in the vadose zone therefore the gravity groundwater level and station barometric pressure observation data and the soil parameter data from the station were obtained the wuhan sg station shown as the red triangle in fig 1 b which is a satellite image from google earth is now operated by the innovation academy for precision measurement science and technology apm chinese academy of sciences it is located on the north ridge of mount shimen wuhan hubei province china fig 1a which is a topographic map of hubei province the latitude and longitude of the sg site are 30 516 n and 114 490 e and its elevation is 80 0 m the surroundings around the observation building are shown in fig 1b it can be seen from fig 1a and b that the study area is relatively flat thus the unevenness of the terrain can be ignored in later analysis moreover the overlying strata of this area are almost formed by middle pleistocene eluvial and alluvial deposits xu et al 2008 this indicates that the soil texture of aquifer here is uncomplex and could be regarded as lateral homogeneous texture therefore groundwater table level observations from the monitoring well shown as the cyan square in fig 1b could approximately indicate the boundary between the saturated zone and the vadose zone of the studied local area previous publications show that 90 of the signal of a gravity measurement comes from the circular area with a radius of 10 times of the mass layer s depth when the instrument is installed on the ground surface leirião et al 2009 kazama et al 2009 güntner et al 2017 because the absolute water level depth varies about from 2 m to 8 m fig 2 the water storage changes in the demonstrated local area in fig 1b 275 m 275 m account for more than 90 of the observed hydrological gravity variation of the sg at wuhan sg station in this reason the gravity changes observed by sg can well represent the gravity response of water storage changes in the local area in addition the meteorological observation data from wuhan climate station for global exchange wuhan climate station for short shown as the yellow star in fig 1a including eight types of observation data such as the daily rainfall average temperature average relative humidity average wind speed and sunshine duration were used the wuhan climate station latitude 30 37 n longitude 114 08 e elevation 23 1 m is about 30 km away from wuhan sg station for the last 30 years according to the statistics of china meteorological administration the mean annual precipitation of wuhan is about 1269 mm while the mean annual evaporation is about 1505 mm due to the lack of meteorological observation elements at wuhan sg station the meteorological observations of wuhan climate station are used as an approximation for wuhan sg station in our study as an example fig 2 shows the groundwater level of the monitoring well at wuhan sg station the daily precipitation observation data collected at the wuhan climate station and the station daily potential evapotranspiration estimated by penman 1948 equation the groundwater level data black curve in fig 2 were obtained using a pressure type water level gauge starting in may 2008 however the observation data after may 2010 are not available due to instrument malfunction therefore approximately two years of data from may 2008 to april 2010 were chosen for use in this study the original sampling interval for the groundwater level observations was 10 min and the hourly observations were used in this study since the well is relatively close to approximately 130 m away the sg the changes in the groundwater level at the sg monitoring point can be approximated by that observed by the water level gauge in the well the black dashed line in fig 2 shows the linear trend fit of the groundwater level observation data which has a slope of 0 12 m a indicating an upward trend in the local groundwater level at wuhan sg station over these 2 years however because the time period is only two years and our main interest is seasonal water storage variation the long term changes in the groundwater storage were not investigated in this study the daily rainfall at the wuhan climate station in the same period the gray bars in fig 2 was downloaded from the dataset v3 0 of the daily values of climate data for chinese surface stations for global exchange on the china meteorological data service center https data cma cn five of the eight observations in this dataset were used in this study including the daily rainfall average daily temperature average humidity average wind speed and sunshine duration and the last four were used to estimate the daily potential evapotranspiration as can be seen from fig 2 the observed groundwater level reached the peak water level value around august in the summer and the minimum value around february in the winter with a peak to peak variation range of approximately 7 m among them the spikes occurring every few days are mainly caused by the periodic living related pumping events done by a nearby hotel and the solid earth tides the rainfall was mostly concentrated from june to august with the daily rainfall ranging from 0 to 120 mm a comparison of the variation trends reveals that the observed changes in the groundwater level and in the daily rainfall both show notable seasonal characteristics and the continuous accumulation of rainfall causes a corresponding rise in the groundwater level the sg gravity tide observations after the pre processing and the gravity residuals after removing the linear trend term are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively the linear trend term was mainly removed in order to eliminate the influence of instrumental drift which is essentially a linear function of time after several months of instrument installation van camp and francis 2007 although this method may remove long term linear trend signals associated with phenomena such as long term variations in the groundwater storage change vertical ground surface displacement post glacial rebound and crustal thickening the removal of the linear trend item has no effect on our following hydrological investigation one reason is the linear trend changes in the groundwater storage are relatively small compared with a seasonal variation of about 7 m which can be seen from the groundwater level change observations shown in fig 2 another reason is the gravity field response of the groundwater changes investigated in the study is mainly concentrated in the seasonal frequency bands and the linear trend is out of our main interest continuous gravity observations were conducted using the sg from november 1997 to july 2012 based on the time period of the selected groundwater level data may 2008 to april 2010 the gravity observations collected in the same time period were selected and resampled using a time sampling interval of 1 h rather than the original 1 s interval xu et al 2008 the gravity observations shown in fig 3a were preprocessed by calibrating the data and removing interferences such as earthquakes spikes steps and discontinuities chen 2003 then the gravity effects of the tides atmosphere and polar motion and the linear trend term of the gravity observations were subtracted to obtain the residual gravity data which was used to calculate the total groundwater storage changes in this study fig 3b he et al 2016 as can be seen from fig 3b the observed gravity residuals also exhibit significant seasonal changes with a maximum variation range of approximately 120 nm s 2 a notable irregular feature is found around july 1 2009 in fig 3b it is due to the failure of the time synchronization between the gps and the sg recording computer its exact time period is from june 5 2009 to october 30 2009 it has been shown that after deducting the gravity effects of the tides atmosphere and polar motion the gravity residuals of continuous surface gravity observations are mainly the gravity changes caused by the changes in the terrestrial water storage hinderer et al 2007 and the gravity effects of the groundwater storage changes are dominant therefore the observed gravity residuals obtained by removing the other effects can be combined with other observations such as rainfall and evaporation from the stations to quantify the groundwater storage changes champollion et al 2018 güntner et al 2017 fores et al 2017 pfeffer et al 2013 crossley et al 2013 jacob et al 2008 the separation results of the wscvz were compared with data obtained using the gldas noah model which is one of the best models of land surface water storage changes generated by national aeronautics and space administration nasa using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques and by fusing satellite and ground based observation data products rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2020 the gldas dataset is available online in two versions i e gldas 1 and gldas 2 the former was discontinued in march 2020 and the new dataset gldas 2 includes three components gldas 2 0 gldas 2 1 and gldas 2 2 gldas 2 1 contains three land surface models i e the noah vic and clsm models of which the gldas 2 1 noah model dataset hereafter referred to as the gldas noah model has the highest temporal and spatial resolutions and was used in this study it has a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 in addition it provides clear soil moisture stratification information by presenting the equivalent water height of the soil water content in layers with depths of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm respectively which can be used to calculate the wscvz in the depth range of 0 200 cm the soil moisture stratification data for the grid point nearest to wuhan sg station were extracted for the corresponding time period of the gldas noah model and the four layers were accumulated as the wscvz of the gldas noah model for wuhan sg station to facilitate comparison with the gravity results a time series with a 1 h sampling interval was obtained through linear interpolation fig 4 the results shown in fig 4 indicate that the soil water storage in each layer of the gldas noah model at wuhan sg station is approximately proportional to its thickness where the solid green line represents the sum of the water storages in the four layers as can be seen the vadose zone water storage in the range of 0 200 cm varies within approximately 140 mm fig 5 shows the temporal changes in the distribution of the vertical soil water content at wuhan sg station which were calculated using a local hydrological model as can be seen the depth range of the vadose zone at wuhan sg station varies greatly with time with a maximum depth of approximately 7 m which is much larger than that given by the gldas noah model 200 cm therefore the vadose zone water storage model constructed using the gldas noah model is not fully satisfactory and thus the results of the vadose zone water storage given by the model cannot be used to characterize the total changes in the water storage of the vadose zone 3 quantitative separation of the vadose zone water storage changes 3 1 quantitative separation of the wscvz using the local hydrological modeling method the groundwater flow and distribution can be numerically simulated using the local hydrological modeling method in order to obtain the spatial and temporal distribution of the soil water content at different depths in the local region of the station and then the water storage changes in the saturated zone and vadose zone can be quantitatively separated based on the depth ranges of the two which are distinguished using the measured groundwater level local hydrological models are usually described using richards equation which was derived based on the mass conservation principle of groundwater flow and darcy s law and has been widely used in the study of soil water infiltration and flow in the vadose zone and the soil water exchange between the saturated and unsaturated zones zha et al 2019 richards 1931 when one dimensional vertical infiltration is considered the simplified one dimensional richards equation is shown as follows 1 θ z t t t d θ θ z k θ z where θ is the soil water content in the vadose zone t is the time s and z is the vertical height m above the reference surface d θ is the diffusivity m2 s and k θ is the conductivity m s both of which are related to the soil properties and defy direct measurement olsson and rose 1978 for this reason they are usually given by exponential empirical equations gardner 1958 pullan 1990 2 k θ k s exp a θ max θ θ max θ min d θ d s exp b θ max θ θ max θ min where k s is the vertical conductivity m s of the soil in the saturated state a a 0 is the rate of change of the conductivity d s is the vertical diffusivity m2 s of the soil in the saturated state and b b 0 is the rate of change of the diffusivity θ max is the maximum volumetric water content of the soil i e the effective porosity n and θ min is the minimum volumetric water content of the soil i e the water retention capacity sr the values of the relevant soil parameters are needed to calculate the changes in the soil water content in the vadose zone θ z t due to the lack of measured data the soil parameters used in this study were mainly derived from the published literature on this region specifically the values of the soil porosities were taken as the values for soil samples from the wuhan area analyzed by zhang et al 2001 and the other parameters including the permeability coefficient and its rate of change the diffusion coefficient and its rate of change and the specific retention were set to be their empirical reference values according to the value range of each parameter cheng 2016 the values of the soil parameters are presented in table 1 in the actual calculation of the changes in the soil water content in the vadose zone θ z t it was also necessary to use the groundwater level observation data as the water content condition in the lower boundary of the vadose zone the difference between the observed rainfall data and the estimated potential evapotranspiration was used as the flow condition in the upper boundary and the groundwater distribution under steady state flow i e the steady state solution was used as the initial condition for the unsteady flow simulation based on this the numerical simulation and finite difference calculations were carried out to finally obtain the temporal changes in the vertical i e with depth soil water content distribution he and sun 2018 he et al 2016 kazama et al 2012 the temporal changes in the vertical soil water content distribution at wuhan sg station calculated using the local hydrological modeling method are shown in fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 the interannual and seasonal variations in the vertical distribution of the soil water content are similar to those of the groundwater level and rainfall data the soil water content at each depth reaches its maximum value in summer and its minimum value in winter but the occurrence times at different depths are not completely consistent with the changes in the soil water content in the deep layers lagging behind that in the shallow layers to some extent it should be noted that the soil below the groundwater level especially at burial depths of greater than 7 m has a constant water content n n 0 24 and is in a saturated state while the soil above the groundwater level has a water content of less than n and is in a vadose state this is the fundamental basis upon which the groundwater level is defined as the interface or boundary that separates the saturated and vadose zones the separation of the wscvz using the local hydrological modeling method was exactly built upon the above calculated temporal changes in the distribution of the soil water content with depth based on this the calculation range was divided into the upper vadose zone and the lower saturated zone according to the observed groundwater level l and then the integral calculation of the water storage changes in each zone was carried out thus achieving the separation of the two calculated using the local hydrological modeling method the vadose zone water storage ws c vz modeled is expressed as the sum of the water content in the soil between the surface z s and the groundwater level l while the saturated zone water storage ws c sz modeled and the total groundwater storage ws c total modeled are the sum of the water content in the soil between the reference surface z 0 and the groundwater level l and the sum of water content in the soil between the reference surface z 0 and the ground surface z s respectively and they care calculated as follows 3 ws c vz modeled l z s θ i d z n m θ i δ z ws c sz modeled z 0 l θ i d z 0 n θ i δ z ws c total modeled w s c vz modeled w s c sz modeled z 0 z s θ i d z 0 m θ i δ z where θ i is the water content of the soil in the ith layer and m and n are the number of soil layers at the ground surface and groundwater level respectively with n changing with the changes in the groundwater level the temporal changes in the groundwater storage at wuhan sg station calculated using the local hydrological modeling method are shown in fig 6 in which the gray blue and green solid lines represent the total water storage changes ws c total modeled the saturated zone water storage changes ws c sz modeled and the vadose zone water storage changes ws c vz modeled respectively as can be seen from the calculation results obtained using the local hydrological modeling method fig 6 the range of the wscsz were 1630 mm and the range of the wscvz were approximately 1310 mm both of which far exceed the range of the total groundwater storage changes approximately 350 mm indicating that the influence of both the vadose zone and the saturated zone should be considered when studying groundwater storage changes in terms of the phase trend the groundwater storage changes in the vadose zone were almost completely opposite that in the saturated zone and the total groundwater storage change and it was also completely opposite the changes in the groundwater level and rainfall fig 2 indicating that when the groundwater level rises due to increased rainfall in the rainy season the soil in the vadose zone becomes thinner which leads to a decrease in the vadose zone water storage whereas the opposite situation occurs in the dry season the grey blue and green solid lines are the total groundwater storage changes ws c total modeled and the water storage changes in the saturated zone ws c sz modeled and vadose zone ws c vz modeled respectively 3 2 quantitative separation of the wscvz using the superconductive gravity technique according to the introduction of the study area in the second section the absence of a surface water body is found in the vicinity of the station and the influence of surface runoff and vegetation water storage may be ignored subsequently the gravity residuals mainly contain information about the groundwater storage changes and can be approximated as an observation to characterize the changes in the total groundwater storage ignoring the unevenness of the terrain and the nonuniformity of the medium the gravity effect δ g m s2 due to the changes in groundwater storage δ h in the study area can be approximated by the following cylinder equation heiskanen and moritz 1967 4 δ g 2 π g ρ w δ h r 2 h 2 r 2 h δ h 2 where g is the universal gravitational constant 6 67 10 11 nm2 kg2 ρ w is the density of water 1000 kg m3 δ h is the change in the water storage thickness m r is the radius of the cylinder m and h is the height of the gravity measurement point relative to the cylinder s surface m by further expanding the cylinder s radius to infinity equation 4 can be simplified to the following approximation equation for the bouguer plate 5 δ g 2 π g ρ δ h therefore under the approximation of a planar semi infinite space the total groundwater storage changes ws c total sg can be estimated from the gravity residuals using the following equation 6 ws c total sg δ h δ g 2 π g ρ w the total groundwater storage changes include the water storage changes in both the vadose and saturated zones to quantitatively separate the two a method is proposed to estimate the saturated zone water storage changes ws c sz n based on the changes in the groundwater level δ l and the soil porosity n and drawing on the practice of converting the observed changes in the groundwater level depth to the storage changes in the study of groundwater storage changes using grace data rodell and famiglietti 2002 feng et al 2013 that is ws c sz n is approximated as the product of δ l and n 7 ws c sz n δ l n where n is given in table 1 and characterizes the wscsz in the study of groundwater storage changes obtained using the grace data the product of the soil s specific yield and the groundwater level changes δ l were used to validate the estimates of total groundwater storage changes from grace the result represents the changes in the water released as the original saturated zone is transformed into the vadose zone after the groundwater level drops or the changes in the water stored as the original vadose zone is transformed into the saturated zone after the groundwater level rises therefore the result characterizes the total groundwater storage changes rather than the wscsz this is the reason why the soil porosity n was chosen to calculate the wscsz after calculating the saturated zone water storage changes ws c sz n using equation 7 the vadose zone water storage changes ws c vz sg can be readily obtained by subtracting ws c sz n from the total groundwater storage changes ws c total sg thereby achieving the quantitative separation of the two that is 8 ws c vz sg w s c total sg w s c sz n fig 7 presents the groundwater storage changes estimated based on the superconducting gravity residuals and the groundwater level observations at wuhan sg station as can be seen from fig 7 the range of the wscsz calculated based on the groundwater level observations and porosity is approximately 1630 mm which also far exceeds the range of the total storage changes estimated using the superconducting gravity residuals approximately 290 mm and the difference between the two is the range of the wscvz approximately 1580 mm in terms of the phase trend this is almost completely opposite to the corresponding saturated zone water storage changes and the total groundwater storage changes this result is consistent with that obtained using the local hydrological modeling method as can be seen from the separation results obtained using the two methods shown in figs 6 and 7 the range of the separated groundwater storage changes in the saturated and vadose zones far exceed the range of the total storage changes in particular in terms of the phase trend the vadose zone water storage changes are basically opposite to the saturated zone water storage changes and to the total groundwater storage changes specifically when the groundwater level rises due to of the increased rainfall in the rainy season part of the vadose zone is recharged and becomes saturated and accordingly the thickness of the vadose zone decreases resulting in a corresponding decrease in the vadose zone water storage when the groundwater level decreases due to the decrease in rainfall in the dry season part of the saturated zone releases part of the water and becomes vadose and thus the thickness of the vadose zone increases leading to a corresponding increase in the vadose zone water storage overall the water retention effect of the vadose aquifer and its buffering effect on the groundwater infiltration and flow slow down the changes in the total groundwater storage this can also explain another phenomenon as follows the actual observed range of the changes in the gravity effect at this station is only about 120 nm s 2 while the groundwater changes reached 7 m and the specific yield was about 0 111 which is far from the 330 nm s 2 estimated using the bouguer effect equation 5 this difference is closely related to the role of the vadose zone in slowing down the total groundwater storage changes and their gravity effect therefore the role of the vadose zone in the study of local groundwater storage changes and their gravity field effect cannot be ignored 4 comparative analysis of the quantitative separation results of the vadose zone water storage changes 4 1 comparative analysis of the quantitative separation results obtained using the local hydrological modeling method and the superconductive gravity technique the wscvz quantitatively separated using the local hydrological modeling method green line in fig 6 and that obtained using the superconductive gravity technique green line in fig 7 are similar in terms of the apparent seasonal variations so the quantitative separation results obtained using the two methods were further compared by calculating the difference in the water storage changes dwsc and the reasons for the difference were investigated fig 8 shows a comparison of the wscvz at wuhan sg station obtained using the superconductive gravity technique red line and using the local hydrological modeling method blue line the two results are in good agreement indicating that the quantitative separation of the wscvz can be achieved using the superconductive gravity technique based on the existing observation conditions at wuhan sg station the gray line in fig 8 represents the difference between the two the maximum difference is approximately 250 mm and the standard deviation of the difference is approximately 50 mm accounting for 3 4 of the result i e cov 3 4 the relatively small magnitude of this difference indicates that its presence does not affect the conclusion that the wscvz can be quantitatively separated using the superconductive gravity technique to explain the differences between the quantitative separation results obtained using the above two methods we calculated the wscsz simulated using the local hydrological modeling method and that directly obtained via conversion using groundwater observation data a comparison of the results is shown in fig 9 the results show that the wscsz obtained using the two methods are almost identical indicating that the difference in the results of the total groundwater storage changes at wuhan sg station obtained using the above two methods is mainly derived from the difference in the vadose zone since the difference in the total groundwater storage changes obtained using the two methods is mainly attributed to the difference in the wscvz it is necessary to analyze the causes of this difference first this difference is due to the uncertainties in the local hydrological model itself such as the one dimensional simplification of the model inaccuracies in precipitation data not considering surface runoff underestimation of the evapotranspiration and the inaccuracy of the soil hydraulic properties parameterization which can cause the simulation results to deviate from the actual situation second this difference could also be caused by the influence of other signals included in the gravity residuals e g remaining barometric pressure tidal signals and other geophysical dynamic signals during the superconducting gravity data processing or by nonlinear drift of the instrument if other causes for this difference are to be further determined additional local hydrogeological survey data and more refined processing of the superconducting gravity observations are needed 4 2 comparative analysis of the groundwater storage changes results obtained using the local hydrological modeling method and the gldas model as was described in section 1 the gldas noah model can provide the equivalent water height time series for the water storage in the specific depth range of 0 200 cm in the global subsurface with a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 which enables the quantitative calculation of the water storage changes in this depth range green line in fig 4 compared with the quantitative separation results obtained using the superconductive gravity technique and using the local hydrological modeling method green lines in figs 6 and 7 respectively shown in fig 10 the result of the gldas noah model significantly underestimates the wscvz at wuhan sg station reflecting only 9 11 of the total changes the comparative results reveal that the gldas noah model fails to fully reflect the water storage changes in the entire vadose zone due to the limitation of the depth range 0 200 cm and the range of the vadose zone cannot be separated from that of the saturated zone in real time using this model alone the wscvz at the same burial depth 0 200 cm was calculated using the local hydrological modeling method and then compared to the wscvz obtained using the gldas noah model the orange and green lines in fig 11 show the results of the groundwater storage changes in the depth range of 0 200 cm obtained using the local hydrological modeling method and the gldas noah model respectively and the gray line in fig 11 represents the difference between the two these results show that the results obtained using the two methods generally exhibit similar change trends with a correlation coefficient of 0 60 however there is a large difference in the absolute amount of water storage changes as shown by the gray line in fig 11 the absolute value of the maximum difference is approximately 100 mm and the standard deviation of the difference is approximately 30 mm accounting for 15 18 of the result i e cov 15 18 the reasons for the difference in the model results may be the differences in the soil stratification the soil properties the elements of the input observation data and the spatial scales of the models for example the local hydrological modeling method uses observation data such as point precipitation and groundwater levels at stations while the data input into the gldas noah model are the meteorological driving parameters with a spatial resolution of approximately 0 2 from the global data assimilation system gdas of the national centers for environmental prediction ncep the daily precipitation with a spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp and the radiation dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 from the air force weather agency afwa therefore the results obtained using the gldas noah model represent an average effect over a relatively large region thus this model is more accurate for the simulation of trend terms on a regional scale but it is slightly deficient in fine simulations on a local scale 5 discussion and conclusions in this study a new method for the quantitative separation of wscvz i e the quantitative separation of groundwater storage changes in the vadose zone from those in the saturated zone based on the superconductive gravity technique was proposed this new method was verified through examples using the superconducting gravity observation data from wuhan sg station may 2008 to april 2010 and groundwater level observation data the quantitative separation results of the wscvz at wuhan sg station were obtained and were compared with those obtained using the local hydrological modeling method and using the global gldas noah model the results show that there is good agreement between the quantitative separation results of the wscvz at wuhan sg station obtained using the superconductive gravity technique and using local hydrological modeling indicating that the quantitative separation of the local wscvz can be achieved using the superconductive gravity technique and groundwater level observations the trend of the quantitatively separated the wscvz is almost exactly opposite to the trends of the total groundwater storage changes and the wscsz indicating that the wscvz play a significant role in slowing down the total groundwater storage changes and their hydrological gravity effect and thus it cannot be ignored when studying local total groundwater storage changes and their gravity field effects the results obtained using the gldas noah model for wuhan sg station differ considerably from those obtained using the above two methods accounting for only approximately 10 of the latter indicating that the gldas noah model fails to completely reflect the groundwater storage changes in the entire vadose zone due to the limitation of the simulated depth range and the large spatial scale of the model in addition there is still a great deal of room for the improvement of this model in terms of the accurate estimation of vadose zone water storage although both the superconductive gravity technique and the local hydrological modeling method can be used to achieve the quantitative separation of the wscvz at wuhan sg station each has its own applicability the local hydrological modeling method has a clear physical meaning and is independent of the gravity observation it is suitable for stations with abundant hydrometeorological data and clear geological and structural conditions the separation method based on the superconductive gravity technique is simple and straightforward and it can be used to obtain quantitative estimates of the vadose zone water storage at stations that lack local knowledge of the hydrogeological structures and hydrometeorological data and have superconducting gravimetric observations as the quantitative estimates of the local vadose zone water storage can be achieved by using the superconductive gravity technique our results further demonstrate that the gravity observation could be used to constrain the local hydrological model parameters therefore the two methods have their own advantages and disadvantages and the selection of one over the other depends on the actual situation of the station credit authorship contribution statement qianqian he

3379,the quantitative study of vadose zone water i e the water contained in the rock formation between the ground surface and the groundwater level is of vital importance for understanding the groundwater flow mechanism mass exchange and circulation however the vadose zone is closely related to the saturated zone and it is difficult to directly observe the vadose zone water causing the quantitative separation of the vadose zone water storage to be a challenging problem considering the insufficient spatial resolution of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace we draw on the practice of converting the observed groundwater level changes into the water storage changes in the study of groundwater storage changes using grace data and propose a new method for implementing the quantitative separation of vadose zone water storage changes based on a single superconducting gravimeter and groundwater level observation data this new method is validated with measurement data collected using a superconducting gravimeter gwr c032 at the national geodetic observation station in wuhan china wuhan sg station and groundwater level observation data obtained during the same period the calculation results show that the changes in the vadose zone water storage obtained using the superconductive gravity technique are in good agreement with that obtained using the local hydrological modeling method indicating that the quantitative separation of the changes in the local vadose zone water storage can be achieved using superconductive gravity and groundwater level observations during the study period from may 2008 to april 2010 the peak to peak changes of the vadose zone water storage at wuhan sg station reached 1580 mm and the seasonal variations were the inverse of the variations of the total groundwater storage changes and the saturated zone water storage changes indicating that the vadose zone plays a pronounced role in slowing down the total groundwater storage changes keywords quantitative separation of groundwater storage changes vadose zone superconductive gravity technique hydrological gravity effect of groundwater storage changes groundwater level observations 1 introduction the vadose zone also known as the unsaturated zone is usually defined as the porous medium between the ground surface and the groundwater level in the first unconfined aquifer stephens 2018 the vadose zone serves as a bridge and link between water systems such as atmospheric water vegetation water surface water and groundwater and thus the quantitative study of its water storage changes is of great significance for groundwater recharge water quality protection and regional and even global water mass exchange and circulation mayfield et al 2021 arora et al 2019 nimmo 2006 however it is difficult to accurately quantify the vadose zone water storage changes wscvz using soil water measurements from only a limited number of locations in the vadose zone because the subsurface space is not fully accessible christiansen et al 2011b this could also not be accomplished simply relying on groundwater table levels or the total water storage below the soil surface the currently available instruments for measuring the water content and flow in the vadose zone including tensiometers soil moisture meters and suction lysimeters can only measure small spatial extents of tens to hundreds of cubic centimeters izbicki et al 2008 moreover equipment and labor costs usually limit the installation depth of these instruments to very near the surface 1 2 m binley et al 2015 therefore traditional subsurface observations are limited in scale and are unable to cover the entire spatial extents of the vadose zone thus failing to reflect the spatial inhomogeneity of the water content in this zone this issue and the limitations on the depth of instrument placement have made the quantitative estimation of deep wscvz an intractable problem kennedy et al 2016 creutzfeldt et al 2010a currently quantitative estimations of wscvz using global or local hydrological models are faced with the following two difficulties 1 it is difficult to apply global hydrological models to the quantitative study of vadose zones water storage changes in a local scale for example the noah model in the global land data assimilation system gldas can be used to assess changes in the global environment including precipitation snowfall evapotranspiration soil moisture surface runoff and subsurface runoff with a spatial resolution of up to 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 h providing very valuable model data for earth science research rodell et al 2004 however the depth of the soil water in this model is only 0 to 200 cm and the spatial resolution is approximately 30 km neither of which is sufficient for the quantitative calculation of the local wscvz 2 local hydrological models strongly rely on detailed hydrogeological structures accurate hydrogeological parameters and abundant hydrometeorological observation data therefore although local hydrological models can be used to numerically simulate the distribution and flow of regional groundwater hinderer et al 2020 reich et al 2019 mikolaj et al 2019 leirião et al 2009 and thus to obtain the wscvz this method is referred to as the local hydrological modeling method the high spatial heterogeneity of the above information makes it very difficult to comprehensively and accurately observe this information ultimately leading to a large uncertainty in the quantitative calculation results of wscvz the superconductive gravity technique offers the possibility of addressing these two difficulties in the quantitative estimation of water storage changes in vadose zones the temporal changes in the gravity field contain information about the mass transport of subsurface materials therefore changes in the total groundwater storage sum of the water storage in the vadose zone and in the saturated zone can be monitored in a noninvasive manner through high precision time varying gravity observations which cannot be achieved by traditional surface hydrological observations or probe monitoring creutzfeldt et al 2010b with the development of the superconductive gravity technique for high precision observation and the continuous improvement of the effects of other non hydrological gravity signal corrections mikolaj et al 2019 warburton et al 2010 boy and hinderer 2006 the superconductive gravity technique has become an effective method for quantifying the changes in regional groundwater storage and has gained increasing attention in groundwater monitoring and modeling studies voigt et al 2021 mouyen et al 2019 champollion et al 2018 chen et al 2018 kennedy et al 2016 lien et al 2014 christiansen et al 2011b creutzfeldt et al 2010a the sensitivity of gravity changes to changes in material mass allows one to obtain a quantitative estimate of groundwater storage changes through gravity observations but this quantitative estimate includes the total changes in groundwater storage in both the saturated and vadose zones therefore appropriate methods are needed to separate the two in order to quantify the wscvz because the gravity observations themselves are subjected to the combined effect of various factors and the depth of the vadose zone changes over time the water storage in the saturated zone was not explicitly separated from that in the vadose zone in most previous studies of groundwater storage changes using the gravity technique kennedy et al 2016 and thus the separation of the two remains a challenging task van camp et al 2017 christiansen et al 2011a the collection of simultaneous observations using two superconducting gravimeters sgs separated by a certain distance or depth help solve this problem van camp et al 2017 mouyen et al 2019 kennedy et al 2014 for example kennedy et al 2014 used two igrav sgs separated by 13 m to form a gravity gradient baseline to estimate the groundwater seepage velocity and soil water content unfortunately this type of experimental observation is only an individual case with an experimental condition that is not available at all stations so it cannot be applied extensively to address the above problem in this study a new method for the quantitative separation of the local wscvz based on a single superconducting gravimeter sg and groundwater level observation data is proposed the new method draws on the soil specific yield parameter which is commonly used in the study of groundwater storage changes and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data to convert the observed groundwater level changes into water storage changes usually expressed as an equivalent water height feng et al 2013 rodell and famiglietti 2002 the following procedure is proposed to obtain the wscvz first the saturated zone water storage changes wscsz are estimated using the soil porosity parameters and the groundwater level observation data then the total groundwater storage changes are extracted from the gravity observations obtained using the sg ws c total sg finally the wscsz are subtracted from the ws c total sg to obtain the wscvz thus achieving the quantitative separation of the two this new method is validated using as an example with the gravity observations collected using the sg gwr c032 at the wuhan geodetic observation station in wuhan china wuhan sg station the calculation and implementation process of the method are described finally the calculated results are analyzed and compared with the results obtained using the local hydrological modeling method and the gldas global hydrological model 2 various types of data required for the quantitative separation of the vadose zone water storage changes in this study the sg observation station in wuhan china was used as an example of the separation of the water storage changes in the vadose zone therefore the gravity groundwater level and station barometric pressure observation data and the soil parameter data from the station were obtained the wuhan sg station shown as the red triangle in fig 1 b which is a satellite image from google earth is now operated by the innovation academy for precision measurement science and technology apm chinese academy of sciences it is located on the north ridge of mount shimen wuhan hubei province china fig 1a which is a topographic map of hubei province the latitude and longitude of the sg site are 30 516 n and 114 490 e and its elevation is 80 0 m the surroundings around the observation building are shown in fig 1b it can be seen from fig 1a and b that the study area is relatively flat thus the unevenness of the terrain can be ignored in later analysis moreover the overlying strata of this area are almost formed by middle pleistocene eluvial and alluvial deposits xu et al 2008 this indicates that the soil texture of aquifer here is uncomplex and could be regarded as lateral homogeneous texture therefore groundwater table level observations from the monitoring well shown as the cyan square in fig 1b could approximately indicate the boundary between the saturated zone and the vadose zone of the studied local area previous publications show that 90 of the signal of a gravity measurement comes from the circular area with a radius of 10 times of the mass layer s depth when the instrument is installed on the ground surface leirião et al 2009 kazama et al 2009 güntner et al 2017 because the absolute water level depth varies about from 2 m to 8 m fig 2 the water storage changes in the demonstrated local area in fig 1b 275 m 275 m account for more than 90 of the observed hydrological gravity variation of the sg at wuhan sg station in this reason the gravity changes observed by sg can well represent the gravity response of water storage changes in the local area in addition the meteorological observation data from wuhan climate station for global exchange wuhan climate station for short shown as the yellow star in fig 1a including eight types of observation data such as the daily rainfall average temperature average relative humidity average wind speed and sunshine duration were used the wuhan climate station latitude 30 37 n longitude 114 08 e elevation 23 1 m is about 30 km away from wuhan sg station for the last 30 years according to the statistics of china meteorological administration the mean annual precipitation of wuhan is about 1269 mm while the mean annual evaporation is about 1505 mm due to the lack of meteorological observation elements at wuhan sg station the meteorological observations of wuhan climate station are used as an approximation for wuhan sg station in our study as an example fig 2 shows the groundwater level of the monitoring well at wuhan sg station the daily precipitation observation data collected at the wuhan climate station and the station daily potential evapotranspiration estimated by penman 1948 equation the groundwater level data black curve in fig 2 were obtained using a pressure type water level gauge starting in may 2008 however the observation data after may 2010 are not available due to instrument malfunction therefore approximately two years of data from may 2008 to april 2010 were chosen for use in this study the original sampling interval for the groundwater level observations was 10 min and the hourly observations were used in this study since the well is relatively close to approximately 130 m away the sg the changes in the groundwater level at the sg monitoring point can be approximated by that observed by the water level gauge in the well the black dashed line in fig 2 shows the linear trend fit of the groundwater level observation data which has a slope of 0 12 m a indicating an upward trend in the local groundwater level at wuhan sg station over these 2 years however because the time period is only two years and our main interest is seasonal water storage variation the long term changes in the groundwater storage were not investigated in this study the daily rainfall at the wuhan climate station in the same period the gray bars in fig 2 was downloaded from the dataset v3 0 of the daily values of climate data for chinese surface stations for global exchange on the china meteorological data service center https data cma cn five of the eight observations in this dataset were used in this study including the daily rainfall average daily temperature average humidity average wind speed and sunshine duration and the last four were used to estimate the daily potential evapotranspiration as can be seen from fig 2 the observed groundwater level reached the peak water level value around august in the summer and the minimum value around february in the winter with a peak to peak variation range of approximately 7 m among them the spikes occurring every few days are mainly caused by the periodic living related pumping events done by a nearby hotel and the solid earth tides the rainfall was mostly concentrated from june to august with the daily rainfall ranging from 0 to 120 mm a comparison of the variation trends reveals that the observed changes in the groundwater level and in the daily rainfall both show notable seasonal characteristics and the continuous accumulation of rainfall causes a corresponding rise in the groundwater level the sg gravity tide observations after the pre processing and the gravity residuals after removing the linear trend term are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively the linear trend term was mainly removed in order to eliminate the influence of instrumental drift which is essentially a linear function of time after several months of instrument installation van camp and francis 2007 although this method may remove long term linear trend signals associated with phenomena such as long term variations in the groundwater storage change vertical ground surface displacement post glacial rebound and crustal thickening the removal of the linear trend item has no effect on our following hydrological investigation one reason is the linear trend changes in the groundwater storage are relatively small compared with a seasonal variation of about 7 m which can be seen from the groundwater level change observations shown in fig 2 another reason is the gravity field response of the groundwater changes investigated in the study is mainly concentrated in the seasonal frequency bands and the linear trend is out of our main interest continuous gravity observations were conducted using the sg from november 1997 to july 2012 based on the time period of the selected groundwater level data may 2008 to april 2010 the gravity observations collected in the same time period were selected and resampled using a time sampling interval of 1 h rather than the original 1 s interval xu et al 2008 the gravity observations shown in fig 3a were preprocessed by calibrating the data and removing interferences such as earthquakes spikes steps and discontinuities chen 2003 then the gravity effects of the tides atmosphere and polar motion and the linear trend term of the gravity observations were subtracted to obtain the residual gravity data which was used to calculate the total groundwater storage changes in this study fig 3b he et al 2016 as can be seen from fig 3b the observed gravity residuals also exhibit significant seasonal changes with a maximum variation range of approximately 120 nm s 2 a notable irregular feature is found around july 1 2009 in fig 3b it is due to the failure of the time synchronization between the gps and the sg recording computer its exact time period is from june 5 2009 to october 30 2009 it has been shown that after deducting the gravity effects of the tides atmosphere and polar motion the gravity residuals of continuous surface gravity observations are mainly the gravity changes caused by the changes in the terrestrial water storage hinderer et al 2007 and the gravity effects of the groundwater storage changes are dominant therefore the observed gravity residuals obtained by removing the other effects can be combined with other observations such as rainfall and evaporation from the stations to quantify the groundwater storage changes champollion et al 2018 güntner et al 2017 fores et al 2017 pfeffer et al 2013 crossley et al 2013 jacob et al 2008 the separation results of the wscvz were compared with data obtained using the gldas noah model which is one of the best models of land surface water storage changes generated by national aeronautics and space administration nasa using advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques and by fusing satellite and ground based observation data products rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2020 the gldas dataset is available online in two versions i e gldas 1 and gldas 2 the former was discontinued in march 2020 and the new dataset gldas 2 includes three components gldas 2 0 gldas 2 1 and gldas 2 2 gldas 2 1 contains three land surface models i e the noah vic and clsm models of which the gldas 2 1 noah model dataset hereafter referred to as the gldas noah model has the highest temporal and spatial resolutions and was used in this study it has a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 in addition it provides clear soil moisture stratification information by presenting the equivalent water height of the soil water content in layers with depths of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm respectively which can be used to calculate the wscvz in the depth range of 0 200 cm the soil moisture stratification data for the grid point nearest to wuhan sg station were extracted for the corresponding time period of the gldas noah model and the four layers were accumulated as the wscvz of the gldas noah model for wuhan sg station to facilitate comparison with the gravity results a time series with a 1 h sampling interval was obtained through linear interpolation fig 4 the results shown in fig 4 indicate that the soil water storage in each layer of the gldas noah model at wuhan sg station is approximately proportional to its thickness where the solid green line represents the sum of the water storages in the four layers as can be seen the vadose zone water storage in the range of 0 200 cm varies within approximately 140 mm fig 5 shows the temporal changes in the distribution of the vertical soil water content at wuhan sg station which were calculated using a local hydrological model as can be seen the depth range of the vadose zone at wuhan sg station varies greatly with time with a maximum depth of approximately 7 m which is much larger than that given by the gldas noah model 200 cm therefore the vadose zone water storage model constructed using the gldas noah model is not fully satisfactory and thus the results of the vadose zone water storage given by the model cannot be used to characterize the total changes in the water storage of the vadose zone 3 quantitative separation of the vadose zone water storage changes 3 1 quantitative separation of the wscvz using the local hydrological modeling method the groundwater flow and distribution can be numerically simulated using the local hydrological modeling method in order to obtain the spatial and temporal distribution of the soil water content at different depths in the local region of the station and then the water storage changes in the saturated zone and vadose zone can be quantitatively separated based on the depth ranges of the two which are distinguished using the measured groundwater level local hydrological models are usually described using richards equation which was derived based on the mass conservation principle of groundwater flow and darcy s law and has been widely used in the study of soil water infiltration and flow in the vadose zone and the soil water exchange between the saturated and unsaturated zones zha et al 2019 richards 1931 when one dimensional vertical infiltration is considered the simplified one dimensional richards equation is shown as follows 1 θ z t t t d θ θ z k θ z where θ is the soil water content in the vadose zone t is the time s and z is the vertical height m above the reference surface d θ is the diffusivity m2 s and k θ is the conductivity m s both of which are related to the soil properties and defy direct measurement olsson and rose 1978 for this reason they are usually given by exponential empirical equations gardner 1958 pullan 1990 2 k θ k s exp a θ max θ θ max θ min d θ d s exp b θ max θ θ max θ min where k s is the vertical conductivity m s of the soil in the saturated state a a 0 is the rate of change of the conductivity d s is the vertical diffusivity m2 s of the soil in the saturated state and b b 0 is the rate of change of the diffusivity θ max is the maximum volumetric water content of the soil i e the effective porosity n and θ min is the minimum volumetric water content of the soil i e the water retention capacity sr the values of the relevant soil parameters are needed to calculate the changes in the soil water content in the vadose zone θ z t due to the lack of measured data the soil parameters used in this study were mainly derived from the published literature on this region specifically the values of the soil porosities were taken as the values for soil samples from the wuhan area analyzed by zhang et al 2001 and the other parameters including the permeability coefficient and its rate of change the diffusion coefficient and its rate of change and the specific retention were set to be their empirical reference values according to the value range of each parameter cheng 2016 the values of the soil parameters are presented in table 1 in the actual calculation of the changes in the soil water content in the vadose zone θ z t it was also necessary to use the groundwater level observation data as the water content condition in the lower boundary of the vadose zone the difference between the observed rainfall data and the estimated potential evapotranspiration was used as the flow condition in the upper boundary and the groundwater distribution under steady state flow i e the steady state solution was used as the initial condition for the unsteady flow simulation based on this the numerical simulation and finite difference calculations were carried out to finally obtain the temporal changes in the vertical i e with depth soil water content distribution he and sun 2018 he et al 2016 kazama et al 2012 the temporal changes in the vertical soil water content distribution at wuhan sg station calculated using the local hydrological modeling method are shown in fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 the interannual and seasonal variations in the vertical distribution of the soil water content are similar to those of the groundwater level and rainfall data the soil water content at each depth reaches its maximum value in summer and its minimum value in winter but the occurrence times at different depths are not completely consistent with the changes in the soil water content in the deep layers lagging behind that in the shallow layers to some extent it should be noted that the soil below the groundwater level especially at burial depths of greater than 7 m has a constant water content n n 0 24 and is in a saturated state while the soil above the groundwater level has a water content of less than n and is in a vadose state this is the fundamental basis upon which the groundwater level is defined as the interface or boundary that separates the saturated and vadose zones the separation of the wscvz using the local hydrological modeling method was exactly built upon the above calculated temporal changes in the distribution of the soil water content with depth based on this the calculation range was divided into the upper vadose zone and the lower saturated zone according to the observed groundwater level l and then the integral calculation of the water storage changes in each zone was carried out thus achieving the separation of the two calculated using the local hydrological modeling method the vadose zone water storage ws c vz modeled is expressed as the sum of the water content in the soil between the surface z s and the groundwater level l while the saturated zone water storage ws c sz modeled and the total groundwater storage ws c total modeled are the sum of the water content in the soil between the reference surface z 0 and the groundwater level l and the sum of water content in the soil between the reference surface z 0 and the ground surface z s respectively and they care calculated as follows 3 ws c vz modeled l z s θ i d z n m θ i δ z ws c sz modeled z 0 l θ i d z 0 n θ i δ z ws c total modeled w s c vz modeled w s c sz modeled z 0 z s θ i d z 0 m θ i δ z where θ i is the water content of the soil in the ith layer and m and n are the number of soil layers at the ground surface and groundwater level respectively with n changing with the changes in the groundwater level the temporal changes in the groundwater storage at wuhan sg station calculated using the local hydrological modeling method are shown in fig 6 in which the gray blue and green solid lines represent the total water storage changes ws c total modeled the saturated zone water storage changes ws c sz modeled and the vadose zone water storage changes ws c vz modeled respectively as can be seen from the calculation results obtained using the local hydrological modeling method fig 6 the range of the wscsz were 1630 mm and the range of the wscvz were approximately 1310 mm both of which far exceed the range of the total groundwater storage changes approximately 350 mm indicating that the influence of both the vadose zone and the saturated zone should be considered when studying groundwater storage changes in terms of the phase trend the groundwater storage changes in the vadose zone were almost completely opposite that in the saturated zone and the total groundwater storage change and it was also completely opposite the changes in the groundwater level and rainfall fig 2 indicating that when the groundwater level rises due to increased rainfall in the rainy season the soil in the vadose zone becomes thinner which leads to a decrease in the vadose zone water storage whereas the opposite situation occurs in the dry season the grey blue and green solid lines are the total groundwater storage changes ws c total modeled and the water storage changes in the saturated zone ws c sz modeled and vadose zone ws c vz modeled respectively 3 2 quantitative separation of the wscvz using the superconductive gravity technique according to the introduction of the study area in the second section the absence of a surface water body is found in the vicinity of the station and the influence of surface runoff and vegetation water storage may be ignored subsequently the gravity residuals mainly contain information about the groundwater storage changes and can be approximated as an observation to characterize the changes in the total groundwater storage ignoring the unevenness of the terrain and the nonuniformity of the medium the gravity effect δ g m s2 due to the changes in groundwater storage δ h in the study area can be approximated by the following cylinder equation heiskanen and moritz 1967 4 δ g 2 π g ρ w δ h r 2 h 2 r 2 h δ h 2 where g is the universal gravitational constant 6 67 10 11 nm2 kg2 ρ w is the density of water 1000 kg m3 δ h is the change in the water storage thickness m r is the radius of the cylinder m and h is the height of the gravity measurement point relative to the cylinder s surface m by further expanding the cylinder s radius to infinity equation 4 can be simplified to the following approximation equation for the bouguer plate 5 δ g 2 π g ρ δ h therefore under the approximation of a planar semi infinite space the total groundwater storage changes ws c total sg can be estimated from the gravity residuals using the following equation 6 ws c total sg δ h δ g 2 π g ρ w the total groundwater storage changes include the water storage changes in both the vadose and saturated zones to quantitatively separate the two a method is proposed to estimate the saturated zone water storage changes ws c sz n based on the changes in the groundwater level δ l and the soil porosity n and drawing on the practice of converting the observed changes in the groundwater level depth to the storage changes in the study of groundwater storage changes using grace data rodell and famiglietti 2002 feng et al 2013 that is ws c sz n is approximated as the product of δ l and n 7 ws c sz n δ l n where n is given in table 1 and characterizes the wscsz in the study of groundwater storage changes obtained using the grace data the product of the soil s specific yield and the groundwater level changes δ l were used to validate the estimates of total groundwater storage changes from grace the result represents the changes in the water released as the original saturated zone is transformed into the vadose zone after the groundwater level drops or the changes in the water stored as the original vadose zone is transformed into the saturated zone after the groundwater level rises therefore the result characterizes the total groundwater storage changes rather than the wscsz this is the reason why the soil porosity n was chosen to calculate the wscsz after calculating the saturated zone water storage changes ws c sz n using equation 7 the vadose zone water storage changes ws c vz sg can be readily obtained by subtracting ws c sz n from the total groundwater storage changes ws c total sg thereby achieving the quantitative separation of the two that is 8 ws c vz sg w s c total sg w s c sz n fig 7 presents the groundwater storage changes estimated based on the superconducting gravity residuals and the groundwater level observations at wuhan sg station as can be seen from fig 7 the range of the wscsz calculated based on the groundwater level observations and porosity is approximately 1630 mm which also far exceeds the range of the total storage changes estimated using the superconducting gravity residuals approximately 290 mm and the difference between the two is the range of the wscvz approximately 1580 mm in terms of the phase trend this is almost completely opposite to the corresponding saturated zone water storage changes and the total groundwater storage changes this result is consistent with that obtained using the local hydrological modeling method as can be seen from the separation results obtained using the two methods shown in figs 6 and 7 the range of the separated groundwater storage changes in the saturated and vadose zones far exceed the range of the total storage changes in particular in terms of the phase trend the vadose zone water storage changes are basically opposite to the saturated zone water storage changes and to the total groundwater storage changes specifically when the groundwater level rises due to of the increased rainfall in the rainy season part of the vadose zone is recharged and becomes saturated and accordingly the thickness of the vadose zone decreases resulting in a corresponding decrease in the vadose zone water storage when the groundwater level decreases due to the decrease in rainfall in the dry season part of the saturated zone releases part of the water and becomes vadose and thus the thickness of the vadose zone increases leading to a corresponding increase in the vadose zone water storage overall the water retention effect of the vadose aquifer and its buffering effect on the groundwater infiltration and flow slow down the changes in the total groundwater storage this can also explain another phenomenon as follows the actual observed range of the changes in the gravity effect at this station is only about 120 nm s 2 while the groundwater changes reached 7 m and the specific yield was about 0 111 which is far from the 330 nm s 2 estimated using the bouguer effect equation 5 this difference is closely related to the role of the vadose zone in slowing down the total groundwater storage changes and their gravity effect therefore the role of the vadose zone in the study of local groundwater storage changes and their gravity field effect cannot be ignored 4 comparative analysis of the quantitative separation results of the vadose zone water storage changes 4 1 comparative analysis of the quantitative separation results obtained using the local hydrological modeling method and the superconductive gravity technique the wscvz quantitatively separated using the local hydrological modeling method green line in fig 6 and that obtained using the superconductive gravity technique green line in fig 7 are similar in terms of the apparent seasonal variations so the quantitative separation results obtained using the two methods were further compared by calculating the difference in the water storage changes dwsc and the reasons for the difference were investigated fig 8 shows a comparison of the wscvz at wuhan sg station obtained using the superconductive gravity technique red line and using the local hydrological modeling method blue line the two results are in good agreement indicating that the quantitative separation of the wscvz can be achieved using the superconductive gravity technique based on the existing observation conditions at wuhan sg station the gray line in fig 8 represents the difference between the two the maximum difference is approximately 250 mm and the standard deviation of the difference is approximately 50 mm accounting for 3 4 of the result i e cov 3 4 the relatively small magnitude of this difference indicates that its presence does not affect the conclusion that the wscvz can be quantitatively separated using the superconductive gravity technique to explain the differences between the quantitative separation results obtained using the above two methods we calculated the wscsz simulated using the local hydrological modeling method and that directly obtained via conversion using groundwater observation data a comparison of the results is shown in fig 9 the results show that the wscsz obtained using the two methods are almost identical indicating that the difference in the results of the total groundwater storage changes at wuhan sg station obtained using the above two methods is mainly derived from the difference in the vadose zone since the difference in the total groundwater storage changes obtained using the two methods is mainly attributed to the difference in the wscvz it is necessary to analyze the causes of this difference first this difference is due to the uncertainties in the local hydrological model itself such as the one dimensional simplification of the model inaccuracies in precipitation data not considering surface runoff underestimation of the evapotranspiration and the inaccuracy of the soil hydraulic properties parameterization which can cause the simulation results to deviate from the actual situation second this difference could also be caused by the influence of other signals included in the gravity residuals e g remaining barometric pressure tidal signals and other geophysical dynamic signals during the superconducting gravity data processing or by nonlinear drift of the instrument if other causes for this difference are to be further determined additional local hydrogeological survey data and more refined processing of the superconducting gravity observations are needed 4 2 comparative analysis of the groundwater storage changes results obtained using the local hydrological modeling method and the gldas model as was described in section 1 the gldas noah model can provide the equivalent water height time series for the water storage in the specific depth range of 0 200 cm in the global subsurface with a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 which enables the quantitative calculation of the water storage changes in this depth range green line in fig 4 compared with the quantitative separation results obtained using the superconductive gravity technique and using the local hydrological modeling method green lines in figs 6 and 7 respectively shown in fig 10 the result of the gldas noah model significantly underestimates the wscvz at wuhan sg station reflecting only 9 11 of the total changes the comparative results reveal that the gldas noah model fails to fully reflect the water storage changes in the entire vadose zone due to the limitation of the depth range 0 200 cm and the range of the vadose zone cannot be separated from that of the saturated zone in real time using this model alone the wscvz at the same burial depth 0 200 cm was calculated using the local hydrological modeling method and then compared to the wscvz obtained using the gldas noah model the orange and green lines in fig 11 show the results of the groundwater storage changes in the depth range of 0 200 cm obtained using the local hydrological modeling method and the gldas noah model respectively and the gray line in fig 11 represents the difference between the two these results show that the results obtained using the two methods generally exhibit similar change trends with a correlation coefficient of 0 60 however there is a large difference in the absolute amount of water storage changes as shown by the gray line in fig 11 the absolute value of the maximum difference is approximately 100 mm and the standard deviation of the difference is approximately 30 mm accounting for 15 18 of the result i e cov 15 18 the reasons for the difference in the model results may be the differences in the soil stratification the soil properties the elements of the input observation data and the spatial scales of the models for example the local hydrological modeling method uses observation data such as point precipitation and groundwater levels at stations while the data input into the gldas noah model are the meteorological driving parameters with a spatial resolution of approximately 0 2 from the global data assimilation system gdas of the national centers for environmental prediction ncep the daily precipitation with a spatial resolution of 1 0 1 0 from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp and the radiation dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 from the air force weather agency afwa therefore the results obtained using the gldas noah model represent an average effect over a relatively large region thus this model is more accurate for the simulation of trend terms on a regional scale but it is slightly deficient in fine simulations on a local scale 5 discussion and conclusions in this study a new method for the quantitative separation of wscvz i e the quantitative separation of groundwater storage changes in the vadose zone from those in the saturated zone based on the superconductive gravity technique was proposed this new method was verified through examples using the superconducting gravity observation data from wuhan sg station may 2008 to april 2010 and groundwater level observation data the quantitative separation results of the wscvz at wuhan sg station were obtained and were compared with those obtained using the local hydrological modeling method and using the global gldas noah model the results show that there is good agreement between the quantitative separation results of the wscvz at wuhan sg station obtained using the superconductive gravity technique and using local hydrological modeling indicating that the quantitative separation of the local wscvz can be achieved using the superconductive gravity technique and groundwater level observations the trend of the quantitatively separated the wscvz is almost exactly opposite to the trends of the total groundwater storage changes and the wscsz indicating that the wscvz play a significant role in slowing down the total groundwater storage changes and their hydrological gravity effect and thus it cannot be ignored when studying local total groundwater storage changes and their gravity field effects the results obtained using the gldas noah model for wuhan sg station differ considerably from those obtained using the above two methods accounting for only approximately 10 of the latter indicating that the gldas noah model fails to completely reflect the groundwater storage changes in the entire vadose zone due to the limitation of the simulated depth range and the large spatial scale of the model in addition there is still a great deal of room for the improvement of this model in terms of the accurate estimation of vadose zone water storage although both the superconductive gravity technique and the local hydrological modeling method can be used to achieve the quantitative separation of the wscvz at wuhan sg station each has its own applicability the local hydrological modeling method has a clear physical meaning and is independent of the gravity observation it is suitable for stations with abundant hydrometeorological data and clear geological and structural conditions the separation method based on the superconductive gravity technique is simple and straightforward and it can be used to obtain quantitative estimates of the vadose zone water storage at stations that lack local knowledge of the hydrogeological structures and hydrometeorological data and have superconducting gravimetric observations as the quantitative estimates of the local vadose zone water storage can be achieved by using the superconductive gravity technique our results further demonstrate that the gravity observation could be used to constrain the local hydrological model parameters therefore the two methods have their own advantages and disadvantages and the selection of one over the other depends on the actual situation of the station credit authorship contribution statement qianqian he
