270,although many frost heave and freezing soil models have been developed in the past decades saturated conditions are commonly assumed and or the behavior of pore ice rather than ice lenses are conventionally predicted this study presents a fully coupled thermal hydraulic mechanical thm model for variably saturated freezing soil which examines a number of processes these include heat conduction and convection phase change water moisture movement through cryosuction and the development of independent ice lenses instead of directly solving for the pore pressure distributions the void ratio is considered as a dependent variable related to the degree of water saturation both the stress deformation and ice lens segregation are inextricably linked to the evolution of the void ratio as well the coupled mechanism and performance of the model is first verified by comparison with laboratory freezing experiment observations obtained from literature and then is further evaluated by a series of parametric analyses the results show that the calculated profiles of temperature water content and frost heave are in good agreement with literature experimental data demonstrating that the proposed thm coupling model appropriately represents the mechanisms of heat moisture deformation in variably saturated freezing soil in addition the sensitivity analysis illustrates that in the test cases considered thermally induced cryosuction due to phase change is the main driving force for water migrating towards the freezing front also ahead of the freezing front a significant increase in effective stress developed due to the elevated negative pore pressure and expansion of ice lenses causing substantial consolidation and reduction in porosity in the unfrozen zone as the freezing front penetrated with time the temperature moisture vapour and stress strain fields interact with each other the distribution of water vapour was mainly controlled by the temperature gradient and location of the freezing front both the initial degree of saturation and hydraulic conductivity affected the distribution of pore pressure and displacements higher compression moduli and lower overburden load led to greater frost heave but exerted little influence on the temperature field finally the two sided freezing scenario for soils underlain by permafrost made the middle ice poor zone

water cycles energy balances and terrestrial dynamics soil freezing is a complicated process which involves water moisture migration heat transfer phase change and potential domain deformation when ground surface temperature drops below the freezing point the freezing front penetrates progressively downward in soils simultaneously the volumetric expansion due to the liquid to solid phase change and accumulated ice lenses may cause the uplifting of the ground surface i e frost heave frost heave can cause damage to engineering infrastructure such as pavements railways pipelines canals and buildings e g williams and smith 1989 sheng et al 2014 tian et al 2019 this phenomenon has been found not only to occur on earth but also to apparently prevail on mars e g sizemore et al 2015

separation e g gilpin 1980 konrad and morgenstern 1980 nixon 1991 and to more fully understand the underlying mechanism of ice lens initiation and formation e g rempel et al 2004 dash et al 2006 a versatile yet straightforward model is still needed for engineering practice as the impacts of climate change become more obvious the need to appropriately consider the impacts of freezing soils on infrastructure is intensifying there are many studies focusing on the development of partially or fully coupled thermo hydraulic mechanical thm models to quantify the evolution of and relationships among the water heat and displacement in freezing soil e g williams and smith 1989 thomas et al 2009 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 however most of them assume the soil is saturated and their model framework is thus strictly applicable only to gas free systems undergoing freeze thaw e g nakano 1990 lai et al 2014 arzanfudi and al khoury 2018 grenier et al 2018 by neglecting the variation of stress strain fields in unsaturated soils during freezing sheshukov and nieber 2011 established a three zone model that was capable of describing coupled flow and heat transfer processes painter and karra 2014 proposed a constitutive relation between temperature unfrozen water content gas content and liquid pressure in frozen soils zhang et al 2016 presented a coupled model for moisture vapour and heat transport in unsaturated freezing soil in which the phase change of evaporation and condensation of vapour flow were taken into account but without considering related deformation process to analyze the frost heave stress in a drainage trench lining tian et al 2019 constructed a heat moisture deformation model for unsaturated soils subjected to freeze thaw cycles more recently xu et al 2020 derived the expression of input work rate for unsaturated and saturated frozen soils to define the stress strain variables involving the thm coupling situation while significant progress has been made in understanding and modeling the freezing processes within partially saturated soils there remains a requirement to more fully validate model performance for example based on the lab field measurements and to explicitly accommodate ice lens formation and the resulting transient stress strain fields ice lens formation in frozen soils has been extensively investigated over past decades and there are many criteria for initiating new ice lenses such as segregating potential or temperature konrad and morgenstern 1980 separation strength gilpin 1980 o neill and miller 1985 nixon 1991 separating void ratio or porosity zhou et al 2012 lai et al 2014 although these methods are different in many aspects they share one common goal which is accurately reproducing the frost heave and distribution of ice lens with simplified parametrization thomas et al 2009 defined a simple stress inequality relating to terzaghi s effective stress which was then incorporated into a thm model to illustrate the development of discrete ice lenses for seasonally frozen soils based on this framework a two independent stress state variable approach bishop and blight 1963 was recent incorporated in a thm model for saturated frozen soils e g zhou and li 2012 lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 for the case of partially saturated freezing soils predicting characteristics of frost heave as well as the formation and segregation of ice lenses remains poorly documented sheng et al 2014 and yin et al 2018 attempted to fill this gap by conducting thm analyses involving the separation of ice lenses but the simulated results were not verified or constrained by laboratory and field observations in addition sheng et al 2014 and yin et al 2018 did not consider the process of cryogenic suction induced by the phase change which occurs at the water ice interfaces it has been well recognized however that the cryosuction is an important process especially for frost susceptible soils e g williams and smith 1989 dash et al 2006 this study aims at presenting a fully coupled thm model for variably saturated freezing soils which considers the processes of heat transfer water moisture movement vapour distribution thermally induced cryosuction stress strain behaviour and the formation of discrete ice lenses the model was verified by comparison simulation results with laboratory experimental measurements obtained from literature the results were discussed in terms of temperature heat flux frost depth water content water flux void ratio vapour content frost heave stress strain and displacement then through a parametric assessment the relative influences of thermal hydraulic and mechanical parameters on the dynamic soil freezing problem were examined these parametric analyses will help to improve the design of field monitoring programs in cold regions and provide useful insights for the construction of artificial ground freezing scenarios and potential freeze thaw phenomena associated with climate change 2 methods 2 1 conceptual formulation frost heave in freezing soils tends to be of the highest magnitude in the vicinity of discrete ice lenses rather than being associated with the expansion of water locally in situ when it turns into ice in the pore space taber 1929 observed the phenomenon of frost heave within soils that were nearly saturated with benzene which contracts upon freezing and accounted for it through the formation of macroscopic ice lenses close to the freezing front the water ice phase change will initiate the process of cryosuction which pulls free liquid water from surrounding voids and unfrozen zones to feed ice lens growth e g williams and smith 1989 an ice lens may continuously grow as a result of the cryosuction until the water ceases to move into the freezing zone frozen fringe or the ice crystals become over stressed e g o neill and miller 1985 nixon 1991 as the freezing front progressively penetrates from ground surface discrete ice lenses may begin to form which effectively squeeze nearby soil particles in the direction of least resistance fig 1 a schematically shows the presence of macroscopic ice lenses in the vadose zone subjected to ground freezing producing typical profiles of the temperature moisture and displacements from a pore scale viewpoint fig 1 b illustrates a schematic representation of a freezing soil with the pore ice absorbed water films gas vapour and soil grains surrounding an individual ice lens during soil freezing under partially saturated conditions the liquid in the unfrozen water films around and between the soil grains moves toward the ice lens displacing the soil grains in the opposite direction rempel et al 2004 in the frozen fringe these soil grain water films may act as conduits through which pore water can move towards the ice lens simultaneously available water vapour diffuses from the warmer more humid side of the freezing profile towards the colder and less humid side and finally condensing there and adding to the ice mass e g sheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the transient freezing processes in partially saturated soils depend on the evolving and transient relationships among the soil water movement heat transfer water ice phase change and deformation in order to better understand the complex coupling and interaction between these different parameters and processes from a quantitative point of view it is helpful to develop and utilize a mathematical model 2 2 mathematical model to formulate the governing equations for water movement heat transport and deformation in unsaturated freezing soil several basic assumptions are made as follows i soil particles water and ice are homogeneous isotropic and incompressible the ice growth expansion is isotropic water ice phase change is based on equilibrium thermodynamics ii the moisture migrates only in liquid form and obeys darcy s law without considering the movement of ice crystals iii the freezing point of water is assumed constant without considering its depression under high pressure and salt exclusion iv pore air pressure in the soil remains atmospheric fig 2 shows a four phase composition diagram for the unsaturated freezing soil taking into consideration the relative volume within the averaging theory if the volume of soil skeleton within a representative elemental volume is assumed to be one then the volume of pore space is the void ratio e then the volumetric content of water θ w ice θ i vapour θ v and soil grains θ s m3 m 3 can be expressed as 1 θ w e s s i 1 e θ i e s i 1 e θ v e 1 s 1 e θ s 1 1 e where s refers to the degree of saturation with respect to the total volume of the liquid water and ice in pore space following the approach taken by thomas 2009 zhou and li 2012 and zhang et al 2018 the void ratio is used to develop constitutive equations rather than porosity si refers to the proportion of the ice in pore space and is a function of temperature which can be described as tice et al 1976 2 s i 0 t t f 1 1 t t f α t t f where tf is the freezing point and α is an empirical parameter depending on the pore size of soil fixed as 5 in this study based on the advice of thomas et al 2009 and ming and li 2014 in laboratory and or field experiments the mass water content fraction of dry weight rather than volumetric water content is often determined such mass water content can be represented as 3 w θ w ρ w d v ρ i θ i d v θ s ρ s d v e s s i ρ w e s i ρ i ρ s where ρ w ρ i and ρ s are densities of liquid water ice and soil grains respectively kg m 3 dv refers to representative element volume of the soil 2 2 1 water migration based on the law of conservation of mass the expression of water moisture migration in freezing soil can be expressed as e g thomas et al 2009 4 ρ w θ w d v ρ i θ i d v ρ v θ v d v t ρ w v d v 0 where t is time s ρ v is the density of vapour kg m 3 and v is average water flux m s 1 the density of vapour is minimal compared to density of water so ρ v ρ w 0 substituting eq 1 into eq 4 and rearranging the equation yields 5 t t ρ i ρ w s i t ρ w s t e 1 e e t ρ w s s i ρ i s i 1 1 e

observed significant water movement from the warm side toward the cold side due to the thermally induced cryogenic suction phenomenon e g williams and smith 1989 thomas et al 2009 based on

s t k k r ρ w g p w ρ w g z ρ w l f t f t in the partially frozen zone the presence of ice crystals would decrease hydraulic conductivity which is usually assumed to depend on temperature and given as gilpin 1980 nixon 1991 9 k k 0 1 t t f β where k 0 is initial saturated hydraulic conductivity m s 1 under the unfrozen condition and β is an empirical parameter depending on the size and structure of pore fixed at 8 in this study as suggested by thomas et al 2009 and ming and li 2014 as a freezing front penetrates through the soil column the accumulated ice occupied pore space results in frost heave upward in the frozen zone and consolidation downward in the unfrozen zone e g lai et al 2014 to account for the influence of this consolidation the hydraulic conductivity in the unfrozen zone can be amended by a factor related to the void ratio specified as e e 0 2 in this study as suggested by arora 2009 then a general form of the saturated hydraulic conductivity in eq 9 can be written as 10 k k 0 e e 0 2 k 0 e e 0 2 1 t t 0 β 0 t t f t t f e e s e p t t f e e s e p where e 0 is the initial void ratio and esep is the critical void ratio separating the discrete ice lens if one is present the esep term was assigned as 1 2 based on the suggested criterion provided in zhou and li 2012 and zhang et al 2018 the relationship between the relative hydraulic conductivity kr dimensionless and the degree of water saturation s is given by the simplified van genuchten mualem equation van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 11 k r s 1 1 s 1 m m 2 where m is an empirical parameter and fixed at 0 5 in this study 2 2 2 heat transport considering evaporation and condensation in unsaturated freezing soil and neglecting heat transport through the vapour flux which is known to be very low under small thermal gradients see supplementary materials the governing equation of the heat conduction convection with phase change based on the energy conservation is commonly given by e g

t 1 where m is the molecular weight of water 0 018 kg mol 1 and r is the universal gas constant 8 341 j mol 1 k 1 2 2 3 force equilibrium and constitutive relationships assuming gravity is the volumetric force the soil is in quasi static equilibrium which in terms of the total stress tensor σ gives the following equation 17 σ γ 0 where γ is the unit weight which can be written as see the four phase composition in fig 2 18 γ g 1 e ρ s e s s i ρ w e s i ρ i e 1 s ρ v based on the uniaxial compression test and according to elastic stress strain relationship the compression coefficient of saturated soil is defined as 19 d e d σ 1 e 0 e s where σ is effective stress and es is the compression modulus of saturated soil for unsaturated soil the influence of the degree of saturation on soil strength should be accounted for here a coefficient χ s 0 4 s 0 6 is used to correct the compression modulus to account for the degree of saturation as follows with aitchison 1960 therefore eq 19 can be rewritten as 20 d σ χ e s d e 1 e 0 χ e s d ε where ε is the strain for a one dimension problem the relationship between the strain and displacement u in terms of the void ratio is stated as 21 ε d u d z e e 0 1 e 0 according to the terzaghi s effective stress principle the total stress is the sum of the equivalent pore pressure ppor and effective stress σ as follows bishop and blight 1963 22 σ σ p p o r σ χ p w 1 χ p a where pw is the pore water pressure and pa is atmospheric pressure substituting eqs 20 and 22 into eq 17 gives 23 χ e s 1 e 0 e p p o r γ 2 2 4 supplementary equations assuming the pore air pressure remains atmospheric integrating eq 23 within the soil domain one dimensional condition in the gravitational direction and then substituting it into eq 22 we obtain 24 p p o r z l γ γ 0 d z χ e s e e 0 1 e 0 χ p w where l is the height of the soil column and γ0 is the initial unit weight according to eq 22 and eq 24 the maximum value of ppor equals to the total stress σ at the critical void ratio es consequently a general form of eq 24 can be rewritten as follows 25 p p o r z l γ γ 0 d z χ e s e e 0 1 e 0 e e s σ e e s with 26 e s 1 χ e s 1 e 0 σ z l γ γ 0 d z e 0 for the freezing of unsaturated soils it is reasonable to assume that the pore space in the frozen zone is entirely occupied by the ice and residual unfrozen liquid water e g sheshukov and nieber 2011 as the vapour was expelled into the pore space in the partially frozen or unfrozen regions it means the frozen zone is saturated and the vapour only exists in the unfrozen zone because the degree of saturation s exists in the governing eqs 5 14 and 17 one additional equation relating to the s is required to solve them to represent how the degree of saturation s changes in the unfrozen zone as the freezing front penetrated here we used a relationship between the degree of saturation and the void ratio proposed by gallipoli et al 2003 modifying the van genuchten equation it can be expressed as follows 27 s t s 1 s 1 m e e t t t f 0 t t f where m is an empirical parameter the same as in eq 11 and fixed at 0 5 in this study 2 3 numerical implementation the governing eqs 5 14 17 21 and 27 are developed to simulate the coupled thm analysis of the frozen soils they are highly non linear because the primary variables and their respective parameters in these equations vary with time and space accompanied by appropriate initial and boundary conditions this coupled system is solved numerically using the finite element fe method for spatial discretization and the finite difference method for temporal discretization the governing equations can be expressed in the following general form 28 d a τ t γ f where τ e t σ u s are the primary dependent variables da is damping or mass coefficient γ is the conservative flux vector and f is the source term the generalized solution to eq 28 can be given as 29 d a τ t τ ω γ τ ω f τ ω n γ τ ω where ω is the computational domain ω is the boundary of the domain and n is the outward norm vector of the boundary by applying the backward difference for temporal discretization 30 τ t τ i τ i 1 δ t substituting equation eq 30 into eq 29 leads to the following equation 31 d a τ i τ i 1 δ t τ ω γ τ ω f τ ω n γ τ ω where τ is virtual displacement and the superscript i denotes the time step the initial condition can be expressed as 32 τ z 0 τ 0 where τ0 is a known quantity of variable when time is 0 the first type dirichlet of boundary condition is given by 33 τ s τ s where τ s is a known function of space and time the second type neumann of boundary condition is given by 34 n γ g κ τ ς t where g is the boundary source and κ τ ς t is a matrix of the elastic constraint the above numerical procedure is implemented by the fe code comsol multiphysics v5 3 with the time dependent solver the solution is sought by making use of a newton raphson algorithm that starts with the initial conditions as an initial guess the resulting system of linearized equations within each newton raphson iteration is solved using the parallel sparse direct solver mumps in the fully coupled monolithic approach resulting in the derived system jacobian containing all off diagonal terms that appear from coupling of the governing equations 3 experimental validation the validity of the proposed model and its performance is checked against an instructive laboratory experiment ming and li 2014 performed a top down freezing test in an open system during which an unsaturated soil the qinghai tibet silty clay was packed into a cylinder of 10 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height the soil sample had an initial nearly uniform void ratio of 0 6 degree of saturation 0 72 and volumetric water content of 0 27 cm3 cm 3 before the test the soil sample was put into a thermotank with a temperature of 1 c for 24 h to allow the thermal equilibrium then the temperature on the top surface was abruptly decreased to 3 c while the bottom surface was maintained at 1 c its sidewall was thermally insulated and hydraulically impermeable and a load of 100 kpa was applied on the top surface at the bottom water was supplied through a tube connected to an external reservoir the freezing test continued for 100 h during which the temperature profile at different depths and the amount of displacement on the top surface i e frost heave were monitored after testing the water content profile was determined by dividing the soil sample into slices for the numerical model setup the dirichlet boundary conditions with specific temperatures were considered in the heat transfer computation because the water was supplied freely no pressure water supply and the void ratio at the bottom was assumed to constant a value of void ratio 0 6 was defined for bottom boundary while for the top boundary a value of void ratio 0 6 1 09 0 654 was assigned account for the essentially instantaneous freezing at the top boundary which caused the volume expansion by 9 the initial conditions of water content void ratio and degree of saturation and temperature were the same as the experimental condition because the displacement was allowed only along the axial direction which was the same for the water and heat transport the process of coupled water heat and stress could be reduced to one dimension for the simulations the numerical domain was discretized with 200 uniform quadric lagrange elements and the time step of 5 min is adopted with a relative convergence tolerance of 10 5 the physical and mechanical parameters for the soil and the other model parameters are listed in table 1 because the temporal profiles of water content were not recorded during this test only the total water content at the end of the experiment is available thus the final profile of total water content is used to verify the proposed model comparisons of the measured and simulated profiles of temperature total water content and frost heave are shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the predicted temperature agrees quite well with the measured ones fig 3a and fig 3b both the measured and simulated results show that the distribution of temperature is approaching to linear trend in both the frozen and unfrozen zones while at the early stage there is a larger temperature gradient in the frozen zone this is caused by the larger thermal conductivity and smaller heat capacity in the frozen zone as compared to the unfrozen zone and vice versa in the late stage fig 3b shows the profiles of temperature at three points against time the point of 9 5 cm is close to the cold top and the point of 3 5 cm is near the warm bottom it can be seen from fig 3b that at the point closer to the cold side less time is required for the temperature to reach a steady value the temperature curves at the 6 cm and 7 cm points clearly show that as the temperature approaches 0 c the rate of temperature drop is relatively gradual and slower than what is observed when the temperatures are higher and lower than 0 c this reduction in the rate of change of temperature with time at this point is due to the large release of latent heat which occurs during the water ice phase change as shown in fig 3c the freezing front 0 c isotherm penetrates quickly at the beginning and then tends to slow down toward a stable depth of about 2 2 cm the thickness of the frozen zone increases with the time and the simulated curve of the frost heave matches well with measured data fig 3d shows that the distribution of mass water content which is a good agreement with the measured results the maximum water content occurs near the freezing front wherein the accumulated water might be caused by the elevated negative pore water pressure near the freezing front see fig s1 which draws free water from unfrozen zone resulting in a high degree of liquid water saturation see fig s2 there are a couple of discrete zones with high variability in water content which is due to the formation of discontinuous ice lenses as shown in fig 3e and fig 3f after the ice lens starts to grow the elevated pore pressure falls to the overburden stress see fig s1 it can be seen from fig 3f that the ice lens located at the lowest point in the domain near the unfrozen boundary is much thicker than the other ones that have formed in the profile this is consistent with the measurements by ming and li 2014 and agrees well with the findings by thomas et al 2009 and lai et al 2014 this observation can be explained by the fact that in the later stage of the freezing process the rate of the freezing front propagation gradually decreases to a slow steady value which leaves sufficient time for water to migrate upward from the unfrozen lower boundary through cryosuction to reach the deepest ice lens and feed its growth the dynamic changes of heat and water fluxes vapour content strain stress and displacement during the freezing test are illustrated in fig 4 which are usually unmeasurable in practice fig 4a shows that in the frozen zone heat transfer is mainly based on conduction while heat convection is dominant in the unfrozen zone because of the noticeable pore water flow the total heat flux reaches a peak at the freezing front where it coincides with the peaks of water flux in fig 4b it should be noted that positive velocities in fig 4b refer to water flow from the warm to cold side fig 4b shows that in the region of the frozen fringe the cryogenic suction at the interface of water ice phase change results in substantial water flow due to temperature gradients thin dashed line in fig 4b simultaneously the cryosuction process results in an opposing development of water pressure gradient see fig s1 which results in an opposing direction of water flow below and above the base of the frozen fringe thick dashed line in fig 4b by accumulating the water fluxes contributed by the pressure gradient driven force and temperature gradient driven force there is a total net water flux which reaches its peak at the freezing front and diminishes toward the cold side such maximum net water flux decreases gradually to a steady value when the freezing front ceased its propagation fig 4c show that the vapour content decreases rapidly in the early stages of the freezing process and stabilizes after 48 hours when the freezing front reaches a steady state fig 3a and fig 3c as observed by philip and de vries 1957 and zhang et al 2016 the calculated vapour fluxes represent a very small water flux within the combined thm model see supplementary materials fig s3 indicating that the vapour fluxes in this freezing test could be neglected in comparison to the substantial water and heat fluxes moreover the model describing the vapour flow is over parameterized and there are few laboratory and field observations to verify the vapour fluxes in freezing soils philip and de vries 1957 zhang et al 2016 the strain distributions in fig 4d indicate that there is a remarkable consolidation in the unfrozen zone which may be caused by the development of the large effective stress near the freezing front as shown in fig 4e this large increase in effective stress ahead of the freezing front dissipates towards the cold and warm domain boundaries which can be explained by a combined effect of the expansion of ice lenses and of the generation of negative pore water pressures through the cryosuction process the coinciding reduction in the void ratio fig 3e and fig 3f and porosity see fig s6 also reflects the degree of packing achieved in the unfrozen zone in response to the given stress histories these findings indicate that there is a substantial consolidation ahead of the freezing front fig 4f displays a deformed contour of displacements during the complete freezing process illustrating that in the later stage the frost heave lifts the top cold surface at a near constant rate although the freezing front gradually approaches a steady state 4 parametric analysis to quantify how relevant factors affect the behaviours of soil freezing this section covers a parametric study based on the proposed and validated model base problem case c0 the parameters analyzed are i boundary temperature ii thermal conductivity iii initial water content iv saturated hydraulic conductivity v overburden load on the top surface vi compression modulus table 2 presents a summary of the cases studied in this parametric analysis the remaining conditions and characteristics are the same as the base problem in the following section presents the most relevant aspects of the analysis 4 1 effects of boundary temperature and thermal conductivity 4 1 1 one sided freezing the one sided freezing is a typical scenario for ground freezing of soils initiated at the atmospheric ground surface interface without the presence of underlying permafrost when the upper boundary temperature is reduced from the base case of 3 oc to 5 oc case c2 the freezing front advances downwards more rapidly fig 5 a as a consequence of the higher thermal gradient near the upper boundary as the rate of freezing front propagation decreases due to the decreasing thermal gradient and increasing of latent heat there is sufficient time for ice formation for the colder case and ultimately deeper frost depth penetration and larger frost heave fig 5b when the thermal conductivity is increased within the base case scenario case c4 the freezing front propagation rate is initially higher but the final profiles of temperature pore water pressure and vapour content are very similar to the base case fig 5 these results suggest that the thermal gradient is a dominant factor controlling the location and propagation rate of the freezing front and the development of negative pore pressures within the freeing profile fig 5a that were observed in the model validation work section 3 4 1 2 two sided freezing for a thawed soil layer overlaying permafrost freezing upward a two sided freezing process would develop when combined with freezing from the ground surface freezing downward as discussed above for this scenario all conditions are the same as in the base case except that the temperature of the lower boundary is reduced to 1 oc table 2 case c5 fig 6 a depicts profiles of temperature and pore pressure profiles for the two sided freezing case c5 after 12 h in the middle zone the temperature is just below zero degrees owing to the released latent heat during water ice phase change and the high negative pore pressure in this region is due to cryogenic suction this is the well known zero curtain effect e g thomas et al 2009 the water flux profile in fig 6b indicates that pore water is flowing upwards upper and downwards lower within the two frozen fringes at the same time a high effective stress zone develops in the middle of the domain fig 6c which results in differential consolidation with significant deformation being observed near the bottom of the domain and less close to the top surface as shown in fig 6d as the freezing continues the thermal and mechanical conditions change as displayed in fig 6e there are two 0 oc frostlines converging from both sides toward the middle and disappeared in about 10 h only a small amount of frost heave is observed because there is no external water supply available during freezing and substantial consolidation occurs in the middle zone early in the unfrozen period collectively during the two sided freezing ice formation and segregation advances from both ends toward the middle zone while water is drawn from the middle towards both ends in a closed system consequently resulting in a consolidated ice poor zone these findings are generally consistent with those reported by thomas et al 2009 4 2 effects of initial water saturation and hydraulic conductivity fig 7 shows the influence of variable degrees of initial saturation and hydraulic conductivity on the profiles of temperature pore pressure frost heave and soil water flux rate as the degree of water saturation increases case c7 the freezing front tends to advance more slowly fig 7a because of the released latent heat the additional available pore water results in more displacement as freezing occurs as would be expected fig 7b in comparison to the unsaturated case c6 the negative pore pressure profile in the saturated case is lower in magnitude as freezing progresses fig 7a whereas the water flux rate along the lower boundary tends to increase with the degree of water saturation fig 7c this may be related to the fact that the hydraulic conductivity of the saturated soil is higher than the unsaturated soil this effect can also be observed in fig 7 that under the same degree of saturation 0 72 cases c8 and c9 the greater hydraulic conductivity results in higher negative pore pressures larger deformation and increased water inflow flux along the lower boundary these results reflect that both the initial water content and hydraulic conductivity have considerable influence on the behaviors of freezing soil these observations are consistent with the practical findings that the magnitude of frost heave for freezing soils usually depends on soil type which can exhibit and range of hydraulic conductivity values 4 3 effects of overburden load and compression modulus as illustrated in fig 8 a higher compression modulus case c12 vs case c13 leads to larger negative pore pressures and higher amounts of deformation the results shown in fig 8 also show that the changes in compression modulus and overburden load cases c10 c11 c12and c13 exert insignificant effects on thermal profiles e g temperature gradient frost depth according to fig 8b the changes in overburden pressure hardly affect the frost heave which is inconsistent with previous findings of the freezing test of the saturated soil such inconsistency may be attributed to the unsaturated condition that is the fixed initial degree of saturation 0 72 in the current parametric analysis of mechanical properties by keeping other parameters the same as base case c0 and only changing the initial degree of saturation and overburden pressure it is observed in fig s7 that under a lower overburden pressure condition the amount of frost heave increases with the degree of water saturation the above observations indicate that the compression modulus can play a controlling role in mechanical behaviour of freezing soil 5 concluding remarks in this work we developed a coupled thm model for variably saturated soil during the ground freezing process taking into account water movement due to cryosuction at the water ice interface concomitant with the development of ice lenses the model framework was based on a fully coupled approach where the void ratio temperature stress displacement and degree of saturation are interweaved to each other the proposed coupling mechanism was then implemented numerically to reproduce the results of a laboratory one sided freezing test and the model capabilities were evaluated through a comparison with the experimental observations utilizing the data from the one dimensional freezing experiment a series of parametric analyses was carried out to quantify their influence during the dynamic freezing process the following conclusions are made 1 by combining the relationship between the effective stress void ratio degree of saturation and the equilibrium thermodynamics at the water ice interfaces the proposed thm coupling model can not only accurately reproduce profiles of temperature water content and frost heave in unsaturated soil under a unidirectional freezing condition but also predict the dynamic changes of many unmeasurable variables in practice 2 the total heat flux was mainly contributed by heat conduction in the frozen zone while heat convection was dominant in the unfrozen zone reaching a maximum value near the freezing front where it coincided with the highest total water flux the thermally induced cryosuction is the main driving force for water migrating towards the freezing front in addition ahead of the freezing front significant increases in effective stress due to the elevated negative pore pressures and expansion of the ice lenses resulted in substantial consolidation and a reduction in strain and porosity in the unfrozen zone 3 as the freezing front penetrates with time the temperature moisture vapour and stress strain fields interact with each other the distribution of vapour was mainly controlled by the temperature gradient and location of the freezing front both the initial degree of saturation and hydraulic conductivity affected the distribution of pore pressure and displacements higher compression moduli and lower overburden load led to greater frost heave but exerted little influence on the temperature field 4 in comparison to the one sided freezing regime the two sided freezing for soils underlain by permafrost made the middle ice poor zone highly compacted with ice lenses accumulating near both cold boundaries the thickest ice lens tended to develop close to the freezing front the overall intent here was to construct an intuitive model constrained by the literature and reasonable assumptions to represent the formation of separate ice lenses and the associated soil deformation during the transient freezing of partially saturated soils incorporating the process of cryosuction the influence of freezing point depression hysteretic freeze thaw processes and non equilibrium thermodynamics as described by koniorczyk et al 2015 and gawin et al 2019 2020 may play an important role under specific conditions and will be explored in subsequent research and model extension within the scope of potential limitations as noted above the proposed model is capable of gaining valuable insights into coupled moisture migration heat transfer and elastic deformation that affect ice lens formation frost heave and consolidation this quantification framework may provide a useful tool for the assessment soil behavior under natural climatically driven freezing conditions or as

270,although many frost heave and freezing soil models have been developed in the past decades saturated conditions are commonly assumed and or the behavior of pore ice rather than ice lenses are conventionally predicted this study presents a fully coupled thermal hydraulic mechanical thm model for variably saturated freezing soil which examines a number of processes these include heat conduction and convection phase change water moisture movement through cryosuction and the development of independent ice lenses instead of directly solving for the pore pressure distributions the void ratio is considered as a dependent variable related to the degree of water saturation both the stress deformation and ice lens segregation are inextricably linked to the evolution of the void ratio as well the coupled mechanism and performance of the model is first verified by comparison with laboratory freezing experiment observations obtained from literature and then is further evaluated by a series of parametric analyses the results show that the calculated profiles of temperature water content and frost heave are in good agreement with literature experimental data demonstrating that the proposed thm coupling model appropriately represents the mechanisms of heat moisture deformation in variably saturated freezing soil in addition the sensitivity analysis illustrates that in the test cases considered thermally induced cryosuction due to phase change is the main driving force for water migrating towards the freezing front also ahead of the freezing front a significant increase in effective stress developed due to the elevated negative pore pressure and expansion of ice lenses causing substantial consolidation and reduction in porosity in the unfrozen zone as the freezing front penetrated with time the temperature moisture vapour and stress strain fields interact with each other the distribution of water vapour was mainly controlled by the temperature gradient and location of the freezing front both the initial degree of saturation and hydraulic conductivity affected the distribution of pore pressure and displacements higher compression moduli and lower overburden load led to greater frost heave but exerted little influence on the temperature field finally the two sided freezing scenario for soils underlain by permafrost made the middle ice poor zone

water cycles energy balances and terrestrial dynamics soil freezing is a complicated process which involves water moisture migration heat transfer phase change and potential domain deformation when ground surface temperature drops below the freezing point the freezing front penetrates progressively downward in soils simultaneously the volumetric expansion due to the liquid to solid phase change and accumulated ice lenses may cause the uplifting of the ground surface i e frost heave frost heave can cause damage to engineering infrastructure such as pavements railways pipelines canals and buildings e g williams and smith 1989 sheng et al 2014 tian et al 2019 this phenomenon has been found not only to occur on earth but also to apparently prevail on mars e g sizemore et al 2015

separation e g gilpin 1980 konrad and morgenstern 1980 nixon 1991 and to more fully understand the underlying mechanism of ice lens initiation and formation e g rempel et al 2004 dash et al 2006 a versatile yet straightforward model is still needed for engineering practice as the impacts of climate change become more obvious the need to appropriately consider the impacts of freezing soils on infrastructure is intensifying there are many studies focusing on the development of partially or fully coupled thermo hydraulic mechanical thm models to quantify the evolution of and relationships among the water heat and displacement in freezing soil e g williams and smith 1989 thomas et al 2009 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 however most of them assume the soil is saturated and their model framework is thus strictly applicable only to gas free systems undergoing freeze thaw e g nakano 1990 lai et al 2014 arzanfudi and al khoury 2018 grenier et al 2018 by neglecting the variation of stress strain fields in unsaturated soils during freezing sheshukov and nieber 2011 established a three zone model that was capable of describing coupled flow and heat transfer processes painter and karra 2014 proposed a constitutive relation between temperature unfrozen water content gas content and liquid pressure in frozen soils zhang et al 2016 presented a coupled model for moisture vapour and heat transport in unsaturated freezing soil in which the phase change of evaporation and condensation of vapour flow were taken into account but without considering related deformation process to analyze the frost heave stress in a drainage trench lining tian et al 2019 constructed a heat moisture deformation model for unsaturated soils subjected to freeze thaw cycles more recently xu et al 2020 derived the expression of input work rate for unsaturated and saturated frozen soils to define the stress strain variables involving the thm coupling situation while significant progress has been made in understanding and modeling the freezing processes within partially saturated soils there remains a requirement to more fully validate model performance for example based on the lab field measurements and to explicitly accommodate ice lens formation and the resulting transient stress strain fields ice lens formation in frozen soils has been extensively investigated over past decades and there are many criteria for initiating new ice lenses such as segregating potential or temperature konrad and morgenstern 1980 separation strength gilpin 1980 o neill and miller 1985 nixon 1991 separating void ratio or porosity zhou et al 2012 lai et al 2014 although these methods are different in many aspects they share one common goal which is accurately reproducing the frost heave and distribution of ice lens with simplified parametrization thomas et al 2009 defined a simple stress inequality relating to terzaghi s effective stress which was then incorporated into a thm model to illustrate the development of discrete ice lenses for seasonally frozen soils based on this framework a two independent stress state variable approach bishop and blight 1963 was recent incorporated in a thm model for saturated frozen soils e g zhou and li 2012 lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 for the case of partially saturated freezing soils predicting characteristics of frost heave as well as the formation and segregation of ice lenses remains poorly documented sheng et al 2014 and yin et al 2018 attempted to fill this gap by conducting thm analyses involving the separation of ice lenses but the simulated results were not verified or constrained by laboratory and field observations in addition sheng et al 2014 and yin et al 2018 did not consider the process of cryogenic suction induced by the phase change which occurs at the water ice interfaces it has been well recognized however that the cryosuction is an important process especially for frost susceptible soils e g williams and smith 1989 dash et al 2006 this study aims at presenting a fully coupled thm model for variably saturated freezing soils which considers the processes of heat transfer water moisture movement vapour distribution thermally induced cryosuction stress strain behaviour and the formation of discrete ice lenses the model was verified by comparison simulation results with laboratory experimental measurements obtained from literature the results were discussed in terms of temperature heat flux frost depth water content water flux void ratio vapour content frost heave stress strain and displacement then through a parametric assessment the relative influences of thermal hydraulic and mechanical parameters on the dynamic soil freezing problem were examined these parametric analyses will help to improve the design of field monitoring programs in cold regions and provide useful insights for the construction of artificial ground freezing scenarios and potential freeze thaw phenomena associated with climate change 2 methods 2 1 conceptual formulation frost heave in freezing soils tends to be of the highest magnitude in the vicinity of discrete ice lenses rather than being associated with the expansion of water locally in situ when it turns into ice in the pore space taber 1929 observed the phenomenon of frost heave within soils that were nearly saturated with benzene which contracts upon freezing and accounted for it through the formation of macroscopic ice lenses close to the freezing front the water ice phase change will initiate the process of cryosuction which pulls free liquid water from surrounding voids and unfrozen zones to feed ice lens growth e g williams and smith 1989 an ice lens may continuously grow as a result of the cryosuction until the water ceases to move into the freezing zone frozen fringe or the ice crystals become over stressed e g o neill and miller 1985 nixon 1991 as the freezing front progressively penetrates from ground surface discrete ice lenses may begin to form which effectively squeeze nearby soil particles in the direction of least resistance fig 1 a schematically shows the presence of macroscopic ice lenses in the vadose zone subjected to ground freezing producing typical profiles of the temperature moisture and displacements from a pore scale viewpoint fig 1 b illustrates a schematic representation of a freezing soil with the pore ice absorbed water films gas vapour and soil grains surrounding an individual ice lens during soil freezing under partially saturated conditions the liquid in the unfrozen water films around and between the soil grains moves toward the ice lens displacing the soil grains in the opposite direction rempel et al 2004 in the frozen fringe these soil grain water films may act as conduits through which pore water can move towards the ice lens simultaneously available water vapour diffuses from the warmer more humid side of the freezing profile towards the colder and less humid side and finally condensing there and adding to the ice mass e g sheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the transient freezing processes in partially saturated soils depend on the evolving and transient relationships among the soil water movement heat transfer water ice phase change and deformation in order to better understand the complex coupling and interaction between these different parameters and processes from a quantitative point of view it is helpful to develop and utilize a mathematical model 2 2 mathematical model to formulate the governing equations for water movement heat transport and deformation in unsaturated freezing soil several basic assumptions are made as follows i soil particles water and ice are homogeneous isotropic and incompressible the ice growth expansion is isotropic water ice phase change is based on equilibrium thermodynamics ii the moisture migrates only in liquid form and obeys darcy s law without considering the movement of ice crystals iii the freezing point of water is assumed constant without considering its depression under high pressure and salt exclusion iv pore air pressure in the soil remains atmospheric fig 2 shows a four phase composition diagram for the unsaturated freezing soil taking into consideration the relative volume within the averaging theory if the volume of soil skeleton within a representative elemental volume is assumed to be one then the volume of pore space is the void ratio e then the volumetric content of water θ w ice θ i vapour θ v and soil grains θ s m3 m 3 can be expressed as 1 θ w e s s i 1 e θ i e s i 1 e θ v e 1 s 1 e θ s 1 1 e where s refers to the degree of saturation with respect to the total volume of the liquid water and ice in pore space following the approach taken by thomas 2009 zhou and li 2012 and zhang et al 2018 the void ratio is used to develop constitutive equations rather than porosity si refers to the proportion of the ice in pore space and is a function of temperature which can be described as tice et al 1976 2 s i 0 t t f 1 1 t t f α t t f where tf is the freezing point and α is an empirical parameter depending on the pore size of soil fixed as 5 in this study based on the advice of thomas et al 2009 and ming and li 2014 in laboratory and or field experiments the mass water content fraction of dry weight rather than volumetric water content is often determined such mass water content can be represented as 3 w θ w ρ w d v ρ i θ i d v θ s ρ s d v e s s i ρ w e s i ρ i ρ s where ρ w ρ i and ρ s are densities of liquid water ice and soil grains respectively kg m 3 dv refers to representative element volume of the soil 2 2 1 water migration based on the law of conservation of mass the expression of water moisture migration

pore fixed at 8 in this study as suggested by thomas et al 2009 and ming and li 2014 as a freezing front penetrates through the soil column the accumulated ice occupied pore space results in frost heave upward in the frozen zone and consolidation downward in the unfrozen zone e g lai et al 2014 to account for the influence of this consolidation the hydraulic conductivity in the unfrozen zone can be amended by a factor related to the void ratio specified as e e 0 2 in this study as suggested by arora 2009 then a general form of the saturated hydraulic conductivity in eq 9 can be written as 10 k k 0 e e 0 2 k 0 e e 0 2 1 t t 0 β 0 t t f t t f e e s e p t t f e e s e p where e 0 is the initial void ratio and esep is the critical void ratio separating the discrete ice lens if one is present the esep term was assigned as 1 2 based on the suggested criterion provided in zhou and li 2012 and zhang et al 2018 the relationship between the relative hydraulic conductivity kr

volumetric force the soil is in quasi static equilibrium which in terms of the total stress tensor σ gives the following equation 17 σ γ 0 where γ is the unit weight which can be written as see the four phase composition in fig 2 18 γ g 1 e ρ s e s s i ρ w e s i ρ i e 1 s ρ v based on the uniaxial compression test and according to elastic stress strain relationship the compression coefficient of saturated soil is defined as 19 d e d σ 1 e 0 e s where σ is effective stress and es is the compression modulus of saturated soil for unsaturated soil the influence of the degree of saturation on soil strength should be accounted for here a coefficient χ s 0 4 s 0 6 is used to correct the compression modulus to account for the degree of saturation as follows with aitchison 1960 therefore eq 19 can be rewritten as 20 d σ χ e s d e 1 e 0 χ e s d ε where ε is the strain for a one dimension problem the relationship between the strain and displacement u in terms of the void ratio is stated as 21 ε d u d z e e 0 1 e 0 according to the terzaghi s effective stress principle the total stress is the sum of the equivalent pore pressure ppor and effective stress σ as follows bishop and blight 1963 22 σ σ p p o r σ χ p w 1 χ p a where pw is the pore water pressure and pa is atmospheric pressure substituting eqs 20 and 22 into eq 17 gives 23 χ e s 1 e 0 e p p o r γ 2 2 4 supplementary equations assuming the pore air pressure remains atmospheric integrating eq 23 within the soil domain one dimensional condition in the gravitational direction and then substituting it into eq 22 we obtain 24 p

for the freezing of unsaturated soils it is reasonable to assume that the pore space in the frozen zone is entirely occupied by the ice and residual unfrozen liquid water e g sheshukov and nieber 2011 as the vapour was expelled into the pore space in the partially frozen or unfrozen regions it means the frozen zone is saturated and the vapour only exists in the unfrozen zone because the degree of saturation s exists in the governing eqs 5 14 and 17 one additional equation relating to the s is required to solve them to represent how the degree of saturation s changes in the unfrozen zone as the freezing front penetrated here we used a relationship between the degree of saturation and the void ratio proposed by gallipoli et al 2003 modifying the van genuchten equation it can be expressed as follows 27 s t s 1 s 1 m e e t t t f 0 t t f where m is an empirical parameter the same as in eq 11 and fixed at 0 5 in this study 2 3 numerical implementation the governing eqs 5 14 17 21 and 27 are developed to simulate the coupled thm analysis of the frozen soils they are highly non linear because the primary variables and their respective parameters in these equations vary with time and space accompanied by appropriate initial and boundary conditions this coupled system is solved numerically using the finite element fe method for spatial discretization and the finite difference method for temporal discretization the governing equations can be expressed in the following general form 28 d a τ t γ f where τ e t σ u s are the primary dependent variables da is damping or mass coefficient γ is the conservative flux vector and f is the source term the generalized solution to eq 28 can be given as 29 d a τ t τ ω γ τ ω f τ ω n γ τ ω where ω is the computational domain ω is the boundary of the domain and n is the outward norm vector of the boundary by applying the backward difference for temporal discretization 30 τ t τ i τ i 1 δ t substituting equation eq 30 into eq 29 leads to the following equation 31 d a τ i τ i 1 δ t τ ω γ τ ω f τ ω n γ τ ω where τ is virtual displacement and the superscript i denotes the time step the initial condition can be expressed as 32 τ z 0 τ 0 where τ0 is a known quantity of variable when time is 0 the first type dirichlet of boundary condition is given by 33 τ s τ s where τ s is a known function of space and time the second type neumann of boundary condition is given by 34 n γ g κ τ ς t where g is the boundary source and κ τ ς t is a matrix of the elastic constraint the above numerical procedure is implemented by the fe code comsol multiphysics v5 3 with the time dependent solver the solution is sought by making use of a newton raphson algorithm that starts with the initial conditions as an initial guess the resulting system of linearized equations within each newton raphson iteration is solved using the parallel sparse direct solver mumps in the fully coupled monolithic approach resulting in the derived system jacobian containing all off diagonal terms that appear from coupling of the governing equations 3 experimental validation the validity of the proposed model and its performance is checked against an instructive laboratory experiment ming and li 2014 performed a top down freezing test in an open system during which an unsaturated soil the qinghai tibet silty clay was packed into a cylinder of 10 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height the soil sample had an initial nearly uniform void ratio of 0 6 degree of saturation 0 72 and volumetric water content of 0 27 cm3 cm 3 before the test the soil sample was put into a thermotank with a temperature of 1 c for 24 h to allow the thermal equilibrium then the temperature on the top surface was abruptly decreased to 3 c while the bottom surface was maintained at 1 c its sidewall was thermally insulated and hydraulically impermeable and a load of 100 kpa was applied on the top surface at the bottom water was supplied through a tube connected to an external reservoir the freezing test continued for 100 h during which the temperature profile at different depths and the amount of displacement on the top surface i e frost heave were monitored after testing the water content profile was determined by dividing the soil sample into slices for the numerical model setup the dirichlet boundary conditions with specific temperatures were considered in the heat transfer computation because the water was supplied freely no pressure water supply and the void ratio at the bottom was assumed to constant a value of void ratio 0 6 was defined for bottom boundary while for the top boundary a value of void ratio 0 6 1 09 0 654 was assigned account for the essentially instantaneous freezing at the top boundary which caused the volume expansion by 9 the initial conditions of water content void ratio and degree of saturation and temperature were the same as the experimental condition because the displacement was allowed only along the axial direction which was the same for the water and heat transport the process of coupled water heat and stress could be reduced to one dimension for the simulations the numerical domain was discretized with 200 uniform quadric lagrange elements and the time step of 5 min is adopted with a relative convergence tolerance of 10 5 the physical and mechanical parameters for the soil and the other model parameters are listed in table 1 because the temporal profiles of water content were not recorded during this test only the total water content at the end of the experiment is available thus the final profile of total water content is used to verify the proposed model comparisons of the measured and simulated profiles of temperature total water content and frost heave are shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the predicted temperature agrees quite well with the measured ones fig 3a and fig 3b both the measured and simulated results show that the distribution of temperature is approaching to linear trend in both the frozen and unfrozen zones while at the early stage there is a larger temperature gradient in the frozen zone this is caused by the larger thermal conductivity and smaller heat capacity in the frozen zone as compared to the unfrozen zone and vice versa in the late stage fig 3b shows the profiles of temperature at three points against time the point of 9 5 cm is close to the cold top and the point of 3 5 cm is near the warm bottom it can be seen from fig 3b that at the point closer to the cold side less time is required for the temperature to reach a steady value the temperature curves at the 6 cm and 7 cm points clearly show that as the temperature approaches 0 c the rate of temperature drop is relatively gradual and slower than what is observed when the temperatures are higher and lower than 0 c this reduction in the rate of change of temperature with time at this point is due to the large release of latent heat which occurs during the water ice phase change as shown in fig 3c the freezing front 0 c isotherm penetrates quickly at the beginning and then tends to slow down toward a stable depth of about 2 2 cm the thickness of the frozen zone increases with the time and the simulated curve of the frost heave matches well with measured data fig 3d shows that the distribution of mass water content which is a good agreement with the measured results the maximum water content occurs near the freezing front wherein the accumulated water might be caused by the elevated negative pore water pressure near the freezing front see fig s1 which draws free water from unfrozen zone resulting in a high degree of liquid water saturation see fig s2 there are a couple of discrete zones with high variability in water content which is due to the formation of discontinuous ice lenses as shown in fig 3e and fig 3f after the ice lens starts to grow the elevated pore pressure falls to the overburden stress see fig s1 it can be seen from fig 3f that the ice lens located at the lowest point in the domain near the unfrozen boundary is much thicker than the other ones that have formed in the profile this is consistent with the measurements by ming and li 2014 and agrees well with the findings by thomas et al 2009 and lai et al 2014 this observation can be explained by the fact that in the later stage of the freezing process the rate of the freezing front propagation gradually decreases to a slow steady value which leaves sufficient time for water to migrate upward from the unfrozen lower boundary through cryosuction to reach the deepest ice lens and feed its growth the dynamic changes of heat and water fluxes vapour content strain stress and displacement during the freezing test are illustrated in fig 4 which are usually unmeasurable in practice fig 4a shows that in the frozen zone heat transfer is mainly based on conduction while heat convection is dominant in the unfrozen zone because of the noticeable pore water flow the total heat flux reaches a peak at the freezing front where it coincides with the peaks of water flux in fig 4b it should be noted that positive velocities in fig 4b refer to water flow from the warm to cold side fig 4b shows that in the region of the frozen fringe the cryogenic suction at the interface of water ice phase change results in substantial water flow due to temperature gradients thin dashed line in fig 4b simultaneously the cryosuction process results in an opposing development of water pressure gradient see fig s1 which results in an opposing direction of water flow below and above the base of the frozen fringe thick dashed line in fig 4b by accumulating the water fluxes contributed by the pressure gradient driven force and temperature gradient driven force there is a total net water flux which reaches its peak at the freezing front and diminishes toward the cold side such maximum net water flux decreases gradually to a steady value when the freezing front ceased its propagation fig 4c show that the vapour content decreases rapidly in the early stages of the freezing process and stabilizes after 48 hours when the freezing front reaches a steady state fig 3a and fig 3c as observed by philip and de vries 1957 and zhang et al 2016 the calculated vapour fluxes represent a very small water flux within the combined thm model see supplementary materials fig s3 indicating that the vapour fluxes in this freezing test could be neglected in comparison to the substantial water and heat fluxes moreover the model describing the vapour flow is over parameterized and there are few laboratory and field observations to verify the vapour fluxes in freezing soils philip and de vries 1957 zhang et al 2016 the strain distributions in fig 4d indicate that there is a remarkable consolidation in the unfrozen zone which may be caused by the development of the large effective stress near the freezing front as shown in fig 4e this large increase in effective stress ahead of the freezing front dissipates towards the cold and warm domain boundaries which can be explained by a combined effect of the expansion of ice lenses and of the generation of negative pore water pressures through the cryosuction process the coinciding reduction in the void ratio fig 3e and fig 3f and porosity see fig s6 also reflects the degree of packing achieved in the unfrozen zone in response to the given stress histories these findings indicate that there is a substantial consolidation ahead of the freezing front fig 4f displays a deformed contour of displacements during the complete freezing process illustrating that in the later stage the frost heave lifts the top cold surface at a near constant rate although the freezing front gradually approaches a steady state 4 parametric analysis to quantify how relevant factors affect the behaviours of soil freezing this section covers a parametric study based on the proposed and validated model base problem case c0 the parameters analyzed are i boundary temperature ii thermal conductivity iii initial water content iv saturated hydraulic conductivity v overburden load on the top surface vi compression modulus table 2 presents a summary of the cases studied in this parametric analysis the remaining conditions and characteristics are the same as the base problem in the following section presents the most relevant aspects of the analysis 4 1 effects of boundary temperature and thermal conductivity 4 1 1 one sided freezing the one sided freezing is a typical scenario for ground freezing of soils initiated at the atmospheric ground surface interface without the presence of underlying permafrost when the upper boundary temperature is reduced from the base case of 3 oc to 5 oc case c2 the freezing front advances downwards more rapidly fig 5 a as a consequence of the higher thermal gradient near the upper boundary as the rate of freezing front propagation decreases due to the decreasing thermal gradient and increasing of latent heat there is sufficient time for ice formation for the colder case and ultimately deeper frost depth penetration and larger frost heave fig 5b when the thermal conductivity is increased within the base case scenario case c4 the freezing front propagation rate is initially higher but the final profiles of temperature pore water pressure and vapour content are very similar to the base case fig 5 these results suggest that the thermal gradient is a dominant factor controlling the location and propagation rate of the freezing front and the development of negative pore pressures within the freeing profile fig 5a that were observed in the model validation work section 3 4 1 2 two sided freezing for a thawed soil layer overlaying permafrost freezing upward a two sided freezing process would develop when combined with freezing from the ground surface freezing downward as discussed above for this scenario all conditions are the same as in the base case except that the temperature of the lower boundary is reduced to 1 oc table 2 case c5 fig 6 a depicts profiles of temperature and pore pressure profiles for the two sided freezing case c5 after 12 h in the middle zone the temperature is just below zero degrees owing to the released latent heat during water ice phase change and the high negative pore pressure in this region is due to cryogenic suction this is the well known zero curtain effect e g thomas et al 2009 the water flux profile in fig 6b indicates that pore water is flowing upwards upper and downwards lower within the two frozen fringes at the same time a high effective stress zone develops in the middle of the domain fig 6c which results in differential consolidation with significant deformation being observed near the bottom of the domain and less close to the top surface as shown in fig 6d as the freezing continues the thermal and mechanical conditions change as displayed in fig 6e there are two 0 oc frostlines converging from both sides toward the middle and disappeared in about 10 h only a small amount of frost heave is observed because there is no external water supply available during freezing and substantial consolidation occurs in the middle zone early in the unfrozen period collectively during the two sided freezing ice formation and segregation advances from both ends toward the middle zone while water is drawn from the middle towards both ends in a closed system consequently resulting in a consolidated ice poor zone these findings are generally consistent with those reported by thomas et al 2009 4 2 effects of initial water saturation and hydraulic conductivity fig 7 shows the influence of variable degrees of initial saturation and hydraulic conductivity on the profiles of temperature pore pressure frost heave and soil water flux rate as the degree of water saturation increases case c7 the freezing front tends to advance more slowly fig 7a because of the released latent heat the additional available pore water results in more displacement as freezing occurs as would be expected fig 7b in comparison to the unsaturated case c6 the negative pore pressure profile in the saturated case is lower in magnitude as freezing progresses fig 7a whereas the water flux rate along the lower boundary tends to increase with the degree of water saturation fig 7c this may be related to the fact that the hydraulic conductivity of the saturated soil is higher than the unsaturated soil this effect can also be observed in fig 7 that under the same degree of saturation 0 72 cases c8 and c9 the greater hydraulic conductivity results in higher negative pore pressures larger deformation and increased water inflow flux along the lower boundary these results reflect that both the initial water content and hydraulic conductivity have considerable influence on the behaviors of freezing soil these observations are consistent with the practical findings that the magnitude of frost heave for freezing soils usually depends on soil type which can exhibit and range of hydraulic conductivity values 4 3 effects of overburden load and compression modulus as illustrated in fig 8 a higher compression modulus case c12 vs case c13 leads to larger negative pore pressures and higher amounts of deformation the results shown in fig 8 also show that the changes in compression modulus and overburden load cases c10 c11 c12and c13 exert insignificant effects on thermal profiles e g temperature gradient frost depth according to fig 8b the changes in overburden pressure hardly affect the frost heave which is inconsistent with previous findings of the freezing test of the saturated soil such inconsistency may be attributed to the unsaturated condition that is the fixed initial degree of saturation 0 72 in the current parametric analysis of mechanical properties by keeping other parameters the same as base case c0 and only changing the initial degree of saturation and overburden pressure it is observed in fig s7 that under a lower overburden pressure condition the amount of frost heave increases with the degree of water saturation the above observations indicate that the compression modulus can play a controlling role in mechanical behaviour of freezing soil 5 concluding remarks in this work we developed a coupled thm model for variably saturated soil during the ground freezing process taking into account water movement due to cryosuction at the water ice interface concomitant with the development of ice lenses the model framework was based on a fully coupled approach where the void ratio temperature stress displacement and degree of saturation are interweaved to each other the proposed coupling mechanism was then implemented numerically to reproduce the results of a laboratory one sided freezing test and the model capabilities were evaluated through a comparison with the experimental observations utilizing the data from the one dimensional freezing experiment a series of parametric analyses was carried out to quantify their influence during the dynamic freezing process the following conclusions are made 1 by combining the relationship between the effective stress void ratio degree of saturation and the equilibrium thermodynamics at the water ice interfaces the proposed thm coupling model can not only accurately reproduce profiles of temperature water content and frost heave in unsaturated soil under a unidirectional freezing condition but also predict the dynamic changes of many unmeasurable variables in practice 2 the total heat flux was mainly contributed by heat conduction in the frozen zone while heat convection was dominant in the unfrozen zone reaching a maximum value near the freezing front where it coincided with the highest total water flux the thermally induced cryosuction is the main driving force for water migrating towards the freezing front in addition ahead of the freezing front significant increases in effective stress due to the elevated negative pore pressures and expansion of the ice lenses resulted in substantial consolidation and a reduction in strain and porosity in the unfrozen zone 3 as the freezing front penetrates with time the temperature moisture vapour and stress strain fields interact with each other the distribution of vapour was mainly controlled by the temperature gradient and location of the freezing front both the initial degree of saturation and hydraulic conductivity affected the distribution of pore pressure and displacements higher compression moduli and lower overburden load led to greater frost heave but exerted little influence on the temperature field 4 in comparison to the one sided freezing regime the two sided freezing for soils underlain by permafrost made the middle ice poor zone highly compacted with ice lenses accumulating near both cold boundaries the thickest ice lens tended to develop close to the freezing front the overall intent here was to construct an intuitive model constrained by the literature and reasonable assumptions to represent the formation of separate ice lenses and the associated soil deformation during the transient freezing of partially saturated soils incorporating the process of cryosuction the influence of freezing point depression hysteretic freeze thaw processes and non equilibrium thermodynamics as described by koniorczyk et al 2015 and gawin et al 2019 2020 may play an important role under specific conditions and will be explored in subsequent research and model extension within the scope of potential limitations as noted above the proposed model is capable of gaining valuable insights into coupled moisture migration heat transfer and elastic deformation that affect ice lens formation frost heave and consolidation this quantification framework may provide a useful tool for the assessment soil behavior under natural climatically driven freezing conditions or as

271,we combine modeling and measurements to investigate the dynamics of convective carbon dioxide co 2 dissolution in a pressure volume temperature cell extending a recent study by wen et al j fluid mech vol 854 2018 pp 56 87 at low pressure under ideal gas conditions to high pressure and real gas conditions pressure dependent compressibility and solubility are included to model the evolution of co 2 concentration in the gas phase and at the interface respectively simple ordinary differential equation models are developed to capture the mean behavior of the convecting system at large rayleigh number and are then verified by using both numerical simulations and laboratory experiments the prefactor for the linear scaling of convective co 2 dissolution is evaluated for the first time by using pressure decay experiments in bead packs at reservoir conditions the results show that our models could quantitatively predict the process of the convective co 2 dissolution in pressure decay experiments moreover the results also reveal that for increasing gas pressure in closed systems the negative feedback of the pressure drop resulting from the dissolution of co 2 in the liquid is weakened due to the decrease of the solubility constant at real gas conditions our analysis provides a new direction for determination and validation of the convective dissolution flux of co 2 in porous media systems keywords convective dissolution geological co 2 storage porous media convection solubility trapping 1 introduction solubility trapping is one of major trapping mechanisms in geological carbon dioxide co 2 storage which is one promising means of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere metz et al 2005 orr 2009 after co 2 is injected into the deep geological storage sites e g the reservoirs or saline aquifers it forms a less dense co 2 rich vapor phase accumulating at the top of the denser brine and below the low permeability cap rock in this two layer configuration co 2 dissolves into the brine and forms a diffusive boundary layer beneath the co 2 brine interface since the resulting solution is denser than the underlying resident brine convection may set in under the influence of the gravity when the diffusive boundary layer is thick enough ennis king et al 2005 riaz et al 2006 hassanzadeh et al 2006 xu et al 2006 slim et al 2013 this process can greatly increase the dissolution flux reduce the possible leakage and contribute to secure long term storage neufeld et al 2010 sathaye et al 2014 to explore the dissolution process of co 2 into the brine water many experiments have been performed in analog fluid systems neufeld et al 2010 backhaus et al 2011 tsai et al 2013 macminn and juanes 2013 wang et al 2016 suekane et al 2017 liang et al 2018 salibindla et al 2018 liyanage et al 2019 michel meyer et al 2020 where the miscible analogue fluids e g methanol ethylene glycol water and propylene glycol water are used to replace co 2 and brine in these systems the convective transport can be visualized in hele shaw cells or using x ray ct scanning nevertheless there exist many fundamental differences between the analog fluid systems and the co 2 brine system the analog fluids and water are fully miscible the density of the mixtures exhibits non monotonic characteristics as a function of the solute mass fraction and the interface moves upward during the mixing neufeld et al 2010 hidalgo et al 2015 jafari raad et al 2016 liang et al 2018 however co 2 is partially soluble in water the density of the mixture increases monotonically with concentration and co 2 brine interface is nearly fixed in a closed system duan and sun 2003 efika et al 2016 shi et al 2018 wen et al 2018a moreover the analog fluid systems allow the experiments at normal laboratory conditions while the experiments with the co 2 brine system at reservoir conditions involve a high pressure and high temperature setup bickle et al 2007 shi et al 2018 the major experimental approach used to measure the co 2 dissolution in brine at reservoir conditions is the pressure decay method tse and sandall 1979 renner et al 1988 riazi 1996 wang et al 1996 zhang et al 2000 sheikha et al 2005 farajzadeh et al 2009 moghaddam et al 2012 azin et al 2013 mojtaba et al 2014 raad et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 shi et al 2018 mahmoodpour et al 2019 2020 this approach is originally designed to characterize the diffusive mass transfer of co 2 in brine in this method the pressure in the gas phase above the liquid phase due to the dissolution of co 2 is monitored and recorded in a pressure volume temperature pvt cell fig 1 the evolution of the amount of co 2 present in the gas phase is then calculated from the pressure temperature and the volume of the gas phase via an equation of state the experimental data are then commonly interpreted via a diffusion model i e the fick s law and the co 2 diffusivity in the liquid phase is evaluated by fitting the experimental data nevertheless when the density driven convection is introduced in the dissolution process molecular diffusion is not the only mechanism that controls the co 2 mass transfer in a few studies researchers interpret the experimental data based on the diffusion model and then use a so called effective diffusivity to describe the combined effect of diffusion and convection yang and gu 2006 farajzadeh et al 2009 wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 in strong convecting systems however the reported values of the effective diffusivity are typically two orders of magnitude larger than the expected co 2 diffusivity in bulk water or brine in a purely diffusive system shi et al 2018 moreover unlike the analog fluid experiments which are convenient to evaluate the mean dissolution flux in the constant flux regime at certain large rayleigh number in pressure decay experiments the driving force for convection always decreases with time due to the pressure drop leading to decreasing rayleigh number and dissolution flux hence there exists a clear need today for developing appropriate models and theories to analyze the mixing processes of convective co 2 dissolution in pressure decay experiments at reservoir conditions although extensive numerical simulations have been performed by several research groups to explore the dynamics of convective co 2 dissolution in water ennis king et al 2005 hassanzadeh et al 2006 riaz et al 2006 xu et al 2006 pau et al 2010 hewitt et al 2013 szulczewski et al 2013 slim 2014 de paoli et al 2016 2017 in their models a constant co 2 concentration is usually assumed at the top boundary i e the co 2 water interface however in both the pressure decay experiments and some natural co 2 reservoirs sathaye et al 2014 2016a 2016b akhbari and hesse 2017 the systems are closed so that the co 2 dissolution reduces the pressure in the vapor phase subsequently leading to a decline of the co 2 concentration at the interface and thereby reducing the density difference driving convective dissolution in the liquid phase wen et al 2018a investigate this negative feedback of the pressure drop on convective dissolution in closed systems at low pressures below 1 mpa and present mathematical models for the dissolution process when the co 2 vapor can be treated as an ideal gas nevertheless most natural gas reservoirs and pressure decay experiments exist operate under high pressure conditions where the co 2 vapor is no longer ideal in this investigation we extend the modeling of convective co 2 dissolution in closed porous media systems to high pressure and real gas conditions pressure dependent compressibility factor and solubility are added in the ideal gas law and the henry s law respectively to model the evolution of co 2 concentration in the gas phase and at the gas liquid interface scaling analysis reveals that the dynamics of the system are controlled by five dimensionless parameters in a wide domain both direct numerical simulations dns and pressure decay experiments are utilized to characterize the convective transport of co 2 dissolution in closed porous media systems moreover simple ordinary differential equation ode models are developed to capture the mean behavior of the convecting system at large rayleigh number and are then verified by simulations and experiments the mathematical models presented here have practical significance for exploring the dynamics of convective co 2 dissolution in both pressure decay experiments and confined reservoirs importantly our analysis allows the recovery of the constant flux regime due to a rescaling so that the pressure decay experiments can be used to determine and validate the convective co 2 dissolution flux as a function of rayleigh number in porous media systems the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in the next section we formulate the mathematical model of convection in closed porous media systems at high pressure and real gas conditions non dimensionalize the governing equations describe the numerical methods used for the simulations and construct the ode models to predict the evolution of the gas pressure and dissolution flux in time in section 3 we discuss the set up of the pressure decay experiments in bead packs the numerical and experimental results are shown and discussed in section 4 our conclusions are given in section 5 2 mathematical modeling numerical simulations by pau et al 2010 and fu et al 2013 indicate that solutal convection in two dimensional 2d porous media systems exhibits similar flow regimes as in the three dimensional 3d systems although in the quasi steady regime the co 2 dissolution flux of the latter is approximately 18 25 higher than that of the former in this section we focus on the modeling of convective co 2 dissolution in a 2d rectangular domain 2 1 dimensional equations consider a 2d isotropic and homogeneous porous medium containing gas overlying water fig 1a we neglect the capillary forces so that the phases are segregated by buoyancy and separated by a sharp interface at z 0 0 golding et al 2011 martinez and hesse 2016 in the gas phase i e 0 z h g the co 2 vapour is assumed to be a real gas 1 p g v g n g z r t where p g is the gas pressure v g is the gas volume n g is the amount of gas in moles z is the gas

equilibrium between the gas and the dissolved aqueous co 2 is given by henry s law 2 c s k h p g where c s is the dissolved gas concentration or the co 2 concentration at the interface and k h is the henry s law solubility constant in previous study at low pressure wen et al 2018a the gas is assumed to be ideal so z 1 and k h is constant at isothermal conditions for high pressure real gas conditions however both z and k h are pressure dependent i e z z p g and k h k h p g hence eq 2 yields c s k h p g p g moreover in the modeling of convection the volume change of water due to the co 2 dissolution is negligible under certain pressure condition approximately 3 5 for fixed p g 12 mpa so the interface is assumed to be always localized at z 0 in closed systems wen et al 2018a nevertheless the solubility k h used here is from previously published batch phase equilibrium data which have already considered the volume change of water in the liquid phase i e h w z 0 the flow is

difference between the fresh water and the saturated water and the concentration of co 2 in saturated water at the initial gas pressure p g 0 in this work δ ρ 0 is modeled using a quadratic function of p g described in wen et al 2018a the transport of the concentration field in the liquid phase is governed by the following advection diffusion equation 6 c w t u w c w d 2 c w where d is the

in this investigation we model z and c s with correlations developed from previously published batch phase equilibrium nist data namely for fixed temperature t 11 z z 1 p g 2 z 2 p g 1 and c s k h p g

linearly with p g so the gas reduces to the ideal state at high pressure however the gas deviates from the ideal gas behavior and c s levels off from eqs 1 and 9 11 we can write the evolution of the

parameters r a 0 π 0 z 1 z 2 and k at p g 1 mpa z 1 z 2 and k are all approximately zero so that the dimensionless system reduces to the low pressure case presented by wen et al 2018a 2 3 numerical method we perform direct numerical simulations for the dimensionless partial differential equation pde model 14 25 by adapting the solver developed in previous investigations wen and chini 2018 shi et

differentiation scheme for the remaining steps peyret 2002 p g and c s are updated at each time step by solving eqs 20 and 22 using a two step adams bashforth algorithm 2 4 ode models at high rayleigh numbers solutal convection in porous media exhibits different flow regimes characterized by the behavior of the dissolution an early diffusion dominated regime a flux growth plume merging regime a quasi steady convective regime and a shut down regime riaz et al 2006 hewitt et al 2013 tilton and riaz 2014 slim 2014 wen et al 2018a at early time the transport is dominated by diffusion and the flux decays as π t 1 2 as the diffusive boundary layer near the interface becomes sufficiently thick convective instability sets in small finger plumes are generated leading to an increase of the flux after a series of plume merging events the resulting primary plumes propagate at a constant speed when the gas pressure remains constant π 0 0 resulting in a constant flux i e the quasi steady convective regime after the primary plumes reach the bottom of the water layer the co 2 rich fluid starts to move upwards with the returning flow once this dense fluid reaches the top boundary i e the interface there is no fresh water in the liquid phase so that the density difference i e the driving force for convection decreases the flux declines and eventually the convection shuts down in wen et al 2018a simple ode models are developed to predict the co 2 dissolution in closed porous media systems at low pressure ideal gas conditions for both quasi steady convective and shut down regimes these models are based on certain properties of the convective flow at large r a 0 and are extended to the high pressure real gas conditions in this manuscript in the quasi steady convective regime the analysis and simulation results in wen et al 2018a show that the dissolution flux is proportional to the square of the interface concentration more specifically 26 f α r a 0 c s 2 where the prefactor α 0 017 from previous investigations hesse 2008 pau et al 2010 hewitt et al 2013 slim 2014 wen et al 2018a with constant co 2 concentration at the top boundary i e c s 1 equation 26 will be verified later via laboratory experiments at high pressure conditions actually the pressure conditions of the vapor phase only affect the equation of state 1 and the solute solubility at the interface 2 while the behavior described by eq 26 is an inherent characteristic for the high rayleigh number convective flow in the liquid phase and therefore can be directly utilized for the modeling at high pressure conditions combining eqs 20 25 with eq 26 yields an ode model for p g in the quasi steady convective regime 27 d p g d t α r a 0 π 0 z 1 p g 2 z 2 p g 1 2 1 z 1 p g 2 k p g 2 p g k 1 2 and p

reference cell and a sample cell fig 3 with further details having been described previously shi et al 2018 a known mass of water was first loaded into the sample cell its volume then calculated from its known density subsequently a known mass of soda lime glass beads with a particle size of 1 6 mm was added to the sample cell wet packing until the height of the beads equalled the water level the height of the water saturated porous material was then recorded and the bulk volume of the porous material was calculated from the cell geometry the porosity of the unconsolidated porous medium ϕ was then calculated from the volume of the water v w and the bulk volume of the porous material and is reported in table 1 the gas volume for each experiment was then calculated from the known volume of the sample cell and the total volume of the porous material the permeability of the porous medium k is estimated using the kozeny carman correlation wyllie and gregory 1955 34 k d 2 ϕ 3 180 1 ϕ 2 where d is the bead diameter all the experiments were performed at a constant temperature of 323 15 k to initiate each experiment the reference cell was pressurized with co 2 to a certain pressure and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium the valve in between the reference cell and the sample cell was then opened to allow the co 2 in the reference cell to enter the sample cell the valve was then closed when the pressure in the sample cell reached the initial pressure shown in table 1 in a few seconds so that the reference cell was isolated from the sample cell for the duration of the experiment from that point on the pressure of co 2 in the gas space in the sample cell started to decrease due to its dissolution into the water saturated porous medium for the remainder of the experiment the gas pressure p g and the temperature t in the sample cell were then monitored and recorded continuously we report here data from four experiments each employing a different height of porous medium the information of each experiment is listed in table 1 the first experiment exp 1 was conducted previously by shi et al 2018 while the remaining three experiments exp 2 to exp 4 were conducted specifically for this study a different cell was used for exp 1 with a slightly larger cell cross sectional area in exp 2 exp 4 teflon spacers were used to reduce the volume of the sample cell in order to arrive at a different water gas volume ratio v w v g for each experiment 4 results and discussion here we use experiments to first quantitatively verify the high r a 0 property of the dissolution flux during convection as proposed in eq 26 figure 4 shows the evolution of the flux f compensated by r a 0 and c s 2 r a 0 as a function of the advection time t a r a 0 t as observed from the experiments in the experiments the moles of co 2 in the vapor phase are determined based on the pressure and temperature data 40000 points for exp 1 and 120000 points for each of exp 2 exp 4 via eqs 1 and 11 the dimensional flux f is then evaluated from the time derivative of the amount of co 2 in the vapor phase via eq 9 to arrive at the dimensionless flux f h w f d c s 0 in fig 4 the scatter in the flux is due to a simple finite difference approximation of the derivative in closed systems the dissolution of co 2 into the underlying water reduces the gas pressure the pressure drop in the gas phase decreases the saturated concentration of co 2 in the water and introduces a negative feedback that reduces the convective dissolution flux as shown in fig 4 a for increasing dissolution capacity π 0 the decline of the dissolution flux is more evident especially at the late time after appropriate rescaling however f c s 2 r a 0 becomes nearly constant in the quasi steady convective regime 1 t a 20 consistent with the theoretical analysis which finds that f c s 2 α r a 0 our four experiments reveal that the prefactor α varies from 0 012 to 0 023 in close agreement with the 2d 3d dns predictions α 0 017 and 0 02 for a constant co 2 concentration at the top boundary see fig 4b to the best of our knowledge this is the first experimental study to evaluate the prefactor of f α r a 0 for high raleigh number convective co 2 dissolution at reservoir conditions in previous experiments the convective dissolution flux of co 2 in porous media systems was usually measured using analog fluids in hele shaw cells or granular porous media neufeld et al 2010 backhaus et al 2011 liang et al 2018 the analog fluid system can successfully visualize and characterize the convective mixing process at atmospheric pressure conditions nevertheless the nonlinear density dependence of miscible analog fluids induces a wavy upward moving interface and produces a higher prefactor α for the dissolution flux than that in the real co 2 water system based on our analysis and validation above the pressure decay experiments can be used to determine the convective co 2 dissolution flux in porous media systems at reservoir conditions to further interpret the experiments we perform high resolution numerical simulations with both the pde and ode models based on the information listed in table 1 in order to avoid the scatter in the experimental flux as seen in fig 4 in the rest of this section we fit the following smooth function to the experimental pressure data p g and moles of co 2 in the vapor phase n g 35 f a 0 a 1 e a 2 t a 3 e a 4 t a 5 e a 6 t where a 0 a 6 are all positive numbers then the dissolution flux can be evaluated by calculating the time derivative of eq 35 as discussed above figures 5 and 6 compare the dimensionless gas pressure p g and dissolution flux f for dns of the pde model ode models in quasi steady and shut down regimes and the experimental results as shown in these figures the ode models agree well with the dns while both models are found to be in good agreement with the experiments for different values of π 0 the gas pressure in fig 5 has a similar evolution with time but declines to lower values at higher π 0 in the log log plot the inflection point on the time pressure curve corresponds to the transition from the quasi steady convective regime to the shut down regime moreover the steady state of eq 32 successfully predicts the equilibrium gas pressure in the experiments since the henry s law solubility constant k h p g for co 2 in water decreases with increasing p g at real gas conditions fig 2b the equilibrium gas pressure from the real gas model is always higher than that from the ideal gas model where k h assumes a constant value wen et al 2018a consistent with the ideal gas case wen et al 2018a four flow regimes are delineated based on the behavior of the dissolution as shown in fig 6 i diffusion dominated regime at early time right after opening the valve the dissolution is dominated by diffusion so that the flux f π t 1 2 ii flux growth plume merging regime after a certain time convection sets in due to the buoyancy driven instability and small plumes are generated beneath the co 2 water interface growing laterally and merging with neighboring plumes fig 7 a iii quasi steady convective regime after the convective pattern has coarsened the basic pattern of the primary plumes is nearly unchanged fig 7b and iv shut down regime once the saturated fluid that is carried upward by the return flow reaches the interface the driving force for convection i e δ c decreases the flux declines rapidly and eventually the convection shuts down fig 7c despite the name of the convective regime iii convection in closed systems is never actually quasi steady as the flux declines due to the negative feedback of the pressure drop moreover the dns results in fig 6 reveal that increasing π 0 delays the transition to the shut down regime to systematically investigate the dynamics of convective co 2 dissolution in closed systems at high pressure real gas conditions we perform dns in the 2d rectangular domain at r a 0 20000 and l 5 with π 0 0 5 1 2 5 and p g 0 0 507 mpa 5 atm 2 027 mpa 20 atm 3 546 mpa 35 atm 5 066 mpa 50 atm figure 7 shows the snapshots of the concentration field c and its horizontal mean profile c at flow regimes ii iv with π 0 1 and p g 0 3 546 mpa the convective pattern at high pressure real gas conditions remains similar for various flow regimes as in the ideal gas case discussed in wen et al 2018a the concentration at the co 2 water interface decreases with time due to the pressure drop in the vapor phase this reduces the driving force for convection i e the concentration difference δ c of the fluids between the interface and the underlying water and thereby induces a negative feedback on the dissolution flux moreover as shown in fig 7 c in the shut down regime the horizontal mean concentration becomes well mixed and nearly constant with depth supporting the hypothesis used in building the ode model in section 2 4 we observe similar features for other values of π 0 and p g 0 which are omitted in this manuscript figure 8 shows the real gas effects on the evolution of the gas pressure and dissolution flux at r a 0 20000 and π 0 1 for reference the ode models for the ideal gas case and the constant pressure π 0 0 case are also plotted at low pressure condition e g p g 0 0 507 mpa the gas is ideal so p g which is equal to c s and f are predicted accurately by the models from wen et al 2018a as the pressure is increased the gas deviates from the ideal state and the solubility constant k h p g declines fig 2 this reduced the pressure drop and the associated negative feedback on the dissolution flux on the other hand at π 0 0 the pressure in the vapor phase remains constant and the negative feedback disappears therefore for closed systems at real gas conditions the ideal gas models by wen et al 2018a provide lower bounds on the gas pressure and the dissolution flux while the ode models with π 0 0 provide the corresponding upper bounds 5 conclusions in this work we extend the modeling of convective co 2 dissolution in closed porous media systems to high pressure real gas conditions this is critical for the determination of convective co 2 dissolution flux at reservoir conditions from pressure decay experiments in a standard pvt cell based on previous models for low pressure ideal gas conditions we add the pressure dependent compressibility factor z p g and solubility k h p g into the ideal gas law and the henry s law respectively direct numerical simulations of the resulting pde model are performed for a 2d rectangular domain to investigate the dynamics of convective co 2 dissolution at large r a 0 simple ode models are developed to capture the mean behavior of the convecting system to validate the pde and ode models we interpret pressure decay experiments in a pvt cell at a constant temperature of 323 15 k the dns of the pde model reveal that at high pressure real gas conditions convection in closed porous media systems at large r a 0 still exhibits four flow regimes characterized by the behavior of the dissolution an early diffusion dominated regime a flux growth plume merging regime a quasi steady convective regime and a shut down regime as in the ideal gas case discussed in wen et al 2018a in the quasi steady convective regime the dissolution flux f is no longer constant due to the negative feedback of the pressure drop in the vapor phase however we use the pressure decay experiments to validate that the quantity f c s 2 remains constant i e f c s 2 α r a 0 providing a new direction for determination of the convective dissolution flux of co 2 in porous media at reservoir conditions moreover the simulations indicate that in the shut down regime the horizontal mean concentration is well mixed and nearly constant with depth based on the above properties nonlinear ode models are built to predict the evolution of gas pressure and dissolution flux in the quasi steady convective and shut down regimes at high pressure real gas conditions our simulations show that both the pde and ode models developed in this work can quantitatively capture the mean behavior of the convective co 2 dissolution measured from experiments finally our models also reveal that for increasing gas pressure p g in closed systems the negative feedback of the pressure drop is weakened due to the decrease of the solubility constant k h p g at the real gas conditions assuming constant co 2 concentration at the top boundary or constant gas pressure in closed systems previous 2d numerical simulations have shown f α r a 0 017 r a 0 for high rayleigh number convective co 2 dissolution although this linear scaling has been verified in some laboratory experiments in hele shaw cells or granular porous media liang et al 2018 de paoli et al 2020 different values of the prefactor α are obtained since the experiments are performed using analog fluids at the atmospheric pressure condition in this study our four experiments which are performed using co 2 and water at the reservoir conditions show that the prefactor α varies from 0 012 to 0 023 to the best of our knowledge this is the first experimental study to evaluate the prefactor of f α r a 0 for high rayleigh number convective co 2 dissolution at reservoir conditions the variation of the value of α in our experiments can be due to some inherent properties of the porous media e g the random packing of glass beads and the effect of mechanical dispersion liang et al 2018 wen et al 2018b gasow et al 2020 de paoli et al 2020 hewitt 2020 etc further systematic experiments are needed to show the effects of various experimental parameters e g initial pressure height of the liquid layer and bead size etc on α the method presented here is currently the only way to experimentally determine the convective dissolution flux in the actual co 2 brine system this opens the door to study a variety of important processes that cannot be studied in analog systems for example our method could be used to develop a set of experiments to study the effect of the capillary transition zone on the convective dissolution process and validate numerical simulations martinez and hesse 2016 working with co 2 and brine also makes it possible to study chemical effects on the convective dissolution rates that cannot be addressed by analog systems these include the effect of impurities such as hydrogen sulfide h 2 s in the gas the composition of the brine and potentially geochemical interactions with the

271,we combine modeling and measurements to investigate the dynamics of convective carbon dioxide co 2 dissolution in a pressure volume temperature cell extending a recent study by wen et al j fluid mech vol 854 2018 pp 56 87 at low pressure under ideal gas conditions to high pressure and real gas conditions pressure dependent compressibility and solubility are included to model the evolution of co 2 concentration in the gas phase and at the interface respectively simple ordinary differential equation models are developed to capture the mean behavior of the convecting system at large rayleigh number and are then verified by using both numerical simulations and laboratory experiments the prefactor for the linear scaling of convective co 2 dissolution is evaluated for the first time by using pressure decay experiments in bead packs at reservoir conditions the results show that our models could quantitatively predict the process of the convective co 2 dissolution in pressure decay experiments moreover the results also reveal that for increasing gas pressure in closed systems the negative feedback of the pressure drop resulting from the dissolution of co 2 in the liquid is weakened due to the decrease of the solubility constant at real gas conditions our analysis provides a new direction for determination and validation of the convective dissolution flux of co 2 in porous media systems keywords convective dissolution geological co 2 storage porous media convection solubility trapping 1 introduction solubility trapping is one of major trapping mechanisms in geological carbon dioxide co 2 storage which is one promising means of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere metz et al 2005 orr 2009 after co 2 is injected into the deep geological storage sites e g the reservoirs or saline aquifers it forms a less dense co 2 rich vapor phase accumulating at the top of the denser brine and below the low permeability cap rock in this two layer configuration co 2 dissolves into the brine and forms a diffusive boundary layer beneath the co 2 brine interface since the resulting solution is denser than the underlying resident brine convection may set in under the influence of the gravity when the diffusive boundary layer is thick enough ennis king et al 2005 riaz et al 2006 hassanzadeh et al 2006 xu et al 2006 slim et al 2013 this process can greatly increase the dissolution flux reduce the possible leakage and contribute to secure long term storage neufeld et al 2010 sathaye et al 2014 to explore the dissolution process of co 2 into the brine water many experiments have been performed in analog fluid systems neufeld et al 2010 backhaus et al 2011 tsai et al 2013 macminn and juanes 2013 wang et al 2016 suekane et al 2017 liang et al 2018 salibindla et al 2018 liyanage et al 2019 michel meyer et al 2020 where the miscible analogue fluids e g methanol ethylene glycol water and propylene glycol water are used to replace co 2 and brine in these systems the convective transport can be visualized in hele shaw cells or using x ray ct scanning nevertheless there exist many fundamental differences between the analog fluid systems and the co 2 brine system the analog fluids and water are fully miscible the density of the mixtures exhibits non monotonic characteristics as a function of the solute mass fraction and the interface moves upward during the mixing neufeld et al 2010 hidalgo et al 2015 jafari raad et al 2016 liang et al 2018 however co 2 is partially soluble in water the density of the mixture increases monotonically with concentration and co 2 brine interface is nearly fixed in a closed system duan and sun 2003 efika et al 2016 shi et al 2018 wen et al 2018a moreover the analog fluid systems allow the experiments at normal laboratory conditions while the experiments with the co 2 brine system at reservoir conditions involve a high pressure and high temperature setup bickle et al 2007 shi et al 2018 the major experimental approach used to measure the co 2 dissolution in brine at reservoir conditions is the pressure decay method tse and sandall 1979 renner et al 1988 riazi 1996 wang et al 1996 zhang et al 2000 sheikha et al 2005 farajzadeh et al 2009 moghaddam et al 2012 azin et al 2013 mojtaba et al 2014 raad et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 shi et al 2018 mahmoodpour et al 2019 2020 this approach is originally designed to characterize the diffusive mass transfer of co 2 in brine in this method the pressure in the gas phase above the liquid phase due to the dissolution of co 2 is monitored and recorded in a pressure volume temperature pvt cell fig 1 the evolution of the amount of co 2 present in the gas phase is then calculated from the pressure temperature and the volume of the gas phase via an equation of state the experimental data are then commonly interpreted via a diffusion model i e the fick s law and the co 2 diffusivity in the liquid phase is evaluated by fitting the experimental data nevertheless when the density driven convection is introduced in the dissolution process molecular diffusion is not the only mechanism that controls the co 2 mass transfer in a few studies researchers interpret the experimental data based on the diffusion model and then use a so called effective diffusivity to describe the combined effect of diffusion and convection yang and gu 2006 farajzadeh et al 2009 wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 in strong convecting systems however the reported values of the effective diffusivity are typically two orders of magnitude larger than the expected co 2 diffusivity in bulk water or brine in a purely diffusive system shi et al 2018 moreover unlike the analog fluid experiments which are convenient to evaluate the mean dissolution flux in the constant flux regime at certain large rayleigh number in pressure decay experiments the driving force for convection always decreases with time due to the pressure drop leading to decreasing rayleigh number and dissolution flux hence there exists a clear need today for developing appropriate models and theories to analyze the mixing processes of convective co 2 dissolution in pressure decay experiments at reservoir conditions although extensive numerical simulations have been performed by several research groups to explore the dynamics of convective co 2 dissolution in water ennis king et al 2005 hassanzadeh et al 2006 riaz et al 2006 xu et al 2006 pau et al 2010 hewitt et al 2013 szulczewski et al 2013 slim 2014 de paoli et al 2016 2017 in their models a constant co 2 concentration is usually assumed at the top boundary i e the co 2 water interface however in both the pressure decay experiments and some natural co 2 reservoirs sathaye et al 2014 2016a 2016b akhbari and hesse 2017 the systems are closed so that the co 2 dissolution reduces the pressure in the vapor phase subsequently leading to a decline of the co 2 concentration at the interface and thereby reducing the density difference driving convective dissolution in the liquid phase wen et al 2018a investigate this negative feedback of the pressure drop on convective dissolution in closed systems at low pressures below 1 mpa and present mathematical models for the dissolution process when the co 2 vapor can be treated as an ideal gas nevertheless most natural gas reservoirs and pressure decay experiments exist operate under high pressure conditions where the co 2 vapor is no longer ideal in this investigation we extend the modeling of convective co 2 dissolution in closed porous media systems to high pressure and real gas conditions pressure dependent compressibility factor and solubility are added in the ideal gas law and the henry s law respectively to model the evolution of co 2 concentration in the gas phase and at the gas liquid interface scaling analysis reveals that the dynamics of the system are controlled by five dimensionless parameters in a wide domain both direct numerical simulations dns and pressure decay experiments are utilized to characterize the convective transport of co 2 dissolution in closed porous media systems moreover simple ordinary differential equation ode models are developed to capture the mean behavior of the convecting system at large rayleigh number and are then verified by simulations and experiments the mathematical models presented here have practical significance for exploring the dynamics of convective co 2 dissolution in both pressure decay experiments and confined reservoirs importantly our analysis allows the recovery of the constant flux regime due to a rescaling so that the pressure decay experiments can be used to determine and validate the convective co 2 dissolution flux as a function of rayleigh number in porous media systems the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in the next section we formulate the mathematical model of convection in closed porous media systems at high pressure and real gas conditions non dimensionalize the governing equations describe the numerical methods used for the simulations and construct the ode models to predict the evolution of the gas pressure and dissolution flux in time in section 3 we discuss the set up of the pressure decay experiments in bead packs the numerical and experimental results are shown and discussed in section 4 our conclusions are given in section 5 2 mathematical modeling numerical simulations by pau et al 2010 and fu et al 2013 indicate that solutal convection in two dimensional 2d porous media systems exhibits similar flow regimes as in the three dimensional 3d systems although in the quasi steady regime the co 2 dissolution flux of the latter is approximately 18 25 higher than that of the former in this section we focus on the modeling of convective co 2 dissolution in a 2d rectangular domain 2 1 dimensional equations consider a 2d isotropic and homogeneous porous medium containing gas overlying water fig 1a we neglect the capillary forces so that the phases are segregated by buoyancy and separated by a sharp interface at z 0 0 golding et al 2011 martinez and hesse

compressibility factor measuring how much the gas deviates from ideal gas behavior anon 2020 r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature at the gas water interface the local equilibrium between the gas and the dissolved aqueous co 2 is given by henry s law 2 c s k h p g where c s is the dissolved gas concentration or the co 2 concentration at the interface and k h is the henry s law solubility constant in previous study at low pressure wen et al 2018a the gas is assumed to be ideal so z 1 and k h is constant at isothermal conditions for high pressure real gas conditions however both z and k h are pressure dependent i e z z p g and k h k h p g hence eq 2 yields c s k h p g p g moreover in the modeling of convection the volume change of water due to the co 2 dissolution is negligible under certain pressure condition approximately 3 5 for fixed p g 12 mpa so the interface is assumed to be always localized at z 0 in closed systems wen et al 2018a nevertheless the solubility k h used here is from previously published batch phase equilibrium data which have already considered the volume change of water in the liquid phase i e h w z 0 the flow is

difference between the fresh water and the saturated water and the concentration of co 2 in saturated water at the initial gas pressure p g 0 in this work δ ρ 0 is modeled using a quadratic function of p g described in wen et al 2018a the transport of the concentration field in the liquid phase is governed by the following advection diffusion equation 6 c w t u w c w d 2 c w where d is the diffusivity from shi et al 2018 d 3 37 10 9 m 2 s for ϕ 0 4 at t 323 15 k 50 c initially the water contains no dissolved gas 7 c w t 0 0 for 1 z 0 for boundary conditions of the liquid phase the upper

in this investigation we model z and c s with correlations developed from previously published batch phase equilibrium nist data namely for fixed temperature t 11 z z 1 p g 2 z 2 p g 1 and c s k h p g

linearly with p g so the gas reduces to the ideal state at high pressure however the gas deviates from the ideal gas behavior and c s levels off from eqs 1 and 9 11 we can write the evolution of the

parameters r a 0 π 0 z 1 z 2 and k at p g 1 mpa z 1 z 2 and k are all approximately zero so that the dimensionless system reduces to the low pressure case presented by wen et al 2018a 2 3 numerical method we perform direct numerical simulations for the dimensionless partial differential equation pde model 14 25 by adapting the solver developed in previous investigations wen and chini 2018 shi et

periodic in x and homogeneous at the top and bottom of the water layer the resulting partial differential eqs 15 and 16 are discretized in space using a fourier chebyshev tau spectral algorithm boyd

differentiation scheme for the remaining steps peyret 2002 p g and c s are updated at each time step by solving eqs 20 and 22 using a two step adams bashforth algorithm 2 4 ode models at high rayleigh numbers solutal convection in porous media exhibits different flow regimes characterized by the behavior of the dissolution an early diffusion dominated regime a flux growth plume merging regime a quasi steady convective regime and a shut down regime riaz et al 2006 hewitt et al 2013 tilton and riaz 2014 slim 2014 wen et al 2018a at early time the transport is dominated by diffusion and the flux decays as π t 1 2 as the diffusive boundary layer near the interface becomes sufficiently thick convective instability sets in small finger plumes are generated leading to an increase of the flux after a series of plume merging events the resulting primary plumes propagate at a constant speed when the gas pressure remains constant π 0 0 resulting in a constant flux i e the quasi steady convective regime after the primary plumes reach the bottom of the water layer the co 2 rich fluid starts to move upwards with the returning flow once this dense fluid reaches the top boundary i e the interface there is no fresh water in the liquid phase so that the density difference i e the driving force for convection decreases the flux declines and eventually the convection shuts down in wen et al 2018a simple ode models are developed to predict the co 2 dissolution in closed porous media systems at low pressure ideal gas conditions for both quasi steady convective and shut down regimes these models are based on certain properties of the convective flow at large r a 0 and are extended to the high pressure real gas conditions in this manuscript in the quasi steady convective regime the analysis and simulation results in wen et al 2018a show that the dissolution flux is proportional to the square of the interface concentration more specifically 26 f α r a 0 c s 2 where the

verified later via laboratory experiments at high pressure conditions actually the pressure conditions of the vapor phase only affect the equation of state 1 and the solute solubility at the interface

reference cell and a sample cell fig 3 with further details having been described previously shi et al 2018 a known mass of water was first loaded into the sample cell its volume then calculated from its known density subsequently a known mass of soda lime glass beads with a particle size of 1 6 mm was added to the sample cell wet packing until the height of the beads equalled the water level the height of the water saturated porous material was then recorded and the bulk volume of the porous material was calculated from the cell geometry the porosity of the unconsolidated porous medium ϕ was then calculated from the volume of the water v w and the bulk volume of the porous material and is reported in table 1 the gas volume for each experiment was then calculated from the known volume of the sample cell and the total volume of the porous material the permeability of the porous medium k is estimated using the kozeny carman correlation wyllie and gregory 1955 34 k d 2 ϕ 3 180 1 ϕ 2 where d is the bead diameter all the experiments were performed at a constant temperature of 323 15 k to initiate each experiment the reference cell was pressurized with co 2 to a certain pressure and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium the valve in between the reference cell and the sample cell was then opened to allow the co 2 in the reference cell to enter the sample cell the valve was then closed when the pressure in the sample cell reached the initial pressure shown in table 1 in a few seconds so that the reference cell was isolated from the sample cell for the duration of the experiment from that point on the pressure of co 2 in the gas space in the sample cell started to decrease due to its dissolution into the water saturated porous medium for the remainder of the experiment the gas pressure p g and the temperature t in the sample cell were then monitored and recorded continuously we report here data from four experiments each employing a different height of porous medium the information of each experiment is listed in table 1 the first experiment exp 1 was conducted previously by shi et al 2018 while the remaining three experiments exp 2 to exp 4 were conducted specifically for this study a different cell was used for exp 1 with a slightly larger cell cross sectional area in exp 2 exp 4 teflon spacers were used to reduce the volume of the sample cell in order to arrive at a different water gas volume ratio v w v g for each experiment 4 results and discussion here we use experiments to first quantitatively verify the high r a 0 property of the dissolution flux during convection as proposed in eq 26 figure 4 shows the evolution of the flux f compensated by r a 0 and c s 2 r a 0 as a function of the advection time t a r a 0 t as observed from the experiments in the experiments the moles of co 2 in the vapor phase are determined based on the pressure and temperature data 40000 points for exp 1 and 120000 points for each of exp 2 exp 4 via eqs 1 and 11 the dimensional flux f is then evaluated from the time derivative of the amount of co 2 in the vapor phase via eq 9 to arrive at the dimensionless flux f h w f d c s 0 in fig 4 the scatter in the flux is due to a simple finite difference approximation of the derivative in closed systems the dissolution of co 2 into the underlying water reduces the gas pressure the pressure drop in the gas phase decreases the saturated concentration of co 2 in the water and introduces a negative feedback that reduces the convective dissolution flux as shown in fig 4 a for increasing dissolution capacity π 0 the decline of the dissolution flux is more evident especially at the late time after appropriate rescaling however f c s 2 r a 0 becomes nearly constant in the quasi steady convective regime 1 t a 20 consistent with the theoretical analysis which finds that f c s 2 α r a 0 our four experiments reveal that the prefactor α varies from 0 012 to 0 023 in close agreement with the 2d 3d dns predictions α 0 017 and 0 02 for a constant co 2 concentration at the top boundary see fig 4b to the best of our knowledge this is the first experimental study to evaluate the prefactor of f α r a 0 for high raleigh number convective co 2 dissolution at reservoir conditions in previous experiments the convective dissolution flux of co 2 in porous media systems was usually measured using analog fluids in hele shaw cells or granular porous media neufeld et al 2010 backhaus et al 2011 liang et al 2018 the analog fluid system can successfully visualize and characterize the convective mixing process at atmospheric pressure conditions nevertheless the nonlinear density dependence of miscible analog fluids induces a wavy upward moving interface and produces a higher prefactor α for the dissolution flux than that in the real co 2 water system based on our analysis and validation above the pressure decay experiments can be used to determine the convective co 2 dissolution flux in porous media systems at reservoir conditions to further interpret the experiments we perform high resolution numerical simulations with both the pde and ode models based on the information listed in table 1 in order to avoid the scatter in the experimental flux as seen in fig 4 in the rest of this section we fit the following smooth function to the experimental pressure data p g and moles of co 2 in the vapor phase n g 35 f a 0 a 1 e a 2 t a 3 e a 4 t a 5 e a 6 t where a 0 a 6 are all positive numbers then the dissolution flux can be evaluated by calculating the time derivative of eq 35 as discussed above figures 5 and 6 compare the dimensionless gas pressure p g and dissolution flux f for dns of the pde model ode models in quasi steady and shut down regimes and the experimental results as shown in these figures the ode models agree well with the dns while both models are found to be in good agreement with the experiments for different values of π 0 the gas pressure in fig 5 has a similar evolution with time but declines to lower values at higher π 0 in the log log plot the inflection point on the time pressure curve corresponds to the transition from the quasi steady convective regime to the shut down regime moreover the steady state of eq 32 successfully predicts the equilibrium gas pressure in the experiments since the henry s law solubility constant k h p g for co 2 in water decreases with increasing p g at real gas conditions fig 2b the equilibrium gas pressure from the real gas model is always higher than that from the ideal gas model where k h assumes a constant value wen et al 2018a consistent with the ideal gas case wen et al 2018a four flow regimes are delineated based on the behavior of the dissolution as shown in fig 6 i diffusion dominated regime at early time right after opening the valve the dissolution is dominated by diffusion so that the flux f π t 1 2 ii flux growth plume merging regime after a certain time convection sets in due to the buoyancy driven instability and small plumes are generated beneath the co 2 water interface growing laterally and merging with neighboring plumes fig 7 a iii quasi steady convective regime after the convective pattern has coarsened the basic pattern of the primary plumes is nearly unchanged fig 7b and iv shut down regime once the saturated fluid that is carried upward by the return flow reaches the interface the driving force for convection i e δ c decreases the flux declines rapidly and eventually the convection shuts down fig 7c despite the name of the convective regime iii convection in closed systems is never actually quasi steady as the flux declines due to the negative feedback of the pressure drop moreover the dns results in fig 6 reveal that increasing π 0 delays the transition to the shut down regime to systematically investigate the dynamics of convective co 2 dissolution in closed systems at high pressure real gas conditions we perform dns in the 2d rectangular domain at r a 0 20000 and l 5 with π 0 0 5 1 2 5 and p g 0 0 507 mpa 5 atm 2 027 mpa 20 atm 3 546 mpa 35 atm 5 066 mpa 50 atm figure 7 shows the snapshots of the concentration field c and its horizontal mean profile c at flow regimes ii iv with π 0 1 and p g 0 3 546 mpa the convective pattern at high pressure real gas conditions remains similar for various flow regimes as in the ideal gas case discussed in wen et al 2018a the concentration at the co 2 water interface decreases with time due to the pressure drop in the vapor phase this reduces the driving force for convection i e the concentration difference δ c of the fluids between the interface and the underlying water and thereby induces a negative feedback on the dissolution flux moreover as shown in fig 7 c in the shut down regime the horizontal mean concentration becomes well mixed and nearly constant with depth supporting the hypothesis used in building the ode model in section 2 4 we observe similar features for other values of π 0 and p g 0 which are omitted in this manuscript figure 8 shows the real gas effects on the evolution of the gas pressure and dissolution flux at r a 0 20000 and π 0 1 for reference the ode models for the ideal gas case and the constant pressure π 0 0 case are also plotted at low pressure condition e g p g 0 0 507 mpa the gas is ideal so p g which is equal to c s and f are predicted accurately by the models from wen et al 2018a as the pressure is increased the gas deviates from the ideal state and the solubility constant k h p g declines fig 2 this reduced the pressure drop and the associated negative feedback on the dissolution flux on the other hand at π 0 0 the pressure in the vapor phase remains constant and the negative feedback disappears therefore for closed systems at real gas conditions the ideal gas models by wen et al 2018a provide lower bounds on the gas pressure and the dissolution flux while the ode models with π 0 0 provide the corresponding upper bounds 5 conclusions in this work we extend the modeling of convective co 2 dissolution in closed porous media systems to high pressure real gas conditions this is critical for the determination of convective co 2 dissolution flux at reservoir conditions from pressure decay experiments in a standard pvt cell based on previous models for low pressure ideal gas conditions we add the pressure dependent compressibility factor z p g and solubility k h p g into the ideal gas law and the henry s law respectively direct numerical simulations of the resulting pde model are performed for a 2d rectangular domain to investigate the dynamics of convective co 2 dissolution at large r a 0 simple ode models are developed to capture the mean behavior of the convecting system to validate the pde and ode models we interpret pressure decay experiments in a pvt cell at a constant temperature of 323 15 k the dns of the pde model reveal that at high pressure real gas conditions convection in closed porous media systems at large r a 0 still exhibits four flow regimes characterized by the behavior of the dissolution an early diffusion dominated regime a flux growth plume merging regime a quasi steady convective regime and a shut down regime as in the ideal gas case discussed in wen et al 2018a in the quasi steady convective regime the dissolution flux f is no longer constant due to the negative feedback of the pressure drop in the vapor phase however we use the pressure decay experiments to validate that the quantity f c s 2 remains constant i e f c s 2 α r a 0 providing a new direction for determination of the convective dissolution flux of co 2 in porous media at reservoir conditions moreover the simulations indicate that in the shut down regime the horizontal mean concentration is well mixed and nearly constant with depth based on the above properties nonlinear ode models are built to predict the evolution of gas pressure and dissolution flux in the quasi steady convective and shut down regimes at high pressure real gas conditions our simulations show that both the pde and ode models developed in this work can quantitatively capture the mean behavior of the convective co 2 dissolution measured from experiments finally our models also reveal that for increasing gas pressure p g in closed systems the negative feedback of the pressure drop is weakened due to the decrease of the solubility constant k h p g at the real gas conditions assuming constant co 2 concentration at the top boundary or constant gas pressure in closed systems previous 2d numerical simulations have shown f α r a 0 017 r a 0 for high rayleigh number convective co 2 dissolution although this linear scaling has been verified in some laboratory experiments in hele shaw cells or granular porous media liang et al 2018 de paoli et al 2020 different values of the prefactor α are obtained since the experiments are performed using analog fluids at the atmospheric pressure condition in this study our four experiments which are performed using co 2 and water at the reservoir conditions show that the prefactor α varies from 0 012 to 0 023 to the best of our knowledge this is the first experimental study to evaluate the prefactor of f α r a 0 for high rayleigh number convective co 2 dissolution at reservoir conditions the variation of the value of α in our experiments can be due to some inherent properties of the porous media e g the random packing of glass beads and the effect of mechanical dispersion liang et al 2018 wen et al 2018b gasow et al 2020 de paoli et al 2020 hewitt 2020 etc further systematic experiments are needed to show the effects of various experimental parameters e g initial pressure height of the liquid layer and bead size etc on α the method presented here is currently the only way to experimentally determine the convective dissolution flux in the actual co 2 brine system this opens the door to study a variety of important processes that cannot be studied in analog systems for example our method could be used to develop a set of experiments to study the effect of the capillary transition zone on the convective dissolution process and validate numerical simulations martinez and hesse 2016 working with co 2 and brine also makes it possible to study chemical effects on the convective dissolution rates that cannot be addressed by analog systems these include the effect of impurities such as hydrogen sulfide h 2 s in the gas the composition of the brine and potentially geochemical interactions with the

272,one of the main challenges for india is increasing food security and promoting economic development using the domestic finite and already stressed natural resources in the last decades silk production has been booming in india in response to the 2025 silk self sufficiency goal set by the indian ministry of textile it is not clear to which extent mulberry morus alba used to feed silkworm in 70 of the total domestic silk production can be expanded in the wastelands identified by the indian government as suitable for moriculture without both endangering natural resources and causing competition for natural resources with the food sector this issue is here investigated by a assessing mulberry water consumption rain and irrigation in the plantations presently cultivated and in all the wastelands selected by the government for the expansion of moriculture as well b analyzing annual and sub annual water scarcity induced by mulberry plantations within the plantations c studying the potential competition for natural resources between food crops and mulberry to this end the dynamic spatially distributed crop water balance watneeds model has been used to analyze two different scenarios being the reference scenario considering the present climate and land cover and the silk expansion scenario combining present climate and the new mulberry plantations results for the reference scenario show mulberry expansion areas already suffering food insecurity and water scarcity in the dry period here the expansion of mulberry cultivation is shown to exacerbate water scarcity in pre monsoon months especially in the north eastern region affecting on a yearly scale eleven million people results also show expanding food production on wastelands rather than mulberry could be a viable solution for alleviating the burden of malnutrition keywords mulberry silk water resources economic development wasteland agricultural expansion 1 introduction silk is a natural protein fiber made by silkworms bombyx mori fed on plant leaves e g mulberry castor plants ghosh et al 2017 karthik et al 2015 nowadays about 110 000 metric tonnes mt of silk are being produced worldwide international sericultural commission 2020 silk is preferred to other fibers as a luxury material in the fashion industry especially in asia where it still holds an important role in ceremonial dresses datta and nanavaty 2005 the major producing country is china followed by india which has a long tradition in sericulture bhat and choure 2014 the indian textile sector represents 6 of the country gdp and it is the second source of employment after agriculture ministry of textile 2015 in particular sericulture has traditionally been an important remunerative economic sector providing employment especially to women who account for the 60 of the work force bukhari et al 2019 ganie et al 2012 mittal and dutta 2019 nowadays the silk sector in india gives employment to more than 7 million people mainly in rural areas ganie et al 2012 and it is continuously growing central silk board 2019a from 2000s to the present indian internal consumption of raw silk has sharply increased by about 60 while conversely imports have decreased by 60 central silk board 2019a united nations 2020 to cope with the additional demand silk production in the country has more than doubled in less than 20 years central silk board 2019a to date i e 2018 2019 domestic silk production has reached the amount of about 35 000 metric tonnes mt more than 25 000 mt of which are mulberry silk so increasing by 25 with respect to 2013 2014 mulberry silk production central silk board 2019a 2019b depending on the years mulberry silk production represents respectively the 90 in 2012 2013 and the 70 in 2018 2019 of total indian silk production bhat and choure 2014 central silk board 2019a following this trend mulberry harvested areas have seen a 20 increase since 2013 in the whole india central silk board 2019a however silk production has remained inadequate to meet domestic demand and achieve country self sufficiency handique et al 2016 with the aim of making india the world leader in silk production the indian government is willing to promote the silk sector with scaling up strategies among the textile industries central silk board 2017 rathore et al 2019 the objectives set by the vision policy of the indian ministry of textile ministry of textile 2015 are the yearly increase of 12 in textile production and on a broader extent the 20 growth in textile exports by 2025 to answer to the increasing demand of silk the future plan of central silk board of the indian ministry of textile central silk board 2017 has planned to increase mulberry trees harvesting in india in agreement with the vision policy of the indian ministry of textile the central silk board and the indian space research organization have detected suitable areas for mulberry horizontal expansion in wastelands using satellite data showing the potential to increase mulberry cultivation tenfold handique et al 2016 singh et al 2016 wasteland areas include mostly scrubs degraded forests shifting cultivation land and barren rocky areas dolr nrsc 2019a dolr nrsc 2019b overall wastelands cover in india about the 16 of the country total area garg et al 2011 and have already been targeted for potential agricultural expansion in india dolr nrsc 2019a dolr nrsc 2019b the attention paid by the indian government in converting those abandoned and marginal areas into profitable areas follows the lack of sufficient land resources to meet the needs e g food feed etc of the population dolr nrsc 2019a while the extent of potential suitable areas has been assessed by indian government silk and so mulberry expansion plans do not include the evaluation of the necessary resources water in particular for sustaining mulberry plants growth in those areas in fact the feasibility of the sericulture expansion plan is constrained not only by the availability of land but also by the availability of freshwater for plant growth mulberry has been estimated to have a cwr crop water requirement in india of about 16 000 m3 ha per year so often requiring irrigation astudillo et al 2014 central silk board 2020a rajaram and qadri 2014 the increase in silk production in fact might be limited by the high cwr of mulberry plantations and by the scarcity of water resources that chronically affects the majority of the country gupta and deshpande 2004 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 furtherly there is evidence that some states i e assam maharashtra manipur meghalaya nagaland orissa tripura tamil nadu and madhya pradesh where mulberry plantations have recently expanded are now experiencing increasing of water scarcity and food insecurity than in the past bhat and choure 2014 central silk board 2019a despite its high potential in boosting indian economy mulberry expansion could affect water availability therefore exacerbating water scarcity and competition for water between staple and cash crops in india more than 190 million people are still undernourished fao ifad unicef wfp who 2020 swaminathan et al 2019 and food supply is mainly contributed by domestic production due to policies promoting food self sufficiency since 1948 sarma 1978 swaminathan and bhavani 2013 yu et al 2015 india has always relied on self sufficiency in term of food production especially for staple crops e g wheat and rice faostat 2018 yu et al 2015 recent works davis et al 2018 kayatz et al 2019 rodell et al 2009 highlighted how cropping strategies proposed by the indian government have worsened water security conditions locally and in turn food security in the country due to failures in accounting for the high freshwater demand e g rice wheat systems those studies show the need of including in crop strategies planning also the water assessment to find not only the most profitable strategies but also the most sustainable ones chouchane et al 2020 damerau et al 2020 davis et al 2018 2017a 2017b with the aim to link objectives of economic development policies to environmental sustainability in this study we analyze the impacts of mulberry expansion in terms of natural resources use specifically land and water a similar approach has been used for studying the hydrological impacts of other water demanding cash crops such as rubber chiarelli et al 2020b chiarelli et al 2018 and oil palm rulli et al 2019 which rise in some cases issues of water and food security however from the best of our knowledge similar studies on silk production have not been carried out either for india or at the global scale in this paper we therefore analyze the hydrological effects of silk production in a country facing silk and staple food i e wheat and rice self sufficiency challenges while affected by natural resources shortages and food insecurity issues to this aim we firstly analyze the current situation of water resources availability in india and then we assess the variation induced by future mulberry horizontal expansion specifically we investigate the water footprint of mulberry fields using the spatially distributed water crop watneeds model chiarelli et al 2020a then we assess the effect of horizontal expansion of moriculture on water scarcity and we quantify the population affected by severe water scarcity condition targeted areas for mulberry expansion are located both in districts with tradition in sericulture i e andhra pradesh jammu and kashmir karnataka tamil nadu and west bengal and in non traditional ones e g madhya pradesh orissa uttar pradesh chhattisgarh and the north eastern region datta 2000 as reported by handique et al 2016 lastly we identified suitable areas for mulberry plantations where cultivation is environmentally sustainable under irrigated conditions i e areas where moriculture does not exacerbate water scarcity tradeoffs of moriculture expansion in term of missing food production are also being evaluated because the tenth five years plan of india released by the indian government planning commission 2002 reports that ngos have identified in wastelands an opportunity to increase food production for improving food security conditions especially among small size rural farmers 2 methods 2 1 green and blue water assessment we assessed the grown crops water requirement cwr subdivided in green gwr and blue water bwr requirements in the units of length that is volume per unit area associated to crops production under two different scenarios namely the baseline scenario that is a reference scenario considering the current land use and climate and the mulberry expansion scenario that is the scenario considering the additional areas selected by the government for mulberry expansion and the current climate hoekstra 2003 defines gwr as the water coming from precipitation stored in the soil and evapotranspired by plants while bwr as the water extracted from surface or groundwater resources and evapotranspired by plants to assess gwr and bwr we used the watneeds model chiarelli et al 2020a that is a dynamic agro hydrological spatially distributed model solving the vertical water balance here used at 5 arcminute grid resolution specifically in each cell i the daily change in soil moisture δs i t is a function of the effective precipitation p i t the actual evapotranspiration e t a i t the runoff r i t and the deep percolation d i t at the day t δ s i t δ t p i t e t a i t r i t d i t usually cwr gwr bwr are expressed in l namely millimeters allen et al 1998 chiarelli et al 2020a mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a siebert and döll 2010 to run the model precipitation p i t data were retrieved from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station version 2 0 chirps at 0 05 x 0 05 resolution funk et al 2015 two different rain periods have been considered a dry year i e 2000 and the average conditions from year 2010 to year 2016 year 2000 was selected because it is considered a peculiar dry year for india showing a rainfall rate 8 lower than the ones in long term climatological condition krishnan et al 2003 a drier season in pre monsoon months i e march and april and more intensive monsoon rains indian meteorological department 2017 ministry of earth science 2017 we also considered the average period between year 2010 and 2016 in order to take into account more recent climate kothawale and rajeevan 2017 krishnan et al 2003 and we analyzed the inter annual variation of the main parameters rain bw gw with respect to the average condition boxplots in figure s1 the actual evapotranspiration eta for each crop for both the two periods i e year 2000 and average 2010 16 is computed as e t a k s k c e t o where the reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated using the fao penmann monteith formulation allen et al 1998 at a resolution of 5 arcmin and input data from harris et al 2014 the crop coefficients kc were taken from siebert and döll 2010 while ks is the water stress coefficient depending on the daily soil moisture available to the plant allen et al 1998 for mulberry trees being perennial crops datta 2000 jain et al 2000 crop coefficient kc and growing periods length were averaged values for perennial crops taken from mekonnen and hoekstra 2011b mulberry planting and harvesting dates were chosen respectively as 1st of june and 31st of may as suggested by handique et al 2016 and singh et al 2016 lastly deep percolation d i t and runoff r i t were computed accordingly to chiarelli et al 2020a by using soil information from fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2012 while capillary rising water has not been accounted for chiarelli et al 2020a therefore an overestimation of water requirements may occur in case of capillary rise becoming significant e g fine soil in association to a high level of groundwater in not saturated soil crop water requirement cwr in the unit of l represents the amount of water needed to meet the water loss through evapotranspiration gwr was computed as the sum of daily actual evapotranspiration while bwr was computed as the difference between cwr and gwr then green water demand gwd blue water demand bwd and total water demand twd in the units of l3 for mulberry have been obtained by multiplying the gwr bwr and twr for the related harvested areas in each district some authors e g mahesh et al 2021 rajaram and qadri 2014 seenappa et al 2016 seenappa and devakumar 2015 emphasize that irrigation plays a significant role in the growth of mulberry trees in india and that these plants are often irrigated recently the silk plan of central silk board highlights the need to expand irrigation to meet mulberry water needs central silk board 2020a accordingly in our analysis we considered to apply fully irrigation on mulberry harvested areas so avoiding plants water stress condition thus we set equal to 1 the water stress coefficient ks for mulberry therefore ensuring the achievement of the maximum crop water yield the proposed methodology has been largely used for assessing the gwr bwr and agriculture sustainability chiarelli et al 2020b chiarelli et al 2018 rosa et al 2020 rosa et al 2018 as well as the input data used in our analysis have already been used in previous studies regarding india davis et al 2018 pandey et al 2021 prakash 2019 sonali and nagesh kumar 2016 in the baseline scenario for the study area we assessed gwr and bwr for the current land use including both croplands and all the other land uses e g forests shrubs grassland urban bare areas concerning croplands we considered rainfed and irrigated crop distribution maps at 5 arc minute portmann et al 2010 which include 23 main crops and 3 crop groups while maps of land uses have been retrieved from the global land cover map at 30 arc second global land cover 2003 the maps having spatial resolution other than 5 arc minute have been rescaled at 5 arc minute for assessing the gwr and bwr in mulberry expansion areas in each 5 arcminute cell we consider to replace the other land uses than croplands with the extent of the mulberry areas in that cell this procedure of cropland mulberry expansion has been carried out according with the hypothesis of field expansion handique et al 2016 2 3 mulberry suitable areas mulberry suitable areas on wastelands were gathered from the sericulture information linkages and knowledge system silks geodatabase handique et al 2016 singh et al 2016 fig 1 figure s2 these areas for silkworm feeding have been planned for sericulture expansion in 108 districts around india handique et al 2016 among these we considered in our analysis only those for which spatially distributed data were available on silks specifically mulberry expansion areas were available on a pixel scale ranging from about 0 001 to 0 002 and subdivided into marginally moderately or high suitable areas handique et al 2016 table s1 those maps have been obtained based on biophysical suitability considering landscape soil and climatic parameters i e drainage texture ph depth slope erosion temperature rainfall and minimal length of growing period showing that 14 out of total mulberry expansion areas selected by silks are highly suitable while 55 are marginally suitable and 31 are moderately suitable in our analysis we considered marginal to high suitable areas table s2 we also investigated the present land use in wastelands by overlapping mulberry suitable areas to the wasteland maps available at state level in bhuvan geodatabase online map bhuvan thematic services 2020 figure s3 2 4 raw silk water footprint green water footprint gwf blue water footprint bwf and total water footprint twf of raw silk l3 mass were computed as the ratio between the gwr and bwr calculated by the watneeds model and the mulberry raw silk yield hoekstra et al 2011 hoekstra and wiedmann 2014 specifically the analysis of gwr and bwr have been carried out at 5 arcminutes spatial resolution and then the results for mulberry have been averaged on harvested areas and aggregated at state level level for which data on raw silk yield have been made available by the central silk board central silk board 2015 central silk board 2016 bwf of raw silk has been calculated including only the bwr related to mulberry irrigation requirement since according to hogeboom and hoekstra 2017 it accounts for the 99 of the total bwf we noticed that non traditional silk producer states tend to have lower mulberry silk yields than traditional ones especially karnataka andhra pradesh tamil nadu west bengal therefore for water footprint calculations we used the proper current yields for traditional states while for not traditional silk producer states we used the average yield of traditional states as already stated we did that under the hypothesis of scaling up strategies for all the states interested in mulberry silk expansion especially non traditional ones ministry of textile 2015 we considered average yields and bwr and gwr data over the time period of analysis we also analyzed the interannual variation of bwf and gwf compared to average conditions for the states of karnataka andhra pradesh tamil nadu and west bengal boxplots in figure s4 2 5 impacts of mulberry expansion water scarcity population affected and food security previous information has been combined to analyze the hydrological impacts of mulberry expansion in particular water scarcity has been computed as the ratio between bwd and water availability for baseline scenario and for the scenario considering mulberry expansion according to the methodology defined by mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 at monthly scale and spatial resolution of 5 arcminutes in detail hydrological fluxes have been calculated for the 2 different scenarios through the watneeds model by accounting for agriculture consumptive water use data on domestic and industrial water use were taken from mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a and were kept constant in the 2 different scenarios flows direction were taken from lehner et al 2008 while environmental flows were set to 80 of runoff as in rosa et al 2018 population affected by water scarcity has been calculated considering the population living in the areas affected by water scarcity population data referred to the latest available year 2020 and the administrative boundaries were taken from worldpop 2018 and gadm 2018 respectively thus the tradeoffs of moriculture expansion in terms of potential missing food production were assessed both by evaluating the amount of food that could be produced if the mulberry expansion areas were grown with food crops so reducing the burden of malnutrition and or decreasing food imports specifically we considered food crops expansion in the areas previously selected for mulberry proportional to the current distribution of the main staple crops grown in each state portmann et al 2010 therefore calculating the kilocalories associated to each crop we found the additional calories associated to the cultivation with food crops in the expansion areas the crop yields and kilocalories conversion tables used in our analysis were taken from monfreda et al 2008 and d odorico et al 2014 respectively 2 6 sensitivity analysis we performed the sensitivity analysis of et0 to changes of dew temperature minimum and maximum temperature cloud cover wind speed at 2 m above surface daily temperature data were taken from cpc noaa oar esrl psl 2021 the other input data i e dew temperature cloud cover wind were retrieved from the agera5 dataset copernicus climate change service 2020 produced by the copernicus climate change service through pre processing of the era5 dataset hersbach et al 2020 we computed et0 using the penman monteith equation from allen et al 1998 and considering the top ten indian states having the largest extent of suitable areas for mulberry production et0 has been evaluated in the centroid of each state of analysis sensitivity analysis has been run considering a variation in each input variable of 20 with a 5 interval we observed negligible sensitivity of et0 to the variation in the parameters on a yearly scale table s3 figure s5 for example in case of a 10 variation in input parameters the respective changes in et0 are negligible i e lower than 10 figure s5 to be noted cwr variations are proportional to changes in et0 through the crop parameters kc however in order to check how bwr and gwr respond to changes in et0 we also performed a sensitivity analysis on watneeds input et0 considering variations of 10 with a 2 5 interval et0 ranges used in our sensitivity analysis are consistent with the overall trend observed in table s3 furtherly daily et0 increases by about 10 in case of an average temperature rise of 3 7 c by the end of the century i e business as usual scenario ipcc 2013 milly and dunne 2016 thus confirming our assumptions to be noted bwr and gwr changes are proportional to bwf and gwf through the yield we observed negligible variations in average bwf and gwf for most states e g assam meghalaya mizoram tables s4 s5 however changes in bwf are higher for states having less rainfall throughout the year e g karnataka telangana tables s4 s5 similarly we made the sensitivity analysis of water scarcity with respect to changes in bw required by mulberry plant the 10 increase in mulberry bwd gave an increase in the water scarcity index higher than 10 in less than 6 of the total mulberry area conversely decreasing mulberry bwd by 10 gave a decrease in water scarcity lower than 10 in less than 5 of the mulberry area 3 results 3 1 consumptive water use and footprint we found crop water requirement cwr of mulberry ranging from 900 mm to 1600 mm across india in the reference time period 2010 2016 table 1 the states of arunachal pradesh and telangana present the lowest 870 mm and the highest 1500 mm values of mulberry cwr respectively table 1 in the mulberry expansion scenario twd in the whole india for mulberry production is around 38 km3 more than 19 km3 of which are bwd thus only about 50 of the total cwr can be met by gwr therefore it is apparent that irrigation is required in all of the states analyzed accordingly with rajaram and qadri 2014 that pointed out that rainfall gwr alone is usually not sufficient in tamil nadu for providing the total amount of water required by mulberry cultivation the highest bwr more than 1000 mm is needed in karnataka while arunachal pradesh has the lowest request about 100 mm table 1 yearly bwr during the dry year 2000 is about 5 higher both in andhra pradesh and in several states without tradition in mulberry silk production e g madhya pradesh chhattisgarh tables s6 s7 surprisingly traditional silk producer states tend to have higher bwr than non traditional states in fact we noticed that the bwr and bwf is higher in central and south india especially in traditional districts e g karnataka andhra pradesh and lower in the north eastern region table table 3 concerning all the states selected for mulberry cultivation expansion the highest twd for sustaining mulberry production is found in madhya pradesh and mizoram corresponding to 5 8 and 5 7 km3 respectively table 2 even though mizoram has the largest mulberry expansion areas our results show the state having the lowest bwd table 2 which is 1 8 km3 of blue water out of 5 7 km3 of twd the highest bwd is found in madhya pradesh about 3 8 km3 table 2 it is notable that the amount of bwd in some of the analyzed states is already beyond their freshwater resources availability given the widespread water scarcity and therefore they are already doing an unsustainable water consumption as shown in fig 2 and according with hoekstra et al 2012 kumar et al 2005 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 table 2 in terms of bwf results show that considering the time period from 2010 to 2016 karnataka tamil nadu and andhra pradesh present respectively 95 71 and 45 m3 kg of bwf for raw silk comparable with the estimated value of 54 m3 kg for these states astudillo et al 2014 table 3 our silk twf values are also similar to the values reported for malawi ranging from 50 to around 80 m3 kg according to the different irrigation systems hogeboom and hoekstra 2017 3 2 water scarcity in the baseline scenario the north eastern region ner i e arunachal pradesh assam manipur mizoram meghalaya nagaland tripura shows mean yearly water availability higher than the rest of india as stated also by roy and shil 2015 fig 2 a the monthly scale water scarcity analysis gives ner region experiencing water scarcity in 4 months per year i e december january february march the rest of india i e west north south and center states except for chhattisgarh shows water scarcity conditions at both yearly and monthly scales as reported in figure s5 and figure s7 for the year 2000 and the 2010 2016 period figure s5 figure s7 water scarcity results for the baseline scenario fig 2 a are consistent with the ones reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 fig 3 results for the mulberry expansion scenario show the increase of moriculture able to exacerbate water scarcity conditions on a monthly and yearly scale in the areas already i e baseline scenario affected by water scarcity i e areas in the state of kerala tamil nadu west bengal karnataka uttar pradesh in addition areas in the north eastern region ner i e the state of mizoram meghalaya assam manipur tripura and the eastern region er i e orissa and chhattisgarh not being affected by water scarcity at yearly scale in the baseline scenario show in the expansion scenario water scarcity in detail on monthly scale water scarcity in the ner is exacerbated with respect to the baseline in pre monsoon months i e december january february march already suffering of water scarcity and it is also occurring in months not previously affected i e april may and november figure s6 s7 s8 s9 more in detail in the mulberry scenario the 78 and 98 of total mulberry expansion areas fall under water scarcity conditions in april in ner and in mizoram state respectively in particular mizoram shows bwd increase from 0 02 km3 to 1 7 km3 per year broadly on a country scale we assess that an additional 40 of total mulberry suitable expansion areas will experience yearly scale water scarcity to be noted the greatest part of suitable areas for mulberry expansion currently lies on scrublands and degraded forests figure s3 lastly findings on potential competition for freshwater between food crops and mulberry during the periods of water scarcity show ner water scarcity in april and november due to mulberry horizontal expansion could affect negatively figure s6h s7d s8h s9d s6v s7k s8v s9k rabi season crops i e wheat pulses barley inducing a decrease in water availability those crops in fact are usually sowed in november december and harvested in april may directorate of economics and statistics 2020 moreover in the central part of india i e chhattisghar orissa there is a worsening of water scarcity in mulberry expansion scenario in june so potentially affecting kharif crops i e rice maize soybean sorghum figure s6l s7f s8l s9f these crops in fact are sowed during the monsoon period in june july and harvested at the end of the rains season in october directorate of economics and statistics 2020 3 3 population affected by water scarcity horizontal mulberry expansion can cause additional yearly water scarcity to more than 11 million people table 4 the highest number of affected people is found in assam having more than 5 million people exposed to water scarcity among the total 11 million indian people affected on average around 70 72 and 67 respectively in 2000 and 2010 2016 is in ner the most critical month is april presenting the highest number of people affected by water scarcity that is calculated in more than 10 million people on the contrary the month with the lowest population exposure to water scarcity is august falling in the monsoon period table s8 s9 3 4 food availability our results show lower blue water requirement of staple food crops than mulberry in mulberry expansion areas table 1 the amount of food that could be obtained from the cultivation of mulberry wastelands has been quantified in kilocalories and corresponds on average to 370 kcal cap day when considering the local population living in the states targeted for mulberry expansion while at country scale food increase is negligible table 4 a more detailed analysis for the population at state level proves that the highest increase in calories is found in mizoram more than 5000 kcal cap day table 4 other ner states e g manipur tripura see their food availability increase at around 1000 kcal cap day when we refer to state wise population on mulberry expansion areas considering the total state population however their food availability is halved table 4 overall the most positively affected states as said previously are the ones in the north eastern region e g manipur mizoram tripura that have about 20 prevalence of child underweight swaminathan et al 2019 compared to mulberry cultivation in the horizontal expansion scenario growing food crops in the targeted wastelands would allow for an overall saving of approximatively 9 km3 of blue water resulting in a 47 decrease in water demand in wastelands areas 4 discussion to boost economic development the restoration of present degraded land i e wastelands through sustainable agricultural expansion is promoted by the indian government dolr nrsc 2019a specifically a possible use of these lands has been identified by the central silk board in the expansion of mulberry plantations to reach the target of 12 annual growth rate in textile production so creating employment for 35 million people by 2025 central silk board 2019a ministry of textile 2015 we analyzed the sustainable environmental feasibility of this indian government plan in terms of water resources needed to produce mulberry silk in those wastelands therefore quantifying the consequent impacts on water resources and food production agricultural expansion on wastelands might impact ecosystems services availability tilman 1999 through the increase in the pressure on natural resources tilman et al 2001 the underestimation of the impacts on the environment induced by socioeconomic development strategies might compromise or nullify the intended benefits in the short or long term as happened with the self sufficiency policy in terms of food production in india davis et al 2018 mulberry expansion potential in wastelands has been considered enormous given the availability of over 3 million hectares of suitable land allowing up to 1000 increase of currently mulberry harvested areas central silk board 2019a handique et al 2016 however mulberry being a water intensive perennial crop is able to increase pressure on water resources our study shows that the expansion of mulberry plantations for silk production will result in an additional 38 km3 of consumptive water use half of which is required by irrigation alone thus potentially competing with other uses and local food security we acknowledge that our results have been obtained under the hypothesis of fully irrigation in order to completely meet the crop water requirements avoiding any stress condition while different types of irrigation strategies can be used i e deficit irrigation however rajaram and qadri 2014 report 70 and 50 deficit irrigation of mulberry in india allows significant water savings through a reduction in consumptive water use while decreasing crop yields by about 10 and 30 respectively and thus in some cases boosting water productivity therefore the economic feasibility of mulberry expansion could involve tradeoffs on whether it is preferable to save water or to maximize the overall silk production while we expected that mulberry expansion areas will be equipped with irrigation systems and then irrigated in order to boost productivity central silk board 2020a 2017 ministry of textile 2015 presently those lands are not equipped for irrigation and information on the indian government irrigation plans is not available however our results show that irrigation is needed not only to boost production but sometimes for the plant survival in almost all the districts it has to be noted in case of high water demand and low water availability mulberry irrigation might cause and or exacerbate water stress condition diverging water from other uses e g food production domestic use industrial use etc as well highlighted by some authors e g chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 rodell et al 2009 in india any use of groundwater for irrigation could aggravate the already critical situation resulting from the historical food self sufficient policies this is confirmed by our analyses which found that water scarcity increases year round in all states that will experience mulberry expansion except for very small areas in arunachal pradesh also showing the greatest water deficit occurs in conjunction with the growing season of rabi and kharif crops so affecting the availability of freshwater for such staple crops so in turn food production and availability the competition for water between fiber namely silk and food sectors has not to be overlooked in a country like india already using the majority of its renewable water resources and that presents nearly one child out of two affected by malnutrition kumar et al 2005 mall et al 2006 narayan et al 2019 swaminathan et al 2019 unicef who the world bank 2019 to be noted that projected rise in population and food demands in india could lead the indian government to increase domestic food production through the cultivation of these marginal areas although low crops yields are expected there dolr nrsc 2019a planning commission 2002 in this case additional food would be produced so increasing food availability and supply to local population while saving water with respect to the cultivation of mulberry being moriculture more water demanding than staple crops and also increasing the resilience of the food system seekell et al 2017 however it could be argued that economic growth obtained thanks to silk production could help to increase food access and to decrease poverty govereh and jayne 2003 nevertheless silk price volatility and external shocks holtemöller and mallick 2016 can influence silk market and so in turn households income and the consequent access to food raw silk prices have had ups and downs in the past years central silk board 2019c in particular during current covid 19 outbreak raw silk prices have decreased by 30 since march 2020 central silk board 2020b about the agricultural yields in the wastelands currently not cropped we assign the yield observed for the same crop in the district where the wasteland is located currently most areas suitable for mulberry are located in degraded forests and scrubs zones on one hand the effective productivity of these lands could be overestimated since different sources reported how degraded lands could yield less than prime farmlands dauber et al 2012 rulli et al 2013 on the other restored degraded lands could see their yield increase in case of effective restoration practices i e water and soil management adeleke et al 2021 hornick and parr 1987 mishra and sharma 2003 rosso et al 2007 beside water also soil suitability affects crop yield davis et al 2017 d odorico et al 2018 among the total mulberry expansion areas in wastelands just 14 are highly suitable and mostly located in ner to be noted marginally suitable areas are widespread throughout mulberry expansion areas and account for more than 55 meaning that the total increase in silk production could be less than expected in addition future climate changes i e drought that predict a further decrease in water availability thus aggravating the competition for natural resources and water in particular should be taken into account as factors affecting agricultural yields bollasina et al 2011 sharma and mujumdar 2017 vermeulen et al 2012 5 conclusion economic development strategies that require natural resources to achieve their goals should consider the availability of such natural resources and the impacts associated with their use in the event that the expansion of agriculture is considered to be instrumental for the economic development it is crucial to evaluate the amount of fresh water needed its availability in the short and long term as well as the water scarcity associated with its use in this paper we have analyzed the hydrological impacts of the indian government economic development strategy consisting in increasing domestic silk production through the expansion of mulberry plantations in the wastelands it results that in all the states where the wastelands are targeted for mulberry expansion the low availability of freshwater resource will lead to and or will exacerbate water scarcity conditions in these areas specifically on an annual average the 40 of the potential mulberry plantations will be interested by an increase of water scarcity and the remaining ones will observe the emergence of water scarcity due to the additional pressure induced by the new plantations on the already stressed water resources these conditions of low availability and high demand of water might induce competition for water resources between staple food and cash mulberry for silk crops in places showing high rate of malnutrition the analyses shown in this paper highlight how economic development strategies require to put in place cost benefit investigations accounting for the natural resources availability and use as well as the environmental and social externalities associated to their use authors statement l r and m c r developed the idea underneath this work all authors performed the investigation data

272,one of the main challenges for india is increasing food security and promoting economic development using the domestic finite and already stressed natural resources in the last decades silk production has been booming in india in response to the 2025 silk self sufficiency goal set by the indian ministry of textile it is not clear to which extent mulberry morus alba used to feed silkworm in 70 of the total domestic silk production can be expanded in the wastelands identified by the indian government as suitable for moriculture without both endangering natural resources and causing competition for natural resources with the food sector this issue is here investigated by a assessing mulberry water consumption rain and irrigation in the plantations presently cultivated and in all the wastelands selected by the government for the expansion of moriculture as well b analyzing annual and sub annual water scarcity induced by mulberry plantations within the plantations c studying the potential competition for natural resources between food crops and mulberry to this end the dynamic spatially distributed crop water balance watneeds model has been used to analyze two different scenarios being the reference scenario considering the present climate and land cover and the silk expansion scenario combining present climate and the new mulberry plantations results for the reference scenario show mulberry expansion areas already suffering food insecurity and water scarcity in the dry period here the expansion of mulberry cultivation is shown to exacerbate water scarcity in pre monsoon months especially in the north eastern region affecting on a yearly scale eleven million people results also show expanding food production on wastelands rather than mulberry could be a viable solution for alleviating the burden of malnutrition keywords mulberry silk water resources economic development wasteland agricultural expansion 1 introduction silk is a natural protein fiber made by silkworms bombyx mori fed on plant leaves e g mulberry castor plants ghosh et al 2017 karthik et al 2015 nowadays about 110 000 metric tonnes mt of silk are being produced worldwide international sericultural commission 2020 silk is preferred to other fibers as a luxury material in the fashion industry especially in asia where it still holds an important role in ceremonial dresses datta and nanavaty 2005 the major producing country is china followed by india which has a long tradition in sericulture bhat and choure 2014 the indian textile sector represents 6 of the country gdp and it is the second source of employment after agriculture ministry of textile 2015 in particular sericulture has traditionally been an important remunerative economic sector providing employment especially to women who account for the 60 of the work force bukhari et al 2019 ganie et al 2012 mittal and dutta 2019 nowadays the silk sector in india gives employment to more than 7 million people mainly in rural areas ganie et al 2012 and it is continuously growing central silk board 2019a from 2000s to the present indian internal consumption of raw silk has sharply increased by about 60 while conversely imports have decreased by 60 central silk board 2019a united nations 2020 to cope with the additional demand silk production in the country has more than doubled in less than 20 years central silk board 2019a to date i e 2018 2019 domestic silk production has reached the amount of about 35 000 metric tonnes mt more than 25 000 mt of which are mulberry silk so increasing by 25 with respect to 2013 2014 mulberry silk production central silk board 2019a 2019b depending on the years mulberry silk production represents respectively the 90 in 2012 2013 and the 70 in 2018 2019 of total indian silk production bhat and choure 2014 central silk board 2019a following this trend mulberry harvested areas have seen a 20 increase since 2013 in the whole india central silk board 2019a however silk production has remained inadequate to meet domestic demand and achieve country self sufficiency handique et al 2016 with the aim of making india the world leader in silk production the indian government is willing to promote the silk sector with scaling up strategies among the textile industries central silk board 2017 rathore et al 2019 the objectives set by the vision policy of the indian ministry of textile ministry of textile 2015 are the yearly increase of 12 in textile production and on a broader extent the 20 growth in textile exports by 2025 to answer to the increasing demand of silk the future plan of central silk board of the indian ministry of textile central silk board 2017 has planned to increase mulberry trees harvesting in india in agreement with the vision policy of the indian ministry of textile the central silk board and the indian space research organization have detected suitable areas for mulberry horizontal expansion in wastelands using satellite data showing the potential to increase mulberry cultivation tenfold handique et al 2016 singh et al 2016 wasteland areas include mostly scrubs degraded forests shifting cultivation land and barren rocky areas dolr nrsc 2019a dolr nrsc 2019b overall wastelands cover in india about the 16 of the country total area garg et al 2011 and have already been targeted for potential agricultural expansion in india dolr nrsc 2019a dolr nrsc 2019b the attention paid by the indian government in converting those abandoned and marginal areas into profitable areas follows the lack of sufficient land resources to meet the needs e g food feed etc of the population dolr nrsc 2019a while the extent of potential suitable areas has been assessed by indian government silk and so mulberry expansion plans do not include the evaluation of the necessary resources water in particular for sustaining mulberry plants growth in those areas in fact the feasibility of the sericulture expansion plan is constrained not only by the availability of land but also by the availability of freshwater for plant growth mulberry has been estimated to have a cwr crop water requirement in india of about 16 000 m3 ha per year so often requiring irrigation astudillo et al 2014 central silk board 2020a rajaram and qadri 2014 the increase in silk production in fact might be limited by the high cwr of mulberry plantations and by the scarcity of water resources that chronically affects the majority of the country gupta and deshpande 2004 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 furtherly there is evidence that some states i e assam maharashtra manipur meghalaya nagaland orissa tripura tamil nadu and madhya pradesh where mulberry plantations have recently expanded are now experiencing increasing of water scarcity and food insecurity than in the past bhat and choure 2014 central silk board 2019a despite its high potential in boosting indian economy mulberry expansion could affect water availability therefore exacerbating water scarcity and competition for water between staple and cash crops in india more than 190 million people are still undernourished fao ifad unicef wfp who 2020 swaminathan et al 2019 and food supply is mainly contributed by domestic production due to policies promoting food self sufficiency since 1948 sarma 1978 swaminathan and bhavani 2013 yu et al 2015 india has always relied on self sufficiency in term of food production especially for staple crops e g wheat and rice faostat 2018 yu et al 2015 recent works davis et al 2018 kayatz et al 2019 rodell et al 2009 highlighted how cropping strategies proposed by the indian government have worsened water security conditions locally and in turn food security in the country due to failures in accounting for the high freshwater demand e g rice wheat systems those studies show the need of including in crop strategies planning also the water assessment to find not only the most profitable strategies but also the most sustainable ones chouchane et al 2020 damerau et al 2020 davis et al 2018 2017a 2017b with the aim to link objectives of economic development policies to environmental sustainability in this study we analyze the impacts of mulberry expansion in terms of natural resources use specifically land and water a similar approach has been used for studying the hydrological impacts of other water demanding cash crops such as rubber chiarelli et al 2020b chiarelli et al 2018 and oil palm rulli et al 2019 which rise in some cases issues of water and food security however from the best of our knowledge similar studies on silk production have not been carried out either for india or at the global scale in this paper we therefore analyze the hydrological effects of silk production in a country facing silk and staple food i e wheat and rice self sufficiency challenges while affected by natural resources shortages and food insecurity issues to this aim we firstly analyze the current situation of water resources availability in india and then we assess the variation induced by future mulberry horizontal expansion specifically we investigate the water footprint of mulberry fields using the spatially distributed water crop watneeds model chiarelli et al 2020a then we assess the effect of horizontal expansion of moriculture on water scarcity and we quantify the population affected by severe water scarcity condition targeted areas for mulberry expansion are located both in districts with tradition in sericulture i e andhra pradesh jammu and kashmir karnataka tamil nadu and west bengal and in non traditional ones e g madhya pradesh orissa uttar pradesh chhattisgarh and the north eastern region datta 2000 as reported by handique et al 2016 lastly we identified suitable areas for mulberry plantations where cultivation is environmentally sustainable under irrigated conditions i e areas where moriculture does not exacerbate water scarcity tradeoffs of moriculture expansion in term of missing food production are also being evaluated because the tenth five years plan of india released by the indian government planning commission 2002 reports that ngos have identified in wastelands an opportunity to increase food production for improving food security conditions especially among small size rural farmers 2 methods 2 1 green and blue water assessment we assessed the grown crops water requirement cwr subdivided in green gwr and blue water bwr requirements in the units of length that is volume per unit area associated to crops production under two different scenarios namely the baseline scenario that is a reference scenario considering the current land use and climate and the mulberry expansion scenario that is the scenario considering the additional areas selected by the government for mulberry expansion and the current climate hoekstra 2003 defines gwr as the water coming from precipitation stored in the soil and evapotranspired by plants while bwr as the water extracted from surface or groundwater resources and evapotranspired by plants to assess gwr and bwr we used the watneeds model chiarelli et al 2020a that is a dynamic agro hydrological spatially distributed model solving the vertical water balance here used at 5 arcminute grid resolution specifically in each cell i the daily change in soil moisture δs i t is a function of the effective precipitation p i t the actual evapotranspiration e t a i t the runoff r i t and the deep percolation d i t at the day t δ s i t δ t p i t e t a i t r i t d i t usually cwr gwr bwr are expressed in l namely millimeters allen et al 1998 chiarelli et al 2020a mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a siebert and döll 2010 to run the model precipitation p i t data were retrieved from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station version 2 0 chirps at 0 05 x 0 05 resolution funk et al 2015 two different rain periods have been considered a dry year i e 2000 and the average conditions from year 2010 to year 2016 year 2000 was selected because it is considered a peculiar dry year for india showing a rainfall rate 8 lower than the ones in long term climatological condition krishnan et al 2003 a drier season in pre monsoon months i e march and april and more intensive monsoon rains indian meteorological department 2017 ministry of earth science 2017 we also considered the average period between year 2010 and 2016 in order to take into account more recent climate kothawale and rajeevan 2017 krishnan et al 2003 and we analyzed the inter annual variation of the main parameters rain bw gw with respect to the average condition boxplots in figure s1 the actual evapotranspiration eta for each crop for both the two periods i e year 2000 and average 2010 16 is computed as e t a k s k c e t o where the reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated using the fao penmann monteith formulation allen et al 1998 at a resolution of 5 arcmin and input data from harris et al 2014 the crop coefficients kc were taken from siebert and döll 2010 while ks is the water stress coefficient depending on the daily soil moisture available to the plant allen et al 1998 for mulberry trees being perennial crops datta 2000 jain et al 2000 crop coefficient kc and growing periods length were averaged values for perennial crops taken from mekonnen and hoekstra 2011b mulberry planting and harvesting dates were chosen respectively as 1st of june and 31st of may as suggested by handique et al 2016 and singh et al 2016 lastly deep percolation d i t and runoff r i t were computed accordingly to chiarelli et al 2020a by using soil information from fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2012 while capillary rising water has not been accounted for chiarelli et al 2020a therefore an overestimation of water requirements may occur in case of capillary rise becoming significant e g fine soil in association to a high level of groundwater in not saturated soil crop water requirement cwr in the unit of l represents the amount of water needed to meet the water loss through evapotranspiration gwr was computed as the sum of daily actual evapotranspiration while bwr was computed as the difference between cwr and gwr then green water demand gwd blue water demand bwd and total water demand twd in the units of l3 for mulberry have been obtained by multiplying the gwr bwr and twr for the related harvested areas in each district some authors e g mahesh et al 2021 rajaram and qadri 2014 seenappa et al 2016 seenappa and devakumar 2015 emphasize that irrigation plays a significant role in the growth of mulberry trees in india and that these plants are often irrigated recently the silk plan of central silk board highlights the need to expand irrigation to meet mulberry water needs central silk board 2020a accordingly in our analysis we considered to apply fully irrigation on mulberry harvested areas so avoiding plants water stress condition thus we set equal to 1 the water stress coefficient ks for mulberry therefore ensuring the achievement of the maximum crop water yield the proposed methodology has been largely used for assessing the gwr bwr and agriculture sustainability chiarelli et al 2020b chiarelli et al 2018 rosa et al 2020 rosa et al 2018 as well as the input data used in our analysis have already been used in previous studies regarding india davis et al 2018 pandey et al 2021 prakash 2019 sonali and nagesh kumar 2016 in the baseline scenario for the study area we assessed gwr and bwr for the current land use including both croplands and all the other land uses e g forests shrubs grassland urban bare areas concerning croplands we considered rainfed and irrigated crop distribution maps at 5 arc minute portmann et al 2010 which include 23 main crops and 3 crop groups while maps of land uses have been retrieved from the global land cover map at 30 arc second global land cover 2003 the maps having spatial resolution other than 5 arc minute have been rescaled at 5 arc minute for assessing the gwr and bwr in mulberry expansion areas in each 5 arcminute cell we consider to replace the other land uses than croplands with the extent of the mulberry areas in that cell this procedure of cropland mulberry expansion has been carried out according with the hypothesis of field expansion handique et al 2016 2 3 mulberry suitable areas mulberry suitable areas on wastelands were gathered from the sericulture information linkages and knowledge system silks geodatabase handique et al 2016 singh et al 2016 fig 1 figure s2 these areas for silkworm feeding have been planned for sericulture expansion in 108 districts around india handique et al 2016 among these we considered in our analysis only those for which spatially distributed data were available on silks specifically mulberry expansion areas were available on a pixel scale ranging from about 0 001 to 0 002 and subdivided into marginally moderately or high suitable areas handique et al 2016 table s1 those maps have been obtained based on biophysical suitability considering landscape soil and climatic parameters i e drainage texture ph depth slope erosion temperature rainfall and minimal length of growing period showing that 14 out of total mulberry expansion areas selected by silks are highly suitable while 55 are marginally suitable and 31 are moderately suitable in our analysis we considered marginal to high suitable areas table s2 we also investigated the present land use in wastelands by overlapping mulberry suitable areas to the wasteland maps available at state level in bhuvan geodatabase online map bhuvan thematic services 2020 figure s3 2 4 raw silk water footprint green water footprint gwf blue water footprint bwf and total water footprint twf of raw silk l3 mass were computed as the ratio between the gwr and bwr calculated by the watneeds model and the mulberry raw silk yield hoekstra et al 2011 hoekstra and wiedmann 2014 specifically the analysis of gwr and bwr have been carried out at 5 arcminutes spatial resolution and then the results for mulberry have been averaged on harvested areas and aggregated at state level level for which data on raw silk yield have been made available by the central silk board central silk board 2015 central silk board 2016 bwf of raw silk has been calculated including only the bwr related to mulberry irrigation requirement since according to hogeboom and hoekstra 2017 it accounts for the 99 of the total bwf we noticed that non traditional silk producer states tend to have lower mulberry silk yields than traditional ones especially karnataka andhra pradesh tamil nadu west bengal therefore for water footprint calculations we used the proper current yields for traditional states while for not traditional silk producer states we used the average yield of traditional states as already stated we did that under the hypothesis of scaling up strategies for all the states interested in mulberry silk expansion especially non traditional ones ministry of textile 2015 we considered average yields and bwr and gwr data over the time period of analysis we also analyzed the interannual variation of bwf and gwf compared to average conditions for the states of karnataka andhra pradesh tamil nadu and west bengal boxplots in figure s4 2 5 impacts of mulberry expansion water scarcity population affected and food security previous information has been combined to analyze the hydrological impacts of mulberry expansion in particular water scarcity has been computed as the ratio between bwd and water availability for baseline scenario and for the scenario considering mulberry expansion according to the methodology defined by mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 at monthly scale and spatial resolution of 5 arcminutes in detail hydrological fluxes have been calculated for the 2 different scenarios through the watneeds model by accounting for agriculture consumptive water use data on domestic and industrial water use were taken from mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a and were kept constant in the 2 different scenarios flows direction were taken from lehner et al 2008 while environmental flows were set to 80 of runoff as in rosa et al 2018 population affected by water scarcity has been calculated considering the population living in the areas affected by water scarcity population data referred to the latest available year 2020 and the administrative boundaries were taken from worldpop 2018 and gadm 2018 respectively thus the tradeoffs of moriculture expansion in terms of potential missing food production were assessed both by evaluating the amount of food that could be produced if the mulberry expansion areas were grown with food crops so reducing the burden of malnutrition and or decreasing food imports specifically we considered food crops expansion in the areas previously selected for mulberry proportional to the current distribution of the main staple crops grown in each state portmann et al 2010 therefore calculating the kilocalories associated to each crop we found the additional calories associated to the cultivation with food crops in the expansion areas the crop yields and kilocalories conversion tables used in our analysis were taken from monfreda et al 2008 and d odorico et al 2014 respectively 2 6 sensitivity analysis we performed the sensitivity analysis of et0 to changes of dew temperature minimum and maximum temperature cloud cover wind speed at 2 m above surface daily temperature data were taken from cpc noaa oar esrl psl 2021 the other input data i e dew temperature cloud cover wind were retrieved from the agera5 dataset copernicus climate change service 2020 produced by the copernicus climate change service through pre processing of the era5 dataset hersbach et al 2020 we computed et0 using the penman monteith equation from allen et al 1998 and considering the top ten indian states having the largest extent of suitable areas for mulberry production et0 has been evaluated in the centroid of each state of analysis sensitivity analysis has been run considering a variation in each input variable of 20 with a 5 interval we observed negligible sensitivity of et0 to the variation in the parameters on a yearly scale table s3 figure s5 for example in case of a 10 variation in input parameters the respective changes in et0 are negligible i e lower than 10 figure s5 to be noted cwr variations are proportional to changes in et0 through the crop parameters kc however in order to check how bwr and gwr respond to changes in et0 we also performed a sensitivity analysis on watneeds input et0 considering variations of 10 with a 2 5 interval et0 ranges used in our sensitivity analysis are consistent with the overall trend observed in table s3 furtherly daily et0 increases by about 10 in case of an average temperature rise of 3 7 c by the end of the century i e business as usual scenario ipcc 2013 milly and dunne 2016 thus confirming our assumptions to be noted bwr and gwr changes are proportional to bwf and gwf through the yield we observed negligible variations in average bwf and gwf for most states e g assam meghalaya mizoram tables s4 s5 however changes in bwf are higher for states having less rainfall throughout the year e g karnataka telangana tables s4 s5 similarly we made the sensitivity analysis of water scarcity with respect to changes in bw required by mulberry plant the 10 increase in mulberry bwd gave an increase in the water scarcity index higher than 10 in less than 6 of the total mulberry area conversely decreasing mulberry bwd by 10 gave a decrease in water scarcity lower than 10 in less than 5 of the mulberry area 3 results 3 1 consumptive water use and footprint we found crop water requirement cwr of mulberry ranging from 900 mm to 1600 mm across india in the reference time period 2010 2016 table 1 the states of arunachal pradesh and telangana present the lowest 870 mm and the highest 1500 mm values of mulberry cwr respectively table 1 in the mulberry expansion scenario twd in the whole india for mulberry production is around 38 km3 more than 19 km3 of which are bwd thus only about 50 of the total cwr can be met by gwr therefore it is apparent that irrigation is required in all of the states analyzed accordingly with rajaram and qadri 2014 that pointed out that rainfall gwr alone is usually not sufficient in tamil nadu for providing the total amount of water required by mulberry cultivation the highest bwr more than 1000 mm is needed in karnataka while arunachal pradesh has the lowest request about 100 mm table 1 yearly bwr during the dry year 2000 is about 5 higher both in andhra pradesh and in several states without tradition in mulberry silk production e g madhya pradesh chhattisgarh tables s6 s7 surprisingly traditional silk producer states tend to have higher bwr than non traditional states in fact we noticed that the bwr and bwf is higher in central and south india especially in traditional districts e g karnataka andhra pradesh and lower in the north eastern region table table 3 concerning all the states selected for mulberry cultivation expansion the highest twd for sustaining mulberry production is found in madhya pradesh and mizoram corresponding to 5 8 and 5 7 km3 respectively table 2 even though mizoram has the largest mulberry expansion areas our results show the state having the lowest bwd table 2 which is 1 8 km3 of blue water out of 5 7 km3 of twd the highest bwd is found in madhya pradesh about 3 8 km3 table 2 it is notable that the amount of bwd in some of the analyzed states is already beyond their freshwater resources availability given the widespread water scarcity and therefore they are already doing an unsustainable water consumption as shown in fig 2 and according with hoekstra et al 2012 kumar et al 2005 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 table 2 in terms of bwf results show that considering the time period from 2010 to 2016 karnataka tamil nadu and andhra pradesh present respectively 95 71 and 45 m3 kg of bwf for raw silk comparable with the estimated value of 54 m3 kg for these states astudillo et al 2014 table 3 our silk twf values are also similar to the values reported for malawi ranging from 50 to around 80 m3 kg according to the different irrigation systems hogeboom and hoekstra 2017 3 2 water scarcity in the baseline scenario the north eastern region ner i e arunachal pradesh assam manipur mizoram meghalaya nagaland tripura shows mean yearly water availability higher than the rest of india as stated also by roy and shil 2015 fig 2 a the monthly scale water scarcity analysis gives ner region experiencing water scarcity in 4 months per year i e december january february march the rest of india i e west north south and center states except for chhattisgarh shows water scarcity conditions at both yearly and monthly scales as reported in figure s5 and figure s7 for the year 2000 and the 2010 2016 period figure s5 figure s7 water scarcity results for the baseline scenario fig 2 a are consistent with the ones reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 fig 3 results for the mulberry expansion scenario show the increase of moriculture able to exacerbate water scarcity conditions on a monthly and yearly scale in the areas already i e baseline scenario affected by water scarcity i e areas in the state of kerala tamil nadu west bengal karnataka uttar pradesh in addition areas in the north eastern region ner i e the state of mizoram meghalaya assam manipur tripura and the eastern region er i e orissa and chhattisgarh not being affected by water scarcity at yearly scale in the baseline scenario show in the expansion scenario water scarcity in detail on monthly scale water scarcity in the ner is exacerbated with respect to the baseline in pre monsoon months i e december january february march already suffering of water scarcity and it is also occurring in months not previously affected i e april may and november figure s6 s7 s8 s9 more in detail in the mulberry scenario the 78 and 98 of total mulberry expansion areas fall under water scarcity conditions in april in ner and in mizoram state respectively in particular mizoram shows bwd increase from 0 02 km3 to 1 7 km3 per year broadly on a country scale we assess that an additional 40 of total mulberry suitable expansion areas will experience yearly scale water scarcity to be noted the greatest part of suitable areas for mulberry expansion currently lies on scrublands and degraded forests figure s3 lastly findings on potential competition for freshwater between food crops and mulberry during the periods of water scarcity show ner water scarcity in april and november due to mulberry horizontal expansion could affect negatively figure s6h s7d s8h s9d s6v s7k s8v s9k rabi season crops i e wheat pulses barley inducing a decrease in water availability those crops in fact are usually sowed in november december and harvested in april may directorate of economics and statistics 2020 moreover in the central part of india i e chhattisghar orissa there is a worsening of water scarcity in mulberry expansion scenario in june so potentially affecting kharif crops i e rice maize soybean sorghum figure s6l s7f s8l s9f these crops in fact are sowed during the monsoon period in june july and harvested at the end of the rains season in october directorate of economics and statistics 2020 3 3 population affected by water scarcity horizontal mulberry expansion can cause additional yearly water scarcity to more than 11 million people table 4 the highest number of affected people is found in assam having more than 5 million people exposed to water scarcity among the total 11 million indian people affected on average around 70 72 and 67 respectively in 2000 and 2010 2016 is in ner the most critical month is april presenting the highest number of people affected by water scarcity that is calculated in more than 10 million people on the contrary the month with the lowest population exposure to water scarcity is august falling in the monsoon period table s8 s9 3 4 food availability our results show lower blue water requirement of staple food crops than mulberry in mulberry expansion areas table 1 the amount of food that could be obtained from the cultivation of mulberry wastelands has been quantified in kilocalories and corresponds on average to 370 kcal cap day when considering the local population living in the states targeted for mulberry expansion while at country scale food increase is negligible table 4 a more detailed analysis for the population at state level proves that the highest increase in calories is found in mizoram more than 5000 kcal cap day table 4 other ner states e g manipur tripura see their food availability increase at around 1000 kcal cap day when we refer to state wise population on mulberry expansion areas considering the total state population however their food availability is halved table 4 overall the most positively affected states as said previously are the ones in the north eastern region e g manipur mizoram tripura that have about 20 prevalence of child underweight swaminathan et al 2019 compared to mulberry cultivation in the horizontal expansion scenario growing food crops in the targeted wastelands would allow for an overall saving of approximatively 9 km3 of blue water resulting in a 47 decrease in water demand in wastelands areas 4 discussion to boost economic development the restoration of present degraded land i e wastelands through sustainable agricultural expansion is promoted by the indian government dolr nrsc 2019a specifically a possible use of these lands has been identified by the central silk board in the expansion of mulberry plantations to reach the target of 12 annual growth rate in textile production so creating employment for 35 million people by 2025 central silk board 2019a ministry of textile 2015 we analyzed the sustainable environmental feasibility of this indian government plan in terms of water resources needed to produce mulberry silk in those wastelands therefore quantifying the consequent impacts on water resources and food production agricultural expansion on wastelands might impact ecosystems services availability tilman 1999 through the increase in the pressure on natural resources tilman et al 2001 the underestimation of the impacts on the environment induced by socioeconomic development strategies might compromise or nullify the intended benefits in the short or long term as happened with the self sufficiency policy in terms of food production in india davis et al 2018 mulberry expansion potential in wastelands has been considered enormous given the availability of over 3 million hectares of suitable land allowing up to 1000 increase of currently mulberry harvested areas central silk board 2019a handique et al 2016 however mulberry being a water intensive perennial crop is able to increase pressure on water resources our study shows that the expansion of mulberry plantations for silk production will result in an additional 38 km3 of consumptive water use half of which is required by irrigation alone thus potentially competing with other uses and local food security we acknowledge that our results have been obtained under the hypothesis of fully irrigation in order to completely meet the crop water requirements avoiding any stress condition while different types of irrigation strategies can be used i e deficit irrigation however rajaram and qadri 2014 report 70 and 50 deficit irrigation of mulberry in india allows significant water savings through a reduction in consumptive water use while decreasing crop yields by about 10 and 30 respectively and thus in some cases boosting water productivity therefore the economic feasibility of mulberry expansion could involve tradeoffs on whether it is preferable to save water or to maximize the overall silk production while we expected that mulberry expansion areas will be equipped with irrigation systems and then irrigated in order to boost productivity central silk board 2020a 2017 ministry of textile 2015 presently those lands are not equipped for irrigation and information on the indian government irrigation plans is not available however our results show that irrigation is needed not only to boost production but sometimes for the plant survival in almost all the districts it has to be noted in case of high water demand and low water availability mulberry irrigation might cause and or exacerbate water stress condition diverging water from other uses e g food production domestic use industrial use etc as well highlighted by some authors e g chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 rodell et al 2009 in india any use of groundwater for irrigation could aggravate the already critical situation resulting from the historical food self sufficient policies this is confirmed by our analyses which found that water scarcity increases year round in all states that will experience mulberry expansion except for very small areas in arunachal pradesh also showing the greatest water deficit occurs in conjunction with the growing season of rabi and kharif crops so affecting the availability of freshwater for such staple crops so in turn food production and availability the competition for water between fiber namely silk and food sectors has not to be overlooked in a country like india already using the majority of its renewable water resources and that presents nearly one child out of two affected by malnutrition kumar et al 2005 mall et al 2006 narayan et al 2019 swaminathan et al 2019 unicef who the world bank 2019 to be noted that projected rise in population and food demands in india could lead the indian government to increase domestic food production through the cultivation of these marginal areas although low crops yields are expected there dolr nrsc 2019a planning commission 2002 in this case additional food would be produced so increasing food availability and supply to local population while saving water with respect to the cultivation of mulberry being moriculture more water demanding than staple crops and also increasing the resilience of the food system seekell et al 2017 however it could be argued that economic growth obtained thanks to silk production could help to increase food access and to decrease poverty govereh and jayne 2003 nevertheless silk price volatility and external shocks holtemöller and mallick 2016 can influence silk market and so in turn households income and the consequent access to food raw silk prices have had ups and downs in the past years central silk board 2019c in particular during current covid 19 outbreak raw silk prices have decreased by 30 since march 2020 central silk board 2020b about the agricultural yields in the wastelands currently not cropped we assign the yield observed for the same crop in the district where the wasteland is located currently most areas suitable for mulberry are located in degraded forests and scrubs zones on one hand the effective productivity of these lands could be overestimated since different sources reported how degraded lands could yield less than prime farmlands dauber et al 2012 rulli et al 2013 on the other restored degraded lands could see their yield increase in case of effective restoration practices i e water and soil management adeleke et al 2021 hornick and parr 1987 mishra and sharma 2003 rosso et al 2007 beside water also soil suitability affects crop yield davis et al 2017 d odorico et al 2018 among the total mulberry expansion areas in wastelands just 14 are highly suitable and mostly located in ner to be noted marginally suitable areas are widespread throughout mulberry expansion areas and account for more than 55 meaning that the total increase in silk production could be less than expected in addition future climate changes i e drought that predict a further decrease in water availability thus aggravating the competition for natural resources and water in particular should be taken into account as factors affecting agricultural yields bollasina et al 2011 sharma and mujumdar 2017 vermeulen et al 2012 5 conclusion economic development strategies that require natural resources to achieve their goals should consider the availability of such natural resources and the impacts associated with their use in the event that the expansion of agriculture is considered to be instrumental for the economic development it is crucial to evaluate the amount of fresh water needed its availability in the short and long term as well as the water scarcity associated with its use in this paper we have analyzed the hydrological impacts of the indian government economic development strategy consisting in increasing domestic silk production through the expansion of mulberry plantations in the wastelands it results that in all the states where the wastelands are targeted for mulberry expansion the low availability of freshwater resource will lead to and or will exacerbate water scarcity conditions in these areas specifically on an annual average the 40 of the potential mulberry plantations will be interested by an increase of water scarcity and the remaining ones will observe the emergence of water scarcity due to the additional pressure induced by the new plantations on the already stressed water resources these conditions of low availability and high demand of water might induce competition for water resources between staple food and cash mulberry for silk crops in places showing high rate of malnutrition the analyses shown in this paper highlight how economic development strategies require to put in place cost benefit investigations accounting for the natural resources availability and use as well as the environmental and social externalities associated to their use authors statement l r and m c r developed the idea underneath this work all authors performed the investigation data

273,hydraulic tomography is a state of the art method for inferring hydraulic conductivity fields using head data we employed geostatistical inversion using synthetically generated head and flux data individually and jointly in a steady state experiment we designed 96 inversion scenarios to better understand the relative merits of each data type for the typical case of a small number of observation points we find that flux data provide a better resolved hydraulic conductivity field compared to head data when considering data with similar signal to noise ratios this finding is further confirmed by a resolution analysis when considering a high number of observation points the estimated fields are of similar quality regardless of the data type in terms of borehole boundary conditions the best setting for flux and head data are constant head and constant rate respectively while joint inversion results are insensitive to the borehole boundary type when considering the same number of observations the joint inversion of head and flux data does not offer advantages over individual inversions when considering the same number of observation points and hence twice as many observations the joint inversion performs better than individual inversions the findings of this paper are useful for future planning and design of hydraulic tomography tests comprising flux and head data keywords hydraulic tomography groundwater flux geostatistical inversion principal component geostatistical analysis pcga resolution analysis 1 introduction knowledge of hydraulic conductivity distributions is essential for the management of water resources liu et al 2020 solute transport predictions yeh 1992 jiménez 2015 and designing remediation of contaminated sites fakhreddine et al 2016 a variety of geophysical kowalsky et al 2004 revil et al 2012 slater 2007 and hydraulic methods brauchler et al 2003 yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 including tracer based measurements doro et al 2015 jiménez et al 2016 somogyvári and bayer 2017 have been developed and employed for characterizing hydraulic properties lochbühler et al 2013 in hydraulic flow methods head data responses to hydraulic perturbations pumping tidal fluctuation etc are measured at different locations across the aquifer the recorded head data are then used to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity k and storativity a distinct advantage of hydraulic methods for imaging purposes is that the hydraulic response of an aquifer is directly related to its hydraulic parameters described by flow equations fakhreddine et al 2016 while in most geophysical methods the hydraulic properties are indirect and inferred from other estimated physical properties thereby requiring petrophysical relationships we define y log10 k and assume that it can be described by a stationary multivariate gaussian distribution in other words y is the log10 based hydraulic conductivity field hydraulic tomography is one type of hydraulic method and has been the subject of many theoretical and numerical studies fienen et al 2008 luo et al 2020 yeh and liu 2000 zha et al 2018 zhu and yeh 2005 laboratory experiments illman et al 2008 w a 2010 liu et al 2002 2007 yin and illman 2009 zhao et al 2016 and field studies berg and illman 2015 s j 2013 s j 2011 bohling et al 2007 brauchler et al 2013 r 2011 r 2010 2003 cardiff et al 2009 m 2013 cardiff and barrash 2011 fischer et al 2017 gottlieb and dietrich 1995 huang et al 2011 klepikova et al 2013 kuhlman et al 2008 paradis et al 2016 2015 sun et al 2013 tosaka et al 1993 however hydraulic tomography based on head data alone has limitations one limitation is inherent to the underlying potential field physics as measured head data are spatially averaged due to the diffusive nature of pressure disturbances created during the test bohling and butler jr 2010 this averaging results in tomographic estimates displaying a high degree of smoothing compared to the actual aquifer property fields this smearing may lead to degraded predictions for transport problems it should be noted that the smoothing would only appear in a single regularized solution however if one uses stochastic methods one should be able to represent the stochastic nature of the underlying actual aquifer property fields furthermore some authors have included geological data as a priori information to overcome this issue luo et al 2017 zha et al 2017 zhao and illman 2018 another limitation appears in applying hydraulic tomography in high conductivity aquifers as hydraulic tests lead to small drawdown values implying high relative uncertainty of the measured head perturbations and correspondingly low signal to noise ratio data adding other types of non redundant data in hydraulic tomography can help to better image the subsurface mao et al 2013 yeh et al 2015 in this regard zha et al 2014 demonstrated the usefulness of flux data specific discharge for hydraulic tomography in a 2d synthetic fractured media mimicking a field site in mizunami japan estimated mean variance and correlation length of the y field were applied as prior information to the inversion model using the cross correlation approach zha et al 2014 they showed that head and flux contribute differently to the y field reconstruction they claimed that inversion of head data collected with known pumping rate can result in representative y field estimates even if the initial guess is incorrect for flux data they find that the final y field estimate is dependent on the initial guess their synthetic work showed that using flux data with head data improves the estimation of y field values and the fracture distribution in another study tso et al 2016 performed numerical test studies on a 3d model mimicking the aquifer at the north campus research site in waterloo canada they simulated pumping in this porous aquifer and measured head data and flux data at different locations then head and flux data were subjected to inversion considering different types of prior information they showed that using flux data jointly with head data can enhance hydraulic conductivity estimates furthermore they found out that the estimated hydraulic conductivity field is less affected by an inadequate prior model when non redundant flux data are used to supplement the head data until recently measurements of groundwater fluxes in the field were limited to local and time consuming measurements the most popular technique for quantifying groundwater flux in the field was based on dilution tests drost et al 1968 jamin et al 2015 schneider et al 2019 where the dilution of an injected tracer inside a screened borehole or within packers is used to estimate the horizontal groundwater flux other approaches such as the colloidal borescope kearl 1997 the point velocity probe labaky et al 2007 or the in situ permeable flow sensor ballard et al 1996 can also measure the horizontal groundwater flux a comprehensive review of the groundwater velocity measurement approaches is provided by devlin 2020 nevertheless boreholes disturb the flow field and affect the measurements hence the measured values may not represent the real flux values moreover these methods are in general limited to local measurements and do not provide in most cases the spatial variability of groundwater fluxes the recent advent of fiber optic distributed temperature sensors fo dts has led to new possibilities for measuring groundwater discharge with unprecedented spatial resolution des tombe et al 2019 simon et al 2021 del val et al 2021 fo dts is a distributed sensor type that allows measurements of temperature all along the fiber optic cable fo dts can be employed in both passive and active modes in passive mode the temperature of the fiber optic is measured without any external forcing while in active mode a heat source is added to the fiber optic cable by using a heating element located very close to the fiber optic cable or by using a heating fiber optic cable active dts have been developed for instance for measuring borehole flows read et al 2014 wind speed sayde et al 2015 and for characterizing groundwater fluxes in fractured media maldaner et al 2019 recently it has also been used for measuring groundwater discharge in sedimentary aquifers the fo cable typically being installed by the direct push method bakker et al 2015 des tombe et al 2019 or along boreholes del val et al 2021 in this case the buried cable is in direct contact with the ground with minimum subsurface perturbations simon et al 2021 showed that active dts can be used for measuring both sediment thermal conductivities and groundwater fluxes on a large range of values with excellent accuracy with errors of less than 10 for groundwater flux in the range of 10 5 to 10 3 m s the principle of such an experiment fig 1 is to monitor the temperature evolution with time which depends on the surrounding area s thermal properties and also groundwater fluxes that limits the temperature rise typically the slope of the temperature rise in the conduction regime with time in logarithmic scale is inversely proportional to thermal conductivity while the greater the groundwater fluxes the lower the temperature at stabilization the temperature evolution with time may be easily interpreted to estimate groundwater fluxes through an analytical solution or by using a graphical analysis simon et al 2021 the application of active fo dts for flux measurements is currently limited to shallow and unconsolidated aquifers due to limitations in deployment by the direct push method new advances in distributed sensing of local groundwater flux make it an appealing data source for independent inversion or joint inversion with hydraulic head this present study assumes that groundwater fluxes can be inferred from such above mentioned techniques at a prescribed spatial resolution and accuracy it is worth mentioning that measuring head data is more accurate and easier than flux data however active fo dts and new developments in the data analysis provide promising result for measurement of the flux along fo cables here we limit ourselves to a 2 d study assuming constant groundwater flux in depth using a geostatistical hydraulic tomography approach we then address the benefits and drawbacks of using either head or flux data individually or jointly more specifically we address the following questions 1 for an equal number and locations of flux and head data which data type leads to the best reconstruction of hydraulic conductivity 2 how does the number of observations affect the inversion results 3 how does inversion performance for the different data types vary with the hydraulic conductivity field variance the paper is structured into six sections section 2 presents the geostatistical inversion method and the forward model employed in section 3 we describe the hydraulic conductivity test model used for our analysis in sections 4 and 5 we present and discuss the main results respectively and section 6 concludes the paper 2 methods the principal component geostatistical approach pcga is a computationally efficient geostatistical inversion method lee and kitanidis 2014 pcga uses the main principal components of the prior model covariance matrix for model parameterization and corresponding estimates of the jacobian sensitivity matrix the resulting model reduction from a model of many gridded elements to a lower number of retained principal components leads to smaller matrices to invert and fewer sensitivities to estimate implying less computational costs than full inversions this method has been employed extensively in recent years fakhreddine et al 2016 fischer et al 2017 kang et al 2017 lee et al 2018 soueid ahmed et al 2016 in this study we use pcga combined with the matlab reservoir simulation toolbox mrst that simulates fluid flow in porous media forward model to perform inversion of head and flux data 2 1 inverse model inferring properties of subsurface media storage hydraulic conductivity from error contaminated and sparse observed data head data flux data etc is an inverse problem and can be formulated as follow 1 d f m where d f m and ƞ refer to measured data forward model model parameters and errors respectively the forward model refers here to a non linear operator solving a set of differential equations numerically to describe the relationship between model parameters and data when considering the joint inversion of two different data type d 1 and d 2 the formulation is as follow 2 d 1 d 2 f m η 1 η 2 from a mathematical point of view the inverse problem is often ill posed and the solution is non unique implying that additional information e g a prior model is required to obtain unique and physically meaningful results the prior model inferred based on the available information about the subsurface media in this work the same prior model is used throughout to avoid the effect of the prior model on the comparisons of final results here the subsurface is described as a multi gaussian stationary field with known statistical properties and a superimposed deterministic trend in the presence of a multivariate gaussian prior model and error distribution it is common to formulate the inverse problem in terms of an exploration of the maximum a posteriori map estimate and its variance in such a setting the solution of the inverse problem is obtained by maximizing a posterior probability density function maximizing the term in bracket expressed by using bayes theorem as follow 3 π p o s t m d exp 1 2 f m d c d 1 f m d 1 2 m m prior c m 1

lee and kitandis 2014 proposed the principal component geostatistical approach pcga which uses a low rank approximation of the prior covariance via principal component analysis and avoids forming the jacobian explicitly for products of the jacobian matrix and eigenvalues eqs 7 and 8 by using a finite difference approximation eq 9 this results in a faster inversion process of high accuracy provided that an adequate number of principal components are retained the terms that are used for geostatistical inversion in eq 5 are approximated through the p largest principal components as follow 6 c m c

represents the j th diagonal entry of the model covariance matrix and jx j is the j th column of the product jx in this work levenberg marquardt algorithm by introducing a multiplier to the error matrix for dampening is used to reduce the distance between simulation and observation once the model parameters are determined it is desirable to perform a resolution analysis by obtaining the resolution matrix r which can be seen as a low pass filter that maps the true model parameters to the estimated model parameters e g alumbaugh and newman 2000 each model parameter during the inversion is estimated from the averaging of other model parameters adjacent to the one of interest the components of r can be interpreted as weights each row in the resolution matrix of the average of true model parameters for estimating each model parameter day lewis et al 2005 the ideal resolution matrix would be an identity matrix that would imply that all model parameters are resolved perfectly the deviation of the diagonal element from the identity matrix reveals the degree of averaging and smoothness thus plotting diagonal elements of the resolution matrix in their corresponding blocks is indicative of the degree of smoothness the diagonal elements of the resolution matrix eq 11 inform the extent to which each estimated parameter is resolved independently the resolution matrix r is obtained by eq 12 which requires recovering the jacobian matrix j r from the previously calculated product eq 7 and inverse of low rank approximation of the covariance matrix c m p as shown in eq 13

the grid cells while j is the jacobian matrix calculated directly for every principal component 2 2 forward model the incompressible fluid flow module of mrst lie 2019 was used to simulate steady state groundwater flow it is used to calculate head and flux values at different points across a confined aquifer starting from the mass conservation law on a control volume introducing the darcy law assuming incompressible fluid flow and steady state condition the final form of the equation reads 14 k w h w q w subjected to the following constant head boundary conditions across external boundaries 15 h h d for w γ a here w x y z k l t h l and q l t represent the hydraulic conductivity head and fluid source or sink inflow or outflow of fluid per volume at certain locations respectively гa represents dirichlet boundaries the above equations are solved numerically to calculate the head values at grid points across the aquifer the mrst uses the two point flux approximation scheme lie 2019 to calculate the darcy flux in each grid block starting from mass conservation introducing the darcy equation to the flux exchange at the face of a cell with its neighboring cells and imposing continuity of fluxes across all faces of a cell the flux in each face for instance in the x direction is calculated by 16 δ x c e l l k c e l l δ x n e i g h b o u r k n e i g h b o u r 1 h c e l l h n e i g h b o u r v f a c e here x l is the length of the grid and v face l t is the fluid flux this equation is solved for all other faces to obtain the flux in all faces the value of the flux attributed to each cell is the euclidean norm of flux in all faces 3 numerical experiments 3 1 setup of the synthetic test case to assess the information content of hydraulic head and groundwater flux data for the reconstruction of heterogeneous aquifers a stationary multi gaussian log hydraulic conductivity field with constant storativity is generated using the fast circulant embedding technique resulting in the field shown in fig 2 in this study we consider steady state hydraulic tomography in which storativity does not play a role in simulated head or flux data and can be considered as a constant value the generated aquifer is 550 m in length 550 m in width and 5 m in depth the aquifer is discretized into 110 110 1 in x y z directions and corresponding block sizes are 5 m 5 m 5 m respectively the aquifer is assumed to have one layer and the log hydraulic conductivity field has a multi gaussian distribution the area of interest is chosen in the middle of the aquifer away from the boundaries to reduce the boundaries effect on the inversion all boundaries are set to a constant head equal to 350 m the correlation length used for generating the y field is 75 m and 45 m for x and y directions respectively the same field same heterogeneity structure with different variances of 0 5 1 2 and 4 are generated to assess the effect of variance and number of observations on the inversion results the mean ymean is 3 57 for all cases but the y fields variance and ranges are different for different experiments this range of hydraulic conductivity is chosen to have measurable and realistic groundwater flux and head responses both in real and synthetic aquifers we use a five spot setup with a central borehole p1 and four boreholes p2 p3 p4 and p5 on the corners of the area of interest bounded by white dashed lines in fig 2 other monitoring points are also considered between the boreholes as shown by asterisk symbols the aquifer is subjected to a series of pumping experiments in each borehole the five boreholes are pumped sequentially one at each time and head flux data are acquired in other boreholes and observation points two different boundary conditions in the borehole namely constant rate and constant head are considered when simulating pumping in one borehole the head and flux values are recorded in other boreholes and monitoring points the acquired flux and head data are noise contaminated before being used to estimate the y field 3 2 hydraulic tomography using head and flux data our numerical inversion experiments aim to compare the relative merits of each data type and analyze how borehole boundary conditions constant head or constant rate the variance of the y field and the number of observations affect the inversion results the observational data are generated using the reference hydraulic conductivity field and a normally distributed and independent error is added to the observations the standard deviations of these errors are different in all cases the errors standard deviations were chosen to be in a realistic range while ensuring the same initial signal to noise ratio of 38 for all cases defined by running the code using y mean the resulting measurement errors range from 0 05 to 0 013 m for the head and 0 055 to 0 01 m day for the flux the relation between values of groundwater flux and measurement uncertainty is provided by simon et al 2021 this relation was used to define a reasonable range of the noise model it should be noted that the uncertainty depends highly on the range of flux measurements and the duration of the active dts experiments typically for a relatively large range of values the accuracy is very good but for very high or very low flows values uncertainty is much greater simon et al 2021 in this work we assume that data quality in terms of signal to noise ratio is the same for both head and flux data pcga with previously mentioned geostatistical parameters variance and correlation length are used for the inversion increasing in the dimension of the problem results in massive computational needs considering the available computational methods one may use the full covariance matrix but if it is not possible a sufficient number of components must be chosen to ensure that most of the heterogeneity features are captured the truncation order p rank of the prior covariance matrix is chosen as 400 out of 12 100 based on the recommendation by lee et al 2016 the truncation order p which results in the relative eigenvalue error below 0 01 would be sufficient to capture most of the covariance matrix structure the relative eigenvalue error is defined as the ratio of first to p 1 th eigenvalue we have chosen p more conservatively for the y field with variance 4 the first eigenvalue is 1411 47 while the 401st eigenvalue is 0 047 giving the ratio of 3 25 10 5 the inversion starts with a constant value of y mean and continues until the root mean square error between observed and simulated measurement normalized with the error standard deviation weighted root mean square error defined in eq 15 reaches a value close to one 17 wrmse 1 n 1 n d f m estimate 2 σ 2 here n is the number of observations and σ is the absolute value of the error s standard deviation if no convergence is obtained the inversion ends after 10 iterations 3 2 1 boundary condition at the pumping borehole the steady state hydraulic tomography is simulated considering two different borehole boundary conditions constant rate the borehole is being pumped with constant flow rate and constant head the head in the borehole is kept constant note that the external boundary conditions do not change and are kept fixed as an example the pumping rates for the field case with variance 4 y field variance are 2400 4000 1750 5000 and 3800 m3 day for p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 respectively the equivalent constant head borehole boundary conditions are 324 340 300 329 and 336 m for p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 respectively the inversion is performed on the whole domain but results are shown for the area of interest 3 2 2 variance of y field and number of observation points the effect of the y field y log10 k variance is investigated by considering four different variances 0 5 1 2 and 4 furthermore a different number of observation points are used to assess their impact on the final inversion results the observation points are distributed symmetrically in the aquifer the minimum number of observation points considered is the number of boreholes 4 observation points and the maximum are the boreholes and the observation points shown by asterisks in fig 2 32 observation points we distinguish between the number of observations and the number of observation points for head and flux data the number of observation points and number of observations are the same for joint inversion the number of observations is twice the number of observation points 3 3 performance metrics to evaluate each data type s performance in estimating y we use the frobenius norm and scatter plots of estimated versus reference y for each case the frobenius norm for the vector of difference between the reference y and estimated y is 18 nor m fr 1 n y reference y estimated 2 furthermore the correlation coefficient between reference y and estimated y values and their corresponding slope lines are calculated we stress that the comparison is based on the log of the hydraulic conductivity values and not the hydraulic conductivity itself thereby avoiding emphasizing large hydraulic conductivity values 4 results 4 1 inversion of head data first the head data are individually inverted the results are presented for 4 observation points only the observations in the boreholes 8 16 and 32 observation points for each case two different borehole boundary conditions are considered constant rate and constant head fig 3 shows the estimated y field with a variance of 4 and table 1 represents the performance metrics for all cases we find that changing the borehole boundary condition from constant rate to constant head deteriorates the y field estimation this is quantified by the fact that the frobenius norm table 1 increases from 68 4 to 85 5 48 27 to 75 15 30 4 to 61 9 and 23 47 to 54 90 for 4 8 16 and 32 observation points respectively comparing figs 3 a to 3 h with the reference y field fig 3 i also show that cases with constant rate boundary conditions is visually closer to the reference y field the use of constant head borehole boundary condition results in an underestimation of y field values and the mean value of y field for instance in the case of 4 observation points the mean value of the estimated y field is around 4 for constant head boundary condition while it is 3 45 for constant rate boundary condition the mean value of the reference y field is 3 57 adding more observations leads to better results in terms of how close the estimated y field is to the reference y field as judged by the frobenius norm the correlation coefficient and the slope of the 1 1 line when estimated y field is to the reference y field are plotted against each other this is reflected in the improvement of the correlation coefficient from 0 27 to 0 94 for constant rate borehole boundary condition and from 0 49 to 0 93 for constant head boundary condition when adding observation points associated increases in the slopes from 0 13 to 0 95 and from 0 32 to 0 93 for constant rate and constant head boundary conditions further underline the previous statement as expected the standard deviations of the posterior covariance matrix fig 4 decrease as the number of observations increase we also see that for the cases involving 8 fig 4 c and 16 fig 4 e observation points with constant rate bc have lower uncertainties than the corresponding number of observations figs 4 d and 4 f with constant head bc this is consistent with the previous statement of proper bc for head data 4 2 inversion of flux data we now consider the results obtained by individual inversions of flux data for a y field variance of 4 fig 5 a to h show the y field estimates for 4 8 16 and 32 observation points subjected to constant rate and constant head borehole boundary conditions table 2 provides the corresponding performance metrics contrary to head data we find that constant head boundary conditions provide a better y field estimate when considering flux data the better performance of the constant head with respect to constant rate boundary condition is seen for instance by comparing the values of the frobenius norm given in table 2 for the case of 4 8 16 and 32 observation points the frobenius norm decreases from 81 2 to 64 53 65 61 to 47 7 62 2 to 44 7 and from 50 51 to 32 03 respectively using constant rate boundary condition for the flux data results in an underestimation of the y field mean considering the case with 4 observation points the estimated y field s mean value with the constant rate boundary condition is around 4 while it is around 3 4 for the constant head boundary condition comparing the values of frobenius norm for the head and flux data given in table 1 and table 2 reveals that for a small number of observations 4 observation points using flux data with constant head boundary condition gives a better y field estimate compared to head data with constant rate boundary condition as the frobenius norm decreases from 68 4 to 64 53 this improvement is further supported by an increase in the correlation coefficient from 0 2744 to 0 446 and slope increase from 0 127 to 0 22 for a larger number of observations the performance of the two data types is similar when considering their ideal boundary conditions it should be noted that inversion of head data using 32 observation points constant rate bc results in an improved y field reconstruction when compared to inversion of the flux data with same number of observation constant head bc despite the notable difference in frobenius norm for this case we can see the values of correlation coefficient and slope of 1 1 line is close to each other furthermore final wrmse for flux data is higher than head data head data are better converged than flux data which may bring biasedness when comparing these two cases finally we do not observe the superiority of inversion of head data with 32 observation points constant rate bc compared to inversion of flux data with 32 observations points constant head bc for hydraulic conductivity field with lower variance the posterior standard deviation of the y field estimations is given in fig 6 again the estimation uncertainty decreases as the number of observations increase fig 6 c and d show the posterior estimation uncertainty for 8 number of flux data observations using constant rate and constant head bcs respectively it can be seen that using constant head bc results in lower uncertainty than constant rate bc figs 6 e and 6 f which show posterior estimation uncertainty for 16 observation points of flux data when constant rate and constant head bcs are used respectively it can be seen that using constant head bc for head data results in lower uncertainty of the estimated y field this confirms our previous statement about the proper bc for inversion of the flux data 4 3 joint inversion of flux and head data the results obtained by joint inversion of flux and head data are provided in fig 7 a to h that show the y field estimate for 8 16 32 and 64 observations subjected to the constant head and constant rate borehole boundary conditions the inversion metrics are outlined in table 3 it should be noted that we have two measurements head and flux for each point shown leading to 64 observations for 32 observation points for instance the frobenius norms for 8 16 32 and 64 observations are 51 8 39 7 24 44 and 22 respectively when considering constant head borehole boundary conditions while they are 53 97 38 34 27 38 and 21 71 for constant rate boundary condition for the same number of observations the frobenius norms are very similar regardless of borehole boundary conditions in contrast to individual inversions this suggests that they do not significantly affect the results obtained by joint inversion the joint inversion results table 3 do not demonstrate any significant improvement compared to the individual inversions tables 1 and 2 when considering the same number of observations for 8 observations the minimum frobenius norm obtained for head flux and joint inversion are 48 27 47 7 and 51 8 respectively for 16 observations the minimum frobenius norm obtained for head flux and joint inversion are 30 4 44 72 and 38 34 respectively while it is 23 47 32 03 and 24 44 for 32 observations when considering the same number of observation points the joint inversion has twice as many observations as the individual inversions this leads to significantly better estimates of the hydraulic conductivity field fig 8 shows the posterior estimation uncertainty of joint inversion of flux and head data for different number of observations and different type of bcs comparing the cases with same number of observations different borehole bcs we do not observe any notable difference in estimation uncertainty depending on bc this is also consistent with our previous statement regarding the fact that borehole bcs play no significant role in joint inversion of head and flux data 5 discussion 5 1 general findings considering the results of all 96 inversion scenarios considered we find that inversion of flux data with appropriate borehole boundary condition leads to better resolved y field estimates than when considering head data particularly when a small number of observations are available furthermore the quality of the inversion results is strongly dependent on the type of boundary condition used in the borehole the performance metrics in tables 1 and 2 suggest that it is more suitable to use constant rate borehole boundary condition for head data and constant head borehole boundary condition for the flux data as reflected in frobenius norms values the reason is that if the observation is head data and the borehole boundary is set to constant head the model response head will have less sensitivity to change of y field values the same argument is also valid for the flux data once pumping with a constant rate the value of groundwater flux is fixed and the distribution of hydraulic gradient will be dependent on the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity this means that measured groundwater flux would not be so sensitive to the distribution of hydraulic conductivity when pumping with a constant head the head gradient would be fixed and the distribution of the groundwater flux will be highly dependent on the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity while the hydraulic gradient would not be very dependent on the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity even though no specific sensitivity analysis was performed but the explained behavior could be seen in the calculated jacobian matrix values the sensitivity of the forward model output at observation points with respect to the unknown model parameters which were quite much smaller in case of inappropriate boundary conditions the estimation uncertainty for head flux and joint inversion of both data reveals the role of boundary condition in the reconstruction of the y field inversion of head data with constant rate bc results in lower uncertainty than using constant head bc inversion of the flux data using constant head bc will be less uncertain than using constant rate bc however the estimation uncertainty for joint inversion of both data is almost the same for both type of bcs further studies which consider transient hydraulic tomography and 3d porous media would be very useful to confirm and investigate how quality of the inversion results depends on the type of boundary condition this may indeed have some consequences for field experiment where the effect of the borehole boundary is essential for proper experimental design our results suggest that the experimental designs should ensure that once head data are intended to be used for the inversion wells must be pumped at a constant rate while for the inversion of the flux data the head in the borehole should be kept fixed other borehole boundary conditions lead to an underestimation of hydraulic conductivity values however for the joint inversion of both data the type of borehole boundary conditions does not play a significant role tso et al 2016 and zha et al 2014 found that joint inversion of head and flux data results in better estimation of y fields in porous and fractured media compared to the head data here we find that joint inversion does not offer any advantage over the individual inversion of the flux and head data when considering an equal number of observations and ideal borehole boundary conditions however measurements distributed across the aquifer could potentially reveal more information about the heterogeneity our results rather suggest that for a constant signal to noise ratio the inversion performance depends largely on the number of observations for a small number of observations the flux data provides a superior y field estimate compared to inversion of head data while for the higher number of observations all data types perform similarly however if we would be able to measure flux and head data at the same location then for the same number of observation points joint inversion of flux and head data provide better estimates of y field as the number of observations are doubled furthermore we demonstrated the importance of borehole boundary conditions for hydraulic tomography experimental design when performing individual inversions a resolution analysis for the case of the variance of 4 and 4 measurement points demonstrates that flux data can better resolve the hydraulic conductivity field compared to head data fig 9 fig 9 shows the diagonal elements of the resolution matrix calculated in the final inversion iteration for head data flux data and joint inversion of both data are plotted on their corresponding blocks respectively considering the best y field estimates obtained for the head constant rate boundary condition and flux constant head boundary condition data for calculating the resolution matrices as shown in fig 9 a and 9 d it can be stated that model parameters hydraulic conductivity values are better resolved by flux data this is manifested by comparing both the values and coverage area of diagonal elements larger than 0 005 when head data are used for the inversion the degree of smoothing and averaging is higher compared to the case in which the flux data are used it is worth noting that since pcga does not calculate the full jacobian matrix it has the potential to blur the resolution matrix however we have chosen more pca elements than recommended to ensure high fidelity realizations with respect to original geostatistical model 5 2 the effect of number of observations and variance figs 10 a to d show the correlation coefficient between estimated y field and reference y field versus the number of observations for different type of data and borehole boundary conditions it is seen that as the number of observations increases the correlation coefficient also increases for all types of data and boundary conditions for a small number of observations flux data are superior to head data the difference between the correlation coefficient of flux and head data is the strongest for a small number of observations while the difference gradually decreases as the number of observations increases and at a high number of observations they converge this is a consequence of the decreasing distance between data points as the number of observations increases thereby decreasing the radius of averaging the gains by joint inversion for a prescribed number of observation points is that performance is independent of the borehole boundary condition and we need half as many boreholes if we are able to measure head and flux data at the same location the variance of the hydraulic conductivity field affects the final values of the correlation coefficient the higher the variance the lower the correlation coefficient especially for a small number of observations and also the more challenging it is to reach a wrmse close to 1 5 3 the effect of truncation order p on final inversion results one of the inversion cases variance of 4 32 observation points joint inversion of head and flux data was chosen to investigate the effect of the truncation order p on the final inversion result inversions were performed using truncation orders of 25 50 100 200 400 800 and 1600 the inversions were performed on a server with one terabyte 1 tb memory 4 processors intel xeon cpu e7 4850 v4 2 10 ghz and 40 cores in parallel mode fig 11 shows the y field estimated for each p value the effect on the correlation coefficient and elapsed time for each geostatistical iteration for a truncation order of 25 we capture an overly smooth version of the true model with a correlation coefficient of 0 84 by setting the truncation order to 50 100 and 200 the correlation coefficient increases to 0 88 0 91 and 0 94 respectively the truncation order of 400 used in our study with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 is the point beyond which increasing the truncation order does not significantly improve the correlation coefficient so the truncation order leads to improvement of y field reconstruction up to some points and after this point it is only the computational time that increases as the inversion performance is data limited the computational time increased exponentially for large p values the right choice of p is critical to ensure sufficient reconstruction of the hydraulic conductivity field while keeping the computational time low the truncation order should be chosen based on the degree of heterogeneity and the computational resource available it would help perform inversion using different numbers of principal components to ensure the proper choice of the number of principal components 5 4 implications for field implementations our results highlight the added value of using the flux data individually or jointly with head data in hydraulic tomography to achieve an enhanced reconstruction of the hydraulic conductivity field compared to using head data alone this improvement is particularly pronounced when considering a small number of observations a more likely setting for field applications however using only flux data requires setting the borehole boundary condition to constant head which is feasible using pumps whose rates are controlled with water level but would be more challenging than pumping at a constant rate during the field experiments however measuring the flux data during pumping with constant rate and joint inversion of both data would be quite feasible and removes the limitation of the borehole boundary condition additional simulations not shown revealed that adding even one relevant observation head data once pumping with constant rate and flux data once pumping with constant head allowed for proper estimation of the hydraulic conductivity moreover if one could measure the head and flux data at the same location by doubling the number of observations the y field estimate would be significantly improved the potential application of fo cables for pressure measurement is discussed by butler jr et al 1999 and a recent application for drawdown measurements during pumping tests is demonstrated by tiedeman and barrash 2020 a proper setting for the collection of head and flux data could include head measurements at boreholes while taking flux measurements at other locations using the fo dts technique it is also worth noting that groundwater flux measurement is not as easy as measuring the head since it requires much more equipment than a simple pressure sensor it is also true that one can measure the water level in all environments while groundwater flux measurement is currently possible for granular unconsolidated aquifers simon et al 2021 on the other hand fo dts measurements may provide groundwater flux data at a high spatial resolution simon et al 2020 the results presented in this paper are only valid for steady state hydraulic tomography the method for measuring groundwater flux from active fo dts experiments estimates has been developed works in steady state hydraulic conditions des tombes et al 2019 simon et al 2021 del val et al 2021 so we used steady state also for head data transient hydraulic tomography would probably result in better reconstruction of hydraulic conductivity field estimation transient hydraulic tomography provides the opportunity to resolve the storage thanks to the numerous transient data available the best practice would be to use all available information transient hydraulic head data and use groundwater flux data as additional constraint 6 conclusions we used a numerical model representing a one layer heterogeneous aquifer along with a geostatistical inversion approach pcga to assess the information content of head and flux data we varied the observation type the number of observation points the hydraulic conductivity variance with the same field structure and the borehole boundary conditions for a small number of observation points we find that flux data produced a better y field compared to head data when increasing the number of observation points and using appropriate borehole boundary conditions the effect of the data type vanishes and all converge to the same results as the sampling distance between points becomes smaller for the same number of observation points if we are able to measure the head and flux data at the same location joint inversion of head and flux data provides an improved estimate compared to the individual inversion of head or flux data due to the doubling of the number of observations this means that the head and flux data measured at the same location provide complementary information the type of borehole boundary conditions used in the tomography and modeling affects the inversion results the appropriate boundary condition for head and flux data is constant rate and constant head respectively while joint inversion performance is independent of the boundary type inappropriate selection of borehole boundary conditions may result in an underestimation of the y field values which is also reflected in posterior estimation uncertainties comparing the estimation uncertainty it can be seen that using head and flux data with inappropriate borehole bc results in higher uncertainty compared to the case when proper borehole bcs are used measuring flux data during a hydraulic tomography experiment is now feasible especially for shallow sandy aquifers where active distributed temperature sensing can be deployed using direct push method to install the fiber optic cables into the sediments since the inversion is particularly sensitive to the number of measurements groundwater flux measurements by active dts can be particularly useful since it may provide a large number of measurements thanks to the high spatial resolution of fiber optic temperature measurements moreover it can be also particularly useful in aquifers where the head drop due to the pumping is small but there may be high groundwater fluxes this should lead to interesting developments of hydraulic tomography experiments in the near future credit authorship contribution

273,hydraulic tomography is a state of the art method for inferring hydraulic conductivity fields using head data we employed geostatistical inversion using synthetically generated head and flux data individually and jointly in a steady state experiment we designed 96 inversion scenarios to better understand the relative merits of each data type for the typical case of a small number of observation points we find that flux data provide a better resolved hydraulic conductivity field compared to head data when considering data with similar signal to noise ratios this finding is further confirmed by a resolution analysis when considering a high number of observation points the estimated fields are of similar quality regardless of the data type in terms of borehole boundary conditions the best setting for flux and head data are constant head and constant rate respectively while joint inversion results are insensitive to the borehole boundary type when considering the same number of observations the joint inversion of head and flux data does not offer advantages over individual inversions when considering the same number of observation points and hence twice as many observations the joint inversion performs better than individual inversions the findings of this paper are useful for future planning and design of hydraulic tomography tests comprising flux and head data keywords

essential for the management of water resources liu et al 2020 solute transport predictions yeh 1992 jiménez 2015 and designing remediation of contaminated sites fakhreddine et al 2016 a variety of geophysical kowalsky et al 2004 revil et al 2012 slater 2007 and hydraulic methods brauchler et al 2003 yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 including tracer based measurements doro et al 2015 jiménez et al 2016 somogyvári and bayer 2017 have been developed and employed for characterizing hydraulic properties lochbühler et al 2013 in hydraulic flow methods head data responses to hydraulic perturbations pumping tidal fluctuation etc are measured at different locations across the aquifer the recorded head data are then used to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity k and storativity a distinct advantage of hydraulic methods for imaging purposes is that the hydraulic response of an aquifer is directly related to its hydraulic parameters described by flow equations fakhreddine et al 2016 while in most geophysical methods the hydraulic properties are indirect and inferred from other estimated physical properties thereby requiring petrophysical relationships we define y log10 k and assume that it can be described by a stationary multivariate gaussian distribution in other words y is the log10 based hydraulic conductivity field hydraulic tomography is one type of hydraulic method and has been the subject of many theoretical and numerical studies fienen et al 2008 luo et al 2020 yeh and liu 2000 zha et al 2018 zhu and yeh 2005 laboratory experiments illman et al 2008 w a 2010 liu et al 2002 2007 yin and illman 2009 zhao et al 2016 and field studies berg and illman 2015 s j 2013 s j 2011 bohling et al 2007 brauchler et al 2013 r 2011 r 2010 2003 cardiff et al 2009 m 2013 cardiff and barrash 2011 fischer et al 2017 gottlieb and dietrich 1995 huang et al 2011 klepikova et al 2013 kuhlman et al 2008 paradis et al 2016 2015 sun et al 2013 tosaka et al 1993 however hydraulic tomography based on head data alone has limitations one limitation is inherent to the underlying potential field physics as measured head data are spatially averaged due to the diffusive nature of pressure disturbances created during the test bohling and butler jr 2010 this averaging results in tomographic estimates displaying a high degree of smoothing compared to the actual aquifer property fields this smearing may lead to degraded predictions for transport problems it should be noted that the smoothing would only appear in a single regularized solution however if one uses stochastic methods one should be able to represent the stochastic nature of the underlying actual aquifer property fields furthermore some authors have included geological data as a priori information to overcome this issue luo et al 2017 zha et al 2017 zhao and illman 2018 another limitation appears in applying hydraulic tomography in high conductivity aquifers as hydraulic tests lead to small drawdown values implying high relative uncertainty of the measured head perturbations and correspondingly low signal to noise ratio data adding other types of non redundant data in hydraulic tomography can help to better image the subsurface mao et al 2013 yeh et al 2015 in this regard zha et al 2014 demonstrated the usefulness of flux data specific discharge for hydraulic tomography in a 2d synthetic fractured media mimicking a field site in mizunami japan estimated mean variance and correlation length of the y field were applied as prior information to the inversion model using the cross correlation approach zha et al 2014 they showed that head and flux contribute differently to the y field reconstruction they claimed that inversion of head data collected with known pumping rate can result in representative y field estimates even if the initial guess is incorrect for flux data they find that the final y field estimate is dependent on the initial guess their synthetic work showed that using flux data with head data improves the estimation of y field values and the fracture distribution in another study tso et al 2016 performed numerical test studies on a 3d model mimicking the aquifer at the north campus research site in waterloo canada they simulated pumping in this porous aquifer and measured head data and flux data at different locations then head and flux data were subjected to inversion considering different types of prior information they showed that using flux data jointly with head data can enhance hydraulic conductivity estimates furthermore they found out that the estimated hydraulic conductivity field is less affected by an inadequate prior model when non redundant flux data are used to supplement the head data until recently measurements of groundwater fluxes in the field were limited to local and time consuming measurements the most popular technique for quantifying groundwater flux in the field was based on dilution tests drost et al 1968 jamin et al 2015 schneider et al 2019 where the dilution of an injected tracer inside a screened borehole or within packers is used to estimate the horizontal groundwater flux other approaches such as the colloidal borescope kearl 1997 the point velocity probe labaky et al 2007 or the in situ permeable flow sensor ballard et al 1996 can also measure the horizontal groundwater flux a comprehensive review of the groundwater velocity measurement approaches is provided by devlin 2020 nevertheless boreholes disturb the flow field and affect the measurements hence the measured values may not represent the real flux values moreover these methods are in general limited to local measurements and do not provide in most cases the spatial variability of groundwater fluxes the recent advent of fiber optic distributed temperature sensors fo dts has led to new possibilities for measuring groundwater discharge with unprecedented spatial resolution des tombe et al 2019 simon et al 2021 del val et al 2021 fo dts is a distributed sensor type that allows measurements of temperature all along the fiber optic cable fo dts can be employed in both passive and active modes in passive mode the temperature of the fiber optic is measured without any external forcing while in active mode a heat source is added to the fiber optic cable by using a heating element located very close to the fiber optic cable or by using a heating fiber optic cable active dts have been developed for instance for measuring borehole flows read et al 2014 wind speed sayde et al 2015 and for characterizing groundwater fluxes in fractured media maldaner et al 2019 recently it has also been used for measuring groundwater discharge in sedimentary aquifers the fo cable typically being installed by the direct push method bakker et al 2015 des tombe et al 2019 or along boreholes del val et al 2021 in this case the buried cable is in direct contact with the ground with minimum subsurface perturbations simon et al 2021 showed that active dts can be used for measuring both sediment thermal conductivities and groundwater fluxes on a large range of values with excellent accuracy with errors of less than 10 for groundwater flux in the range of 10 5 to 10 3 m s the principle of such an experiment fig 1 is to monitor the temperature evolution with time which depends on the surrounding area s thermal properties and also groundwater fluxes that limits the temperature rise typically the slope of the temperature rise in the conduction regime with time in logarithmic scale is inversely proportional to thermal conductivity while the greater the groundwater fluxes the lower the temperature at stabilization the temperature evolution with time may be easily interpreted to estimate groundwater fluxes through an analytical solution or by using a graphical analysis simon et al 2021 the application of active fo dts for flux measurements is currently limited to shallow and unconsolidated aquifers due to limitations in deployment by the direct push method new advances in distributed sensing of local groundwater flux make it an appealing data source for independent inversion or joint inversion with hydraulic head this present study assumes that groundwater fluxes can be inferred from such above mentioned techniques at a prescribed spatial resolution and accuracy it is worth mentioning that measuring head data is more accurate and easier than flux data however active fo dts and new developments in the data analysis provide promising result for measurement of the flux along fo cables here we limit ourselves to a 2 d study assuming constant groundwater flux in depth using a geostatistical hydraulic tomography approach we then address the benefits and drawbacks of using either head or flux data individually or jointly more specifically we address the following questions 1 for an equal number and locations of flux and head data which data type leads to the best reconstruction of hydraulic conductivity 2 how does the number of observations affect the inversion results 3 how does inversion performance for the different data types vary with the hydraulic conductivity field variance the paper is structured into six sections section 2 presents the geostatistical inversion method and the forward model employed in section 3 we describe the hydraulic conductivity test model used for our analysis in sections 4 and 5 we present and discuss the main results respectively and section 6 concludes the paper 2 methods the principal component geostatistical approach pcga is a computationally efficient geostatistical inversion method lee and kitanidis 2014 pcga uses the main principal components of the prior model covariance matrix for model parameterization and corresponding estimates of the jacobian sensitivity matrix the resulting model reduction from a model of many gridded elements to a lower number of retained principal components leads to smaller matrices to invert and fewer sensitivities to estimate implying less computational costs than full inversions this method has been employed extensively in recent years fakhreddine et al 2016 fischer et al 2017 kang et al 2017 lee et al 2018 soueid ahmed et al 2016 in this study we use pcga combined with the matlab reservoir simulation toolbox mrst that simulates fluid flow in porous media forward model to perform inversion of head and flux data 2 1 inverse model inferring properties of subsurface media storage hydraulic conductivity from error contaminated and sparse observed data head data flux data etc is an inverse problem and can be formulated as follow 1 d f m where d f m and ƞ refer to measured data forward model model parameters and errors respectively the forward model refers here to a non linear operator solving a set of differential equations numerically to describe the relationship between model parameters and data when considering the joint inversion of two different data type d 1 and d 2 the formulation is as follow 2 d 1 d 2 f m η 1 η 2 from a mathematical point of view the inverse problem is often ill posed and the solution is non unique implying that additional information e g a prior model is required to obtain unique and physically meaningful results the prior model inferred based on the available information about the subsurface media in this work the same prior model is used throughout to avoid the effect of the prior model on the comparisons of final results here the subsurface is described as a multi gaussian stationary field with known statistical properties and a superimposed deterministic trend in the presence of a multivariate gaussian prior model and error distribution it is common to formulate the inverse problem in terms of an exploration of the maximum a posteriori map estimate and its variance in such a setting the solution of the inverse problem is obtained by maximizing a posterior probability density function maximizing the term in bracket expressed by using bayes theorem as follow 3 π p o s t m d exp 1 2 f m d c d 1 f m d 1 2 m m prior c m 1

tomography purposes illman et al 2015 the iterative optimization process estimates the model parameters the solution at i 1 th iteration is calculated as 4 m i 1 x β i c m j i t ε i where x is a known matrix and β is an unknown vector used to determine linear trends that is inferred along with ε by solving the system of equations below in this equation x is a trend matrix and β is trend vector here

f m i j i m i 0 2 1 1 principal component geostatistical approach calculating the jacobian matrix j used in eqs 4 and 5 for high dimensional problems often requires a very high computational effort lee and kitandis 2014 proposed the principal component geostatistical approach pcga which uses a low rank approximation of the prior covariance via principal component analysis and avoids forming the jacobian explicitly for products of the jacobian matrix and eigenvalues eqs 7 and 8 by using a finite difference approximation eq 9 this results in a faster inversion process of high accuracy provided that an adequate number of principal components are retained the terms that are used for geostatistical inversion in eq 5 are approximated through the p largest principal components as follow 6 c m c

f m i here c m p is a rank p approximation of the model parameter covariance matrix the c mp and jacobian matrix products required for the inversion eq 5 are given by eqs 7 8 z is a m p matrix and ς ii is the i th column vector of z how to choose the finite difference interval δ is addressed by lee and kitandis 2014 the diagonal entries of the posterior covariance matrix v jj are often presented as the estimation of the variance and can be calculated without explicit construction of v lee and kitanidis 2014 10 v jj c m j j j c m j x t t j c m j t c d jx t j x 0 1 j c m j x j t where c m jj represents the j th diagonal entry of the model covariance matrix and jx j is the j th column of the product jx in this work levenberg marquardt algorithm by introducing a multiplier to the error matrix for dampening is used to reduce the distance between simulation and observation once the model parameters are determined it is desirable to perform a resolution analysis by obtaining the resolution matrix r which can be seen as a low pass filter that maps the true model parameters to the estimated model parameters e g alumbaugh and newman 2000 each model parameter during the inversion is estimated from the averaging of other model parameters adjacent to the one of interest the components of r can be interpreted as weights each row in the resolution matrix of the average of true model parameters for estimating each model parameter day lewis et al 2005 the ideal resolution matrix would be an identity matrix that would imply that all model parameters are resolved perfectly the deviation of the diagonal element from the identity matrix reveals the degree of averaging and smoothness thus plotting diagonal elements of the resolution matrix in their corresponding blocks is indicative of the degree of smoothness the diagonal elements of the resolution matrix eq 11 inform the extent to which each estimated parameter is resolved independently the resolution matrix r is obtained by eq 12 which requires recovering the jacobian matrix j r from the previously calculated product eq 7 and inverse of low rank approximation of the covariance matrix c m p as shown in eq 13

the grid cells while j is the jacobian matrix calculated directly for every principal component 2 2 forward model the incompressible fluid flow module of mrst lie 2019 was used to simulate steady state groundwater flow it is used to calculate head and flux values at different points across a confined aquifer starting from the mass conservation law on a control volume introducing the darcy law assuming incompressible fluid flow and steady state condition the final form of the equation reads 14 k w h w q w subjected to the following constant head boundary conditions across external boundaries 15 h h d for w γ a here w x y z k l t h l and q l t represent the hydraulic conductivity head and fluid source or sink inflow or outflow of fluid per volume at certain locations respectively гa represents dirichlet boundaries the above equations are solved numerically to calculate the head values at grid points across the aquifer the mrst uses the two point flux approximation scheme lie 2019 to calculate the darcy flux in each grid block starting from mass conservation introducing the darcy equation to the flux exchange at the face of a cell with its neighboring cells and imposing continuity of fluxes across all faces of a cell the flux in each face for instance in the x direction is calculated by 16 δ x c e l l k c e l l δ x n e i g h b o u r k n e i g h b o u r 1 h c e l l h n e i g h b o u r v f a c e here x l is the length of the grid and v face l t is the fluid flux this equation is solved for all other faces to obtain the flux in all faces the value of the flux attributed to each cell is the euclidean norm of flux in all faces 3 numerical experiments 3 1 setup of the synthetic test case to assess the information content of hydraulic head and groundwater flux data for the reconstruction of heterogeneous aquifers a stationary multi gaussian log hydraulic conductivity field with constant storativity is generated using the fast circulant embedding technique resulting in the field shown in fig 2 in this study we consider steady state hydraulic tomography in which storativity does not play a role in simulated head or flux data and can be considered as a constant value the generated aquifer is 550 m in length 550 m in width and 5 m in depth the aquifer is discretized into 110 110 1 in x y z directions and corresponding block sizes are 5 m 5 m 5 m respectively the aquifer is assumed to have one layer and the log hydraulic conductivity field has a multi gaussian distribution the area of interest is chosen in the middle of the aquifer away from the boundaries to reduce the boundaries effect on the inversion all boundaries are set to a constant head equal to 350 m the correlation length used for generating the y field is 75 m and 45 m for x and y directions respectively the same field same heterogeneity structure with different variances of 0 5 1 2 and 4 are generated to assess the effect of variance and number of observations on the inversion results the mean ymean is 3 57 for all cases but the y fields variance and ranges are different for different experiments this range of hydraulic conductivity is chosen to have measurable and realistic groundwater flux and head responses both in real and synthetic aquifers we use a five spot setup with a central borehole p1 and four boreholes p2 p3 p4 and p5 on the corners of the area of interest bounded by white dashed lines in fig 2 other monitoring points are also considered between the boreholes as shown by asterisk symbols the aquifer is subjected to a series of pumping experiments in each borehole the five boreholes are pumped sequentially one at each time and head flux data are acquired in other boreholes and observation points two different boundary conditions in the borehole namely constant rate and constant head are considered when simulating pumping in one borehole the head and flux values are recorded in other boreholes and monitoring points the acquired flux and head data are noise contaminated before being used to estimate the y field 3 2 hydraulic tomography using head and flux data our numerical inversion experiments aim to compare the relative merits of each data type and analyze how borehole boundary conditions constant head or constant rate the variance of the y field and the number of observations affect the inversion results the observational data are generated using the reference hydraulic conductivity field and a normally distributed and independent error is added to the observations the standard deviations of these errors are different in all cases the errors standard deviations were chosen to be in a realistic range while ensuring the same initial signal to noise ratio of 38 for all cases defined by running the code using y mean the resulting measurement errors range from 0 05 to 0 013 m for the head and 0 055 to 0 01 m day for the flux the relation between values of groundwater flux and measurement uncertainty is provided by simon et al 2021 this relation was used to define a reasonable range of the noise model it should be noted that the uncertainty depends highly on the range of flux measurements and the duration of the active dts experiments typically for a relatively large range of values the accuracy is very good but for very high or very low flows values uncertainty is much greater simon et al 2021 in this work we assume that data quality in terms of signal to noise ratio is the same for both head and flux data pcga with previously mentioned geostatistical parameters variance and correlation length are used for the inversion increasing in the dimension of the problem results in massive computational needs considering the available computational methods one may use the full covariance matrix but if it is not possible a sufficient number of components must be chosen to ensure that most of the heterogeneity features are captured the truncation order p rank of the prior covariance matrix is chosen as 400 out of 12 100 based on the recommendation by lee et al 2016 the truncation order p which results in the relative eigenvalue error below 0 01 would be sufficient to capture most of the covariance matrix structure the relative eigenvalue error is defined as the ratio of first to p 1 th eigenvalue we have chosen p more conservatively for the y field with variance 4 the first eigenvalue is 1411 47 while the 401st eigenvalue is 0 047 giving the ratio of 3 25 10 5 the inversion starts with a constant value of y mean and continues until the root mean square error between observed and simulated measurement normalized with the error standard deviation weighted root mean square error defined in eq 15 reaches a value close to one 17 wrmse 1 n 1 n d f m estimate 2 σ 2 here n is the number of observations and σ is the absolute value of the error s standard deviation if no convergence is obtained the inversion ends after 10 iterations 3 2 1 boundary condition at the pumping borehole the steady state hydraulic tomography is simulated considering two different borehole boundary conditions constant rate the borehole is being pumped with constant flow rate and constant head the head in the borehole is kept constant note that the external boundary conditions do not change and are kept fixed as an example the pumping rates for the field case with variance 4 y field variance are 2400 4000 1750 5000 and 3800 m3 day for p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 respectively the equivalent constant head borehole boundary conditions are 324 340 300 329 and 336 m for p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 respectively the inversion is performed on the whole domain but results are shown for the area of interest 3 2 2 variance of y field and number of observation points the effect of the y field y log10 k variance is investigated by considering four different variances 0 5 1 2 and 4 furthermore a different number of observation points are used to assess their impact on the final inversion results the observation points are distributed symmetrically in the aquifer the minimum number of observation points considered is the number of boreholes 4 observation points and the maximum are the boreholes and the observation points shown by asterisks in fig 2 32 observation points we distinguish between the number of observations and the number of observation points for head and flux data the number of observation points and number of observations are the same for joint inversion the number of observations is twice the number of observation points 3 3 performance metrics to evaluate each data type s performance in estimating y we use the frobenius norm and scatter plots of estimated versus reference y for each case the frobenius norm for the vector of difference between the reference y and estimated y is 18 nor m fr 1 n y reference y estimated 2 furthermore the correlation coefficient between reference y and estimated y values and their corresponding slope lines are calculated we stress that the comparison is based on the log of the hydraulic conductivity values and not the hydraulic conductivity itself thereby avoiding emphasizing large hydraulic conductivity values 4 results 4 1 inversion of head data first the head data are individually inverted the results are presented for 4 observation points only the observations in the boreholes 8 16 and 32 observation points for each case two different borehole boundary conditions are considered constant rate and constant head fig 3 shows the estimated y field with a variance of 4 and table 1 represents the performance metrics for all cases we find that changing the borehole boundary condition from constant rate to constant head deteriorates the y field estimation this is quantified by the fact that the frobenius norm table 1 increases from 68 4 to 85 5 48 27 to 75 15 30 4 to 61 9 and 23 47 to 54 90 for 4 8 16 and 32 observation points respectively comparing figs 3 a to 3 h with the reference y field fig 3 i also show that cases with constant rate boundary conditions is visually closer to the reference y field the use of constant head borehole boundary condition results in an underestimation of y field values and the mean value of y field for instance in the case of 4 observation points the mean value of the estimated y field is around 4 for constant head boundary condition while it is 3 45 for constant rate boundary condition the mean value of the reference y field is 3 57 adding more observations leads to better results in terms of how close the estimated y field is to the reference y field as judged by the frobenius norm the correlation coefficient and the slope of the 1 1 line when estimated y field is to the reference y field are plotted against each other this is reflected in the improvement of the correlation coefficient from 0 27 to 0 94 for constant rate borehole boundary condition and from 0 49 to 0 93 for constant head boundary condition when adding observation points associated increases in the slopes from 0 13 to 0 95 and from 0 32 to 0 93 for constant rate and constant head boundary conditions further underline the previous statement as expected the standard deviations of the posterior covariance matrix fig 4 decrease as the number of observations increase we also see that for the cases involving 8 fig 4 c and 16 fig 4 e observation points with constant rate bc have lower uncertainties than the corresponding number of observations figs 4 d and 4 f with constant head bc this is consistent with the previous statement of proper bc for head data 4 2 inversion of flux data we now consider the results obtained by individual inversions of flux data for a y field variance of 4 fig 5 a to h show the y field estimates for 4 8 16 and 32 observation points subjected to constant rate and constant head borehole boundary conditions table 2 provides the corresponding performance metrics contrary to head data we find that constant head boundary conditions provide a better y field estimate when considering flux data the better performance of the constant head with respect to constant rate boundary condition is seen for instance by comparing the values of the frobenius norm given in table 2 for the case of 4 8 16 and 32 observation points the frobenius norm decreases from 81 2 to 64 53 65 61 to 47 7 62 2 to 44 7 and from 50 51 to 32 03 respectively using constant rate boundary condition for the flux data results in an underestimation of the y field mean considering the case with 4 observation points the estimated y field s mean value with the constant rate boundary condition is around 4 while it is around 3 4 for the constant head boundary condition comparing the values of frobenius norm for the head and flux data given in table 1 and table 2 reveals that for a small number of observations 4 observation points using flux data with constant head boundary condition gives a better y field estimate compared to head data with constant rate boundary condition as the frobenius norm decreases from 68 4 to 64 53 this improvement is further supported by an increase in the correlation coefficient from 0 2744 to 0 446 and slope increase from 0 127 to 0 22 for a larger number of observations the performance of the two data types is similar when considering their ideal boundary conditions it should be noted that inversion of head data using 32 observation points constant rate bc results in an improved y field reconstruction when compared to inversion of the flux data with same number of observation constant head bc despite the notable difference in frobenius norm for this case we can see the values of correlation coefficient and slope of 1 1 line is close to each other furthermore final wrmse for flux data is higher than head data head data are better converged than flux data which may bring biasedness when comparing these two cases finally we do not observe the superiority of inversion of head data with 32 observation points constant rate bc compared to inversion of flux data with 32 observations points constant head bc for hydraulic conductivity field with lower variance the posterior standard deviation of the y field estimations is given in fig 6 again the estimation uncertainty decreases as the number of observations increase fig 6 c and d show the posterior estimation uncertainty for 8 number of flux data observations using constant rate and constant head bcs respectively it can be seen that using constant head bc results in lower uncertainty than constant rate bc figs 6 e and 6 f which show posterior estimation uncertainty for 16 observation points of flux data when constant rate and constant head bcs are used respectively it can be seen that using constant head bc for head data results in lower uncertainty of the estimated y field this confirms our previous statement about the proper bc for inversion of the flux data 4 3 joint inversion of flux and head data the results obtained by joint inversion of flux and head data are provided in fig 7 a to h that show the y field estimate for 8 16 32 and 64 observations subjected to the constant head and constant rate borehole boundary conditions the inversion metrics are outlined in table 3 it should be noted that we have two measurements head and flux for each point shown leading to 64 observations for 32 observation points for instance the frobenius norms for 8 16 32 and 64 observations are 51 8 39 7 24 44 and 22 respectively when considering constant head borehole boundary conditions while they are 53 97 38 34 27 38 and 21 71 for constant rate boundary condition for the same number of observations the frobenius norms are very similar regardless of borehole boundary conditions in contrast to individual inversions this suggests that they do not significantly affect the results obtained by joint inversion the joint inversion results table 3 do not demonstrate any significant improvement compared to the individual inversions tables 1 and 2 when considering the same number of observations for 8 observations the minimum frobenius norm obtained for head flux and joint inversion are 48 27 47 7 and 51 8 respectively for 16 observations the minimum frobenius norm obtained for head flux and joint inversion are 30 4 44 72 and 38 34 respectively while it is 23 47 32 03 and 24 44 for 32 observations when considering the same number of observation points the joint inversion has twice as many observations as the individual inversions this leads to significantly better estimates of the hydraulic conductivity field fig 8 shows the posterior estimation uncertainty of joint inversion of flux and head data for different number of observations and different type of bcs comparing the cases with same number of observations different borehole bcs we do not observe any notable difference in estimation uncertainty depending on bc this is also consistent with our previous statement regarding the fact that borehole bcs play no significant role in joint inversion of head and flux data 5 discussion 5 1 general findings considering the results of all 96 inversion scenarios considered we find that inversion of flux data with appropriate borehole boundary condition leads to better resolved y field estimates than when considering head data particularly when a small number of observations are available furthermore the quality of the inversion results is strongly dependent on the type of boundary condition used in the borehole the performance metrics in tables 1 and 2 suggest that it is more suitable to use constant rate borehole boundary condition for head data and constant head borehole boundary condition for the flux data as reflected in frobenius norms values the reason is that if the observation is head data and the borehole boundary is set to constant head the model response head will have less sensitivity to change of y field values the same argument is also valid for the flux data once pumping with a constant rate the value of groundwater flux is fixed and the distribution of hydraulic gradient will be dependent on the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity this means that measured groundwater flux would not be so sensitive to the distribution of hydraulic conductivity when pumping with a constant head the head gradient would be fixed and the distribution of the groundwater flux will be highly dependent on the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity while the hydraulic gradient would not be very dependent on the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity even though no specific sensitivity analysis was performed but the explained behavior could be seen in the calculated jacobian matrix values the sensitivity of the forward model output at observation points with respect to the unknown model parameters which were quite much smaller in case of inappropriate boundary conditions the estimation uncertainty for head flux and joint inversion of both data reveals the role of boundary condition in the reconstruction of the y field inversion of head data with constant rate bc results in lower uncertainty than using constant head bc inversion of the flux data using constant head bc will be less uncertain than using constant rate bc however the estimation uncertainty for joint inversion of both data is almost the same for both type of bcs further studies which consider transient hydraulic tomography and 3d porous media would be very useful to confirm and investigate how quality of the inversion results depends on the type of boundary condition this may indeed have some consequences for field experiment where the effect of the borehole boundary is essential for proper experimental design our results suggest that the experimental designs should ensure that once head data are intended to be used for the inversion wells must be pumped at a constant rate while for the inversion of the flux data the head in the borehole should be kept fixed other borehole boundary conditions lead to an underestimation of hydraulic conductivity values however for the joint inversion of both data the type of borehole boundary conditions does not play a significant role tso et al 2016 and zha et al 2014 found that joint inversion of head and flux data results in better estimation of y fields in porous and fractured media compared to the head data here we find that joint inversion does not offer any advantage over the individual inversion of the flux and head data when considering an equal number of observations and ideal borehole boundary conditions however measurements distributed across the aquifer could potentially reveal more information about the heterogeneity our results rather suggest that for a constant signal to noise ratio the inversion performance depends largely on the number of observations for a small number of observations the flux data provides a superior y field estimate compared to inversion of head data while for the higher number of observations all data types perform similarly however if we would be able to measure flux and head data at the same location then for the same number of observation points joint inversion of flux and head data provide better estimates of y field as the number of observations are doubled furthermore we demonstrated the importance of borehole boundary conditions for hydraulic tomography experimental design when performing individual inversions a resolution analysis for the case of the variance of 4 and 4 measurement points demonstrates that flux data can better resolve the hydraulic conductivity field compared to head data fig 9 fig 9 shows the diagonal elements of the resolution matrix calculated in the final inversion iteration for head data flux data and joint inversion of both data are plotted on their corresponding blocks respectively considering the best y field estimates obtained for the head constant rate boundary condition and flux constant head boundary condition data for calculating the resolution matrices as shown in fig 9 a and 9 d it can be stated that model parameters hydraulic conductivity values are better resolved by flux data this is manifested by comparing both the values and coverage area of diagonal elements larger than 0 005 when head data are used for the inversion the degree of smoothing and averaging is higher compared to the case in which the flux data are used it is worth noting that since pcga does not calculate the full jacobian matrix it has the potential to blur the resolution matrix however we have chosen more pca elements than recommended to ensure high fidelity realizations with respect to original geostatistical model 5 2 the effect of number of observations and variance figs 10 a to d show the correlation coefficient between estimated y field and reference y field versus the number of observations for different type of data and borehole boundary conditions it is seen that as the number of observations increases the correlation coefficient also increases for all types of data and boundary conditions for a small number of observations flux data are superior to head data the difference between the correlation coefficient of flux and head data is the strongest for a small number of observations while the difference gradually decreases as the number of observations increases and at a high number of observations they converge this is a consequence of the decreasing distance between data points as the number of observations increases thereby decreasing the radius of averaging the gains by joint inversion for a prescribed number of observation points is that performance is independent of the borehole boundary condition and we need half as many boreholes if we are able to measure head and flux data at the same location the variance of the hydraulic conductivity field affects the final values of the correlation coefficient the higher the variance the lower the correlation coefficient especially for a small number of observations and also the more challenging it is to reach a wrmse close to 1 5 3 the effect of truncation order p on final inversion results one of the inversion cases variance of 4 32 observation points joint inversion of head and flux data was chosen to investigate the effect of the truncation order p on the final inversion result inversions were performed using truncation orders of 25 50 100 200 400 800 and 1600 the inversions were performed on a server with one terabyte 1 tb memory 4 processors intel xeon cpu e7 4850 v4 2 10 ghz and 40 cores in parallel mode fig 11 shows the y field estimated for each p value the effect on the correlation coefficient and elapsed time for each geostatistical iteration for a truncation order of 25 we capture an overly smooth version of the true model with a correlation coefficient of 0 84 by setting the truncation order to 50 100 and 200 the correlation coefficient increases to 0 88 0 91 and 0 94 respectively the truncation order of 400 used in our study with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 is the point beyond which increasing the truncation order does not significantly improve the correlation coefficient so the truncation order leads to improvement of y field reconstruction up to some points and after this point it is only the computational time that increases as the inversion performance is data limited the computational time increased exponentially for large p values the right choice of p is critical to ensure sufficient reconstruction of the hydraulic conductivity field while keeping the computational time low the truncation order should be chosen based on the degree of heterogeneity and the computational resource available it would help perform inversion using different numbers of principal components to ensure the proper choice of the number of principal components 5 4 implications for field implementations our results highlight the added value of using the flux data individually or jointly with head data in hydraulic tomography to achieve an enhanced reconstruction of the hydraulic conductivity field compared to using head data alone this improvement is particularly pronounced when considering a small number of observations a more likely setting for field applications however using only flux data requires setting the borehole boundary condition to constant head which is feasible using pumps whose rates are controlled with water level but would be more challenging than pumping at a constant rate during the field experiments however measuring the flux data during pumping with constant rate and joint inversion of both data would be quite feasible and removes the limitation of the borehole boundary condition additional simulations not shown revealed that adding even one relevant observation head data once pumping with constant rate and flux data once pumping with constant head allowed for proper estimation of the hydraulic conductivity moreover if one could measure the head and flux data at the same location by doubling the number of observations the y field estimate would be significantly improved the potential application of fo cables for pressure measurement is discussed by butler jr et al 1999 and a recent application for drawdown measurements during pumping tests is demonstrated by tiedeman and barrash 2020 a proper setting for the collection of head and flux data could include head measurements at boreholes while taking flux measurements at other locations using the fo dts technique it is also worth noting that groundwater flux measurement is not as easy as measuring the head since it requires much more equipment than a simple pressure sensor it is also true that one can measure the water level in all environments while groundwater flux measurement is currently possible for granular unconsolidated aquifers simon et al 2021 on the other hand fo dts measurements may provide groundwater flux data at a high spatial resolution simon et al 2020 the results presented in this paper are only valid for steady state hydraulic tomography the method for measuring groundwater flux from active fo dts experiments estimates has been developed works in steady state hydraulic conditions des tombes et al 2019 simon et al 2021 del val et al 2021 so we used steady state also for head data transient hydraulic tomography would probably result in better reconstruction of hydraulic conductivity field estimation transient hydraulic tomography provides the opportunity to resolve the storage thanks to the numerous transient data available the best practice would be to use all available information transient hydraulic head data and use groundwater flux data as additional constraint 6 conclusions we used a numerical model representing a one layer heterogeneous aquifer along with a geostatistical inversion approach pcga to assess the information content of head and flux data we varied the observation type the number of observation points the hydraulic conductivity variance with the same field structure and the borehole boundary conditions for a small number of observation points we find that flux data produced a better y field compared to head data when increasing the number of observation points and using appropriate borehole boundary conditions the effect of the data type vanishes and all converge to the same results as the sampling distance between points becomes smaller for the same number of observation points if we are able to measure the head and flux data at the same location joint inversion of head and flux data provides an improved estimate compared to the individual inversion of head or flux data due to the doubling of the number of observations this means that the head and flux data measured at the same location provide complementary information the type of borehole boundary conditions used in the tomography and modeling affects the inversion results the appropriate boundary condition for head and flux data is constant rate and constant head respectively while joint inversion performance is independent of the boundary type inappropriate selection of borehole boundary conditions may result in an underestimation of the y field values which is also reflected in posterior estimation uncertainties comparing the estimation uncertainty it can be seen that using head and flux data with inappropriate borehole bc results in higher uncertainty compared to the case when proper borehole bcs are used measuring flux data during a hydraulic tomography experiment is now feasible especially for shallow sandy aquifers where active distributed temperature sensing can be deployed using direct push method to install the fiber optic cables into the sediments since the inversion is particularly sensitive to the number of measurements groundwater flux measurements by active dts can be particularly useful since it may provide a large number of measurements thanks to the high spatial resolution of fiber optic temperature measurements moreover it can be also particularly useful in aquifers where the head drop due to the pumping is small but there may be high groundwater fluxes this should lead to interesting developments of hydraulic tomography experiments in the near future credit authorship contribution

274,consistent particle tracking relies on conforming velocity fields that ensure local mass conservation on elements cell centered finite volume and mixed finite element methods result in conforming velocity fields but this is not the case for continuous galerkin methods such as the standard finite element method fem nonetheless standard fem is often used for subsurface flow modeling because it yields a continuous approximation of hydraulic heads and it naturally handles unstructured grids and full material tensors acknowledging these advantages and the wide spread use of finite element type simulations we present a postprocessing method that reconstructs a cell centered finite volume solution from a finite element type solution of the variably saturated subsurface flow equation to obtain conforming mass conservative fluxes using the linear average velocity field derived from these fluid fluxes we employ element wise analytical solutions for triangular prisms to compute particle trajectories and associated travel times as a result we can compute consistent particle trajectories for variably saturated flow solutions generated by node centered methods such as finite element or finite difference methods that do not yield conforming velocity fields our flux reconstruction solves a linear elliptic problem whose size is on the order of the number of elements which is computationally much faster than solving the initial non linear transient variably saturated flow equation compared to other postprocessing schemes our flux reconstruction is numerically stable fast to compute and does not induce severe numerical artifacts when applied to heterogeneous domains with strongly varying velocities however these advantages come with a comparably high coding effort and the necessity of solving a global system of equations we show that the results of our flux reconstruction are close to the node centered primal solution for variably saturated three dimensional flow with heterogeneous material properties keywords cell centered finite volume method finite element method particle tracking local mass conservation triangular prisms variably saturated flow 1 introduction standard continuous finite element and related methods are popular for subsurface flow simulations because they easily allow for unstructured grids and yield physically realistic continuous hydraulic head fields while cell centered finite volume formulations on an unstructured primal grid are possible see e g friis et al 2009 edwards and zheng 2010 selzer and cirpka 2020 vertex centered finite volumes e g huber and helmig 2000 or other formulations on a dual grid edwards 2002 are more common also full material tensors can be incorporated in finite volumes as an example edwards 2002 derived such techniques for a dual grid to unstructured triangular meshes friis et al 2009 and edwards and zheng 2010 extended this approach to the primal grid using a dual grid and transformations of coordinates similar to those known from finite elements on subspaces leading to more flexible schemes but also to a considerable computational overhead while continuous galerkin methods like the standard fem and related techniques yield a continuous primary unknown i e a physically realistic hydraulic head field this is not the case for finite volume type techniques mixed finite element methods and discontinuous galerkin methods which in general lead to a jump of the primary unknown on element boundaries odsæter et al 2017 selzer and cirpka 2020 bastian and rivière 2003 larson and niklasson 2004 sun and wheeler 2006 hoteit et al 2002 however in contrast to finite volume type techniques standard fem and related methods yield non conforming velocity fields with the normal flux component being discontinuous across element boundaries and mass is not conserved locally in the elements this yields a physically unrealistic jump of the velocity on element boundaries odsæter et al 2017 selzer and cirpka 2020 bastian and rivière 2003 larson and niklasson 2004 sun and wheeler 2006 hoteit et al 2002 putti and sartoretto 2009 overall one may conclude that standard fem is the method of choice if the primary interest lies in the hydraulic heads while finite volume type techniques are favorable if the primary interest lies in the velocities non conforming velocity fields can cause severe problems for solute transport simulations that are based on particle tracking particle tracking methods require velocity fields generated by a preceding solution of the flow equation especially for advection dominated transport these methods represent an attractive alternative to solving the advection dispersion equation by eulerian methods because they do not suffer from the drawbacks of numerical dispersion or spurious negative concentrations cirpka et al 1999 2015 crane and blunt 1999 neglecting transverse dispersion particle tracking replaces an explicit three dimensional description of solute transport by a one dimensional representation employing travel time atchley et al 2013 crane and blunt 1999 ginn 2001 loschko et al 2016 shapiro and cvetkovic 1988 it yields an easy to compute approximation of flow paths and travel times and can also be used to study among others the effects of sedimentary anisotropy on solute transport bennett et al 2017 however particle tracking represents a consistent method for solving solute transport only if it is based on a conforming velocity field which implies that the normal component of the flux is continuous on element boundaries and mass is conserved in the elements such velocity fields may originate from a cell centered finite volume method loschko et al 2016 pollock 1988 a mixed finite element method juanes and matringe 2009 matringe et al 2006 putti and sartoretto 2009 or from an h d i v projection of a non conforming velocity field bastian and rivière 2003 cordes and kinzelbach 1992 kees et al 2008 larson and niklasson 2004 odsæter et al 2017 selzer and cirpka 2020 sun and wheeler 2006 vidotto et al 2018 several postprocessing techniques have been developed to obtain conforming velocity fields from fem solutions these techniques have allowed to simulate solute transport by godunov type finite volume methods scudeler et al 2016 discontinuous galerkin methods odsæter et al 2017 or particle tracking cordes and kinzelbach 1992 selzer and cirpka 2020 simulations were either conducted on the primal grid kees et al 2008 larson and niklasson 2004 odsæter et al 2017 selzer and cirpka 2020 sun and wheeler 2006 or on a dual grid cordes and kinzelbach 1992 while yielding conforming velocity fields all existing postprocessing methods either face particular restrictions or induce numerical artifacts when applied to velocity fields that exhibit strong spatial variations which is among others the case for highly heterogeneous porous media selzer and cirpka 2020 the method of cordes and kinzelbach 1992 is well established in groundwater hydrology however it is restricted to two dimensional triangular and quadrilateral elements because its extension to three dimensions yields an under determined system of equations that cannot uniquely be solved cordes and kinzelbach 1992 putti and sartoretto 2009 selzer and cirpka 2020 the postprocessing techniques of larson and niklasson 2004 and sun and wheeler 2006 are defined as a local and a global method the local method is particularly appealing because no global system of equations has to be solved larson and niklasson 2004 scudeler et al 2016 however the method was only derived and numerically tested for the poisson equation larson and niklasson 2004 implying saturated flow and homogeneous material coefficients throughout the domain kees et al 2008 extended the approach to variably saturated flow while the approach of larson and niklasson 2004 has been applied to flow in heterogeneous porous media scudeler et al 2016 such an application may lead to pronounced numerical artifacts schiavazzi 2013 selzer and cirpka 2020 like spurious rotation or regions of anomalously high velocities in low flow regions artificial rotation has also occasionally been observed for some formulations of mixed finite element methods hoteit et al 2002 in order to overcome numerical artifacts postprocessing schemes have been developed in which the deviation between a finite element velocity field and a conforming velocity field are minimized within a weighted l 2 norm weights are either the inverse harmonic mean hydraulic conductivity on the element faces odsæter et al 2017 or the minimization is conducted at the elemental centroids employing the inverse of the elemental hydraulic conductivity tensor as weighting factor selzer and cirpka 2020 both schemes are exclusively developed for and applied to saturated flow the drawback of these approaches is that an additional global system of equations has to be solved which may be a saddle point problem of larger order than the initial fem discretization implying an increased computational effort and restrictions in the choice of the solver for the solution of the system of linear equations selzer cirpka 2020 while the numerical results of odsæter et al 2017 and selzer and cirpka 2020 are very accurate selzer and cirpka 2020 showed that such a postprocessing scheme may still induce numerical artifacts like artificial rotation if velocities vary by several orders of magnitude in regions of similar hydraulic conductivity solving a global system of equations within a velocity postprocessing scheme may be computationally more beneficial when the flow equation is either transient or non linear such as richards equation in that case postprocessing requires solving only a single system of linear equations for each time at which the velocity is to be evaluated this system of equations resembles that of a discretized linear steady state flow equation in which changes in storage may appear as a source or sink term and the non linear dependence of relative permeability on pressure head has already been accounted for in the preceding flow simulation postprocessing with a global system of equations remains computationally much faster than rerunning a full transient model solving the non linear richards equation by a method that yields a conforming velocity field to begin with we present a novel finite volume based reconstruction of fluxes on the primal grid that does not directly project a finite element type velocity field onto a conforming velocity field our approach based on a lowest order cell centered finite volume method requires solving a global system of linear equations that is strictly positive definite and whose size is on the order of the number of elements because lowest order finite volumes used here are numerically very stable the flux reconstruction does not introduce severe numerical artifacts such as artificial rotation or anomalously high velocities in regions of low hydraulic conductivity we also present a semi analytical particle tracking scheme for triangular prisms that uses the resulting velocity field our particle tracking scheme is analogous to pollock s method pollock 1988 and based on the scheme presented by selzer and cirpka 2020 for simplices hydrogeosphere aquanty inc 2015 therrien and sudicky 1996 is used to solve the variably saturated flow equation and generate the primal solution of the pressure head and relative permeability fields required for the reconstruction to demonstrate the potential of our method for catchment scale subsurface flow and transport modeling we apply it to an unstructured grid consisting of triangular prisms that discretize a real catchment 2 methods 2 1 model equations we describe variably saturated flow by a modified form of richards equation that allows for saturated unsaturated simulations and a mass conservative first order time discretization e g richardson 1922 richards 1931 celia et al 1990 1 θ ψ t q f where ψ is the pressure head l θ ψ is the volumetric water content t is time t f represents a volumetric source sink term expressed as a volume of fluid exchanged per unit time and unit bulk volume t 1 and q is the specific discharge lt 1 or darcy velocity defined by the extended form of darcy s law 2 q k r ψ k ψ z with h ψ z where k r ψ is the relative permeability k denotes the hydraulic conductivity tensor l t 1 z is the elevation head l and h is the hydraulic head l we use the parameterizations of mualem 1976 and van genuchten 1980 for the soil retention curve and the dependence of relative permeability on effective saturation and pressure head respectively 3 s e ψ 1 α

residual and saturated water contents respectively for transient flow the following approximation can be used for the term representing the change in storage in eq 1 6 θ ψ t θ ψ θ s s s ψ t θ ψ t where s s is the specific storage coefficient l 1 the solution of the three dimensional richards equation is approximated in a spatial domain ω r 3 with the boundary ω γ and within the time interval 0

fixed pressure head n is the outer unit normal vector q n is a specified normal flux and c 0 c 1 c 2 r are coefficients moreover γ d is the part of boundary γ with a dirichlet boundary condition γ n with a neumann boundary condition and γ r with a robin boundary condition a robin boundary condition is often also referred to as a third type boundary condition it can be written as a linear combination of the primary unknown and its derivative note that ω γ γ d γ n γ r and that γ d γ n and γ r are pairwise disjoint 2 2 spatial discretization of the domain and set notation let t be a conforming subdivision of ω in triangular prismatic elements the elements are denoted e i t with i 1 2 n where n is the total number of elements furthermore we use the indices i d n r to denote the inner domain the dirichlet boundary the neumann boundary and the robin boundary respectively let n be the set of nodes then n i n d n n and n r are the sets of nodes in the inner domain at the dirichlet neumann and robin boundary respectively these sets of nodes are pairwise disjoint whereas individual elements might belong to more than one type of boundary moreover f is the set of elemental faces m 1 2 m with m being the total number of faces which can be uniquely split into sets f i f d f n which are the sets of the faces in the interior of the domain at the dirichlet boundary and at the neumann boundary respectively these sets are pairwise disjoint furthermore f e denotes the faces belonging to an element and n e denotes the nodes belonging to an element whereas n f denotes the set of nodes belonging to an individual face we further define n e as the unit vector normal to the boundary of element e which is pointing outwards additionally we specify n e f as the unit normal vector pointing outwards of element e on a face f whereas ν f is a unit normal vector on face f following a sign convention we use to denote the measure of a set in particular e denotes the volume of an element and f denotes the area of a face 2 3 flux reconstruction by cell centered finite volumes we assume that a node centered solution of eq 1 is already available typically computed by the standard galerkin finite element method or by some finite difference scheme such a solution is known to be not mass conservative in the elements e g cordes and kinzelbach 1992 larson and niklasson 2004 odsæter et al 2017 putti and sartoretto 2009 in finite element models the normal velocity component exhibits a jump across element faces e g odsæter et al 2017 leading to an inconsistent velocity field which is not suitable for particle tracking in standard finite difference methods the velocity component normal to a cell boundary is not defined while cell centered finite volume schemes are sometimes denoted finite difference methods by their developers e g mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 the original finite difference method does not perform a mass balance in cells and mass conservation is not guaranteed we use hydrogeosphere in finite difference mode to obtain a steady state variably saturated flow solution aquanty inc 2015 therrien and sudicky 1996 the finite difference method of hydrogeosphere is formulated in finite element terms that neglects the cross terms so that only direct connections between nodes that correspond to the primal grid are retained therrien and sudicky 1996 thus the approximation of the hydraulic head field may be imagined as a continuous solution on these direct connections resembling a network of lines on element edges when visualizing the hydraulic head solution a bilinear interpolation within the prismatic elements is typically assumed which is not fully consistent with the way heads have been computed taking the hydrogeosphere pressure head solution to obtain nodal values of the relative permeability in each element and the storage related divergence of the flow field we present a flux reconstruction that is locally mass conservative in the elements and conforming on the element faces to do so we recompute the hydraulic head governed by the richards eq 1 with a lowest order cell centered finite volume method using the elements as control volumes from the finite volume solution we can construct the velocity field in lowest order raviart thomas nédélec rtn 0 space on triangular prisms forming the basis for consistent particle tracking the following description of the lowest order finite volume flux reconstruction heavily relies on the description given by selzer and cirpka 2020 finite volume schemes are based on conserving the quantity of interest in our case the fluid mass assuming constant fluid density in each element 8 e q d x e f d x e t where f f θ t includs the expanded change in storage eq 6 applying the divergence theorem yields 9 f f e f n e f q d s e f d x e t for setting up the system of linear equations we expand the discretization by treating dirichlet and neumann faces as ghost elements implying explicit head values at these faces a lowest order finite difference approximation of the flux on the boundary of the elements together with a weighted approximation of the material coefficients yields the mobility coefficients m i j on the faces for neighboring elements 10 m i j s i j k r i j f ℓ i k i ℓ j k j ℓ 2 on f e i e j f i f k r i j k i ℓ i on f e i γ d f d e j γ d c on f f n where i and j are the indices of two neighboring elements and k i and k j are the isotropic saturated hydraulic conductivities of the elements i and j respectively in the anisotropic case these saturated conductivity values would represent the conductivity in the direction of the normal vector on face f furthermore ℓ ℓ i ℓ j is the distance between the centroids of the triangular prisms i and j whereas ℓ i and ℓ j are the parts within elements i and j respectively s i j is an orthogonal correction factor accounting for the fact that the approximated flux is in general not normal to the face f e i e j k r i j is the relative permeability on the face f and c 0 including anisotropy as a full tensor would be possible in a cell centered finite volume flux reconstruction but it is beyond our consideration as an example edwards 2002 derived such techniques for a dual grid to unstructured triangular meshes friis et al 2009 and edwards and zheng 2010 extended this approach to the primal grid using a dual grid and transformations of coordinates similar to those known from finite elements on subspaces which yields a more versatile finite volume formulation but also adds to the computational costs another possible route for including anisotropy may be facilitated by incorporating a flux approximation scheme similar to the one suggested by su et al 2020 as mentioned above the discretization t is expanded by ghost elements on faces in order to account for dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions in contrast to a standard cell centered finite volume discretization we do not use the distance weighted harmonic mean to compute the mobility coefficients but a distance weighted arithmetic mean this turned out to be more stable and better mimics the primal hydraulic head solution obtained by the finite difference mode of hydrogeosphere celia et al 1990 also used an unweighted arithmetic mean of hydraulic conductivities to obtain an equivalent approximation of spatial derivatives between a finite difference method and the standard galerkin finite element method on a one dimensional regular grid in order to compute the correction factor s i j we consider the projection of the distance vector ℓ connecting the centroids of the elements i and j onto the direction of the normal vector 11 s i j ℓ ℓ ν f ℓ 2 ℓ 2 f e i e j e i e j t for the approximation of the relative permeability on the faces k r i j we need to consider that the finite element type scheme may yield different values of k r for the same node in the different elements i and j sharing the node if material properties differ between elements i and j for a flux reconstruction we need to approximate a single relative permeability per face we do this by first linearly interpolating the nodal values belonging to each element to the centroid of the face which is the arithmetic mean of the nodal values and then applying upstream weighting that is taking the relative permeability of the element that has the larger hydraulic head h z ψ at its element centroid in the initial finite element or finite difference solution 12 k r i j 1 n f n n f k r i n f f e i if h c i h c j or f γ 1 n f n n f k r j n f f e j if h c j h c i where n f is the number of nodes on face f k r i n and k r j n are the relative permeabilities at node n in the elements i and j respectively whereas h c i and h c j are the hydraulic heads at the centroids of elements i and j respectively additionally we set the relative permeability of a node exhibiting recharge to one which we found necessary for accurately mimicking some primary solutions as these nodes experience a water influx during a recharge event the water saturation is close to unity anyway with these approximations we can specify the resulting system of linear equations by assembling the mass balance equations for all elements 13 a h r where a is the mobility matrix h is a pseudo hydraulic head which we call the pseudo potential defined on the centroids of the elements which leads to mass conservative and conforming fluxes and r is the right hand side vector including the divergence of the flux f integrated over the element as well as boundary conditions after computing the pseudo potential we can reconstruct the mass conservative lowest order fluxes on the faces which are a prerequisite for particle tracking in rtn 0 space in the following we give the mass balance equation for an inner element e i 14 for e i t j e i e j f m i j h i h j f i e i where h i is the pseudo potential at the centroid of element i whereas h j is either the corresponding pseudo potential at the centroid of element j or the fixed potential at a dirichlet boundary condition h d m or the pseudo potential associated to a neumann boundary condition h n m which is set such that the flux between the neumann boundary and the i th element is fixed furthermore f i is the source or sink strength including the change in storage associated to the centroid of the element e i a robin boundary condition is applied by setting a reference potential h r m and giving a conductance c m l 2 t 1 associated to the face m for computing the total flux towards the i th element for setting a robin boundary condition eq 14 is superimposed with 15 c m h i h r m q m where q m l 3 t 1 is a total flux on face m which leads to an additional mobility coefficient on the main diagonal of matrix a in eq 13 and an entry in the right hand side vector of the system 13 if element i is a face belonging to a dirichlet or a neumann boundary the resulting i th equation is 16 for e i f m f d h i h d m 17 for e i f m f n c m h n m h j q n m f m where h d m is the hydraulic head associated to a dirichlet face h n m is a hydraulic head at a neumann face defined such that the normal component of the specific discharge entering or exiting through element e i is equal to q n m including a sign denoting the direction of the flux and c m l 2 t 1 is a positive scalar 2 4 the rtn 0 velocity field in mixed coordinates on triangular prisms a triangular prism can be represented as a superposition of two simplices a line and a triangle while element wise analytical particle tracking on simplices is feasible in both global and local coordinates we need to employ local coordinates when analyzing the velocity field in deformed non simplicial elements upon transformation from global to local coordinates all arbitrarily deformed triangular prisms become the same reference prism in subsurface flow modeling however it is common practice to start the discretization with triangulation in the horizontal coordinates followed by expanding the triangles at the horizontal nodes in the vertical direction this allows defining a reference prism in mixed coordinates in which the horizontal local coordinates equal the corresponding global coordinates while the vertical coordinates are mapped to the unit interval and therefore scaled between 0 at the bottom of the prism and 1 at the top thus our reference prism is not fixed but it combines the triangular base area in global coordinates mapped to local coordinates of the same value with a unit height by this we have separated the horizontal from the vertical dimension we can still conduct horizontal particle tracking in global coordinates on triangles while tracking the particles in the vertical within the unit interval then the three dimensional trajectory is given by direct superposition the rtn 0 velocity space is a lowest order velocity approximation within the individual elements yielding a distinct velocity vector in every spatial coordinate nédélec 1980 1986 raviart and thomas 1977 in rtn 0 space the spatial dimensions are independent of each other yielding together with a constant normal component of the velocity on the element boundary for the reference element a bilinear approximation of the velocity within the triangular prisms before describing the actual velocity space a few prerequisites on transformations of coordinates are necessary in the following we use x to denote the physical coordinates in three spatial dimensions x x y z furthermore we use x to denote the coordinates in a local coordinate system associated to a reference element such that the three spatial dimensions are x x y z for the transformation of coordinates we need the jacobian matrix j of partial derivatives 18 j i j x i x j 19 j x n x p r i where i ranges over the dimensions in physical global coordinates and j ranges over the dimensions in local coordinates x n is the gradient of the shape functions n defining the reference prism in local coordinates and x p r i contains the global coordinates of all nodes of the physical prism the gradient of the shape functions in global coordinates x n can now be determined by 20 x n j 1 x n for the integration over the element volume the following rule applies 21 e x d x e x det j d x where e x is an element in global and e x is an element in local coordinates respectively the same rule applies to integrations within the element like the pathline integration employed in particle tracking furthermore the transformation of coordinates is linear such that e g rognes et al 2009 22 x j x c considering the transformation shown in eq 22 we also see that the barycentric weights on a simplex in local coordinates are the same for every point in the element as in global coordinates which is a useful attribute one may exploit for example for mapping particle locations from physical to local coordinates the described transformation from local to global coordinates is often called piola transformation it is a standard procedure in finite element simulations of scalar state variables like hydraulic heads approximated at the nodes and interpolated within the element for mapping a vector field onto a space which either preserves the divergence or the curl special rules for transforming normal and tangential traces on the element faces apply these rules are explained in great detail by rognes et al 2009 on whose descriptions and derivations we rely as particle tracking is based on conforming velocity fields implying mass conservation we opted for the lowest order velocity space which preserves the divergence facilitating the derivation of analytical solutions of trajectories in the elements contravariant piola transformation applies to the normal traces of the velocity in rtn 0 space considering this rognes et al 2009 showed that the following transformation rule is valid 23 f ϕ x n in global coordinates f 0 φ x n 0 in local coordinates where f is the measure of a face in global coordinates f 0 is the measure of the same face in local coordinates n is the normal vector on f in global coordinates pointing outwards and n 0 is the same normal vector in local coordinates ϕ x is a vector valued function approximated in some velocity space on the elements in global coordinates and φ x is the equivalent vector valued function in local coordinates from eq 23 one directly sees that transforming the normal component of a vector field on an element boundary from one coordinate system to the other reduces to the multiplication with a scaling factor equal to the ratio of the measures of the faces in the two coordinate systems as mentioned above we consider prisms with a constant triangular base area in the horizontal directions and linearly varying height we opt for a reference prism in mixed coordinates in which the horizontal coordinates have the same value as in global horizontal coordinates without the unit whereas the vertical extension of the prism is scaled to the dimensionless unit interval z 0 1 for this choice of local coordinates the determinant of the jacobian becomes 24 det j x y h e x y where h e is the scalar value of the height of the prism at the horizontal coordinates x y although having dimensions of l 3 this gives an intuitive measure on the magnitude of variation of det j within the element also particle tracking in the horizontal directions can be conducted in global coordinates saving transformations of coordinates mapping of faces and associated bookkeeping for a triangular prism e i the specific discharge vector q e i m i x e d q x i q y i q z i in mixed coordinates can be computed by 25 q x i f t r i e t r i f t r i 2 e t r i x p x f t r i

linear variation of the horizontal specific discharge component in an element i and can be computed by summation note that the horizontal specific discharge components q x i and q y i in the eqs 25 and 26 are given in global physical coordinates having dimensions of l t 1 while the vertical specific discharge component q z in eq 27 is given in the local coordinates of the mixed reference prism having dimensions of an inverse time if the eqs 25 and 26 were formulated in the local coordinates of the mixed reference prism the horizontal specific discharge components also would have dimensions of an inverse time while the values of all variables would remain the same although being dimensionless in space fig 1 while there is a linear dependence of q z with z the linear variation of the height and therefore of the determinant of the jacobian h e x y in the horizontal coordinates leads to a complicated dependence of q z on the mixed coordinates x y z the specific discharge vector q e

particle tracking for a given velocity field v x t particle trajectories x p t and associated travel times τ are computed by 29 x p t x t 0 t 0 t v τ d τ 30 τ s 1 v s 2 d s where x t 0 is the vector of starting coordinates s is the curvilinear trajectory while s denotes all coordinates defining s and v denotes the linear average velocity which determines the particle trajectory s and which is related to the specific discharge vector q by 31 v q θ in the following we assume that the volumetric water content θ is constant within an element in our scheme this constant water content is the arithmetic mean of the volumetric water contents at the nodes of the element of interest which equals a linear interpolation to the centroid given a conforming velocity field in an appropriate velocity space particle tracking can either be computed by numerical integration e g matringe et al 2006 srinivasan and lipnikov 2013 or analytically e g crane and blunt 1999 loschko et al 2016 matringe et al 2006 pollock 1988 prévost et al 2002 selzer and cirpka 2020 the key idea of the semi analytical methods is to evaluate the particle trajectory analytically based on an element wise given velocity field which is numerically approximated in this approach the exit point and travel time are determined from the entry point by closed form integration of the kinematic equation using the velocity approximation within the element the particle is then tracked further in the neighboring element until it has reached an outflow boundary or the total travel time to be simulated has been reached the advantages of the semi analytical approach is that the integration within the elements is exact eqs 25 and 26 indicate that in our flux approximation on deformed prisms the horizontal specific discharge components q x and q y within an element vary linearly in their respective direction while they are constant in all other directions because we assume that the volumetric water content is constant within the element the same properties hold for the horizontal components of the linear average velocity v x and v y eq 27 shows that the local vertical specific discharge q z on deformed prisms depends not only on the local vertical coordinate z but also on the horizontal coordinates which complicates the analytical evaluation of vertical displacements rather than performing a numerical integration we decided to simplify eq 27 by the following approximation for an analogical simplification compare prévost et al 2002 32 q z i z 1 q b o t t o m i f b o t t o m f 0 b o t t o

spatial specific discharge components are decoupled the semi analytical approach of pollock 1988 relies on such decoupled velocity components within elements in our adaptation it consists of the following steps 1 extend the faces of the element to infinite planes 2 for a starting location x 0 within the element or at an inflow face of the element determine which faces are potential exit faces for the particle the velocity component normal to such a face must be oriented outwards of the element 3 for a given element i and each potential exit plane m determine the travel time τ i m it would take to reach that plane by analytical integration for a dimension d x y z 33 τ i m θ i x i m d x 0 d a d i if b d i ε b θ i b d i ln a d i b d i x i m d a d i b d i x 0 d otherwise where a d i a x i a y i a z i and b d i b h i b z i are the coefficients describing the linear dependence of the specific discharge component in its dimension d in the element e i x i m d is the possible exit location on the face f m in dimension d note that if e i takes a sink not projected on e i like it would be the case for an extraction well the exit location x i m d could be also within the element x 0 d x 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is the coordinate of the starting location x 0 being in element e i or on e i note that τ i m is the same for a possible exit location for every dimension d ε b is a small number on the order of 100 times the relative machine precision 4 the actual travel time τ i within the element is now the minimum positive and real travel time towards all face carrying planes or the center of an internal sink 5 with the given travel time τ i the exit point x e x x e x y e x z e x in mixed coordinates is now given by 34 x e x x 0 a x i θ i τ i if b h i ε b x 0 a x i b h i exp b h i θ i τ i a x

otherwise 6 back transform the local vertical coordinate z e x to the corresponding physical coordinate z e x 7 determine whether the particle has reached an outflow boundary of the domain or the center of an internal sink if not analyze which neighboring element e j will be entered switch to that element such that e j becomes e i set x 0 x e x and repeat all steps selzer and cirpka 2020 give analytical expressions on how to perform these calculations most efficiently for triangles these expressions directly apply for the horizontal tracking in the triangular prisms depending on the application we keep track of the full particle trajectory keep only travel times and the type of boundary where the particle exits the domain or travel times spent in elements of specific material properties by reverting the velocity field and the time arrow we can also evaluate where particles have come from how long they have been in the domain and how much time they spent in certain zones 2 6 implementation the primal solution is obtained using hydrogeosphere on windows 10 aquanty inc 2015 therrien and sudicky 1996 using the finite difference mode and mass lumping the particle tracking framework is implemented in matlab 2016b and it reads either binary or ascii output files generated by hydrogeosphere for transient flow the nodal volumetric water content is reconstructed for every element using the van genuchten parameterization see eq 4 the framework is split into three major parts the first computes all geometrical properties and has to be run once per grid the second is the fvm flux reconstruction that is run once per time level for which a flux reconstruction is requested we solve the final linear system of eq 13 by the stabilized biconjugate gradients method in matlab using an incomplete lu factorization as preconditioner and a starting vector computed from the primal hydraulic head solution linearly interpolated to the centroids of the elements the third part is the actual particle tracking routine here the algorithm switches for every element individually between non divergent and divergent flow according to a user defined criterion reflecting numerical accuracy 3 numerical results we evaluate the performance of our fvm flux reconstruction in two ways first we compare the hydraulic heads of the fvm reconstruction to the hydraulic heads of the primal solution obtained with hydrogeosphere in the finite difference mode panday et al 1993 therrien and sudicky 1996 note that the heads of the fvm reconstruction are not used for any evaluation other than computing mass conservative fluxes in rtn 0 space suitable for consistent particle tracking in the comparison of heads we contrast the fvm heads of the elements to the hydrogeosphere heads at the centroids of the elements evaluated by bilinear interpolation of the respective nodal values within the triangular prism the second demonstration of the performance of the fvm flux reconstruction is by illustrating consistent particle tracks resulting from this flux reconstruction compared to particle tracks based on the velocity field directly derived from the primal solution such trajectories may stagnate because the underlying velocity field is non conforming we also apply our framework to a three dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow model connecting two floodplains close to tübingen germany allgeier et al 2020 by this we demonstrate the applicability of our framework to catchment scale applications 3 1 benchmark model recharge in a subarea of the top boundary our first benchmark model considers a cubic domain having dimensions of 10 m 10 m 10 m the domain is discretized by 12 692 nodes and 22 572 elements in 18 elemental layers the vertical discretization is refined at the top of the domain and around the height of the dirichlet boundary conditions on the left and right sides of the domain we assign homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions with a constant hydraulic head h f i x 6 m the front back and bottom sides are no flow boundaries a recharge zone is located at the center of the top of the domain the zone is a square with dimensions of 3 m 3 m and the applied recharge rate is 200 mm a we assume a uniform saturated hydraulic conductivity of 10 5 m s saturated and residual water contents of 0 4 and 0 065 respectively and van genuchten parameters α 7 5 1 m and n 1 89 fig 2 illustrates simulated hydraulic heads according to the primal solution of hydrogeosphere in finite difference mode fig 2a and the fvm reconstruction fig 2b for steady state flow the two head solutions are very close to each other as quantified by the ratios in the top fig 2c and bottom fig 2d layers it can be observed that the top layer heads of the fvm reconstruction fig 2b drop slightly faster towards the lateral boundaries of the domain than the heads of the primal solution fig 2a leading to slightly lower hydraulic heads in the top layer for elements that are outside of the recharge zone in the recharge zone and its direct vicinity the head solutions are very close to each other on the dirichlet boundaries the heads of both solutions are forced to be identical leading to excellent agreement in the direct vicinity of those boundaries within the saturated zone illustrated by the solutions of the bottom layer fig 2d the hydraulic heads computed by the two methods are identical within computational precision the excellent agreement may be attributed to the simple setup of the model we would expect small differences between the primal solution and the fvm reconstruction because the solutions are based on different numerical methods for instance the primal solution is computed on the nodes of the elements whereas the fvm reconstruction yields an average solution for each element fig 3 shows particle trajectories for the model of a rectangular recharge zone at the centroid of every recharge face at the top of the domain a particle is introduced and tracked through the domain fig 3a shows the particle trajectories for the conforming velocity solution based on the fvm flux reconstruction the particle tracks show a reasonable pattern all particles reach the two possible outlets at the dirichlet boundaries and the expected symmetries of the trajectory patterns are overall achieved fig 3b shows the particle trajectories using a velocity field based on the primal fem type solution for this plot the velocity is evaluated at the centroid of each element and assumed constant within the element while the patterns of the trajectories obtained by the two methods are overall similar two particles stagnate in the fem type solution due to the non conformity of the velocity field which can lead to normal velocities at element faces that point outwards of each element this prevents further tracking in a consistent manner 3 2 case study particle trajectories in a floodplain we now apply our fvm flux reconstruction and particle tracking scheme to a subsurface flow model on the scale of a sub catchment the model was originally developed for a stochastic analysis of groundwater divides allgeier et al 2020 in the following we use a single realization of the original ensemble to demonstrate the applicability of our scheme the model simulates variably saturated flow in the ammer floodplain and its surroundings close to tübingen in south western germany martin et al 2020 the domain is discretized by 74 412 nodes and 138 565 deformed triangular prisms 35 layers of 3959 elements each like in the benchmark case we use hydrogeosphere in finite difference mode to obtain the steady state solution of richards eq 1 towards this end we simulate transient flow with constant forcings until steady state was reached based on this solution we perform our fvm flux reconstruction and the particle tracking the subsurface is subdivided into different hydrostratigraphic units following the layered structure of an underlying regional geological model d affonseca et al 2020 and studies within the floodplain martin et al 2020 the bedrock consists of a sequence of mud and sandstones with a weathering layer of higher hydraulic conductivity quaternary fillings in the valleys form alluvial aquifers separated by clay layers we consider the differences of hydraulic conductivity between the hydrostratigraphic units to be higher than the internal variability and assigned each unit a uniform set of hydraulic parameters saturated hydraulic conductivities range between 5 10 10 m s vertical conductivity in the top colluvial clay and 3 10 4 m s horizontal conductivity in the gravel aquifer of the floodplain vertical hydraulic conductivities of the units differ from their horizontal counterparts for the sake of simplicity we approximate the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the mobility coefficients eq 10 by taking the vertical hydraulic conductivities for the vertical connections and the horizontal hydraulic conductivities for the horizontal connections we assign dirichlet boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet faces of the floodplain filling as well as at the southern boundary of the domain at the top of the domain we assign neumann boundary conditions according to the net infiltration rates which varies between 20 and 60 mm a depending on land use robin boundary conditions are used to simulate the exchange between groundwater and the ammer river as well as the seepage of groundwater into artificial drainage channels all other boundaries are no flow boundaries all boundary conditions are assumed to be constant over time and we simulate subsurface flow until steady state is reached fig 4 presents contourlines of hydraulic heads according to the primal solution and the fvm reconstruction at the element centroids at the top and bottom of the domain the two hydraulic head fields are very similar at the top of the domain fig 4a and b the system is mostly unsaturated in particular towards the west the depth to the water table is fairly large here the values of hydraulic head differ the most between the primal solution and the fvm reconstruction at the bottom of the domain fig 4c and d the system is fully water saturated also here we see some differences in the hydraulic head distribution however the major objective of the fvm reconstruction is to obtain a conforming velocity field rather than exactly reproducing the hydraulic head field of the finite element type simulation by finite volumes we use the fvm reconstruction to delineate various sub catchments by particle tracking towards this end we place a particle at the centroid of each top face of the domain and track the particle until it has reached an outflow boundary in total these are 3959 particle tracks visualized in fig 5 fig 5 shows a two dimensional horizontal projection of the resulting particle tracks the trajectories are colored according to the outlet where they end up a local groundwater divide becomes apparent between all orange particle tracks reaching the southern groundwater outlet in the neckar valley and the remaining particles ending up in the ammer valley all inserted particles reach an outflow boundary that is no particles get stuck in the domain or exit at non physical destinations in practice the tecplot tecplot inc 2019 visualization and analysis platform is often used as visualization software for hydrogeosphere results tecplot can trace streamlines using the element wise given velocity field although this visualization software is not designed for rigorous and consistent particle tracking a qualitative comparison of the streamlines generated by tecplot revealed a good general agreement regarding the overall pattern with our particle tracking approach however like in our first benchmark case in which we used a velocity field derived from the primal solution at the centroids fig 3 some particles released at the surface do not reach an outlet boundary condition when tracked by tecplot instead they stagnate within the domain or erroneously reach a no flow boundary or even an inflow boundary moreover we deem our trajectories to be more accurate the major advantage of consistent particle tracking based on conforming velocity fields is physical and numerical accuracy of the flow paths which avoids non physical exit locations or stagnation of particles table 1 summarizes the wall clock and cpu times needed for achieving the primal solution as well as the times needed for the finite volume flux reconstruction here we differentiate between the effort to perform geometry related computations and the actual fvm flux reconstruction for an increased representativeness we report the averages and the standard deviations of run times for ten model runs each additionally we give the time needed to compute the trajectories of all 3959 individual particles on the cpu the results of table 1 clearly show that computing the primal solution is the time limiting step in the computations the postprocessing as well as the particle tracking take only about a tenth of the time which is needed for computing the primal solution 4 conclusions consistent particle tracking relies on conforming velocity fields which locally preserve mass in the elements and yield a continuous normal component of the velocity on the element faces we have presented a postprocessing scheme for non conforming velocity fields by reconstructing the hydraulic head and associated flux distribution by cell centered finite volumes of lowest order our flux reconstruction can be coupled to a finite element type primal solution of variably saturated flow based on this we formulated a semi analytical particle tracking scheme relying on element wise analytical solutions of the particle trajectories in rtn 0 space we showed that our fvm flux reconstruction yields hydraulic head fields which are close to the initial solution computed by hydrogeosphere in finite difference mode therrien and sudicky 1996 in the fvm reconstruction we make use of the relative permeabilities of the primal solution assuming that the latter already accounts for the non linearity of richards equation also we consider storage changes of the primal solution as known divergence in an otherwise steady state simulation in the fvm reconstruction this is computationally much faster than computing a conforming solution from scratch compared to preceding flux corrections e g larson and niklasson 2004 scudeler et al 2016 selzer and cirpka 2020 sun and wheeler 2006 the proposed scheme is absolutely stable and does not lead to severe numerical artifacts like velocities being too high by orders of magnitude in low velocity regions or reverted velocities in such regions compare schiavazzi 2013 selzer and cirpka 2020 these advantages come at the cost of accurately mimicking the primal model including all material properties and boundary conditions in the fvm reconstruction for non deformed triangular prisms our analytical approach is exact the inaccuracy increases the more deformed the prism is and the more the bottom and the top faces are tilted towards each other as well as the more the height of the element at the centroid differs from the mean height along the trajectory however we think that in catchment scale hydrological modeling the major uncertainty is in the approximation of material properties uncertain boundary conditions and in simplifications of the physical representation such as neglecting preferential flow paths in contrast the prisms normally used in catchment scale subsurface hydrological modeling are often only moderately deformed therefore we believe that the additionally introduced inaccuracy is small compared to the other inaccuracies present in most catchment scale variably saturated flow models and the approximation above is justified by the gain in computational efficiency we have shown that our fvm flux reconstruction as well as the associated particle tracking scheme on potentially deformed triangular prisms can be applied to realistic subsurface flow models on the catchment scale including varying element geometries several geological layers and heterogeneous boundary conditions our scheme is accurate gives results close to the primal solution in the hydraulic head reconstruction and avoid gaps in definition the particle trajectories can be used for the delineation of capture zones or for streamline based simulations of reactive transport

274,consistent particle tracking relies on conforming velocity fields that ensure local mass conservation on elements cell centered finite volume and mixed finite element methods result in conforming velocity fields but this is not the case for continuous galerkin methods such as the standard finite element method fem nonetheless standard fem is often used for subsurface flow modeling because it yields a continuous approximation of hydraulic heads and it naturally handles unstructured grids and full material tensors acknowledging these advantages and the wide spread use of finite element type simulations we present a postprocessing method that reconstructs a cell centered finite volume solution from a finite element type solution of the variably saturated subsurface flow equation to obtain conforming mass conservative fluxes using the linear average velocity field derived from these fluid fluxes we employ element wise analytical solutions for triangular prisms to compute particle trajectories and associated travel times as a result we can compute consistent particle trajectories for variably saturated flow solutions generated by node centered methods such as finite element or finite difference methods that do not yield conforming velocity fields our flux reconstruction solves a linear elliptic problem whose size is on the order of the number of elements which is computationally much faster than solving the initial non linear transient variably saturated flow equation compared to other postprocessing schemes our flux reconstruction is numerically stable fast to compute and does not induce severe numerical artifacts when applied to heterogeneous domains with strongly varying velocities however these advantages come with a comparably high coding effort and the necessity of solving a global system of equations we show that the results of our flux reconstruction are close to the node centered primal solution for variably saturated three dimensional flow with heterogeneous material properties keywords cell centered finite volume method finite element method particle tracking local mass conservation triangular prisms variably saturated flow 1 introduction standard continuous finite element and related methods are popular for subsurface flow simulations because they easily allow for unstructured grids and yield physically realistic continuous hydraulic head fields while cell centered finite volume formulations on an unstructured primal grid are possible see e g friis et al 2009 edwards and zheng 2010 selzer and cirpka 2020 vertex centered finite volumes e g huber and helmig 2000 or other formulations on a dual grid edwards 2002 are more common also full material tensors can be incorporated in finite volumes as an example edwards 2002 derived such techniques for a dual grid to unstructured triangular meshes friis et al 2009 and edwards and zheng 2010 extended this approach to the primal grid using a dual grid and transformations of coordinates similar to those known from finite elements on subspaces leading to more flexible schemes but also to a considerable computational overhead while continuous galerkin methods like the standard fem and related techniques yield a continuous primary unknown i e a physically realistic hydraulic head field this is not the case for finite volume type techniques mixed finite element methods and discontinuous galerkin methods which in general lead to a jump of the primary unknown on element boundaries odsæter et al 2017 selzer and cirpka 2020 bastian and rivière 2003 larson and niklasson 2004 sun and wheeler 2006 hoteit et al 2002 however in contrast to finite volume type techniques standard fem and related methods yield non conforming velocity fields with the normal flux component being discontinuous across element boundaries and mass is not conserved locally in the elements this yields a physically unrealistic jump of the velocity on element boundaries odsæter et al 2017 selzer and cirpka 2020 bastian and rivière 2003 larson and niklasson 2004 sun and wheeler 2006 hoteit et al 2002 putti and sartoretto 2009 overall one may conclude that standard fem is the method of choice if the primary interest lies in the hydraulic heads while finite volume type techniques are favorable if the primary interest lies in the velocities non conforming velocity fields can cause severe problems for solute transport simulations that are based on particle tracking particle tracking methods require velocity fields generated by a preceding solution of the flow equation especially for advection dominated transport these methods represent an attractive alternative to solving the advection dispersion equation by eulerian methods because they do not suffer from the drawbacks of numerical dispersion or spurious negative concentrations cirpka et al 1999 2015 crane and blunt 1999 neglecting transverse dispersion particle tracking replaces an explicit three dimensional description of solute transport by a one dimensional representation employing travel time atchley et al 2013 crane and blunt 1999 ginn 2001 loschko et al 2016 shapiro and cvetkovic 1988 it yields an easy to compute approximation of flow paths and travel times and can also be used to study among others the effects of sedimentary anisotropy on solute transport bennett et al 2017 however particle tracking represents a consistent method for solving solute transport only if it is based on a conforming velocity field which implies that the normal component of the flux is continuous on element boundaries and mass is conserved in the elements such velocity fields may originate from a cell centered finite volume method loschko et al 2016 pollock 1988 a mixed finite element method juanes and matringe 2009 matringe et al 2006 putti and sartoretto 2009 or from an h d i v projection of a non conforming velocity field bastian and rivière 2003 cordes and kinzelbach 1992 kees et al 2008 larson and niklasson 2004 odsæter et al 2017 selzer and cirpka 2020 sun and wheeler 2006 vidotto et al 2018 several postprocessing techniques have been developed to obtain conforming velocity fields from fem solutions these techniques have allowed to simulate solute transport by godunov type finite volume methods scudeler et al 2016 discontinuous galerkin methods odsæter et al 2017 or particle tracking cordes and kinzelbach 1992 selzer and cirpka 2020 simulations were either conducted on the primal grid kees et al 2008 larson and niklasson 2004 odsæter et al 2017 selzer and cirpka 2020 sun and wheeler 2006 or on a dual grid cordes and kinzelbach 1992 while yielding conforming velocity fields all existing postprocessing methods either face particular restrictions or induce numerical artifacts when applied to velocity fields that exhibit strong spatial variations which is among others the case for highly heterogeneous porous media selzer and cirpka 2020 the method of cordes and kinzelbach 1992 is well established in groundwater hydrology however it is restricted to two dimensional triangular and quadrilateral elements because its extension to three dimensions yields an under determined system of equations that cannot uniquely be solved cordes and kinzelbach 1992 putti and sartoretto 2009 selzer and cirpka 2020 the postprocessing techniques of larson and niklasson 2004 and sun and wheeler 2006 are defined as a local and a global method the local method is particularly appealing because no global system of equations has to be solved larson and niklasson 2004 scudeler et al 2016 however the method was only derived and numerically tested for the poisson equation larson and niklasson 2004 implying saturated flow and homogeneous material coefficients throughout the domain kees et al 2008 extended the approach to variably saturated flow while the approach of larson and niklasson 2004 has been applied to flow in heterogeneous porous media scudeler et al 2016 such an application may lead to pronounced numerical artifacts schiavazzi 2013 selzer and cirpka 2020 like spurious rotation or regions of anomalously high velocities in low flow regions artificial rotation has also occasionally been observed for some formulations of mixed finite element methods hoteit et al 2002 in order to overcome numerical artifacts postprocessing schemes have been developed in which the deviation between a finite element velocity field and a conforming velocity field are minimized within a weighted l 2 norm weights are either the inverse harmonic mean hydraulic conductivity on the element faces odsæter et al 2017 or the minimization is conducted at the elemental centroids employing the inverse of the elemental hydraulic conductivity tensor as weighting factor selzer and cirpka 2020 both schemes are exclusively developed for and applied to saturated flow the drawback of these approaches is that an additional global system of equations has to be solved which may be a saddle point problem of larger order than the initial fem discretization implying an increased computational effort and restrictions in the choice of the solver for the solution of the system of linear equations selzer cirpka 2020 while the numerical results of odsæter et al 2017 and selzer and cirpka 2020 are very accurate selzer and cirpka 2020 showed that such a postprocessing scheme may still induce numerical artifacts like artificial rotation if velocities vary by several orders of magnitude in regions of similar hydraulic conductivity solving a global system of equations within a velocity postprocessing scheme may be computationally more beneficial when the flow equation is either transient or non linear such as richards equation in that case postprocessing requires solving only a single system of linear equations for each time at which the velocity is to be evaluated this system of equations resembles that of a discretized linear steady state flow equation in which changes in storage may appear as a source or sink term and the non linear dependence of relative permeability on pressure head has already been accounted for in the preceding flow simulation postprocessing with a global system of equations remains computationally much faster than rerunning a full transient model solving the non linear richards equation by a method that yields a conforming velocity field to begin with we present a novel finite volume based reconstruction of fluxes on the primal grid that does not directly project a finite element type velocity field onto a conforming velocity field our approach based on a lowest order cell centered finite volume method requires solving a global system of linear equations that is strictly positive definite and whose size is on the order of the number of elements because lowest order finite volumes used here are numerically very stable the flux reconstruction does not introduce severe numerical artifacts such as artificial rotation or anomalously high velocities in regions of low hydraulic conductivity we also present a semi analytical particle tracking scheme for triangular prisms that uses the resulting velocity field our particle tracking scheme is analogous to pollock s method pollock 1988 and based on the scheme presented by selzer and cirpka 2020 for simplices hydrogeosphere aquanty inc 2015 therrien and sudicky 1996 is used to solve the variably saturated flow equation and generate the primal solution of the pressure head and relative permeability fields required for the reconstruction to demonstrate the potential of our method for catchment scale subsurface flow and transport modeling we apply it to an unstructured grid consisting of triangular prisms that discretize a real catchment 2 methods 2 1 model equations we describe variably saturated flow by a modified form of richards equation that allows for saturated unsaturated simulations and a mass conservative first order time discretization e g richardson 1922 richards 1931 celia et al 1990 1 θ ψ t q f where ψ is the pressure head l θ ψ is the volumetric water content t is time t f represents a volumetric source sink term expressed as a volume of fluid exchanged per unit time and unit bulk volume t 1 and q is the specific discharge lt 1 or darcy velocity defined by the extended form of darcy s law 2 q k r ψ k ψ z with h ψ z where k r ψ is the relative permeability k denotes the hydraulic conductivity tensor l t 1 z is the elevation head l and h is the hydraulic head l we use the parameterizations of mualem 1976 and van genuchten 1980 for the soil retention curve and the dependence of relative permeability on effective saturation and pressure head respectively 3 s e ψ 1 α ψ n 1 n n if ψ 0 1 if ψ 0 4 θ ψ θ r s e ψ θ s θ r 5 k r ψ s e ψ 1 1 s e ψ n n 1 n 1 n 2 where α l 1 and n are empirical coefficients s e denotes the effective saturation whereas θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated water contents respectively for transient flow the following approximation can be used for the term representing the change in storage in eq 1 6 θ ψ t θ ψ θ s s s ψ t θ ψ t where s s is the specific storage coefficient l 1 the solution of the three dimensional richards equation is approximated in a spatial domain ω r 3 with the boundary ω γ and within the time interval 0

fixed pressure head n is the outer unit normal vector q n is a specified normal flux and c 0 c 1 c 2 r are coefficients moreover γ d is the part of boundary γ with a dirichlet boundary condition γ n with a neumann boundary condition and γ r with a robin boundary condition a robin boundary condition is often also referred to as a third type boundary condition it can be written as a linear combination of the primary unknown and its derivative note that ω γ γ d γ n γ r and that γ d γ n and γ r are pairwise disjoint 2 2 spatial discretization of the domain and set notation let t be a conforming subdivision of ω in triangular prismatic elements the elements are denoted e i t with i 1 2 n where n is the total number of elements furthermore we use the indices i d n r to denote the inner domain the dirichlet boundary the neumann boundary and the robin boundary respectively let n be the set of nodes then n i n d n n and n r are the sets of nodes in the inner domain at the dirichlet neumann and robin boundary respectively these sets of nodes are pairwise disjoint whereas individual elements might belong to more than one type of boundary moreover f is the set of elemental faces m 1 2 m with m being the total number of faces which can be uniquely split into sets f i f d f n which are the sets of the faces in the interior of the domain at the dirichlet boundary and at the neumann boundary respectively these sets are pairwise disjoint furthermore f e denotes the faces belonging to an element and n e denotes the nodes belonging to an element whereas n f denotes the set of nodes belonging to an individual face we further define n e as the unit vector normal to the boundary of element e which is pointing outwards additionally we specify n e f as the unit normal vector pointing outwards of element e on a face f whereas ν f is a unit normal vector on face f following a sign convention we use to denote the measure of a set in particular e denotes the volume of an element and f denotes the area of a face 2 3 flux reconstruction by cell centered finite volumes we assume that a node centered solution of eq 1 is already available typically computed by the standard galerkin finite element method or by some finite difference scheme such a solution is known to be not mass conservative in the elements e g cordes and kinzelbach 1992 larson and niklasson 2004 odsæter et al 2017 putti and sartoretto 2009 in finite element models the normal velocity component exhibits a jump across element faces e g odsæter et al 2017 leading to an inconsistent velocity field which is not suitable for particle tracking in standard finite difference methods the velocity component normal to a cell boundary is not defined while cell centered finite volume schemes are sometimes denoted finite difference methods by their developers e g mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 the original finite difference method does not perform a mass balance in cells and mass conservation is not guaranteed we use hydrogeosphere in finite difference mode to obtain a steady state variably saturated flow solution aquanty inc 2015 therrien and sudicky 1996 the finite difference method of hydrogeosphere is formulated in finite element terms that neglects the cross terms so that only direct connections between nodes that correspond to the primal grid are retained therrien and sudicky 1996 thus the approximation of the hydraulic head field may be imagined as a continuous solution on these direct connections resembling a network of lines on element edges when visualizing the hydraulic head solution a bilinear interpolation within the prismatic elements is typically assumed which is not fully consistent with the way heads have been computed taking the hydrogeosphere pressure head solution to obtain nodal values of the relative permeability in each element and the storage related divergence of the flow field we present a flux reconstruction that is locally mass conservative in the elements and conforming on the element faces to do so we recompute the hydraulic head governed by the richards eq 1 with a lowest order cell centered finite volume method using the elements as control volumes from the finite volume solution we can construct the velocity field in lowest order raviart thomas nédélec rtn 0 space on triangular prisms forming the basis for consistent particle tracking the following description of the lowest order finite volume flux reconstruction heavily relies on the description given by selzer and cirpka 2020 finite volume schemes are based on conserving the quantity of interest in our case the fluid mass assuming constant fluid density in each element 8 e q d x e f d x e t where f f θ t includs the expanded change in storage eq 6 applying the divergence theorem yields 9 f f e f n e f q d s e f d x e t for setting up the system of linear equations we expand the discretization by treating dirichlet and neumann faces as ghost elements implying explicit head values at these faces a lowest order finite difference approximation of the flux on the boundary of the elements together with a weighted approximation of the material coefficients yields the mobility coefficients m i j on the faces for neighboring elements 10 m i j s i j k r i j f ℓ i k i ℓ j k j ℓ 2 on f e i e j f i f k r i j k i ℓ i on f e i γ d f d e j γ d c on f f n where i and j are the indices of two neighboring elements and k i and k j are the isotropic saturated hydraulic conductivities of the elements i and j respectively in the anisotropic case these saturated conductivity values would represent the conductivity in the direction of the normal vector on face f furthermore ℓ ℓ i ℓ j is the distance between the centroids of the triangular prisms i and j whereas ℓ i and ℓ j are the parts within elements i and j respectively s i j is an orthogonal correction factor accounting for the fact that the approximated flux is in general not normal to the face f e i e j k r i j is the relative permeability on the face f and c 0 including anisotropy as a full tensor would be possible in a cell centered finite volume flux reconstruction but it is beyond our consideration as an example edwards 2002 derived such techniques for a dual grid to unstructured triangular meshes friis et al 2009 and edwards and zheng 2010 extended this approach to the primal grid using a dual grid and transformations of coordinates similar to those known from finite elements on subspaces which yields a more versatile finite volume formulation but also adds to the computational costs another possible route for including anisotropy may be facilitated by incorporating a flux approximation scheme similar to the one suggested by su et al 2020 as mentioned above the discretization t is expanded by ghost elements on faces in order to account for dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions in contrast to a standard cell centered finite volume discretization we do not use the distance weighted harmonic mean to compute the mobility coefficients but a distance weighted arithmetic mean this turned out to be more stable and better mimics the primal hydraulic head solution obtained by the finite difference mode of hydrogeosphere celia et al 1990 also used an unweighted arithmetic mean of hydraulic conductivities to obtain an equivalent approximation of spatial derivatives between a finite difference method and the standard galerkin finite element method on a one dimensional regular grid in order to compute the correction factor s i j we consider the projection of the distance vector ℓ connecting the centroids of the elements i and j onto the direction of the normal vector 11 s i j ℓ ℓ ν f ℓ 2 ℓ 2 f e i e j e i e j t for the approximation of the relative permeability on the faces k r i j we need to consider that the finite element type scheme may yield different values of k r for the same node in the different elements i and j sharing the node if material properties differ between elements i and j for a flux reconstruction we need to approximate a single relative permeability per face we do this by first linearly interpolating the nodal values belonging to each element to the centroid of the face which is the arithmetic mean of the nodal values and then applying upstream weighting that is taking the relative permeability of the element that has the larger hydraulic head h z ψ at its element centroid in the initial finite element or finite difference solution 12 k r i j 1 n f n n f k r i n f f e i if h c i h c j or f γ 1 n f n n f k r j n f f e j if h c j h c i where n f is the number of nodes on face f k r i n and k r j n are the relative permeabilities at node n in the elements i and j respectively whereas h c i and h c j are the hydraulic heads at the centroids of elements i and j respectively additionally we set the relative permeability of a node exhibiting recharge to one which we found necessary for accurately mimicking some primary solutions as these nodes experience a water influx during a recharge event the water saturation is close to unity anyway with these approximations we can specify the resulting system of linear equations by assembling the mass balance equations for all elements 13 a h r where a is the mobility matrix h is a pseudo hydraulic head which we call the pseudo potential defined on the centroids of the elements which leads to mass conservative and conforming fluxes and r is the right hand side vector including the divergence of the flux f integrated over the element as well as boundary conditions after computing the pseudo potential we can reconstruct the mass conservative lowest order fluxes on the faces which are a prerequisite for particle tracking in rtn 0 space in the following we give the mass balance equation for an inner element e i 14 for e i t j e i e j f m i j h i h j f i e i where h i is the pseudo potential at the centroid of element i whereas h j is either the corresponding pseudo potential at the centroid of element j or the fixed potential at a dirichlet boundary condition h d m or the pseudo potential associated to a neumann boundary condition h n m which is set such that the flux between the neumann boundary and the i th element is fixed furthermore f i is the source or sink strength including the change in storage associated to the centroid of the element e i a robin boundary condition is applied by setting a reference potential h r m and giving a conductance c m l 2 t 1 associated to the face m for computing the total flux towards the i th element for setting a robin boundary condition eq 14 is superimposed with 15 c m h i h r m q m where q m l 3 t 1 is a total flux on face m which leads to an additional mobility coefficient on the main diagonal of matrix a in eq 13 and an entry in the right hand side vector of the system 13 if element i is a face belonging to a dirichlet or a neumann boundary the resulting i th equation is 16 for e i f m f d h i h d m 17 for e i f m f n c m h n m h j q n m f m where h d m is the hydraulic head associated to a dirichlet face h n m is a hydraulic head at a neumann face defined such that the normal component of the specific discharge entering or exiting through element e i is equal to q n m including a sign denoting the direction of the flux and c m l 2 t 1 is a positive scalar 2 4 the rtn 0 velocity field in mixed coordinates on triangular prisms a triangular prism can be represented as a superposition of two simplices a line and a triangle while element wise analytical particle tracking on simplices is feasible in both global and local coordinates we need to employ local coordinates when analyzing the velocity field in deformed non simplicial elements upon transformation from global to local coordinates all arbitrarily deformed triangular prisms become the same reference prism in subsurface flow modeling however it is common practice to start the discretization with triangulation in the horizontal coordinates followed by expanding the triangles at the horizontal nodes in the vertical direction this allows defining a reference prism in mixed coordinates in which the horizontal local coordinates equal the corresponding global coordinates while the vertical coordinates are mapped to the unit interval and therefore scaled between 0 at the bottom of the prism and 1 at the top thus our reference prism is not fixed but it combines the triangular base area in global coordinates mapped to local coordinates of the same value with a unit height by this we have separated the horizontal from the vertical dimension we can still conduct horizontal particle tracking in global coordinates on triangles while tracking the particles in the vertical within the unit interval then the three dimensional trajectory is given by direct superposition the rtn 0 velocity space is a lowest order velocity approximation within the individual elements yielding a distinct velocity vector in every spatial coordinate nédélec 1980 1986 raviart and thomas 1977 in rtn 0 space the spatial dimensions are independent of each other yielding together with a constant normal component of the velocity on the element boundary for the reference element a bilinear approximation of the velocity within the triangular prisms before describing the actual velocity space a few prerequisites on transformations of coordinates are necessary in the following we use x to denote the physical coordinates in three spatial dimensions x x y z furthermore we use x to denote the coordinates in a local coordinate system associated to a reference element such that the three spatial dimensions are x x y z for the transformation of coordinates we need the jacobian matrix j of partial derivatives 18 j i j x i x j 19 j x n x p r i where i ranges over the dimensions in physical global coordinates and j ranges over the dimensions in local coordinates x n is the gradient of the shape functions n defining the reference prism in local coordinates and x p r i contains the global coordinates of all nodes of the physical prism the gradient of the shape functions in global coordinates x n can now be determined by 20 x n j 1 x n for the integration over the element volume the following rule applies 21 e x d x e x det j d x where e x is an element in global and e x is an element in local coordinates respectively the same rule applies to integrations within the element like the pathline integration employed in particle tracking furthermore the transformation of coordinates is linear such that e g rognes et al 2009 22 x j x c considering the transformation shown in eq 22 we also see that the barycentric weights on a simplex in local coordinates are the same for every point in the element as in global coordinates which is a useful attribute one may exploit for example for mapping particle locations from physical to local coordinates the described transformation from local to global coordinates is often called piola transformation it is a standard procedure in finite element simulations of scalar state variables like hydraulic heads approximated at the nodes and interpolated within the element for mapping a vector field onto a space which either preserves the divergence or the curl special rules for transforming normal and tangential traces on the element faces apply these rules are explained in great detail by rognes et al 2009 on whose descriptions and derivations we rely as particle tracking is based on conforming velocity fields implying mass conservation we opted for the lowest order velocity space which preserves the divergence facilitating the derivation of analytical solutions of trajectories in the elements contravariant piola transformation applies to the normal traces of the velocity in rtn 0 space considering this rognes et al 2009 showed that the following transformation rule is valid 23 f ϕ x n in global coordinates f 0 φ x n 0 in local coordinates where f is the measure of a face in global coordinates f 0 is the measure of the same face in local coordinates n is the normal vector on f in global coordinates pointing outwards and n 0 is the same normal vector in local coordinates ϕ x is a vector valued function approximated in some velocity space on the elements in global coordinates and φ x is the equivalent vector valued function in local coordinates from eq 23 one directly sees that transforming the normal component of a vector field on an element boundary from one coordinate system to the other reduces to the multiplication with a scaling factor equal to the ratio of the measures of the faces in the two coordinate systems as mentioned above we consider prisms with a constant triangular base area in the horizontal directions and linearly varying height we opt for a reference prism in mixed coordinates in which the horizontal coordinates have the same value as in global horizontal coordinates without the unit whereas the vertical extension of the prism is scaled to the dimensionless unit interval z 0 1 for this choice of local coordinates the determinant of the jacobian becomes 24 det j x y h e x y where h e is the scalar value of the height of the prism at the horizontal coordinates x y although having dimensions of l 3 this gives an intuitive measure on the magnitude of variation of det j within the element also particle tracking in the horizontal directions can be conducted in global coordinates saving transformations of coordinates mapping of faces and associated bookkeeping for a triangular prism e i the specific discharge vector q e i m i x e d q x i q y i q z i in mixed coordinates can be computed by 25 q x i f t r i e t r i f t r i 2 e t r i x p x f t r i

p h e i x y a z i b z i z h e i x y where f t r i is the length of an edge f t r i of the base triangle of e i e t r i is the area of the base triangle and p f t r i p x f t r i p y f t r i are the horizontal coordinates of the node opposite to the edge f t r i in the horizontal plane of the element e i f b o t t o m and f t o p are the areas of the bottom face f b o t t o m and the top face f t o p of the physical element whereas f 0 b o t t o m and f 0 t o p are the areas of the bottom face f 0 b o t t o m and the top face f 0 t o p in local coordinates both f 0 b o t t o m and f 0 t o p are equal to area of the base triangle e t r i in mixed coordinates q h f t r i i q b o t t o m i and q t o p i are the specific discharge values in global coordinates computed by the finite volume flux reconstruction normal to the side edge f t r i the bottom and top face of the element i respectively all normal flux components q i are also equipped with a sign convention such that q f i ν f q n e i f ν f in which f can be the edge f t r i the bottom or the top face of the element e i such a sign convention is common among adjacent elements the coefficients a x i a y i b h i describe the linear variation of the horizontal specific discharge component in an element i and can be computed by summation note that the horizontal specific discharge components q x i and q y i in the eqs 25 and 26 are given in global physical coordinates having dimensions of l t 1 while the vertical specific discharge component q z in eq 27 is given in the local coordinates of the mixed reference prism having dimensions of an inverse time if the eqs 25 and 26 were formulated in the local coordinates of the mixed reference prism the horizontal specific discharge components also would have dimensions of an inverse time while the values of all variables would remain the same although being dimensionless in space fig 1 while there is a linear dependence of q z with z the linear variation of the height and therefore of the determinant of the jacobian h e x y in the horizontal coordinates leads to a complicated dependence of q z on the mixed coordinates x y z the specific discharge vector q e i m i x e d now given in local coordinates in every dimension can be transformed into the specific discharge vector in global coordinates q e i by 28 q e i j q e i m i x e d 2 5 semi analytical particle tracking for a given velocity field v x t particle trajectories x p t and associated travel times τ are computed by 29 x p t x t 0 t 0 t v τ d τ 30 τ s 1 v s 2 d s where x t 0 is the vector of starting coordinates s is the curvilinear trajectory while s denotes all coordinates defining s and v denotes the linear average velocity which determines the particle trajectory s and which is related to the specific discharge vector q by 31 v q θ in the following we assume that the volumetric water content θ is constant within an element in our scheme this constant water content is the arithmetic mean of the volumetric water contents at the nodes of the element of interest which equals a linear interpolation to the centroid given a conforming velocity field in an appropriate velocity space particle tracking can either be computed by numerical integration e g matringe et al 2006 srinivasan and lipnikov 2013 or analytically e g crane and blunt 1999 loschko et al 2016 matringe et al 2006 pollock 1988 prévost et al 2002 selzer and cirpka 2020 the key idea of the semi analytical methods is to evaluate the particle trajectory analytically based on an element wise given velocity field which is numerically approximated in this approach the exit point and travel time are determined from the entry point by closed form integration of the kinematic equation using the velocity approximation within the element the particle is then tracked further in the neighboring element until it has reached an outflow boundary or the total travel time to be simulated has been reached the advantages of the semi analytical approach is that the integration within the elements is exact eqs 25 and 26 indicate that in our flux approximation on deformed prisms the horizontal specific discharge components q x and q y within an element vary linearly in their respective direction while they are constant in all other directions because we assume that the volumetric water content is constant within the element the same properties hold for the horizontal components of the linear average velocity v x and v y eq 27 shows that the local vertical specific discharge q z on deformed prisms depends not only on the local vertical coordinate z but also on the horizontal coordinates which complicates the analytical evaluation of vertical displacements rather than performing a numerical integration we decided to simplify eq 27 by the following approximation for an analogical simplification compare prévost et al 2002 32 q z i z 1 q b o t t o m i f b o t t o m f 0 b o t t o

spatial specific discharge components are decoupled the semi analytical approach of pollock 1988 relies on such decoupled velocity components within elements in our adaptation it consists of the following steps 1 extend the faces of the element to infinite planes 2 for a starting location x 0 within the element or at an inflow face of the element determine which faces are potential exit faces for the particle the velocity component normal to such a face must be oriented outwards of the element 3 for a given element i and each potential exit plane m determine the travel time τ i m it would take to reach that plane by analytical integration for a dimension d x y z 33 τ i m θ i x i m d x 0 d a d i if b d i ε b θ i b d i ln a d i b d i x i m d a d i b d i x 0 d otherwise where a d i a x i a y i a z i and b d i b h i b z i are the coefficients describing the linear dependence of the specific discharge component in its dimension d in the element e i x i m d is the possible exit location on the face f m in dimension d note that if e i takes a sink not projected on e i like it would be the case for an extraction well the exit location x i m d could be also within the element x 0 d x 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is the coordinate of the starting location x 0 being in element e i or on e i note that τ i m is the same for a possible exit location for every dimension d ε b is a small number on the order of 100 times the relative machine precision 4 the actual travel time τ i within the element is now the minimum positive and real travel time towards all face carrying planes or the center of an internal sink 5 with the given travel time τ i the exit point x e x x e x y e x z e x in mixed coordinates is now given by 34 x e x x 0 a x i θ i τ i if b h i ε b x 0 a x i b h i exp b h i θ i τ i a x

otherwise 6 back transform the local vertical coordinate z e x to the corresponding physical coordinate z e x 7 determine whether the particle has reached an outflow boundary of the domain or the center of an internal sink if not analyze which neighboring element e j will be entered switch to that element such that e j becomes e i set x 0 x e x and repeat all steps selzer and cirpka 2020 give analytical expressions on how to perform these calculations most efficiently for triangles these expressions directly apply for the horizontal tracking in the triangular prisms depending on the application we keep track of the full particle trajectory keep only travel times and the type of boundary where the particle exits the domain or travel times spent in elements of specific material properties by reverting the velocity field and the time arrow we can also evaluate where particles have come from how long they have been in the domain and how much time they spent in certain zones 2 6 implementation the primal solution is obtained using hydrogeosphere on windows 10 aquanty inc 2015 therrien and sudicky 1996 using the finite difference mode and mass lumping the particle tracking framework is implemented in matlab 2016b and it reads either binary or ascii output files generated by hydrogeosphere for transient flow the nodal volumetric water content is reconstructed for every element using the van genuchten parameterization see eq 4 the framework is split into three major parts the first computes all geometrical properties and has to be run once per grid the second is the fvm flux reconstruction that is run once per time level for which a flux reconstruction is requested we solve the final linear system of eq 13 by the stabilized biconjugate gradients method in matlab using an incomplete lu factorization as preconditioner and a starting vector computed from the primal hydraulic head solution linearly interpolated to the centroids of the elements the third part is the actual particle tracking routine here the algorithm switches for every element individually between non divergent and divergent flow according to a user defined criterion reflecting numerical accuracy 3 numerical results we evaluate the performance of our fvm flux reconstruction in two ways first we compare the hydraulic heads of the fvm reconstruction to the hydraulic heads of the primal solution obtained with hydrogeosphere in the finite difference mode panday et al 1993 therrien and sudicky 1996 note that the heads of the fvm reconstruction are not used for any evaluation other than computing mass conservative fluxes in rtn 0 space suitable for consistent particle tracking in the comparison of heads we contrast the fvm heads of the elements to the hydrogeosphere heads at the centroids of the elements evaluated by bilinear interpolation of the respective nodal values within the triangular prism the second demonstration of the performance of the fvm flux reconstruction is by illustrating consistent particle tracks resulting from this flux reconstruction compared to particle tracks based on the velocity field directly derived from the primal solution such trajectories may stagnate because the underlying velocity field is non conforming we also apply our framework to a three dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow model connecting two floodplains close to tübingen germany allgeier et al 2020 by this we demonstrate the applicability of our framework to catchment scale applications 3 1 benchmark model recharge in a subarea of the top boundary our first benchmark model considers a cubic domain having dimensions of 10 m 10 m 10 m the domain is discretized by 12 692 nodes and 22 572 elements in 18 elemental layers the vertical discretization is refined at the top of the domain and around the height of the dirichlet boundary conditions on the left and right sides of the domain we assign homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions with a constant hydraulic head h f i x 6 m the front back and bottom sides are no flow boundaries a recharge zone is located at the center of the top of the domain the zone is a square with dimensions of 3 m 3 m and the applied recharge rate is 200 mm a we assume a uniform saturated hydraulic conductivity of 10 5 m s saturated and residual water contents of 0 4 and 0 065 respectively and van genuchten parameters α 7 5 1 m and n 1 89 fig 2 illustrates simulated hydraulic heads according to the primal solution of hydrogeosphere in finite difference mode fig 2a and the fvm reconstruction fig 2b for steady state flow the two head solutions are very close to each other as quantified by the ratios in the top fig 2c and bottom fig 2d layers it can be observed that the top layer heads of the fvm reconstruction fig 2b drop slightly faster towards the lateral boundaries of the domain than the heads of the primal solution fig 2a leading to slightly lower hydraulic heads in the top layer for elements that are outside of the recharge zone in the recharge zone and its direct vicinity the head solutions are very close to each other on the dirichlet boundaries the heads of both solutions are forced to be identical leading to excellent agreement in the direct vicinity of those boundaries within the saturated zone illustrated by the solutions of the bottom layer fig 2d the hydraulic heads computed by the two methods are identical within computational precision the excellent agreement may be attributed to the simple setup of the model we would expect small differences between the primal solution and the fvm reconstruction because the solutions are based on different numerical methods for instance the primal solution is computed on the nodes of the elements whereas the fvm reconstruction yields an average solution for each element fig 3 shows particle trajectories for the model of a rectangular recharge zone at the centroid of every recharge face at the top of the domain a particle is introduced and tracked through the domain fig 3a shows the particle trajectories for the conforming velocity solution based on the fvm flux reconstruction the particle tracks show a reasonable pattern all particles reach the two possible outlets at the dirichlet boundaries and the expected symmetries of the trajectory patterns are overall achieved fig 3b shows the particle trajectories using a velocity field based on the primal fem type solution for this plot the velocity is evaluated at the centroid of each element and assumed constant within the element while the patterns of the trajectories obtained by the two methods are overall similar two particles stagnate in the fem type solution due to the non conformity of the velocity field which can lead to normal velocities at element faces that point outwards of each element this prevents further tracking in a consistent manner 3 2 case study particle trajectories in a floodplain we now apply our fvm flux reconstruction and particle tracking scheme to a subsurface flow model on the scale of a sub catchment the model was originally developed for a stochastic analysis of groundwater divides allgeier et al 2020 in the following we use a single realization of the original ensemble to demonstrate the applicability of our scheme the model simulates variably saturated flow in the ammer floodplain and its surroundings close to tübingen in south western germany martin et al 2020 the domain is discretized by 74 412 nodes and 138 565 deformed triangular prisms 35 layers of 3959 elements each like in the benchmark case we use hydrogeosphere in finite difference mode to obtain the steady state solution of richards eq 1 towards this end we simulate transient flow with constant forcings until steady state was reached based on this solution we perform our fvm flux reconstruction and the particle tracking the subsurface is subdivided into different hydrostratigraphic units following the layered structure of an underlying regional geological model d affonseca et al 2020 and studies within the floodplain martin et al 2020 the bedrock consists of a sequence of mud and sandstones with a weathering layer of higher hydraulic conductivity quaternary fillings in the valleys form alluvial aquifers separated by clay layers we consider the differences of hydraulic conductivity between the hydrostratigraphic units to be higher than the internal variability and assigned each unit a uniform set of hydraulic parameters saturated hydraulic conductivities range between 5 10 10 m s vertical conductivity in the top colluvial clay and 3 10 4 m s horizontal conductivity in the gravel aquifer of the floodplain vertical hydraulic conductivities of the units differ from their horizontal counterparts for the sake of simplicity we approximate the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the mobility coefficients eq 10 by taking the vertical hydraulic conductivities for the vertical connections and the horizontal hydraulic conductivities for the horizontal connections we assign dirichlet boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet faces of the floodplain filling as well as at the southern boundary of the domain at the top of the domain we assign neumann boundary conditions according to the net infiltration rates which varies between 20 and 60 mm a depending on land use robin boundary conditions are used to simulate the exchange between groundwater and the ammer river as well as the seepage of groundwater into artificial drainage channels all other boundaries are no flow boundaries all boundary conditions are assumed to be constant over time and we simulate subsurface flow until steady state is reached fig 4 presents contourlines of hydraulic heads according to the primal solution and the fvm reconstruction at the element centroids at the top and bottom of the domain the two hydraulic head fields are very similar at the top of the domain fig 4a and b the system is mostly unsaturated in particular towards the west the depth to the water table is fairly large here the values of hydraulic head differ the most between the primal solution and the fvm reconstruction at the bottom of the domain fig 4c and d the system is fully water saturated also here we see some differences in the hydraulic head distribution however the major objective of the fvm reconstruction is to obtain a conforming velocity field rather than exactly reproducing the hydraulic head field of the finite element type simulation by finite volumes we use the fvm reconstruction to delineate various sub catchments by particle tracking towards this end we place a particle at the centroid of each top face of the domain and track the particle until it has reached an outflow boundary in total these are 3959 particle tracks visualized in fig 5 fig 5 shows a two dimensional horizontal projection of the resulting particle tracks the trajectories are colored according to the outlet where they end up a local groundwater divide becomes apparent between all orange particle tracks reaching the southern groundwater outlet in the neckar valley and the remaining particles ending up in the ammer valley all inserted particles reach an outflow boundary that is no particles get stuck in the domain or exit at non physical destinations in practice the tecplot tecplot inc 2019 visualization and analysis platform is often used as visualization software for hydrogeosphere results tecplot can trace streamlines using the element wise given velocity field although this visualization software is not designed for rigorous and consistent particle tracking a qualitative comparison of the streamlines generated by tecplot revealed a good general agreement regarding the overall pattern with our particle tracking approach however like in our first benchmark case in which we used a velocity field derived from the primal solution at the centroids fig 3 some particles released at the surface do not reach an outlet boundary condition when tracked by tecplot instead they stagnate within the domain or erroneously reach a no flow boundary or even an inflow boundary moreover we deem our trajectories to be more accurate the major advantage of consistent particle tracking based on conforming velocity fields is physical and numerical accuracy of the flow paths which avoids non physical exit locations or stagnation of particles table 1 summarizes the wall clock and cpu times needed for achieving the primal solution as well as the times needed for the finite volume flux reconstruction here we differentiate between the effort to perform geometry related computations and the actual fvm flux reconstruction for an increased representativeness we report the averages and the standard deviations of run times for ten model runs each additionally we give the time needed to compute the trajectories of all 3959 individual particles on the cpu the results of table 1 clearly show that computing the primal solution is the time limiting step in the computations the postprocessing as well as the particle tracking take only about a tenth of the time which is needed for computing the primal solution 4 conclusions consistent particle tracking relies on conforming velocity fields which locally preserve mass in the elements and yield a continuous normal component of the velocity on the element faces we have presented a postprocessing scheme for non conforming velocity fields by reconstructing the hydraulic head and associated flux distribution by cell centered finite volumes of lowest order our flux reconstruction can be coupled to a finite element type primal solution of variably saturated flow based on this we formulated a semi analytical particle tracking scheme relying on element wise analytical solutions of the particle trajectories in rtn 0 space we showed that our fvm flux reconstruction yields hydraulic head fields which are close to the initial solution computed by hydrogeosphere in finite difference mode therrien and sudicky 1996 in the fvm reconstruction we make use of the relative permeabilities of the primal solution assuming that the latter already accounts for the non linearity of richards equation also we consider storage changes of the primal solution as known divergence in an otherwise steady state simulation in the fvm reconstruction this is computationally much faster than computing a conforming solution from scratch compared to preceding flux corrections e g larson and niklasson 2004 scudeler et al 2016 selzer and cirpka 2020 sun and wheeler 2006 the proposed scheme is absolutely stable and does not lead to severe numerical artifacts like velocities being too high by orders of magnitude in low velocity regions or reverted velocities in such regions compare schiavazzi 2013 selzer and cirpka 2020 these advantages come at the cost of accurately mimicking the primal model including all material properties and boundary conditions in the fvm reconstruction for non deformed triangular prisms our analytical approach is exact the inaccuracy increases the more deformed the prism is and the more the bottom and the top faces are tilted towards each other as well as the more the height of the element at the centroid differs from the mean height along the trajectory however we think that in catchment scale hydrological modeling the major uncertainty is in the approximation of material properties uncertain boundary conditions and in simplifications of the physical representation such as neglecting preferential flow paths in contrast the prisms normally used in catchment scale subsurface hydrological modeling are often only moderately deformed therefore we believe that the additionally introduced inaccuracy is small compared to the other inaccuracies present in most catchment scale variably saturated flow models and the approximation above is justified by the gain in computational efficiency we have shown that our fvm flux reconstruction as well as the associated particle tracking scheme on potentially deformed triangular prisms can be applied to realistic subsurface flow models on the catchment scale including varying element geometries several geological layers and heterogeneous boundary conditions our scheme is accurate gives results close to the primal solution in the hydraulic head reconstruction and avoid gaps in definition the particle trajectories can be used for the delineation of capture zones or for streamline based simulations of reactive transport
