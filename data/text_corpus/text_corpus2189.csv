10945,for efficient irrigation management practices an accurate prediction of water uptake in the root zone and soil information are foremost important the present study deals with the identification and estimation of root water uptake rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using inverse modeling these parameters were estimated by minimizing the difference between observed and model simulated soil moisture and deep percolation during the crop growth period the linked simulation optimization model is tested for three different objective functions using hypothetically generated observed data results indicate that the optimizer with objective function defined by soil moisture failed to provide unique estimate of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters further it has been observed that with the objective function defined by deep percolation soil hydraulic parameters were uniquely estimated but rwu parameter was not estimated accurately however with the objective function that includes both soil moisture and deep percolation these parameters were uniquely estimated a lysimeter experiments were conducted with four crops i e berseem trifolium alexandrinum wheat triticum aestivum maize zea mays and pearl millet pennisetum glaucum daily monitoring of soil moisture and deep percolation along with soil and crop parameter measurements were done for model validation inversely estimated soil hydraulic parameters were found to be in close agreement with laboratory obtained values the results indicate that specifically for soils with high hydraulic conductivity the information about deep percolation along with soil moisture is necessary for inverse estimation of root and soil parameters simultaneously the moisture depletion pattern and deep percolation corresponding to optimized parameters for these crops were found to be in close agreement with observed values keywords root water uptake soil moisture depletion deep percolation inverse approach 1 introduction the hydrological cycle comprises of a number of key elements of which root water uptake rwu has a significant role in controlling water fluxes in soil profiles as it links the soil subsurface with the atmosphere in irrigated fields the study of rwu is important because the roots withdraw most of the soil water from the root zone in response to transpiration chahine 1992 feddes et al 2001 zheng feng et al 2015 illustrated the various existing models that predict the root water extraction the functioning of these models is broadly classified into two approaches i e microscopic approach and macroscopic approach feddes and raats 2004 molz 1981 ojha et al 2009 the microscopic approach describes the water movement through individual roots considering water flux in both the root system and soil in vicinity of roots while in the macroscopic approach the root system is considered as a single sink term representing the sum of water uptake by individual roots from the viewpoint of simplicity the macroscopic based model are mostly favored in moisture flow models in the root zone couvreur et al 2012 the root water extraction depends upon several factors such as root density distribution root hydraulic properties soil water availability and soil salinity yu et al 2007 highlighted that the high root density of maize plants is more vital than the maximum rooting depth for water uptake under water stress condition feddes et al 1978 proposed a model that involves the prescribed function of the soil moisture pressure head that reduces potential transpiration to actual root water uptake under water stress condition with the knowledge of root and soil hydraulic properties the distribution of water extraction by the roots can be predicted by using these models feddes et al 1976 kang et al 2001 li et al 1999 molz et al 1968 ojha and rai 1996 prasad 1988 numerous models based on macroscopic approach are used to determine the rwu taking care of water stress belmans et al 1983 feddes 1978 jordan and ritchie 1971 soil salinity jordan and ritchie 1971 li et al 2015 skaggs et al 2006 and compensating effect couvreur et al 2012 javaux et al 2013 from several studies it has been found that the roots can compensate the water stress by withdrawing more water from non stressed zone leib et al 2006 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 vogel et al 2013 2013 yadav et al 2009 one of the simplest approaches was defined by jarvis 1989 jarvis 1989 introduces stress index ω which is the ratio of non compensated to potential root water uptake this simple empirical approach is widely used in modeling moisture flow in root zone šimůnek and hopmans 2009 however field or laboratory measurement of crop root parameters like root density distribution is extremely challenging furthermore due to soil heterogeneity the directly measured soil hydraulic properties on soil samples do not represent exactly the field conditions vereecken et al 2010 therefore the root water extraction pattern predicted from forward modeling corresponding to directly measured soil hydraulic and root properties is not much precise one of the ways to accurately estimate these parameters is by applying inverse estimation which involves estimation of these parameters based on observed data the soil water dynamics in the root zone is interrelated to rwu soil water flux and top and bottom boundary conditions thus the information of root water uptake and soil hydraulic properties for the known initial top and boundary conditions can be acquired by modeling dynamic process of rwu the traditional inverse method is trial and error procedure which involve manual comparison of computed and observed state variable e g soil moisture content deep percolation soil water potential etc the disadvantages of this method are time consuming inaccuracy when several parameters are involved and non uniqueness mbonimpa et al 2015 an alternative to trial and error approach is to link numerical model with an optimization algorithm šimůnek et al 1998 uses marquardt levenberg optimization method to estimate soil hydraulic parameters from laboratory evaporation experiment vrugt et al 2001 presented the 2 d rwu model based on raats 1974 model the developed model was linked to soil moisture flow model to optimize rwu parameters by minimizing the defined objective function related to soil moisture content sonkar et al 2018a estimated the non linear root water uptake parameter by linking root water uptake model with the genetic algorithm ga based optimizer the parameter was estimated by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed percentage soil moisture depletion the inverse approach is also used to identify both rwu and soil hydraulic parameters simultaneously wöhling et al 2013 use the amalgam search algorithm to estimate simultaneously soil hydraulic and plant parameters using soil moisture data similarly using bottom boundary flux data from lysimeter experiment schelle et al 2013 uniquely identified soil hydraulic and rwu parameters however from the results of musters and bouten 2000 and musters and bouten et al 1999 it has been seen that the rwu parameters does not produce significant effect on soil moisture dynamics which might lead to identifiability problems for those parameters also it has been observed by hupet et al 2003 that for soil with high hydraulic conductivity the root water uptake parameters cannot be identified uniquely with the soil moisture status in the root zone similarly sonkar et al 2018b observed that with only soil moisture data there are multiple solutions while estimating rwu and soil hydraulic parameters simultaneously the first objective of the present study is to investigate the feasibility of simultaneous estimation of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using root zone soil moisture data for this the developed rwu model is coupled with genetic algorithm ga based optimizer the coupled model is tested by inverse estimation of these parameters using hypothetically generated observed soil moisture depletion and deep percolation rate the second objective is to estimate these parameters using both soil moisture and deep percolation rate for different crops full crop season lysimeter experiments were conducted to obtain crop parameters required for model development 2 material and methods 2 1 forward modeling 2 1 1 governing equation the soil moisture and the deep percolation in the root zone is analysed by solving richards equation 1931 with root water uptake as a sink term the governing equation is given as 1

and the study is focused in the root zone the lower boundary condition was assumed to be gravity drainage which is neumann or flux type boundary condition given by 8 ψ z 0 z 0 t 0 the potential transpiration t p lt 1 can be directly computed by removing soil surface flux part equal to e s from crop evapotranspiration et c eq 9 where et c is obtained by multiplying reference evapotranspiration eto by an appropriate crop coefficient the eto is calculated using the penman montieth equation allen et al 1998 this method uses climatic parameters such as maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity sunshine hour and wind speed the climate data were obtained from a weather station installed at national institute of hydrology nih roorkee 9 t p e t c e s where e s is calculated using experimentally monitored leaf area index lai according to relation given by belmans et al 1983 as 10 e s e t c e x p 0 6 l a i 2 1 4 root water uptake rate in the present study the root water uptake calculation is done by using ojha and rai 1996 herein after called o r model the potential root water uptake at depth z s max z under the non stressed condition is defined as follows 11 s m a x z t p 1 β z r 1 z z r β f o r 0 z z r where β root water uptake model parameters dimensionless and z r root depth m under soil moisture limiting condition the actual extraction of soil water by the roots is lower than potential extraction and hence the water uptake by the roots depends on pressure head feddes et al 1978 the actual root water uptake rate representing sink term in eq 1 is then obtained by modifying s max with a reduction factor of soil moisture pressure heads the net root water uptake rate at depth z s z is calculated from 12 s z f ψ s m a x z where f ψ prescribed function of soil moisture pressure head the pressure head lying between available moisture content ψ a m c and wilting point ψ w or between field capacity ψ f c and anaerobiosis point ψ a defines water stress condition in this condition the f ψ will be less than unity and interpolated linearly fig 1 the water uptake by the roots is maximum i e f ψ 1 for ψ a m c ψ ψ f c below ψ w and above ψ a

ψ a ψ f c ψ ψ a 0 ψ ψ a 2 2 numerical scheme a computer code in fortron 77 programming language has been developed for the implementation of rwu model the governing partial differential eq 1 along with constitutive relationships eqs 2 5 are solved by a mass conservative fully implicit finite difference scheme proposed by celia et al 1990 the length of root zone is divided into uniform segments finite difference approximations of eq 1 are written for each node the resulting system of non linear equations are linearized using picards scheme which is solved using thomas algorithm the iterative process is continued until the convergence is achieved i e the difference between pressure heads computed between two successive iterations falls within the specified tolerance limit the solution provides pressure heads at each nodal point in the root zone at successive intervals of time these pressure heads are used to compute the soil moisture depletion and deep percolation at successive time intervals 2 3 soil moisture depletion calculation the soil moisture depletion d x at any discrete time interval is defined as the difference between the soil moisture content at the start and the end of time interval given as 14 d x δ z i b n o d e 1 t n o d e 1 θ i i n i θ i r e s δ z 2 θ b n o d e i n i θ b n o d e r e s θ t n o d e i n i θ t n o d e r e s where θi ini and θi res are soil moisture contents at node i at the start and end of any discrete time interval respectively bnode and tnode denote the bottom and top node of the layer x and δz nodal distance the total soil moisture depletion in the root zone is obtained as summation of depletions from each layer the percentage soil moisture depletion m d x in layer x is calculated as 15 m d x d x k 1 n l a y e r d k 100 where nlayer total number of layers in a root zone 2 4 inverse modeling three objective functions are formulated objective functions 16 18 to estimate simultaneously the non linear rwu parameter β and the soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v by minimizing the objective function ϕ objective function 16 is defined as sum of squares of normalized differences between the model predicted and field observed percentage soil moisture depletions for minimization while objective function 17 is defined as sum of squares of normalized differences between model predicted and field observed deep percolation for minimization problem objective function 18 is defined as summation of normalized deviations between model predicted and field observed percentage soil moisture depletions and deep percolation 16 ϕ i 1 n m d m d m d 2 17 ϕ i 1 m d p d p d p 2 18 ϕ i 1 n m d m d m d 2 i 1 m d p d p d p 2 where md and md are observed and simulated percentage soil moisture depletion respectively dp and dp are observed and simulated deep percolation respectively n is total number of observed percentage soil moisture depletion and m is total number of observed deep percolation data the normalization brings the magnitude of both the terms in objective function 18 to same order since the main objective of the present study is parameter identification equal weightage is assigned to each function in objective function 18 the parameters are optimized with each of the defined objective functions 16 18 by minimizing ϕ using ga optimization technique unlike levenberg marquardt method which often gets stuck at local minima ga is a derivative free global search technique that assures global optimal solution majed and houssem 2009 however it requires more computational operations than other non linear optimization techniques but nowadays with the advancement of fast computing processors the computational time is not of much concern since ga works on problem solution through a maximization the minimization problem is converted into a maximization problem by defining the fitness function f x that is used in genetic operations deb 2000 the fitness function is given by 19 f x 1 1 ϕ 2 5 experiments the field observations of soil moisture and deep percolation experiments for determination of soil and crop parameters were conducted at the irrigation laboratory of civil engineering department iit roorkee india during november 2016 to october 2017 the climatic condition of the experimental site is described by humid subtropical type the site is located in the geometric grid of 77 53 e and 29 52 n at an altitude of 274 m above mean sea level two season lysimeter experiments were conducted on four crops table 1 two in rabi season wheat and berseem followed by two in kharif season maize and pearl millet the experimental site consists of two lysimeters and field plots the crops were grown in the field plots as well as in lysimeters the area of lysimeters is 1 m2 having a depth of 1 5 m repacked soil similar to that of the experimental field an open chamber is built between both the lysimeter for collecting and measuring deep percolated water this arrangement allows gravity drained water to drain towards outlet which is finally collected in bucket kept in an open chamber the quantity of water drained was measured using measuring cylinder for complete growing season the deep percolation was measured and recorded on daily basis the root depth of the crops was measured from a field plot by a method similar to trench profile method in which a trench is excavated near to the crop root and the length of deepest exposed root is measured for calculating the potential transpiration the crop evapotranspiration is partitioned using leaf area index lai the monitoring of the lai was done using accupar ceptometer model lp 80 decagon devices inc pullman wa usa the instrument based on the principle of radiation measurement thus accurately measures the lai in real time figs 2 and 3 shows the variation of root depth and lai for four crops during crop growth period respectively the root depth measurement was taken weekly while lai was measured weekly during initial stage however from the development stage the lai observation was taken at an interval 3 4 days since lai is observed to increase rapidly during development stage except for berseem crop this is because being a fodder crop berseem required periodic harvesting during its growth period the root depth increases till development stages and then afterward observed to be constant the daily soil moisture status in the root zone was measured at different locations in the experimental site at 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 100 cm depth below the soil surface the in situ measurement of soil water content was done using soil moisture probe profile probe pr2 6 delta t devices cambridge the probe sensors measure the permittivity of the surrounding material using electromagnetic waves which is used to measure soil moisture the soil moisture at the mentioned depth was monitored by inserting the profile probe in the access tube installed in the field plots and lysimeters to determine the soil properties field representative samples were collected at three spots of the field plots at five depths from 0 to 140 cm and tested in the laboratory table 2 provides average measured soil characteristics at different depths from table 2 the soil texture in the root zone can be described by sandy loam type the field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp refer to moisture content corresponding to matrix suction value of 33 kpa and 1500 kpa these parameters were determined from the soil moisture characteristic curve obtained from pressure plate test the observed fc and pwp are converted into ψ f c and ψ w respectively for determining f ψ the soil retention parameters were obtained from pressure plate test soil moisture corporation santa barbara california usa the experimentally observed soil moisture content and the corresponding equilibrium pressure are fitted with retc model van genuchten 1980 to obtain soil retention parameters and are shown in table 3 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was measured in situ by using guelph permeameter eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment table 3 2 6 estimation of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters to estimate the rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using soil moisture data the optimization technique based on ga has been implemented the rwu model was coupled with ga based optimizer deb 2000 for estimation of β k sat α v and n v the identification estimation of the rwu and soil hydraulic parameters were done in two steps in the first step these parameters were simultaneously estimated using generated hypothetical generated soil moisture and deep percolation data with the objective functions 16 18 for this purpose the coupled rwu ga model was run for three times each time with different objective function the optimized parameters resulting from each run were checked with the true values of the parameters used to generate hypothetical data in the second step these parameters were inversely estimated for the four crops using observed soil moisture and deep percolation data with the best objective function among the three 2 7 generation of hypothetical data for the generation of hypothetical percentage moisture depletion and deep percolation rate a reference run of 15 days for one irrigation interval was simulated corresponding to actual growing condition of wheat crop root zone length of 150 cm is discretized into equally spaced nodal distance of 1 cm the whole root zone was divided into 6 layers each of 25 cm for calculating the layerwise depleted soil moisture content from the simulated soil moisture the field was irrigated on the first day therefore initially the soil moisture content is set to saturation followed by no irrigation rainfall event until 15th day the top boundary condition was assigned with soil evaporation flux and the lower boundary is considered as free drainage the potential transpiration and the soil evaporation were calculated by partitioning crop evapotranspiration based on recorded lai of the wheat crop the interval was selected from 96 to 111 days after sowing das the root length of 1 m was taken as observed during this period the laboratory tested average soil parameters were assigned at each nodal point in the flow domain of the model with the given soil crop parameters and boundary conditions the soil moisture content and the deep percolation was simulated at each time step of 15 min for 15 days finally the layer wise percentage soil moisture depletion and daily deep percolation were calculated which are treated as observed data for inversely estimating the rwu and soil hydraulic parameters for generation of hypothetical data the soil hydraulic parameters considered as average values i e k sat 3 89 cm h 1 α v 1 50 m 1 n v 1 52 the rwu parameter β is considered as 2 to reflect the nonlinearity in the rwu mechanism 3 results and discussion to check the feasibility of simultaneous estimation of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using soil moisture data the parameters were estimated using hypothetically generated data treating as observed data parameters estimation using objective functions 16 18 is discussed in the following sections 3 1 case 1 parameters estimation using soil moisture data the parameters were estimated by minimizing the normalized deviations between observed and computed percentage soil moisture depletion objective function 16 the ga parameters value used in this problem were chromosome length 45 population size 50 number of generations 250 crossover probability 0 6 and mutation probability 0 08 to test the nonuniqueness in parameters identification the parameters were optimized with three different seed values table 4 shows the true and estimated values of the parameters corresponding to different seed numbers it can be seen from table 4 that the parameters do not converge to their true values when objective function 16 is used for estimation with three different seed values the optimization results in three different sets of parameters indicating the nonuniqueness of the inverse procedure the nonuniqueness in parameter estimation is explained as follows the soil moisture movement in the root zone depends on both soil hydraulic parameters and root water uptake and these two processes occur simultaneously during crop growth the soil moisture depletion in the root zone is due to the combined effect of soil moisture movement resulting from unsaturated soil dynamics and root water uptake hence using soil moisture depletion data alone objective function 16 is not sufficient to estimate both rwu and soil hydraulic parameters uniquely 3 2 case 2 parameters estimation using deep percolation data in this case the parameters were inversely estimated by minimizing the sum of squares of the normalized differences between observed and simulated deep percolation data objective function 17 the ga parameters value adopted are same as in the case 1 the results of parameters identification using deep percolation data are summarized in table 4 from table 4 it is interesting to note that with objective function 15 the soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v converged almost near to their true values with different seeds however the objective function failed to estimate the rwu parameter β uniquely it is emphasized here that deep percolation is the process which occurs well below the root zone and primarily depends on the unsaturated soil moisture dynamics and as such rwu dynamics does not affect much the deep percolation hence inclusion of deep percolation data in the objective function facilitates identification of soil hydraulic parameters uniquely however it fails to estimate the rwu parameter β uniquely 3 3 case 3 parameters estimation using soil moisture and deep percolation data in this case the parameters are optimized by minimizing the objective function defined by normalized differences of sum of squares of the observed and simulated percentage soil moisture depletion as well as deep percolation rate objective function 18 table 4 presents the parameters estimates obtained using objective function 18 for three different seed values it is evident from table 4 that using both soil moisture depletion and deep percolation data in the objective function results in unique estimation of both soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v and rwu parameter β with all these parameters converging very near to their true value with three different seeds the ability of objective function 18 to uniquely estimate both rwu and soil hydraulic parameters is explained as follows as already mentioned the soil moisture depletion in the root zone is due to combined effect of unsaturated soil dynamics and rwu however the deep percolation which occurs well below the root zone primarily depends on unsaturated soil dynamics influenced by the soil hydraulic parameters objective function 18 comprises two parts i soil moisture depletion and ii deep percolation the deep percolation part drives the optimization to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v uniquely with these unique estimates of soil hydraulic parameters the soil moisture depletion parts drives the optimization to provide unique estimate of rwu parameter β 3 4 estimation of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters from a lysimeters experiment from the preceeding discussion it has been found that the observed data including soil moisture and deep percolation rate is best suited for unique estimation of a rwu and soil hydraulic parameters in the present study lysimeter experiments were conducted on four crops to determine soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v using field observed soil moisture status and deep percolation rate table 5 presents the optimized value of the parameters for all four crops results show that the optimized values of the soil parameters are found to be same for all the optimization runs for each crop this has been expected as the crops were grown in the same field the inversely estimated k sat α v and n v values are in close agreement with those obtained from laboratory tests since the plant roots poses different root architecture root length and density the water extraction pattern differs from crop to crop the optimal value of parameter β for berseem is 1 55 while for wheat maize and pearl millet are 1 72 1 30 and 1 83 respectively the simulated potential and actual rwu with the optimized parameters for each crop are shown in fig 4 under non stressed condition i e when the soil moisture content is in between field capacity and available moisture content table 2 the actual rwu rate is equal to potential rate from fig 4 it can be seen that during the starting days after irrigation or precipitation event the actual rwu is found to be same as potential rate but for end days the actual rwu is found to be less than potential rate from the temporally simulated soil moisture content the layer wise percentage moisture depletions were calculated these depletions were compared with the field observed percentage moisture depletion figs 5 8 show the comparison between the observed and simulated soil moisture depletion for berseem wheat maize and pearl millet respectively it has been observed from the moisture depletion pattern that most of the water uptake is from the top layers of the root zone for a better analysis of depletion pattern 0 25 m of thickness for each layer is considered for the upper layers the simulated soil moisture depletion is in close agreement with the observed depletion however for the lower layers the differences between observed and computed percentage soil moisture depletion is more as compared to top layers for berseem and wheat crop figs 5 and 6 the predicted percentage moisture depletion corresponding to optimized parameters overestimates the measured moisture depletion in the lower layers similarly for maize and pearl millet crop figs 7 and 8 the simulated moisture depletions in the lower layers were not matched accurately with the observed depletion this may be due to the slight heterogeneity in the lower root zone the moisture observation taken at different depths were compared with corresponding simulated soil moisture for the four crops along with soil moisture profile the rwu model also simulated daily deep percolation in a given crop growth period for all four crops deep percolation is the amount of gravity drainage water below crop root zone contributed to groundwater the rwu model simulates the daily accumulated deep percolation by calculating flux at bottom boundary of the considered soil domain for observed data the volume of deep percolated water is directly measured from lysimeter experiment and recorded daily measured and predicted rates of deep percolation for berseem wheat maize and pearl millet are presented in figs 9 12 respectively the simulated deep percolation with the optimized parameters for all the four experiments showed good agreement with the field observed deep percolation 4 conclusions in this study a rwu model is presented that simulates the deep percolation and soil moisture in the root zone for a known root and soil parameters the developed model was linked with ga based optimizer to inversely estimate the rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using observed soil moisture status and deep percolation the coupled model was tested for inverse estimation of these parameters using hypothetically generated observed data sets the hypothetical soil moisture and deep percolation data were generated based on the actual crop grown field condition of wheat these data sets were treated as observed data and compared with simulated values in order to genetically optimize the nonlinear rwu parameter β of o r model and soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v the parameters were estimated using three defined objective functions from the results obtained with the three objective functions it was found that the optimizer failed to converge rwu and soil hydraulic parameters to their true values when using soil moisture data with objective function which includes deep percolation only soil hydraulic parameters converge near to their true values with different seed hence using deep percolation inverse estimation of soil hydraulic parameters is assured but rwu parameter cannot be estimated uniquely as deep percolation is mainly associated with unsaturated soil moisture dynamics well below the root zone however with both soil moisture and deep percolation the rwu and soil hydraulic parameters were uniquely estimated for different seeds as the optimized soil hydraulic parameters with deep percolation assisted in driving optimization of rwu parameter with soil moisture information hence for simultaneous estimation of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters inversely both soil moisture and deep percolation data is necessary the present study also involves the estimation of β k sat α v and n v for a different cropping experiments using both soil moisture and deep percolation with the optimized parameters the soil moisture depletion and deep percolation were simulated and compared with observed data the results show that the predicted percentage soil moisture depletion and deep percolation with the optimized rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using both soil moisture and deep percolation were in good agreement with observed data in the present case nonuniqueness in parameter estimation was observed while considering crop growth condition in the sandy loam soil it has been in the recent research hupet et al 2003 that for soils with high hydraulic conductivity the rwu parameter identification problem is ill posed whereas for fine soils the rwu optimization works well thus inverse estimation of rwu parameters along with soil parameters also depends on the type of soil hence prior to application of inverse method for real cases feasibility assessment of inverse estimation of these parameters should be studied we also recommend investigating the uncertainty in parameters estimation due to presence of noise in the observed soil moisture and deep percolation data acknowledgments the authors wish to acknowledge the nature environment research council nerc

10945,for efficient irrigation management practices an accurate prediction of water uptake in the root zone and soil information are foremost important the present study deals with the identification and estimation of root water uptake rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using inverse modeling these parameters were estimated by minimizing the difference between observed and model simulated soil moisture and deep percolation during the crop growth period the linked simulation optimization model is tested for three different objective functions using hypothetically generated observed data results indicate that the optimizer with objective function defined by soil moisture failed to provide unique estimate of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters further it has been observed that with the objective function defined by deep percolation soil hydraulic parameters were uniquely estimated but rwu parameter was not estimated accurately however with the objective function that includes both soil moisture and deep percolation these parameters were uniquely estimated a lysimeter experiments were conducted with four crops i e berseem trifolium alexandrinum wheat triticum aestivum maize zea mays and pearl millet pennisetum glaucum daily monitoring of soil moisture and deep percolation along with soil and crop parameter measurements were done for model validation inversely estimated soil hydraulic parameters were found to be in close agreement with laboratory obtained values the results indicate that specifically for soils with high hydraulic conductivity the information about deep percolation along with soil moisture is necessary for inverse estimation of root and soil parameters simultaneously the moisture depletion pattern and deep percolation corresponding to optimized parameters for these crops were found to be in close agreement with observed values keywords root water uptake soil moisture depletion deep percolation inverse approach 1 introduction the hydrological cycle comprises of a number of key elements of which root water uptake rwu has a significant role in controlling water fluxes in soil profiles as it links the soil subsurface with the atmosphere in irrigated fields the study of rwu is important because the roots withdraw most of the soil water from the root zone in response to transpiration chahine 1992 feddes et al 2001 zheng feng et al 2015 illustrated the various existing models that predict the root water extraction the functioning of these models is broadly classified into two approaches i e microscopic approach and macroscopic approach feddes and raats 2004 molz 1981 ojha et al 2009 the microscopic approach describes the water movement through individual roots considering water flux in both the root system and soil in vicinity of roots while in the macroscopic approach the root system is considered as a single sink term representing the sum of water uptake by individual roots from the viewpoint of simplicity the macroscopic based model are mostly favored in moisture flow models in the root zone couvreur et al 2012 the root water extraction depends upon several factors such as root density distribution root hydraulic properties soil water availability and soil salinity yu et al 2007 highlighted that the high root density of maize plants is more vital than the maximum rooting depth for water uptake under water stress condition feddes et al 1978 proposed a model that involves the prescribed function of the soil moisture pressure head that reduces potential transpiration to actual root water uptake under water stress condition with the knowledge of root and soil hydraulic properties the distribution of water extraction by the roots can be predicted by using these models feddes et al 1976 kang et al 2001 li et al 1999 molz et al 1968 ojha and rai 1996 prasad 1988 numerous models based on macroscopic approach are used to determine the rwu taking care of water stress belmans et al 1983 feddes 1978 jordan and ritchie 1971 soil salinity jordan and ritchie 1971 li et al 2015 skaggs et al 2006 and compensating effect couvreur et al 2012 javaux et al 2013 from several studies it has been found that the roots can compensate the water stress by withdrawing more water from non stressed zone leib et al 2006 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 vogel et al 2013 2013 yadav et al 2009 one of the simplest approaches was defined by jarvis 1989 jarvis 1989 introduces stress index ω which is the ratio of non compensated to potential root water uptake this simple empirical approach is widely used in modeling moisture flow in root zone šimůnek and hopmans 2009 however field or laboratory measurement of crop root parameters like root density distribution is extremely challenging furthermore due to soil heterogeneity the directly measured soil hydraulic properties on soil samples do not represent exactly the field conditions vereecken et al 2010 therefore the root water extraction pattern predicted from forward modeling corresponding to directly measured soil hydraulic and root properties is not much precise one of the ways to accurately estimate these parameters is by applying inverse estimation which involves estimation of these parameters based on observed data the soil water dynamics in the root zone is interrelated to rwu soil water flux and top and bottom boundary conditions thus the information of root water uptake and soil hydraulic properties for the known initial top and boundary conditions can be acquired by modeling dynamic process of rwu the traditional inverse method is trial and error procedure which involve manual comparison of computed and observed state variable e g soil moisture content deep percolation soil water potential etc the disadvantages of this method are time consuming inaccuracy when several parameters are involved and non uniqueness mbonimpa et al 2015 an alternative to trial and error approach is to link numerical model with an optimization algorithm šimůnek et al 1998 uses marquardt levenberg optimization method to estimate soil hydraulic parameters from laboratory evaporation experiment vrugt et al 2001 presented the 2 d rwu model based on raats 1974 model the developed model was linked to soil moisture flow model to optimize rwu parameters by minimizing the defined objective function related to soil moisture content sonkar et al 2018a estimated the non linear root water uptake parameter by linking root water uptake model with the genetic algorithm ga based optimizer the parameter was estimated by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed percentage soil moisture depletion the inverse approach is also used to identify both rwu and soil hydraulic parameters simultaneously wöhling et al 2013 use the amalgam search algorithm to estimate simultaneously soil hydraulic and plant parameters using soil moisture data similarly using bottom boundary flux data from lysimeter experiment schelle et al 2013 uniquely identified soil hydraulic and rwu parameters however from the results of musters and bouten 2000 and musters and bouten et al 1999 it has been seen that the rwu parameters does not produce significant effect on soil moisture dynamics which might lead to identifiability problems for those parameters also it has been observed by hupet et al 2003 that for soil with high hydraulic conductivity the root water uptake parameters cannot be identified uniquely with the soil moisture status in the root zone similarly sonkar et al 2018b observed that with only soil moisture data there are multiple solutions while estimating rwu and soil hydraulic parameters simultaneously the first objective of the present study is to investigate the feasibility of simultaneous estimation of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using root zone soil moisture data for this the developed rwu model is coupled with genetic algorithm ga based optimizer the coupled model is tested by inverse estimation of these parameters using hypothetically generated observed soil moisture depletion and deep percolation rate the second objective is to estimate these parameters using both soil moisture and deep percolation rate for different crops full crop season lysimeter experiments were conducted to obtain crop parameters required for model development 2 material and methods 2 1 forward modeling 2 1 1 governing equation the soil moisture and the deep percolation in the root zone is analysed by solving richards equation 1931 with root water uptake as a sink term the governing equation is given as 1

root water uptake calculation is done by using ojha and rai 1996 herein after called o r model the potential root water uptake at depth z s max z under the non stressed condition is defined as follows 11 s m a x z t p 1 β z r 1 z z r β f o r 0 z z r where β root water uptake model parameters dimensionless and z r root depth m under soil moisture limiting condition the actual extraction of soil water by the roots is lower than potential extraction and hence the water uptake by the roots depends on pressure head feddes et al 1978 the actual root water uptake rate representing sink term in eq

ψ a ψ f c ψ ψ a 0 ψ ψ a 2 2 numerical scheme a computer code in fortron 77 programming language has been developed for the implementation of rwu model the governing partial differential eq 1 along with constitutive relationships eqs 2 5 are solved by a mass conservative fully implicit finite difference scheme proposed by celia et al 1990 the length of root zone is divided into uniform segments finite difference approximations of eq 1 are written for each node the resulting system of non linear equations are linearized using picards scheme which is solved using thomas algorithm the iterative process is continued until the convergence is achieved i e the difference between pressure heads computed between two successive iterations falls within the specified tolerance limit the solution provides pressure heads at each nodal point in the root zone at successive intervals of time these pressure heads are used to compute the soil moisture depletion and deep percolation at successive time intervals 2 3 soil moisture depletion calculation the soil moisture depletion d x at any discrete time interval is defined as the difference between the soil moisture content at the start and the end of time interval given as 14 d x δ z i b n o d e 1 t n o d e 1 θ i i n i θ i r e s δ z 2 θ b n o d e i n i θ b n o d e r e s θ t n o d e i n i θ t n o d e r e s where θi ini and θi res are soil moisture contents at node i at the start and end of any discrete time interval respectively bnode and tnode denote the bottom and top node of the layer x and δz nodal distance the total soil moisture depletion in the root zone is obtained as summation of depletions from each layer the percentage soil moisture depletion m d x in layer x is calculated as 15 m d x d x k 1 n l a y e r d k 100 where nlayer total number of layers in a root zone 2 4 inverse modeling three objective functions are formulated objective functions 16 18 to estimate simultaneously the non linear rwu parameter β and the soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v by minimizing the objective function ϕ objective function 16 is defined as sum of squares of normalized differences between the model predicted and field observed percentage soil moisture depletions for minimization while objective function 17 is defined as sum of squares of normalized differences between model predicted and field observed deep percolation for minimization problem objective function 18 is defined as summation of normalized deviations between model predicted and field observed percentage soil moisture depletions and deep percolation 16 ϕ i 1 n m d m d m d 2 17 ϕ i 1 m d p d p d p 2 18 ϕ i 1 n m d m d m d 2 i 1 m d p d p d p 2 where md and md are observed and simulated percentage soil moisture depletion respectively dp and dp are observed and simulated deep percolation respectively n is total number of observed percentage soil moisture depletion and m is total number of observed deep percolation data the normalization brings the magnitude of both the terms in objective function 18 to same order since the main objective of the present study is parameter identification equal weightage is assigned to each function in objective function 18 the parameters are optimized with each of the defined objective functions 16 18 by minimizing ϕ using ga optimization technique unlike levenberg marquardt method which often gets stuck at local minima ga is a derivative free global search technique that assures global optimal solution majed and houssem 2009 however it requires more computational operations than other non linear optimization techniques but nowadays with the advancement of fast computing processors the computational time is not of much concern since ga works on problem solution through a maximization the minimization problem is converted into a maximization problem by defining the fitness function f x that is used in genetic operations deb 2000 the fitness function is given by 19 f x 1 1 ϕ 2 5 experiments the field observations of soil moisture and deep percolation experiments for determination of soil and crop parameters were conducted at the irrigation laboratory of civil engineering department iit roorkee india during november 2016 to october 2017 the climatic condition of the experimental site is described by humid subtropical type the site is located in the geometric grid of 77 53 e and 29 52 n at an altitude of 274 m above mean sea level two season lysimeter experiments were conducted on four crops table 1 two in rabi season wheat and berseem followed by two in kharif season maize and pearl millet the experimental site consists of two lysimeters and field plots the crops were grown in the field plots as well as in lysimeters the area of lysimeters is 1 m2 having a depth of 1 5 m repacked soil similar to that of the experimental field an open chamber is built between both the lysimeter for collecting and measuring deep percolated water this arrangement allows gravity drained water to drain towards outlet which is finally collected in bucket kept in an open chamber the quantity of water drained was measured using measuring cylinder for complete growing season the deep percolation was measured and recorded on daily basis the root depth of the crops was measured from a field plot by a method similar to trench profile method in which a trench is excavated near to the crop root and the length of deepest exposed root is measured for calculating the potential transpiration the crop evapotranspiration is partitioned using leaf area index lai the monitoring of the lai was done using accupar ceptometer model lp 80 decagon devices inc pullman wa usa the instrument based on the principle of radiation measurement thus accurately measures the lai in real time figs 2 and 3 shows the variation of root depth and lai for four crops during crop growth period respectively the root depth measurement was taken weekly while lai was measured weekly during initial stage however from the development stage the lai observation was taken at an interval 3 4 days since lai is observed to increase rapidly during development stage except for berseem crop this is because being a fodder crop berseem required periodic harvesting during its growth period the root depth increases till development stages and then afterward observed to be constant the daily soil moisture status in the root zone was measured at different locations in the experimental site at 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 100 cm depth below the soil surface the in situ measurement of soil water content was done using soil moisture probe profile probe pr2 6 delta t devices cambridge the probe sensors measure the permittivity of the surrounding material using electromagnetic waves which is used to measure soil moisture the soil moisture at the mentioned depth was monitored by inserting the profile probe in the access tube installed in the field plots and lysimeters to determine the soil properties field representative samples were collected at three spots of the field plots at five depths from 0 to 140 cm and tested in the laboratory table 2 provides average measured soil characteristics at different depths from table 2 the soil texture in the root zone can be described by sandy loam type the field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp refer to moisture content corresponding to matrix suction value of 33 kpa and 1500 kpa these parameters were determined from the soil moisture characteristic curve obtained from pressure plate test the observed fc and pwp are converted into ψ f c and ψ w respectively for determining f ψ the soil retention parameters were obtained from pressure plate test soil moisture corporation santa barbara california usa the experimentally observed soil moisture content and the corresponding equilibrium pressure are fitted with retc model van genuchten 1980 to obtain soil retention parameters and are shown in table 3 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was measured in situ by using guelph permeameter eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment table 3 2 6 estimation of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters to estimate the rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using soil moisture data the optimization technique based on ga has been implemented the rwu model was coupled with ga based optimizer deb 2000 for estimation of β k sat α v and n v the identification estimation of the rwu and soil hydraulic parameters were done in two steps in the first step these parameters were simultaneously estimated using generated hypothetical generated soil moisture and deep percolation data with the objective functions 16 18 for this purpose the coupled rwu ga model was run for three times each time with different objective function the optimized parameters resulting from each run were checked with the true values of the parameters used to generate hypothetical data in the second step these parameters were inversely estimated for the four crops using observed soil moisture and deep percolation data with the best objective function among the three 2 7 generation of hypothetical data for the generation of hypothetical percentage moisture depletion and deep percolation rate a reference run of 15 days for one irrigation interval was simulated corresponding to actual growing condition of wheat crop root zone length of 150 cm is discretized into equally spaced nodal distance of 1 cm the whole root zone was divided into 6 layers each of 25 cm for calculating the layerwise depleted soil moisture content from the simulated soil moisture the field was irrigated on the first day therefore initially the soil moisture content is set to saturation followed by no irrigation rainfall event until 15th day the top boundary condition was assigned with soil evaporation flux and the lower boundary is considered as free drainage the potential transpiration and the soil evaporation were calculated by partitioning crop evapotranspiration based on recorded lai of the wheat crop the interval was selected from 96 to 111 days after sowing das the root length of 1 m was taken as observed during this period the laboratory tested average soil parameters were assigned at each nodal point in the flow domain of the model with the given soil crop parameters and boundary conditions the soil moisture content and the deep percolation was simulated at each time step of 15 min for 15 days finally the layer wise percentage soil moisture depletion and daily deep percolation were calculated which are treated as observed data for inversely estimating the rwu and soil hydraulic parameters for generation of hypothetical data the soil hydraulic parameters considered as average values i e k sat 3 89 cm h 1 α v 1 50 m 1 n v 1 52 the rwu parameter β is considered as 2 to reflect the nonlinearity in the rwu mechanism 3 results and discussion to check the feasibility of simultaneous estimation of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using soil moisture data the parameters were estimated using hypothetically generated data treating as observed data parameters estimation using objective functions 16 18 is discussed in the following sections 3 1 case 1 parameters estimation using soil moisture data the parameters were estimated by minimizing the normalized deviations between observed and computed percentage soil moisture depletion objective function 16 the ga parameters value used in this problem were chromosome length 45 population size 50 number of generations 250 crossover probability 0 6 and mutation probability 0 08 to test the nonuniqueness in parameters identification the parameters were optimized with three different seed values table 4 shows the true and estimated values of the parameters corresponding to different seed numbers it can be seen from table 4 that the parameters do not converge to their true values when objective function 16 is used for estimation with three different seed values the optimization results in three different sets of parameters indicating the nonuniqueness of the inverse procedure the nonuniqueness in parameter estimation is explained as follows the soil moisture movement in the root zone depends on both soil hydraulic parameters and root water uptake and these two processes occur simultaneously during crop growth the soil moisture depletion in the root zone is due to the combined effect of soil moisture movement resulting from unsaturated soil dynamics and root water uptake hence using soil moisture depletion data alone objective function 16 is not sufficient to estimate both rwu and soil hydraulic parameters uniquely 3 2 case 2 parameters estimation using deep percolation data in this case the parameters were inversely estimated by minimizing the sum of squares of the normalized differences between observed and simulated deep percolation data objective function 17 the ga parameters value adopted are same as in the case 1 the results of parameters identification using deep percolation data are summarized in table 4 from table 4 it is interesting to note that with objective function 15 the soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v converged almost near to their true values with different seeds however the objective function failed to estimate the rwu parameter β uniquely it is emphasized here that deep percolation is the process which occurs well below the root zone and primarily depends on the unsaturated soil moisture dynamics and as such rwu dynamics does not affect much the deep percolation hence inclusion of deep percolation data in the objective function facilitates identification of soil hydraulic parameters uniquely however it fails to estimate the rwu parameter β uniquely 3 3 case 3 parameters estimation using soil moisture and deep percolation data in this case the parameters are optimized by minimizing the objective function defined by normalized differences of sum of squares of the observed and simulated percentage soil moisture depletion as well as deep percolation rate objective function 18 table 4 presents the parameters estimates obtained using objective function 18 for three different seed values it is evident from table 4 that using both soil moisture depletion and deep percolation data in the objective function results in unique estimation of both soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v and rwu parameter β with all these parameters converging very near to their true value with three different seeds the ability of objective function 18 to uniquely estimate both rwu and soil hydraulic parameters is explained as follows as already mentioned the soil moisture depletion in the root zone is due to combined effect of unsaturated soil dynamics and rwu however the deep percolation which occurs well below the root zone primarily depends on unsaturated soil dynamics influenced by the soil hydraulic parameters objective function 18 comprises two parts i soil moisture depletion and ii deep percolation the deep percolation part drives the optimization to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v uniquely with these unique estimates of soil hydraulic parameters the soil moisture depletion parts drives the optimization to provide unique estimate of rwu parameter β 3 4 estimation of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters from a lysimeters experiment from the preceeding discussion it has been found that the observed data including soil moisture and deep percolation rate is best suited for unique estimation of a rwu and soil hydraulic parameters in the present study lysimeter experiments were conducted on four crops to determine soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v using field observed soil moisture status and deep percolation rate table 5 presents the optimized value of the parameters for all four crops results show that the optimized values of the soil parameters are found to be same for all the optimization runs for each crop this has been expected as the crops were grown in the same field the inversely estimated k sat α v and n v values are in close agreement with those obtained from laboratory tests since the plant roots poses different root architecture root length and density the water extraction pattern differs from crop to crop the optimal value of parameter β for berseem is 1 55 while for wheat maize and pearl millet are 1 72 1 30 and 1 83 respectively the simulated potential and actual rwu with the optimized parameters for each crop are shown in fig 4 under non stressed condition i e when the soil moisture content is in between field capacity and available moisture content table 2 the actual rwu rate is equal to potential rate from fig 4 it can be seen that during the starting days after irrigation or precipitation event the actual rwu is found to be same as potential rate but for end days the actual rwu is found to be less than potential rate from the temporally simulated soil moisture content the layer wise percentage moisture depletions were calculated these depletions were compared with the field observed percentage moisture depletion figs 5 8 show the comparison between the observed and simulated soil moisture depletion for berseem wheat maize and pearl millet respectively it has been observed from the moisture depletion pattern that most of the water uptake is from the top layers of the root zone for a better analysis of depletion pattern 0 25 m of thickness for each layer is considered for the upper layers the simulated soil moisture depletion is in close agreement with the observed depletion however for the lower layers the differences between observed and computed percentage soil moisture depletion is more as compared to top layers for berseem and wheat crop figs 5 and 6 the predicted percentage moisture depletion corresponding to optimized parameters overestimates the measured moisture depletion in the lower layers similarly for maize and pearl millet crop figs 7 and 8 the simulated moisture depletions in the lower layers were not matched accurately with the observed depletion this may be due to the slight heterogeneity in the lower root zone the moisture observation taken at different depths were compared with corresponding simulated soil moisture for the four crops along with soil moisture profile the rwu model also simulated daily deep percolation in a given crop growth period for all four crops deep percolation is the amount of gravity drainage water below crop root zone contributed to groundwater the rwu model simulates the daily accumulated deep percolation by calculating flux at bottom boundary of the considered soil domain for observed data the volume of deep percolated water is directly measured from lysimeter experiment and recorded daily measured and predicted rates of deep percolation for berseem wheat maize and pearl millet are presented in figs 9 12 respectively the simulated deep percolation with the optimized parameters for all the four experiments showed good agreement with the field observed deep percolation 4 conclusions in this study a rwu model is presented that simulates the deep percolation and soil moisture in the root zone for a known root and soil parameters the developed model was linked with ga based optimizer to inversely estimate the rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using observed soil moisture status and deep percolation the coupled model was tested for inverse estimation of these parameters using hypothetically generated observed data sets the hypothetical soil moisture and deep percolation data were generated based on the actual crop grown field condition of wheat these data sets were treated as observed data and compared with simulated values in order to genetically optimize the nonlinear rwu parameter β of o r model and soil hydraulic parameters k sat α v and n v the parameters were estimated using three defined objective functions from the results obtained with the three objective functions it was found that the optimizer failed to converge rwu and soil hydraulic parameters to their true values when using soil moisture data with objective function which includes deep percolation only soil hydraulic parameters converge near to their true values with different seed hence using deep percolation inverse estimation of soil hydraulic parameters is assured but rwu parameter cannot be estimated uniquely as deep percolation is mainly associated with unsaturated soil moisture dynamics well below the root zone however with both soil moisture and deep percolation the rwu and soil hydraulic parameters were uniquely estimated for different seeds as the optimized soil hydraulic parameters with deep percolation assisted in driving optimization of rwu parameter with soil moisture information hence for simultaneous estimation of rwu and soil hydraulic parameters inversely both soil moisture and deep percolation data is necessary the present study also involves the estimation of β k sat α v and n v for a different cropping experiments using both soil moisture and deep percolation with the optimized parameters the soil moisture depletion and deep percolation were simulated and compared with observed data the results show that the predicted percentage soil moisture depletion and deep percolation with the optimized rwu and soil hydraulic parameters using both soil moisture and deep percolation were in good agreement with observed data in the present case nonuniqueness in parameter estimation was observed while considering crop growth condition in the sandy loam soil it has been in the recent research hupet et al 2003 that for soils with high hydraulic conductivity the rwu parameter identification problem is ill posed whereas for fine soils the rwu optimization works well thus inverse estimation of rwu parameters along with soil parameters also depends on the type of soil hence prior to application of inverse method for real cases feasibility assessment of inverse estimation of these parameters should be studied we also recommend investigating the uncertainty in parameters estimation due to presence of noise in the observed soil moisture and deep percolation data acknowledgments the authors wish to acknowledge the nature environment research council nerc

system dss having a potential for improving the implementation of the pim imt programs through the identification of their criticalities and facilitating the corrective actions at government agency and wua levels international commission on irrigation and drainage icid working group on institutional and organizational aspects wg ioa organized an international symposium with the theme global review of institutional reforms in the irrigation sector for sustainable agricultural water management including wuas during the 23rd icid congress 8 14 october 2017 in mexico city the symposium deliberated upon legal framework and organizational structure including wuas for water supply services pim and management transfer approaches and conditions for successful irrigation and drainage and public private partnership ppp in irrigation and drainage operation and maintenance towards sustainable irrigated agricultural water management based on this a review on institutional reforms in the irrigation sector in 14 countries and regions including australia china india indonesia iran japan malaysia mexico nepal south korea sudan chinese taipei turkey and ukraine was done by gany et al 2019 despite the diverse geography and institutional frameworks in irrigation sector food security remains a major concern in all the countries and regions reviewed the formation and functioning of wuas ageing irrigation and drainage infrastructure and its operation and management remain to be the major institutional and ppp challenges for sustainable agricultural water management in the immediate future one of the metrics to assess the success of pim is to assess its impact on food grain production and or cropping intensity if pim has contributed to increased water use efficiency through better management of available irrigation water at the local level then it should have reflected in overall food grain productivity at the local level spatial variations in approaches to pim implementation might result in spatial variations in its overall impact an overall understanding of irrigation development in india will be helpful to understand the reasons for spatial variations in implementation and impact of pim this will also help us answer questions such as whether pim is the best strategy for improving irrigation management in all the states in india or whether there are any spatial variations in its impact additionally empirical evidence on the effects of participatory irrigation management on crop productivity and irrigation efficiency at aggregate level is lacking in the existing literature the present study has undertaken an ex post assessment of effects of pim on food grain productivity using district level panel data from six states in india the objectives of our study are three fold first to conduct a comparative analysis of irrigation scenario during pre and post pim periods second to examine the impact of pim on food grain productivity and third to identify the factors contributing to the spatio temporal variations in pim s impact 2 methodology 2 1 locale of the study and background of pim under the constitution of india water is state subject union government play the role of a facilitator but the actual implementation of pim is done by the states so far 84 779 wuas have been formed in various states covering an area of 17 8 m ha under various commands of irrigation schemes gany et al 2019 it is important for creation and successfully functioning of any organisation to have adequate legal backup in india 16 out of 29 states have enacted pim while all the states have been implementing pim ministry of water resources govt of india 2012 the states which are yet to do the enactment follow various approaches for implementation of pim however states enacted pim follow almost similar approach six states andhra pradesh karnataka tamil nadu madhya pradesh odisha and rajasthan implementing the pim reform are included in the present study fig 1 andhra pradesh enacted andhra pradesh farmers management of irrigation system act 1997 karnataka promulgated an ordinance on 7th june 2000 for amendment of the existing karnataka irrigation act 1957 rajasthan passed the rajasthan sinchai pranali ke prabandh me krishkon ki sahabhagita adhiniyam 2000 farmers participation in irrigation management in rajasthan byelaws 2000 tamil nadu enacted the tamil nadu farmers management of irrigation system act 2000 odisha implemented the orissa pani panchayat act 2002 and orissa pani panchayat rule 2003 these enabling laws and or byelaws ensure formation of wuas for undertaking management of irrigation participation of farmers in irrigation management to manage the irrigation systems within the operational area under wua legal rights to wua to receive irrigation water at the head of the irrigation system in the operational area of wua from irrigation agency legal powers to distribute irrigation water among the members in the operational area by wua empowering wua in developing a suitable crop pattern based on health of land water availability and climatological conditions without degradation of land within operational area fixation of water rates for different crops on area basis collection of water charges from the farmers for utilization of irrigation water generation of resources from donor agencies other than the water charges maintenance grant resolving conflicts among farmers members and non members and wuas etc ministry of water resources govt of india 2007 the structural arrangements of wua pani panchayat indicate the involvement of both irrigation and agriculture department to facilitate proper planning and implementation of irrigation and agriculture in the irrigation command fig 2 there is no uniform procedure to form wuas its structural development size and organisation used to be at the convenience of farmers and the irrigation department the size of a wua is in between 500 to 750 ha on a hydraulic unit preferably a minor covering one or more villages a minor irrigation project is managed by one wua a single tier system the medium irrigation project is managed by a two tier system having wuas at minor level and apex body at project level in a major irrigation project it is a three tier system the wua at minor level a federation or a distributary committee at branch canal distributary level and apex body at project level in all cases mentioned above wua is the only registered body all farmers in the operational area of the wua may become its members the wua has a managing committee which consists of a president vice president treasurer and a secretary in addition to at least five members state irrigation agriculture command area development and revenue departments also nominate one officer from each department to be included in the managing committee who help managing committee in its functioning in addition of the by laws another important legal document is the transfer agreement or the memorandum of understanding between the wua and the irrigation department this agreement contains the terms and conditions of transfer of the system and clearly spells out the duties and responsibilities of irrigation department and wua handing over of the system method of its operation and supply of irrigation water in bulk at agreed time and quantities in different crop seasons are included in the agreement the transfer agreement clearly defines the area of operation of wua the details of the irrigation system with its present condition and the existing structures with their technical details the plan map delineating the area of operation irrigation distribution network and location of structures is attached with the transfer agreement technical details like longitudinal and the cross section of the system is also attached with the document it specifies the procedure to be adopted for the management of irrigation in the operation area the agreement used to be valid for a specified period but having been satisfied with the performance the agreement may be renewed for a further mutually agreed period the grounds for termination of agreement are clearly mentioned in the agreement present study was conducted in such six out of 13 states where pim enacted at an early period so as to have the district level data of agricultural and irrigation development indicators for 10 years each before and after implementation of pim to study the effect of pim reform 2 2 data and analyses district level data were analyzed for the variables depicting irrigation and agricultural scenario district wise data on selected variables were taken from the published database under village dynamics in south asia vdsa project of international crop research institute in semi arid tropics icrisat hyderabad india the data pertained to 10 years each before and after the pim enactment and implementation period in the states of andhra pradesh tamil nadu karnataka madhya pradesh odisha and rajasthan following the planning commission s presently names as niti aayog approach in state development reports the variables were selected to assess irrigation and agricultural scenario before and after enactment of pim with the help of different indexes decadal mean and standard deviation sd of each of the parameters related to agricultural and irrigation scenario are calculated in order to depict the agricultural as well as irrigation scenario of the respective states during pre and post pim implementation period 2 2 1 agricultural development index adi the district wise agricultural scenario was analyzed with the help of a composite agricultural development index adi in the selected states ghosh et al 2017 analysed

agricultural development during pre pim and post pim period the changes in cultivable land net sown area and net irrigated area in the six study states during pre and post pim period are presented in table 1 the coverage of cultivable land remained similar in andhra pradesh and karnataka during post pim period that is about 55 and 60 percent of total land respectively extent of decrease of cultivable land is found about 1 5 in tamil nadu and odisha the share of cultivable land has increased by about one percent both in madhya pradesh and rajasthan after implementation of pim the percentage of net sown area to cultivable area nsa to cl has not changed much in andhra pradesh madhya pradesh and rajasthan during post pim period and remained 73 92 and 81 percent respectively the share of net sown area has declined in the states like karnataka from 87 to 84 tamil nadu from 75 to 70 and odisha from 91 to 87 as evident from the mean value during 10 years period after implementation of pim in these states the decadal mean values calculated before and after implementation of pim indicate that the share of net irrigated area to net sown area nia to nsa has increased in all six selected states during post pim period the extent of increase is three percent in andhra pradesh four percent in tamil nadu six percent in karnataka eight percent in rajasthan 10 percent in madhya pradesh and 12 percent in odisha table 1 the area under major crops in six states is presented in terms of mean of 10 years and standard deviation before and after implementation of pim table 2 the major crops are found different in the selected states therefore three major crops are considered in each state paddy is the major crop in four out of six selected states in andhra pradesh maximum area is occupied by paddy followed by groundnut and cotton both pre and post pim period however the area under cotton has increased and that of groundnut has decreased during post pim period while the area under paddy has remained almost same 30 of gross sown area paddy millets and sorghum are three major crops in karnataka the area under paddy remained almost same after implementation of pim however the areas under both millets and sorghum have declined with extent of decline more in case of sorghum during post pim period both these crops are drought resistant and non irrigated therefore farmers have started growing other irrigated crops like vegetables etc after implementation of pim with better irrigation regime in tamil nadu the area under paddy and groundnut has decreased by about one and four percent respectively during post pim period while that under sugarcane has increased marginally wheat is the major crop in madhya pradesh the area of which has increased marginally after implementation of pim gram and paddy are other two major crops grown in madhya pradesh areas under which have increased marginally during post pim period in odisha paddy has occupied more than half of the gross sown area about 50 of gross sown area both during pre and post pim period maize being the second major crop has shown an increase in its area during post pim period with more than four times increase in growth rate the major crops of rajasthan are bajra wheat and maize the area under bajra has declined by one percent during post pim period the decadal mean value for area under wheat shows almost same after implementation of pim maize the third major crop has shown a better situation as the decadal mean area has increased from 10 to 12 percent of gross sown area table 2 the productivity of the major crops of the aforesaid states has increased varying from 2 to 67 on an average 11 20 considering all three major crops across six selected states together during post pim period as compared to pre pim period as evident from the decadal mean values of productivity barring the sugarcane in tamil nadu productivity of which has decreased 11 155 to 10 613 kg ha table 3 the decadal mean of total area under high yielding varieties hyvs during pre and post pim period indicates an increase in karnataka 158 to 232 thousand ha odisha 3171 to 3589 thousand ha and rajasthan 3171 to 3589 thousand ha during post pim period table 4 while tamil nadu has shown a decrease in decadal mean of total area under hyvs during post pim period 2494 to 2219 thousand hectare the share of area under food grains has decreased 1 7 in five out of six selected states while it has remained almost stationary in karnataka the growth is negative in case of all the states during post pim period this may be attributed to the fact of shift in cropping pattern from food grains to more remunerative non food grains crops with better irrigation scenario after implementation of the pim the mean productivity of food grains has increased in all selected states with maximum increase in andhra pradesh 1631 to 2119 kg ha and minimum increase in madhya pradesh 1111 to 1242 kg ha the growth is positive for all states during post pim period in fact it has been shifted from negative to positive in case of odisha the cropping intensity has increased in all the six selected states except in tamil nadu the extent of increase is between three percent in karnataka and 12 percent in odisha table 5 all the states have depicted a positive growth during the post pim implementation period fertiliser consumption has increased by 21 80 percent with maximum increase in andhra pradesh 77 13 120 14 thousand tonnes and minimum increase in madhya pradesh 19 83 32 18 thousand tonnes after implementation of pim in the respective states 3 2 district wise agricultural development scenario in the states implementing pim district wise comparative agricultural development in the selected states before and after implementation of pim is assessed with the help of agriculture development index adi that considers all the parameters discussed above together to derive the index for each district of a state the adi in the districts of selected six states i e andhra pradesh karnataka tamil nadu madhya pradesh odisha and rajasthan during pre pim and post pim reform period is depicted in fig 3 out of 19 undivided districts in undivided state of andhra pradesh presently andhra pradesh state has been bifurcated into two states viz telangana and seemandhra states 10 have fallen in low adi categories 0 20 0 40 during pre pim period while eight districts are there in this category during post pim period five districts were found in medium category with adi value between 0 40 and 0 60 before implementation of pim while it is increased by two districts after implementation of pim four districts were found under the category of high with adi values ranging between 0 60 and 0 80 which continued to remain same during post pim period karnataka has shown an improvement in agricultural scenario as after the enactment of pim in the state the number of districts falling under medium range 0 40 0 60 has increased from ten to twelve along with decrease in number of districts 8 to 7 in low range of adi tamil nadu has shown an increase in the number of districts from three to five falling under category of very low to low adi in post pim period as compared to pre pim period as number of districts under medium and high category is decreased after the enactment of pim in the state thus relatively less development in agriculture is visualized during post pim period in the state the performance of madhya pradesh has also shown an improvement as one districts has fallen under the high category during post period which was nil previously in medium category number of district has increased by one however number of districts falling under very low and low categories remained same the state of odisha has shown a better agricultural scenario as the number of districts falling under low category has decreased during post pim period and the number of districts under medium category has increased by one one district is found with high adi value both during pre and post pim enactment rajasthan has not shown much change in agriculture as the districts falling under very low to low remained same after the implementation of pim along with increase in the number of districts under medium category by one and reduction by one in high category adi 3 3 performance of irrigation development indicators during pre pim and post pim period net irrigated area has shown an increase in five out of six selected states after the implementation of pim 6 in andhra pradesh 27 in karnataka 28 in rajasthan 36 in odisha and 38 in madhya pradesh except in tamil nadu decreased marginally from 2794 02 to 2764 94 thousand ha i e by 1 the decadal mean of irrigation coverage nia to nsa has increased in all selected six states after implementation of pim table 6 the maximum increase was observed in odisha 12 and minimum in andhra pradesh 3 groundwater irrigated area registered an increase in all the states 16 in tamil nadu 42 in rajasthan 45 in odisha 46 in madhya pradesh 51 in andhra pradesh and 63 in karnataka during post pim period as compared to pre pim period the decadal 10 years mean values calculated before and after enactment of pim indicate that the share of groundwater irrigation area to net sown area gia to nsa has increased 5 8 in all selected six states during post pim period the share of groundwater irrigated area in net irrigated area has increased ranging from 3 in odisha to 14 in andhra pradesh as evident from table 7 decadal mean canal irrigated area has increased in karnataka by seven percent 926 79 992 75 thousand ha madhya pradesh by 10 percent 930 61 1021 71 thousand ha odisha by 31 percent 1413 73 1850 89 thousand ha and rajasthan by 10 percent 1412 87 1558 65 thousand ha during post pim period as compared to pre pim period table 8 the same has decreased in the states of andhra pradesh by 10 percent 1718 45 1547 39 thousand ha and tamil nadu by 16 percent 800 56 672 21 thousand ha with respect to the share of canal irrigated area to net sown area cia to nsa an increase of five per cent is found in odisha during post pim period a marginal increase about 1 is found in madhya pradesh karnataka and rajasthan however it has decreased in andhra pradesh 17 08 15 50 and tamil nadu 13 81 to 12 55 during post pim period the share of canal irrigated area in net irrigated area has decreased 2 7 during post pim period in case of all the selected six states tank irrigated area has showed a decline in four out of six states barring madhya pradesh and odisha during post pim period table 9 the percentage of tank irrigated area to net sown area tia to nsa has decreased in andhra pradesh tamil nadu and rajasthan while it is almost stationary in madhya pradesh and karnataka it has showed an increase in odisha the share of tank irrigated area in net irrigated area has decreased during post pim period in case of all the selected six states 3 4 district wise irrigation development scenario in the states implementing pim district wise comparative irrigation development in the selected states before and after implementation of pim is assessed with the help of irrigation development index idi that considers overall irrigation area both ground and surface and share of irrigation area both ground and surface in cropped area to derive the index for each district of a state the idi of the six states i e andhra pradesh karnataka tamil nadu madhya pradesh odisha and rajasthan during and after pim reform is depicted in fig 4 in andhra pradesh number of districts remained same in case of low idi category 0 20 0 40 while it is decreased by one district in very low idi category 0 0 20 during the post pim period three districts were found to be in medium category with adi value 0 40 0 60 before as well as after pim enactment five and one districts were observed to have fallen under the category of high 0 60 0 80 and very high adi 0 80 1 00 which is increased by one district in case of former category and remained same in case of the later after implementation of pim showing a little improvement in irrigation scenario idi values in the districts of karnataka show that the number of districts falling under high category 0 60 0 80 is reduced by three after the enactment of pim in the state there is no change in very high category idi however number of districts in medium range of idi 0 40 0 60 has increased from four to six while there is no change in number of districts under very low category of idi number of district is increased by one in low category of idi during post pim period in case of tamil nadu idi of one district have fallen under each very low and low category of idi during pre as well as post pim period there in an increased in number of districts under high category that is due to shift of one district from medium category of idi in post pim period the number of districts has remained same in very high category of idi in pre and post pim period this again indicates a beginning of the improvement in irrigation development in few districts of the state the irrigation development in madhya pradesh depicts an improvement after enactment and implementation of pim there is a decrease of two districts under very low and three districts under low category of idi values during post pim period the number of districts under medium category of idi is increased from 13 to 19 after implementation of pim while number of districts has remained same under high category it has reduced by one in very high category after implementation of the pim in state in odisha number of districts has decreased by two both under very low and medium category of idi values however the same gas increased by three under low category of idi during post pim period the number of districts is increased by two in high category and decreased by one in very high category of idi after implementation of pim in case of rajasthan the number of districts falling under low high and very high categories of idi remained same both before and after implementation of pim the number of districts has increased by two in very low category of idi while the same has decreased by two in case of medium category after enactment and implementation of pim in the state 3 5 impact of pim reform on food grain productivity descriptive statistics of panel data for 10 years each before and after implementation of pim indicate betterment with respect to area under non food grains crops productivity of most of the major crops both food grains crops and non food grains crops areas under hyvs cropping intensity and fertiliser consumption during post pim period these improvements may be attributed to the better irrigation regimes in the respective states after implementation of the pim however the effect of pim reform on food grain productivity was assessed with a panel regression function using feasible generalized least squares fgls technique this empirical analysis indicates that southern states such as andhra pradesh and tamil nadu and central state madhya pradesh did not show any significant effect of pim on food grain productivity while another southern state karnataka eastern state odhisa and western state rajasthan witnessed positive and significant effect on food grain productivity as evident from significant coefficient values in case of interaction pim year table 10 the states like andhra pradesh and tamil nadu had better irrigation scenario even before the pim reform due to better irrigation infrastructure and the non foodgrain crops are more preferred after pim thus the impact of pim on foodgrain productivity is not found significant in these states similarly madhya pradesh state s three major crops are wheat gram and paddy the food grains productivity of which did not affected by pim reform the states like karnataka odisha and rajasthan were predominantly having areas under rainfed agriculture and less irrigated area before pim period that increased after pim which impacted on foodgrain productivity it reiterates that pim reform works better in the areas with relatively lesser irrigation intensity gany et al 2019 reviewed institutional frameworks for implementation of pim undertaken in 14 countries and regions including australia china india indonesia iran japan malaysia mexico nepal south korea sudan chinese taipei turkey and ukraine which revealed food security as a major concern in all the countries and regions reviewed thus the empirical analyses undertaken in present study on effect of pim on foodgrain productivity in six states implementing pim in india is important for future policy advocacy on water and food security findings of present study are found similar to may impact studies undertaken in other countries progress of pim in different countries of the world show some positive results in crop production scenario an evaluation of pim in 29 irrigation schemes in asia africa and latin american countries was undertaken in which the most often reported positive impacts are increase in irrigated area crop yields and cropping intensity salas and wilson 2004 bhatta et al 2005 in their study in nepal also observed that rice productivity increased by more than 30 per cent 2 7 to 3 6 t ha and the overall profits from agriculture has been doubled due to increased inputs use use of improved varieties and better management practices due to changes in irrigation managers from government agencies to the farmers however sam amoah and gowing 2001 in a case study of management transfer of a rice irrigation scheme in ghana reported that whilst both cropping intensity and cultivated area decreased after transfer the relatively high yields were sustained in pakistan farmers managed irrigation systems have witnessed an increase in irrigated area by 6 to 7 per cent even under severe drought like conditions latif and pomee 2003 kloezen 1995 and restrepo 2004 reported significant improvements in crop yields irrigation and other input supplies in schemes that have undergone both rehabilitation and imt in sri lanka in philippines participatory irrigation systems commands had higher dry season rice yields 93 versus 83 cavanas ha farmers net income per month increased from 764 to 1149 pesos gains for tail end farmers due to equity in water deliveries are reported niaconsult 1993 however according to restrepo 2004 there was no significant yield difference between the systems with or without imt on the basis of evidence drawn over 15 year period in mexico upward trend was shown in yields of wheat barley and bean however this trend started before imt cropping intensity increased from 110 to 165 percent in one out of four systems evaluated in columbia restrepo 2004 reviews of iwmi studies on the impact of pim and imt on crop performance restrepo 2004 examined for 18 systems in 11 countries and reported that non rice producing irrigation systems can be more productive than the rice producing irrigation systems by 100 to 200 per cent pim in turkey has resulted an increase in irrigated areas and the irrigation ratio increased around 4 per cent from 58 to 62 as reported by yercan et al 2004 and kucu et al 2008 in du niger irrigation scheme in mali where rice is the major crop revealed an improvement of irrigation efficiency by at least 14 per cent and increase in total rice output due to the expansion of the irrigated area after the collective action of farmers in irrigation management vandersypen et al 2009 senanayake et al 2015 have done systematic review of all available impact assessments of imt pim in asia africa and latin america published since 1994 that included 230 case studies of 181 separate imt pim interventions and found the strength of the methods used to infer impact was low or very low in almost all cases for water users associations to play a more significant role in water governance they have to be context specific with better understanding of local perspectives make strategic use of social capital and cope with shared and or conflicting interests among stakeholders zhou et al 2017 in their study at north western china found the participation level in irrigation management is very low 40 in addition most of the farmers have superficial understanding of the roles and management scheme of wuas empirical results show that though significantly positive the magnitude of the impact of pim on irrigation water use efficiency in maize crop is relatively small wuas are not operating with their designed objectives reforms suggested for wuas to make them more transparent fair and farmers participatory for water users associations to play a more significant role in water governance they have to be context specific with better understanding of local perspectives make strategic use of social capital and cope with shared and or conflicting interests among stakeholders yu 2016 indian states have witnessed positive influence in agricultural and irrigation scenario on implementation of pim but the extent of impact varies spatially as recorded during present study the findings of present study schematically present in fig 5 unlike present study the progress of pim in india has been evaluated as isolated studies and mostly one time evaluation studies which indicate positive effect on crop production in andhra pradesh first state to enact pim farmers management of irrigation systems have expanded irrigated area reduced flooding losses resulted an early cropping calendar as a result of improved drainage and higher yields of paddy crop svendsen and huppert 2003 analyses from a sample of 222 wuas covering 22 districts in andhra pradesh reddy and reddy 2005 revealed that canal systems in all locations have experienced increased productivity of paddy while tank wuas have experienced negative growth this reiterates the findings of present study reddy and reddy 2005 mentioned hardly any improvement in tank systems as degraded tanks needed more allocation for rehabilitation for improvement in water availability the same is observed in all six states covered under present study the results of the impact assessment of pim and imt in maharashtra carried out by naik et al 2002 and mckay and keremane 2006 revealed an increase in cultivated area shift in cropping pattern towards high value crops and increased yields in one of the canal system mula minor 7 and no increase in agricultural productivity in another canal system bhima minor 10 this finding again shows the spatial variation in success of pim the impact evaluation of rehabilitation and imt in three selected minor irrigation systems mis in odisha revealed increase in cultivated area by 9 6 22 per cent yields of all crops cropping intensity by 10 26 per cent and irrigation intensity by 15 57 per cent mishra et al 2013 thus the present findings based on panel data reveal the successes of pim in influencing the agricultural and irrigation scenario in general and foodgrain productivity in particular in three states which otherwise having unfavourable irrigation regime before the pim reform indian national commission on surface water indian national committee on surface water incsw 2017 described status of pim as developing with the challenges like low capacities of wua and water scarcity low supply high demand an integrated approach for agricultural water management pricing mechanisms for irrigation water better demand supply management and technological upgrades are suggested for implementation according to gany et al 2019 in india though pim is expected to bring substantial improvement in the overall irrigation system its impact is not as yet visible on a large scale due to the unsustainability of the wuas in many cases despite several local success stories of pim the widespread effect is yet to happen capacity building of wuas through training of farmers and promotion of improved technologies to enhance agricultural production and productivity are important component however the capacities of farmers need to be strengthened for the pim legislation to bring about the desired effects 4 conclusions analysis under present study suggests spatial variations in the impact of pim on food grain productivity and overall irrigation and agriculture development pim s impact on food grain productivity is significant more in traditionally rain fed states results imply that targeting rain fed states with low food grain productivity is important in efforts to reform irrigation sector in india transfer of irrigation management responsibilities from government agencies to farmers is now an important policy not only in india but also in other developing countries in this context findings from this study will have the policy implications for irrigation development and management in other developing countries which are planning on such reforms positive impact of pim reform would more depend on future efforts to improve surface irrigation efficiency keeping the efficiency of groundwater

10946,after a decade of implementation of participatory irrigation management pim policy in india the impact of pim on agricultural and irrigation scenario is studied in six states andhra pradesh karnataka tamil nadu madhya pradesh odisha and rajasthan implementing the pim reform in case of each state district level panel data of 10 years each before and after the pim enactment is analyzed for the variables depicting agricultural and irrigation scenario the decadal mean values calculated before and after implementation of pim indicate that increased share of net irrigated area to net sown area 3 12 increased productivity of major crops 11 20 increased food grain productivity 8 39 with decreased share of food grain crops area to gross sown area 1 3 increased area under high yielding varieties in three states 13 54 increased cropping intensity in five states 3 12 and increased fertiliser consumption 21 80 during post pim period net irrigated area has shown an increase from 6 to 38 percent that is because of relatively more increase in groundwater irrigated area 16 63 as compared to canal irrigated area after pim 16 to 31 district wise agricultural development index adi and irrigation development index idi are derived showing betterment in both after pim reform feasible generalized least squares fgls regression models are worked out that revealed variations in impact of pim in the states of india the pim has made significant impact on food grain productivity as evident from the significant coefficient value for interaction term between year and pim dummy in case of karnataka odisha and rajasthan in case of other three states the impact of pim is not significantly visible keywords agricultural scenario india irrigation management transfer irrigation scenario 1 introduction poor performance of government managed irrigation systems persists in developing countries despite numerous policy interventions over the past decades there is a general agreement that performance of government managed irrigation systems in developing countries has remained sub optimal jones 1995 turral 1995 malano hofwegen 1999 mukherji et al 2009 abernethy 2010 which is caused by deterioration of physical infrastructure due to deferred maintenance poor incentives financial and weak institutional arrangements for infrastructure management coward 1984 dinar and subramanian 1997 groenfeldt and svendsen 2000 the bottleneck for good performance of any irrigation scheme is often found in the water delivery system malano et al 1999 mateos et al 2002 to address the performance problems and their causes number of reforms has been implemented across the countries usually backed with substantial financial support from major international donor agencies such as the world bank the asian development bank adb and the us agency for international development usaid these reforms have made a shift from construction and rehabilitation to operation and maintenance o mara 1990 improve infrastructure condition formation of water users associations wuas giving farmers a greater involvement in system management bottrall 1981 world bank 1986 introduction of irrigation service fees isfs for improving system cost recovery svendsen 1994 dinar and subramanian 1997 and irrigation management transfer imt to farmers for their greater control and responsibility in irrigation management groenfeldt and svendsen 2000 johnson et al 2004 as a result of the debate over non performance of publicly supplied irrigation system the participatory irrigation management pim and imt has been advocated as a solution and remained a central occupant of institutional reform in the irrigation sector worldwide since the 1980s implementation of imt pim peaked in the 1990s when the policies became the de facto national irrigation strategies in most of the developing countries presently imt pim is being implemented in nearly 60 countries food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao 2007 remains the main institutional solution for irrigation management problems in the developing world despite the wide spread and continued application of imt pim as a remedy for poor irrigation system performance the actual effectiveness of transfer programs in terms of improving irrigation agricultural and management efficiency is still a subject of much debate irrigation is critical to agricultural growth as it increases land use intensity and cropping intensity and allows farmers to use modern production technology there by significantly increase land crop productivity kumar 2010 vaidyanathan 2013 the irrigation sector has always been emphasized due to its yield augmenting impact and treated as one of the priority areas of india s agricultural development strategy with a substantial financial support in successive five year plans agarwal and narain 1999 central water commission 2012 irrigated agriculture in about 48 per cent net sown area contributes to 60 per cent of the india s food grain production irrigation development in india has been quite remarkable with an increase in irrigation potential from 22 6 m ha in 1950 1951 to about 123 m ha at present including 42 m ha under major and medium irrigation project 14 and 67 m ha under minor surface and minor groundwater lift project respectively making it a world leader in irrigation the central challenge facing irrigated agriculture today and in the foreseeable future is more crops per drop or more crop and less drop giordano et al 2006 ministry of water resources govt of india 2017 the problems in irrigation sector in india include low irrigation efficiency 30 35 deteriorating physical structures inadequate maintenance low cost recovery under utilization 74 of created potential uncontrolled water delivery tail end water deprivation seepage loss siltation waterlogging and soil salinity ghosh et al 2005 in their study reported tail end deprivation in irrigation service farmers perceived tractability quantity stream size and point of delivery of water convenience timing flow rate duration and frequency of water supply and predictability knowledge of future water supply certainty of water availability and management decisions influenced by water supply of irrigation service in decreasing order direct effects of irrigation include reduction in downstream river flow increased evaporation in the irrigated area increased level in the water table due to increase in groundwater recharge and flow in the irrigated area the indirect effects of irrigation include waterlogging soil salination ecological damage and socioeconomic impacts which take longer to happen but can be more far reaching adverse impacts are reduced river flow waterlogging soil salinity reduced downstream river water quality affected downstream water users lost land use opportunities groundwater mining with wells land subsidence etc the waterlogging and soil salination occur directly on the land being irrigated in india 2 19 million ha have been reported to suffer from waterlogging in irrigation canal commands also 3 47 million ha were reported to be seriously salt affected tyagi 1996 singh 2005 in case of irrigation schemes using water wells for irrigation the overall water level decreases causing water mining land soil subsidence saltwater intrusion along the coast however the potential positive effects of the irrigation project outweigh the potential negative impacts worldwide about 16 of the total agricultural area is irrigated roughly providing 40 of the total crop yield sundquist 2007 thus irrigated land produces 2 5 times more produce than non irrigated land based on the concept of people s management of developmental infrastructures that requires local solution to local problems affecting them the national water policy of india 1987 2002 stressed on farmers participation in irrigation management several states in india have been implementing the pim reform and transferring the irrigation management to wuas with a view to provide equitable timely and assured irrigation however in india adoption of pim has been slow compared to some other countries in fact the pim is in the process of evolution and different models of pim are being tried in the country based on the state s water resources irrigation development and social and political setup pant 2007 although thousands of user groups have been formed a closer examination is the need of the hour as there are less than achievable benefits of the reforms due to inefficient water use social power capture by rural elites in the name of participation inadequate support from government institutions and other factors swain and das 2008 there has been some concern about the sustainability of the pim approach and how participatory is pim reddy and reddy 2005 mckay and keremane 2006 kulkalrni et al 2009 currently there is inadequate understanding of the linkage between socio cultural institutional and ecological factors affecting the outcome of the pim reforms in india saravanan 2010 khadra et al 2018 opined that one of the major shortcomings of the pim imt programs undertaken in many countries of the world is the predominant absence of monitoring evaluation m e systems specifically addressed to these processes to correct improve and learn they suggested a monitoring and evaluation moneva system tailored to pim imt programs and adapted to different mediterranean countries the system is based on the principles of the logical framework this is a kind of decision support system dss having a potential for improving the implementation of the pim imt programs through the identification of their criticalities and facilitating the corrective actions at government agency and wua levels international commission on irrigation and drainage icid working group on institutional and organizational aspects wg ioa organized an international symposium with the theme global review of institutional reforms in the irrigation sector for sustainable agricultural water management including wuas during the 23rd icid congress 8 14 october 2017 in mexico city the symposium deliberated upon legal framework and organizational structure including wuas for water supply services pim and management transfer approaches and conditions for successful irrigation and drainage and public private partnership ppp in irrigation and drainage operation and maintenance towards sustainable irrigated agricultural water management based on this a review on institutional reforms in the irrigation sector in 14 countries and regions including australia china india indonesia iran japan malaysia mexico nepal south korea sudan chinese taipei turkey and ukraine was done by gany et al 2019 despite the diverse geography and institutional frameworks in irrigation sector food security remains a major concern in all the countries and regions reviewed the formation and functioning of wuas ageing irrigation and drainage infrastructure and its operation and management remain to be the major institutional and ppp challenges for sustainable agricultural water management in the immediate future one of the metrics to assess the success of pim is to assess its impact on food grain production and or cropping intensity if pim has contributed to increased water use efficiency through better management of available irrigation water at the local level then it should have reflected in overall food grain productivity at the local level spatial variations in approaches to pim implementation might result in spatial variations in its overall impact an overall understanding of irrigation development in india will be helpful to understand the reasons for spatial variations in implementation and impact of pim this will also help us answer questions such as whether pim is the best strategy for improving irrigation management in all the states in india or whether there are any spatial variations in its impact additionally empirical evidence on the effects of participatory irrigation management on crop productivity and irrigation efficiency at aggregate level is lacking in the existing literature the present study has undertaken an ex post assessment of effects of pim on food grain productivity using district level panel data from six states in india the objectives of our study are three fold first to conduct a comparative analysis of irrigation scenario during pre and post pim periods second to examine the impact of pim on food grain productivity and third to identify the factors contributing to the spatio temporal variations in pim s impact 2 methodology 2 1 locale of the study and background of pim under the constitution of india water is state subject union government play the role of a facilitator but the actual implementation of pim is done by the states so far 84 779 wuas have been formed in various states covering an area of 17 8 m ha under various commands of irrigation schemes gany et al 2019 it is important for creation and successfully functioning of any organisation to have adequate legal backup in india 16 out of 29 states have enacted pim while all the states have been implementing pim ministry of water resources govt of india 2012 the states which are yet to do the enactment follow various approaches for implementation of pim however states enacted pim follow almost similar approach six states andhra pradesh karnataka tamil nadu madhya pradesh odisha and rajasthan implementing the pim reform are included in the present study fig 1 andhra pradesh enacted andhra pradesh farmers management of irrigation system act 1997 karnataka promulgated an ordinance on 7th june 2000 for amendment of the existing karnataka irrigation act 1957 rajasthan passed the rajasthan sinchai pranali ke prabandh me krishkon ki sahabhagita adhiniyam 2000 farmers participation in irrigation management in rajasthan byelaws 2000 tamil nadu enacted the tamil nadu farmers management of irrigation system act 2000 odisha implemented the orissa pani panchayat act 2002 and orissa pani panchayat rule 2003 these enabling laws and or byelaws ensure formation of wuas for undertaking management of irrigation participation of farmers in irrigation management to manage the irrigation systems within the operational area under wua legal rights to wua to receive irrigation water at the head of the irrigation system in the operational area of wua from irrigation agency legal powers to distribute irrigation water among the members in the operational area by wua empowering wua in developing a suitable crop pattern based on health of land water availability and climatological conditions without degradation of land within operational area fixation of water rates for different crops on area basis collection of water charges from the farmers for utilization of irrigation water generation of resources from donor agencies other than the water charges maintenance grant resolving conflicts among farmers members and non members and wuas etc ministry of water resources govt of india 2007 the structural arrangements of wua pani panchayat indicate the involvement of both irrigation and agriculture department to facilitate proper planning and implementation of irrigation and agriculture in the irrigation command fig 2 there is no uniform procedure to form wuas its structural development size and organisation used to be at the convenience of farmers and the irrigation department the size of a wua is in between 500 to 750 ha on a hydraulic unit preferably a minor covering one or more villages a minor irrigation project is managed by one wua a single tier system the medium irrigation project is managed by a two tier system having wuas at minor level and apex body at project level in a major irrigation project it is a three tier system the wua at minor level a federation or a distributary committee at branch canal distributary level and apex body at project level in all cases mentioned above wua is the only registered body all farmers in the operational area of the wua may become its members the wua has a managing committee which consists of a president vice president treasurer and a secretary in addition to at least five members state irrigation agriculture command area development and revenue departments also nominate one officer from each department to be included in the managing committee who help managing committee in its functioning in addition of the by laws another important legal document is the transfer agreement or the memorandum of understanding between the wua and the irrigation department this agreement contains the terms and conditions of transfer of the system and clearly spells out the duties and responsibilities of irrigation department and wua handing over of the system method of its operation and supply of irrigation water in bulk at agreed time and quantities in different crop seasons are included in the agreement the transfer agreement clearly defines the area of operation of wua the details of the irrigation system with its present condition and the existing structures with their technical details the plan map delineating the area of operation irrigation distribution network and location of structures is attached with the transfer agreement technical details like longitudinal and the cross section of the system is also attached with the document it specifies the procedure to be adopted for the management of irrigation in the operation area the agreement used to be valid for a specified period but having been satisfied with the performance the agreement may be renewed for a further mutually agreed period the grounds for termination of agreement are clearly mentioned in the agreement present study was conducted in such six out of 13 states where pim enacted at an early period so as to have the district level data of agricultural and irrigation development indicators for 10 years each before and after implementation of pim to study the effect of pim reform 2 2 data and analyses district level data were analyzed for the variables depicting irrigation and agricultural scenario district wise data on selected variables were taken from the published database under village dynamics in south asia vdsa project of international crop research institute in semi arid tropics icrisat hyderabad india the data pertained to 10 years each before and after the pim enactment and implementation period in the states of andhra pradesh tamil nadu karnataka madhya pradesh odisha and rajasthan following the planning commission s presently names as niti aayog approach in state development reports the variables were selected to assess irrigation and agricultural scenario before and after enactment of pim with the help of different indexes decadal mean and standard deviation sd of each of the parameters related to agricultural and irrigation scenario are calculated in order to depict the agricultural as well as irrigation scenario of the respective states during pre and post pim implementation period 2 2 1 agricultural development index adi the district wise agricultural scenario was analyzed with the help of a composite agricultural development index adi in the selected states ghosh et al 2017 analysed district wise agricultural scenario in an eastern indian state with the help of a similar index that was constructed by the deprivation method using 11 parameters similar to those given in the report

agricultural development during pre pim and post pim period the changes in cultivable land net sown area and net irrigated area in the six study states during pre and post pim period are presented in table 1 the coverage of cultivable land remained similar in andhra pradesh and karnataka during post pim period that is about 55 and 60 percent of total land respectively extent of decrease of cultivable land is found about 1 5 in tamil nadu and odisha the share of cultivable land has increased by about one percent both in madhya pradesh and rajasthan after implementation of pim the percentage of net sown area to cultivable area nsa to cl has not changed much in andhra pradesh madhya pradesh and rajasthan during post pim period and remained 73 92 and 81 percent respectively the share of net sown area has declined in the states like karnataka from 87 to 84 tamil nadu from 75 to 70 and odisha from 91 to 87 as evident from the mean value during 10 years period after implementation of pim in these states the decadal mean values calculated before and after implementation of pim indicate that the share of net irrigated area to net sown area nia to nsa has increased in all six selected states during post pim period the extent of increase is three percent in andhra pradesh four percent in tamil nadu six percent in karnataka eight percent in rajasthan 10 percent in madhya pradesh and 12 percent in odisha table 1 the area under major crops in six states is presented in terms of mean of 10 years and standard deviation before and after implementation of pim table 2 the major crops are found different in the selected states therefore three major crops are considered in each state paddy is the major crop in four out of six selected states in andhra pradesh maximum area is occupied by paddy followed by groundnut and cotton both pre and post pim period however the area under cotton has increased and that of groundnut has decreased during post pim period while the area under paddy has remained almost same 30 of gross sown area paddy millets and sorghum are three major crops in karnataka the area under paddy remained almost same after implementation of pim however the areas under both millets and sorghum have declined with extent of decline more in case of sorghum during post pim period both these crops are drought resistant and non irrigated therefore farmers have started growing other irrigated crops like vegetables etc after implementation of pim with better irrigation regime in tamil nadu the area under paddy and groundnut has decreased by about one and four percent respectively during post pim period while that under sugarcane has increased marginally wheat is the major crop in madhya pradesh the area of which has increased marginally after implementation of pim gram and paddy are other two major crops grown in madhya pradesh areas under which have increased marginally during post pim period in odisha paddy has occupied more than half of the gross sown area about 50 of gross sown area both during pre and post pim period maize being the second major crop has shown an increase in its area during post pim period with more than four times increase in growth rate the major crops of rajasthan are bajra wheat and maize the area under bajra has declined by one percent during post pim period the decadal mean value for area under wheat shows almost same after implementation of pim maize the third major crop has shown a better situation as the decadal mean area has increased from 10 to 12 percent of gross sown area table 2 the productivity of the major crops of the aforesaid states has increased varying from 2 to 67 on an average 11 20 considering all three major crops across six selected states together during post pim period as compared to pre pim period as evident from the decadal mean values of productivity barring the sugarcane in tamil nadu productivity of which has decreased 11 155 to 10 613 kg ha table 3 the decadal mean of total area under high yielding varieties hyvs during pre and post pim period indicates an increase in karnataka 158 to 232 thousand ha odisha 3171 to 3589 thousand ha and rajasthan 3171 to 3589 thousand ha during post pim period table 4 while tamil nadu has shown a decrease in decadal mean of total area under hyvs during post pim period 2494 to 2219 thousand hectare the share of area under food grains has decreased 1 7 in five out of six selected states while it has remained almost stationary in karnataka the growth is negative in case of all the states during post pim period this may be attributed to the fact of shift in cropping pattern from food grains to more remunerative non food grains crops with better irrigation scenario after implementation of the pim the mean productivity of food grains has increased in all selected states with maximum increase in andhra pradesh 1631 to 2119 kg ha and minimum increase in madhya pradesh 1111 to 1242 kg ha the growth is positive for all states during post pim period in fact it has been shifted from negative to positive in case of odisha the cropping intensity has increased in all the six selected states except in tamil nadu the extent of increase is between three percent in karnataka and 12 percent in odisha table 5 all the states have depicted a positive growth during the post pim implementation period fertiliser consumption has increased by 21 80 percent with maximum increase in andhra pradesh 77 13 120 14 thousand tonnes and minimum increase in madhya pradesh 19 83 32 18 thousand tonnes after implementation of pim in the respective states 3 2 district wise agricultural development scenario in the states implementing pim district wise comparative agricultural development in the selected states before and after implementation of pim is assessed with the help of agriculture development index adi that considers all the parameters discussed above together to derive the index for each district of a state the adi in the districts of selected six states i e andhra pradesh karnataka tamil nadu madhya pradesh odisha and rajasthan during pre pim and post pim reform period is depicted in fig 3 out of 19 undivided districts in undivided state of andhra pradesh presently andhra pradesh state has been bifurcated into two states viz telangana and seemandhra states 10 have fallen in low adi categories 0 20 0 40 during pre pim period while eight districts are there in this category during post pim period five districts were found in medium category with adi value between 0 40 and 0 60 before implementation of pim while it is increased by two districts after implementation of pim four districts were found under the category of high with adi values ranging between 0 60 and 0 80 which continued to remain same during post pim period karnataka has shown an improvement in agricultural scenario as after the enactment of pim in the state the number of districts falling under medium range 0 40 0 60 has increased from ten to twelve along with decrease in number of districts 8 to 7 in low range of adi tamil nadu has shown an increase in the number of districts from three to five falling under category of very low to low adi in post pim period as compared to pre pim period as number of districts under medium and high category is decreased after the enactment of pim in the state thus relatively less development in agriculture is visualized during post pim period in the state the performance of madhya pradesh has also shown an improvement as one districts has fallen under the high category during post period which was nil previously in medium category number of district has increased by one however number of districts falling under very low and low categories remained same the state of odisha has shown a better agricultural scenario as the number of districts falling under low category has decreased during post pim period and the number of districts under medium category has increased by one one district is found with high adi value both during pre and post pim enactment rajasthan has not shown much change in agriculture as the districts falling under very low to low remained same after the implementation of pim along with increase in the number of districts under medium category by one and reduction by one in high category adi 3 3 performance of irrigation development indicators during pre pim and post pim period net irrigated area has shown an increase in five out of six selected states after the implementation of pim 6 in andhra pradesh 27 in karnataka 28 in rajasthan 36 in odisha and 38 in madhya pradesh except in tamil nadu decreased marginally from 2794 02 to 2764 94 thousand ha i e by 1 the decadal mean of irrigation coverage nia to nsa has increased in all selected six states after implementation of pim table 6 the maximum increase was observed in odisha 12 and minimum in andhra pradesh 3 groundwater irrigated area registered an increase in all the states 16 in tamil nadu 42 in rajasthan 45 in odisha 46 in madhya pradesh 51 in andhra pradesh and 63 in karnataka during post pim period as compared to pre pim period the decadal 10 years mean values calculated before and after enactment of pim indicate that the share of groundwater irrigation area to net sown area gia to nsa has increased 5 8 in all selected six states during post pim period the share of groundwater irrigated area in net irrigated area has increased ranging from 3 in odisha to 14 in andhra pradesh as evident from table 7 decadal mean canal irrigated area has increased in karnataka by seven percent 926 79 992 75 thousand ha madhya pradesh by 10 percent 930 61 1021 71 thousand ha odisha by 31 percent 1413 73 1850 89 thousand ha and rajasthan by 10 percent 1412 87 1558 65 thousand ha during post pim period as compared to pre pim period table 8 the same has decreased in the states of andhra pradesh by 10 percent 1718 45 1547 39 thousand ha and tamil nadu by 16 percent 800 56 672 21 thousand ha with respect to the share of canal irrigated area to net sown area cia to nsa an increase of five per cent is found in odisha during post pim period a marginal increase about 1 is found in madhya pradesh karnataka and rajasthan however it has decreased in andhra pradesh 17 08 15 50 and tamil nadu 13 81 to 12 55 during post pim period the share of canal irrigated area in net irrigated area has decreased 2 7 during post pim period in case of all the selected six states tank irrigated area has showed a decline in four out of six states barring madhya pradesh and odisha during post pim period table 9 the percentage of tank irrigated area to net sown area tia to nsa has decreased in andhra pradesh tamil nadu and rajasthan while it is almost stationary in madhya pradesh and karnataka it has showed an increase in odisha the share of tank irrigated area in net irrigated area has decreased during post pim period in case of all the selected six states 3 4 district wise irrigation development scenario in the states implementing pim district wise comparative irrigation development in the selected states before and after implementation of pim is assessed with the help of irrigation development index idi that considers overall irrigation area both ground and surface and share of irrigation area both ground and surface in cropped area to derive the index for each district of a state the idi of the six states i e andhra pradesh karnataka tamil nadu madhya pradesh odisha and rajasthan during and after pim reform is depicted in fig 4 in andhra pradesh number of districts remained same in case of low idi category 0 20 0 40 while it is decreased by one district in very low idi category 0 0 20 during the post pim period three districts were found to be in medium category with adi value 0 40 0 60 before as well as after pim enactment five and one districts were observed to have fallen under the category of high 0 60 0 80 and very high adi 0 80 1 00 which is increased by one district in case of former category and remained same in case of the later after implementation of pim showing a little improvement in irrigation scenario idi values in the districts of karnataka show that the number of districts falling under high category 0 60 0 80 is reduced by three after the enactment of pim in the state there is no change in very high category idi however number of districts in medium range of idi 0 40 0 60 has increased from four to six while there is no change in number of districts under very low category of idi number of district is increased by one in low category of idi during post pim period in case of tamil nadu idi of one district have fallen under each very low and low category of idi during pre as well as post pim period there in an increased in number of districts under high category that is due to shift of one district from medium category of idi in post pim period the number of districts has remained same in very high category of idi in pre and post pim period this again indicates a beginning of the improvement in irrigation development in few districts of the state the irrigation development in madhya pradesh depicts an improvement after enactment and implementation of pim there is a decrease of two districts under very low and three districts under low category of idi values during post pim period the number of districts under medium category of idi is increased from 13 to 19 after implementation of pim while number of districts has remained same under high category it has reduced by one in very high category after implementation of the pim in state in odisha number of districts has decreased by two both under very low and medium category of idi values however the same gas increased by three under low category of idi during post pim period the number of districts is increased by two in high category and decreased by one in very high category of idi after implementation of pim in case of rajasthan the number of districts falling under low high and very high categories of idi remained same both before and after implementation of pim the number of districts has increased by two in very low category of idi while the same has decreased by two in case of medium category after enactment and implementation of pim in the state 3 5 impact of pim reform on food grain productivity descriptive statistics of panel data for 10 years each before and after implementation of pim indicate betterment with respect to area under non food grains crops productivity of most of the major crops both food grains crops and non food grains crops areas under hyvs cropping intensity and fertiliser consumption during post pim period these improvements may be attributed to the better irrigation regimes in the respective states after implementation of the pim however the effect of pim reform on food grain productivity was assessed with a panel regression function using feasible generalized least squares fgls technique this empirical analysis indicates that southern states such as andhra pradesh and tamil nadu and central state madhya pradesh did not show any significant effect of pim on food grain productivity while another southern state karnataka eastern state odhisa and western state rajasthan witnessed positive and significant effect on food grain productivity as evident from significant coefficient values in case of interaction pim year table 10 the states like andhra pradesh and tamil nadu had better irrigation scenario even before the pim reform due to better irrigation infrastructure and the non foodgrain crops are more preferred after pim thus the impact of pim on foodgrain productivity is not found significant in these states similarly madhya pradesh state s three major crops are wheat gram and paddy the food grains productivity of which did not affected by pim reform the states like karnataka odisha and rajasthan were predominantly having areas under rainfed agriculture and less irrigated area before pim period that increased after pim which impacted on foodgrain productivity it reiterates that pim reform works better in the areas with relatively lesser irrigation intensity gany et al 2019 reviewed institutional frameworks for implementation of pim undertaken in 14 countries and regions including australia china india indonesia iran japan malaysia mexico nepal south korea sudan chinese taipei turkey and ukraine which revealed food security as a major concern in all the countries and regions reviewed thus the empirical analyses undertaken in present study on effect of pim on foodgrain productivity in six states implementing pim in india is important for future policy advocacy on water and food security findings of present study are found similar to may impact studies undertaken in other countries progress of pim in different countries of the world show some positive results in crop production scenario an evaluation of pim in 29 irrigation schemes in asia africa and latin american countries was undertaken in which the most often reported positive impacts are increase in irrigated area crop yields and cropping intensity salas and wilson 2004 bhatta et al 2005 in their study in nepal also observed that rice productivity increased by more than 30 per cent 2 7 to 3 6 t ha and the overall profits from agriculture has been doubled due to increased inputs use use of improved varieties and better management practices due to changes in irrigation managers from government agencies to the farmers however sam amoah and gowing 2001 in a case study of management transfer of a rice irrigation scheme in ghana reported that whilst both cropping intensity and cultivated area decreased after transfer the relatively high yields were sustained in pakistan farmers managed irrigation systems have witnessed an increase in irrigated area by 6 to 7 per cent even under severe drought like conditions latif and pomee 2003 kloezen 1995 and restrepo 2004 reported significant improvements in crop yields irrigation and other input supplies in schemes that have undergone both rehabilitation and imt in sri lanka in philippines participatory irrigation systems commands had higher dry season rice yields 93 versus 83 cavanas ha farmers net income per month increased from 764 to 1149 pesos gains for tail end farmers due to equity in water deliveries are reported niaconsult 1993 however according to restrepo 2004 there was no significant yield difference between the systems with or without imt on the basis of evidence drawn over 15 year period in mexico upward trend was shown in yields of wheat barley and bean however this trend started before imt cropping intensity increased from 110 to 165 percent in one out of four systems evaluated in columbia restrepo 2004 reviews of iwmi studies on the impact of pim and imt on crop performance restrepo 2004 examined for 18 systems in 11 countries and reported that non rice producing irrigation systems can be more productive than the rice producing irrigation systems by 100 to 200 per cent pim in turkey has resulted an increase in irrigated areas and the irrigation ratio increased around 4 per cent from 58 to 62 as reported by yercan et al 2004 and kucu et al 2008 in du niger irrigation scheme in mali where rice is the major crop revealed an improvement of irrigation efficiency by at least 14 per cent and increase in total rice output due to the expansion of the irrigated area after the collective action of farmers in irrigation management vandersypen et al 2009 senanayake et al 2015 have done systematic review of all available impact assessments of imt pim in asia africa and latin america published since 1994 that included 230 case studies of 181 separate imt pim interventions and found the strength of the methods used to infer impact was low or very low in almost all cases for water users associations to play a more significant role in water governance they have to be context specific with better understanding of local perspectives make strategic use of social capital and cope with shared and or conflicting interests among stakeholders zhou et al 2017 in their study at north western china found the participation level in irrigation management is very low 40 in addition most of the farmers have superficial understanding of the roles and management scheme of wuas empirical results show that though significantly positive the magnitude of the impact of pim on irrigation water use efficiency in maize crop is relatively small wuas are not operating with their designed objectives reforms suggested for wuas to make them more transparent fair and farmers participatory for water users associations to play a more significant role in water governance they have to be context specific with better understanding of local perspectives make strategic use of social capital and cope with shared and or conflicting interests among stakeholders yu 2016 indian states have witnessed positive influence in agricultural and irrigation scenario on implementation of pim but the extent of impact varies spatially as recorded during present study the findings of present study schematically present in fig 5 unlike present study the progress of pim in india has been evaluated as isolated studies and mostly one time evaluation studies which indicate positive effect on crop production in andhra pradesh first state to enact pim farmers management of irrigation systems have expanded irrigated area reduced flooding losses resulted an early cropping calendar as a result of improved drainage and higher yields of paddy crop svendsen and huppert 2003 analyses from a sample of 222 wuas covering 22 districts in andhra pradesh reddy and reddy 2005 revealed that canal systems in all locations have experienced increased productivity of paddy while tank wuas have experienced negative growth this reiterates the findings of present study reddy and reddy 2005 mentioned hardly any improvement in tank systems as degraded tanks needed more allocation for rehabilitation for improvement in water availability the same is observed in all six states covered under present study the results of the impact assessment of pim and imt in maharashtra carried out by naik et al 2002 and mckay and keremane 2006 revealed an increase in cultivated area shift in cropping pattern towards high value crops and increased yields in one of the canal system mula minor 7 and no increase in agricultural productivity in another canal system bhima minor 10 this finding again shows the spatial variation in success of pim the impact evaluation of rehabilitation and imt in three selected minor irrigation systems mis in odisha revealed increase in cultivated area by 9 6 22 per cent yields of all crops cropping intensity by 10 26 per cent and irrigation intensity by 15 57 per cent mishra et al 2013 thus the present findings based on panel data reveal the successes of pim in influencing the agricultural and irrigation scenario in general and foodgrain productivity in particular in three states which otherwise having unfavourable irrigation regime before the pim reform indian national commission on surface water indian national committee on surface water incsw 2017 described status of pim as developing with the challenges like low capacities of wua and water scarcity low supply high demand an integrated approach for agricultural water management pricing mechanisms for irrigation water better demand supply management and technological upgrades are suggested for implementation according to gany et al 2019 in india though pim is expected to bring substantial improvement in the overall irrigation system its impact is not as yet visible on a large scale due to the unsustainability of the wuas in many cases despite several local success stories of pim the widespread effect is yet to happen capacity building of wuas through training of farmers and promotion of improved technologies to enhance agricultural production and productivity are important component however the capacities of farmers need to be strengthened for the pim legislation to bring about the desired effects 4 conclusions analysis under present study suggests spatial variations in the impact of pim on food grain productivity and overall irrigation and agriculture development pim s impact on food grain productivity is significant more in traditionally rain fed states results imply that targeting rain fed states with low food grain productivity is important in efforts to reform irrigation sector in india transfer of irrigation management responsibilities from government agencies to farmers is now an important policy not only in india but also in other developing countries in this context findings from this study will have the policy implications for irrigation development and management in other developing countries which are planning on such reforms positive impact of pim reform would more depend on future efforts to improve surface irrigation efficiency keeping the efficiency of groundwater

10947,almond prunus dulcis mill has been traditionally associated to marginal areas in andalusia being cultivated under rainfed agriculture conditions in the last few years it has been progressively introduced in many irrigated areas of the guadalquivir river basin which has promoted a growing interest about irrigation water management for this crop i e the potential irrigation requirements or the best irrigation strategy under sub optimal conditions aiming at obtaining balanced nut yields saving water without affecting yield this work examines the response of three almond cultivars cvs guara marta and lauranne subjected to different irrigation regimes in a semi arid mediterranean environment sw spain the trial was conducted over two seasons 2017 2018 in a commercial orchard with three irrigation regimes i a full irrigation treatment fi which received 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc as a control ii an over irrigated treatment 150 etc which received 150 of etc during the whole irrigation period and iii a regulated deficit irrigation treatment rdi65 which was irrigated at 100 etc during the whole irrigation season except during the kernel filling period when it received the 65 of etc in order to assess the crop water status the leaf water potential ψleaf and the stomatal conductance to water vapour gs were measured at the end of each season the yield kernel unit weight and irrigation water productivity were determined significant differences in physiological behaviour and yield responses among cultivars were found according to the final yield obtained during the experimental seasons guara and lauranne did not show significant improvements in the 150 etc in relation to fi and rdi65 whereas cv marta showed significant improvements under 150 etc moreover yield response followed the physiological trend observed in the different irrigation treatments for each cultivar those cultivars guara and lauranne that had not shown significant differences in terms of yield evidenced a similar pattern in terms of gs unlike marta the obtained results allow us to conclude that there is a clear differential response in terms of the cultivar taking into account the adaptation capacity of different cultivars to different irrigation doses keywords deficit irrigation crop physiological parameters irrigation water productivity nut yield 1 introduction almond prunus dulcis mill represents the third crop in terms of surface in spain and contributes to the 84 of the european production of almonds however this performance represents only 5 worldwide usa being the largest international producer with 80 of the world market faostat 2018 almond production in spain is generally low this is because this crop has been traditionally associated to marginal areas i e cultivated under very limited water conditions leading to those low yields 150 kg ha 1 garcía tejero et al 2018a these data contrast with those obtained in other countries such as usa or australia where this crop is cultivated under intensive practices and without irrigation restrictions obtaining higher yields in many cases up to 3000 kg ha 1 goldhamer and fereres 2017 irrigation is considered the main limiting factor for almond trees determining the yield in terms of fruit numbers and kernel unit weight and the nut quality goldhamer et al 2012 estimated that almond water requirements for the climatic conditions of california would range between 9000 and 13 500 m3 ha 1 depending on the plant density rootstock crop management or pruning system among other factors recently lópez lópez et al 2018 defined the optimum irrigation doses for almond cv guara under the climatic conditions of guadalquivir river basin s spain these being close to 8000 m3 ha 1 and similar to other irrigation doses applied under non limiting conditions for this same cultivar by garcía tejero et al 2018b these data contrast with those reported by goldhamer and fereres 2017 who concluded that in california almond crop reached the maximum yield close to 4000 kg ha 1 when the irrigation doses applied were around 1250 mm notwithstanding these results were obtained under other climatic conditions san joaquin river basin california and for a soft shell cultivar cv nonpareil therefore according to the maximum irrigation rates required by this crop its introduction as alternative to other traditional crops in arid and semiarid zones would be justified only if its productivity is improved by means of deficit irrigation di strategies in this sense almond is considered a drought tolerant species and its response under water scarcity conditions has been defined by several authors to improve its development under drought conditions minimizing the losses of production and fruit quality romero et al 2004 girona et al 2005 goldhamer et al 2006 egea et al 2013 in this context egea et al 2009 reported the effects of various irrigation strategies and water stress intensities on the growth and quality of almond nuts these authors demonstrated that di strategies does not affect the overall fruit growth pattern but a negative impact on the final kernel dry weight for the most severely stressed treatment was found in the same vein garcía tejero et al 2018b concluded that the kernel filling period would be a suitable phenological stage to apply water withholdings close to 50 etc for a long term period minimizing the yield losses on the other hand the cultivar is also important because not all have the same behaviour when a di strategy is applied up to day there are few works related to the study of the differential response of almond cultivars when these are subjected to different irrigation doses among the known experiments gomes laranjo et al 2006 studied the physiological response of five almond cultivars cvs lauranne masbovera ferragnès francoli and glorieta under non watered and a watered situations these authors concluded that cv ferragnès was the most sensitive to drought conditions something similar was reported by oliveira et al 2018 who compared the leaf anatomy and water relations in different cultivars of almond cvs ferragnès glorieta bonita casanova parada and pegarinhos concluding that cv ferragnès was the most sensitive to water stress due to its thin cuticle and the high stomatal density taking into account the previous experiments we hypothesize that on one hand a differential responsiveness in terms of yield can be observed depending on the cultivar when different irrigation regimes are applied in almond and on other hand a sustainable di strategy could be defined obtaining maximum yields for total irrigation doses close to 6000 m3 ha 1 thus the aim of the present study was to assess the nut yield and physiological response of three most popular almond cultivars cvs guara marta and lauranne when a moderate di strategy is imposed and corroborate the tree response when these three cultivars are subjected to different irrigation regimes in a semiarid mediterranean environment sw spain 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental conditions the trial was conducted during two seasons 2017 2018 in a commercial almond orchard prunus dulcis mill d a webb cvs guara marta and lauranne grafted onto gn15 rootstock located in the guadalquivir river basin 37 29 3 19 n 5 59 55 1 o seville sw spain trees were planted in 2007 spaced 8 6 m and drip irrigated using two pipe lines with emitters of 2 3 l h 1 spaced 0 75 m the soil is silty loam typical fluvisol usda 2010 with more than 2 5 m deep and organic matter content 1 5 roots are located predominately in the first 50 cm of soil 90 corresponding to the intended wetting depth although these exceed more than one meter in depth soil water content values at field capacity 0 033 mpa and permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa are 0 42 and 0 17 m3 m 3 respectively with an allowable soil water depletion level of 0 35 m3 m 3 the climatic classification of the study area is attenuated meso mediterranean with an annual et0 rate of 1400 mm and accumulated rainfall of 540 mm mainly distributed from october to april historical data for the last 20 years own development from the andalusian weather information network depending on the andalusian institute of training and agricultural research ifapa in spanish 2 2 irrigation regimes and experimental design the irrigation strategies design was performed in a mature and uniform almond orchards simulating three different scenarios i a full irrigated treatment fi which was irrigated in order to cover the 100 of the crop evapotranspiration etc during the irrigation period ii an over irrigated treatment 150 etc which was irrigated at 150 of etc during the entire irrigation period iii and a regulated deficit irrigation rdi65 covering the full irrigation requirements during the whole irrigation period 100 etc except during the kernel filling stage from the beginning of this to harvesting when was irrigated at 65 etc fi treatment was developed in order to simulate a scenario of optimum conditions in which trees would receive irrigation doses between 7500 and 8500 m3 ha 1 being these doses very similar to those irrigation requirements defined by lópez lópez et al 2018 in mature almond trees in the guadalquivir river basin the 150 etc treatment was designed considering the information provided by goldhamer and fereres 2017 these authors concluded that for mature almond trees well developed and cultivated under the climatic conditions of california similar to the current conditions in the experimental area the maximum yield values 4000 kg ha 1 would be reached under irrigation doses between 12 500 and 13 000 m3 ha 1 thus in spite of being these irrigation doses beyond the crop water requirements estimated in the experimental area this treatment was defined with the aim of testing if the final yield could be improved when almond trees were subjected to the irrigation amounts close to those irrigation doses reported by goldhamer and fereres 2017 finally rdi65 strategy was designed in order to define a moderate di strategy in which the total water applied at the end of the irrigation period were around 5000 and 6500 m3 ha 1 these doses being similar to others applied in traditional crops developed in the guadalquivir river basin under irrigated conditions such as citrus garcía tejero et al 2010a 2010b or olives carr 2013 this strategy was developed assuming that the kernel filling stage is the phenological period in which the water stress would cause a minor impact on yield garcía tejero et al 2018a this stage was determined by taking biweekly 12 samples of almonds for each irrigation treatment and cultivar and manually opened in order to observe the kernel status from the beginning of may till observing that grain was completely filled onset kernel filling period irrigation doses were calculated according to the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 obtaining the values of reference evapotranspiration et0 by using a weather station installed in the same experimental orchard davis advance pro2 davis instruments valencia spain the local crop coefficients used during the experimental period ranged from 0 4 to 1 2 according to the results obtained by garcía tejero et al 2015 we used a randomized block design with four replications per irrigation treatment and cultivar each replication had 12 trees 3 rows and 4 trees per row being monitored the two central trees for each replication n 8 2 3 plant measurements during the irrigation period crop water monitoring was done throughout the measurements of leaf water potential ψleaf in shaded leaves and the stomatal conductance to water vapour gs in well exposed sunny leaves these readings being taken between 12 00 and 13 30 gtm and with a periodicity of 7 10 days regarding to the measurements of ψleaf we took into account the experiments previously developed by other authors such as goldhamer and fereres 2004 these authors reported that water potential of shaded leaves covered with a damp cloth immediately prior to excision and quickly transported to the pressure chamber were highly correlated with stem water potential in almond ψleaf was measured using a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp sta barbara ca usa monitoring 8 trees per irrigation treatment two leaves per tree located in the north side of the tree and being totally mature fresh and shaded at 1 5 m of height approximately additionally in these same trees we measured the gs using a porometer sc 1 decagon devices inc wa usa these measurements being done in two leaves per monitored tree completely exposed to the sun and at 1 5 m of height approximately additionally with the aim of quantifying total water stress supported by the crop the stress integral si was calculated from ψleaf and gs data following the methodology proposed by myers 1988 1 2 1 s i l e a f ψ l e a f a v ψ l e a f m a x n where sileaf is the stress integral in terms of leaf water potential values ψ l e a f a v is the average leaf water potential for any interval ψ l e a f m a x is the maximum value of leaf water potential registered during the experimental period and n is the days numbers within each interval 2 s i g s g s m a x g s a v n where sigs is the stress integral in terms of stomatal conductance values g s a v is the average stomatal conductance for any interval g s m a x is the maximum value of stomatal conductance during the experimental period and n is the days numbers within each interval according to these indexes as higher values of sileaf and si gs higher water stress gathered by the crop in this sense these indexes provide information to quantify the water stress of a crop accumulated along a period this index allows to quantify the effect of water stress provided by the water restriction beyond its temporal distribution integrating the global stress supported by the crop in comparison to the punctual measurements at the end of each season it was monitored the final yield in terms of nut and kernel weight harvesting was carried out by using specific machinery for almond in this regard it was used a mechanic vibrator to throw the almond on the ground previously covered with a plastic mesh collected almonds were processed with a mechanic peeling to remove the hull finally once cleaned almonds were left to air dry and weighing once reached am humidity content around 6 finally almonds were processed with shelling machine obtaining the kernel yield for each irrigation treatment and cultivar in relation to the harvesting dates these were different for each cultivar and season in this sense in 2017 harvesting was developed at 207 220 and 234 doy for guara marta and lauranne respectively whereas in 2018 harvesting was carried out at 226 233 and 243 doy for guara marta and lauranne respectively moreover we randomly selected 100 almonds per replication n 8 of irrigation treatment and cultivar obtaining the ratio between kernel and nut yield and the kernel unit weight finally and considering the total irrigation applied in each treatment it was estimated the irrigation water productivity iwp defined as the ratio between kernel yield and irrigation water applied 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was developed by using the sigma plot statistical software version 12 5 systat software inc san jose ca usa first of all an exploratory descriptive analysis of data was done for each measurement day ψleaf and g s applying a levene s test to check the variance homogeneity of the variables studied within each cultivar significant differences between irrigation treatments p 0 05 in these physiological variables were identified by applying a one way anova and a tukey s test to study the means separation between treatments the relationships between sileaf and sigs for each cultivar were examined using a linear correlation analysis between these values comparing the obtained regressions slope and intercept using a covariance analysis to determine the variation in terms of the cultivar at the end of each season the kernel yield was analysed together with the unit weight and the ratio between kernel weight vs almond weight kernel shell for each treatment within each cultivar applying a levene s test to check the variance homogeneity and a one way anova with a tukey s test to study the means separation between treatments finally the water use efficiency was calculated thus the best irrigation strategy in terms of irrigation water applied and almond yield in order to study the whole of yield data obtained in both seasons a dataset normalization for each irrigation treatment and cultivar was done taken into consideration the methodology proposed by sterk and stein 1997 this methodology tries to minimize the variability associated to the particular conditions in each season grouping the values and allowing to apply an overall analysis with the entire of data according to this equation y n y i e l d i y i e l d a n u a l a v y i e l d t o t a l a v where y n is the normalized yield for each treatment and cultivar y i e l d i is the yield obtained for each replication y i e l d a n u a l a v is the average yield for a single treatment and cultivar in a year and y i e l d t o t a l a v is the average yield for a single treatment and cultivar during all the studied years 3 results 3 1 climatic conditions and water supply during the studied seasons the climatic conditions were very similar to those historically registered in the experimental area during 2017 table 1 total rainfall and reference evapotranspiration was 210 and 1337 mm respectively according to these conditions fi 150 etc etc and rdi65 received 852 1279 and 554 mm respectively fig 1 a considering that rdi65 from the beginning to 13th june doy 164 when water stress was applied and after harvesting it was irrigated with similar irrigation amounts than fi 100 etc during 2018 table 2 rainfall and reference evapotranspiration were 514 mm and 1102 mm respectively according to this the accumulative amounts of irrigation water applied in fi 150 etc and rdi65 were 687 1030 and 541 mm respectively fig 1b regarding to rdi65 from the beginning of the irrigation period to 12th june doy 163 when water stress was imposed and after harvesting it was irrigated with similar irrigation amounts than fi 3 2 physiological response to irrigation during the first studied season 2017 similar values of ψleaf were observed among the different irrigation treatments in the periods of low evaporative demand which correspond to fruit growth and postharvest stages these being significant different during the kernel filling stage fig 2 in this regard the values of ψleaf in 150 etc etc treatment were significantly higher than those obtained in the remaining three studied treatments in relation to rdi65 the ψleaf values were similar to fi during the fruit growth period and significantly lower when water withholding was applied during the kernel filling period from 172 doy to harvesting finally after harvesting ψleaf recovered till reach similar levels than those registered in 150 etc fig 2 a similar trend was observed in gs for each cultivar and irrigation regime in 2017 fig 3 as it was observed for ψleaf the most noticeable differences among irrigation treatments were observed during the kernel filling period specially between 150 etc etc and the remining treatments these differences being more pronounced at 192 199 200 and 234 doys moreover it is noticeable that cv guara reached the highest values of gs in contrast with cv marta which reached the lowest especially during maximum evapotranspirative demand period during the second experimental year as it was in 2017 the differences in ψleaf between irrigation treatments were negligible during the fruit growth period and more significant during the kernel filling stage especially between 150 etc etc and the remaining irrigation regimes fig 4 in relation to rdi65 the ψleaf values were similar to fi during the fruit growth period and sensitively lower when the stress started in 163 doy regarding to gs values during 2018 fig 5 the most remarkable were the significant differences in cv marta between 150 etc etc and rdi65 in contrast with cultivars guara and lauranne were these differences were not as patent as in the previous cultivar more interesting were the obtained values for the stress integral in terms of ψleaf during the kernel filling period table 3 in this sense during 2017 as guara as lauranne offered similar values for fi and rdi65 within each cultivar and these being significant higher p 0 05 than those registered in 150 etc however for marta these differences were slightly different not appearing significant differences between fi and 150 etc etc during 2018 this pattern was very similar to those registered in the previous season in this regard the registered values in 150 etc for cv marta were 9 and 20 lower than those registered in fi and rdi65 whereas for cvs lauranne and guara these differences were equal to those registered in the previous season regarding to the values of si gs during the kernel filling period in both studied seasons cv guara showed similar levels of accumulated water stress in terms of the stomatal conductance values there were observed increases in fi and rdi65 in comparison to 150 etc during 2017 and these were negligible for fi and close to 17 for rdi65 moreover during 2018 these reductions did not appear for fi and were close to 10 for rdi65 the opposite situation was observed for cv marta in this line during 2017 these increases were 27 in fi and rdi65 comparing to 150 etc whereas during 2018 these were 14 and 17 for fi and rdi65 respectively considering these differences among cultivars in terms of the accumulated water stress the relationships between the si leaf and sigs were estimated for each measurement interval fig 6 according to these relationships it can be observed that cv marta registered higher si gs values for similar si leaf in comparison to the remaining studied cultivars this was similar in both seasons showing the same patterns for cvs lauranne and guara moreover for 2017 significant differences were observed as in the slope as in the interception points between cultivars but during 2018 the obtained relationships for guara and lauranne were similar and different with marta 3 3 yield response and irrigation water productivity iwp figs 7 and 8 show the yield for each cultivar and irrigation treatment in 2017 and 2018 the same pattern being observed during the two year monitoring period for cvs guara and lauranne no differences were obtained while for cv marta a clear pattern was fixed with significant improvements for 150 etc in addition the kernel unit weight was calculated in both seasons these results being summarized in table 4 there were no significant differences between treatments within each cultivar in 2017 except in the cv marta that showed higher values in the 150 etc etc treatment something similar was observed in 2018 for the case of marta although during this second year some differences between irrigation treatments were observed in the case of guara finally and taking into account the normalization of the final yield according to the sterk and stein 1997 methodology no significant differences among irrigation regimes were registered for cvs guara and lauranne whereas for marta 150 etc etc treatment reached significant higher values than fi and rdi65 as it was previously discussed within each experimental season regarding to the irrigation water productivity iwp kernel yield per unit of irrigation water applied the obtained data for the two seasons are shown in table 5 in both years and for all the cultivars the treatment with better values of iwp were reached in rdi65 this treatment with 35 less water than the fi treatment was able to produce about 10 14 more of kernel yield in terms of unit of irrigation regime applied 4 discussion this experiment was developed in order to define the response of three almond cultivars to different irrigation regimes confronting both the physiological and agronomical responses although the climatic conditions were something different the results showed a similar pattern in both seasons these being enough robust to extract relevant responses to the issues considered at the beginning of this experiment in this regard two main issues were raised the importance of the cultivar when a di strategy is going to be imposed and corroborate the almond response when is subjected to the three irrigation regimes is clearly differentiated in relation to the first issue and according to the obtained results two differential patterns were observed in the studied cultivars on one side guara and lauranne showed similar responses when an over irrigation and a regulated deficit irrigation treatment was applied with similar values of ψleaf during entire study period figs 2 and 4 this similarity between these cultivars was confirmed by means of the si values table 3 and the relationships between them fig 6 unlike this latter higher values of ψleaf were registered for case of cv marta together with lower values of gs in fi and especially in rdi65 in comparison to the observed in the remaining cultivars indicating that cv marta would have more pronounced stomatal sensitiveness comparing to cvs guara and lauranne on the other hand these physiological responses were directly related with the observed results in terms of final yield in this sense not all the studied cultivars showed similar responses to the over irrigated treatment comparing to the obtained yields in the remaining treatments that is cv marta evidenced a higher sensibility to water stress showed significant improvements on yield when this received irrigation amounts above to the theoretical requirements 150 etc etc vs fi in spite of the absence of similar works comparing the differential responses of almond cultivars to water stress gomes laranjo et al 2006 evidenced that lauranne was a cultivar with a higher capability of maintaining similar photosynthesis rates directly related with the stomatal conductance under moderate to severe drought conditions than those obtained under full irrigation conditions in comparison to other almond cultivars such as cvs ferragnès masbovera glorieta and francoli in our case the highest values of gs were registered in guara and lauranne being able to keep higher transpiration rates than cv marta for similar values of ψleaf as it can be observed in figs 2 5 this relation makes strong the hypothesis that cv marta would show a higher sensitiveness in terms stomatal control under a water stress adopting a conservative approach to water use under drought scenarios these findings endorse the obtained in our experiment and corroborate that to establish a proper irrigation strategy we must know the physiological behavior for a given cultivar relating to the second issue considered in this work the obtained results sustain the viability of the rdi65 treatment which was able to reach similar yield values to those under full irrigated conditions in the three studied cultivars and even similar to the yields registered under over irrigation conditions with cvs guara and lauranne in relation to these findings si gs were similar in the three irrigation treatments in both cultivars table 3 which would largely explain the absence of effects in the yields similar responses to these obtained for cvs guara and lauranne have been reported by other authors girona et al 2005 in a four year experiment with the cultivar ferragnès concluded that any improvement was detected for an irrigation treatment in which crop was irrigated at 130 of etc this capability of reaching similar yield values under a moderate water stress situation encouraged significant improvements in the iwp for rdi65 treatment table 5 these values being similar to those reported by egea et al 2010 for stressed treatments reporting values from 0 25 to 0 45 kg m 3 thus according to our findings significant yields could be reached under a moderate water stress situation in the guadalquivir river basin with water savings around 2000 m3 ha 1 5 conclusions almond is a drought tolerant crop and many works have been developed in order to perform the best di strategy however up to day no differences between cultivars have been considered in this way we have determined that guara and lauranne can reach similar yields with water savings close to 3000 m3 ha

10947,almond prunus dulcis mill has been traditionally associated to marginal areas in andalusia being cultivated under rainfed agriculture conditions in the last few years it has been progressively introduced in many irrigated areas of the guadalquivir river basin which has promoted a growing interest about irrigation water management for this crop i e the potential irrigation requirements or the best irrigation strategy under sub optimal conditions aiming at obtaining balanced nut yields saving water without affecting yield this work examines the response of three almond cultivars cvs guara marta and lauranne subjected to different irrigation regimes in a semi arid mediterranean environment sw spain the trial was conducted over two seasons 2017 2018 in a commercial orchard with three irrigation regimes i a full irrigation treatment fi which received 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc as a control ii an over irrigated treatment 150 etc which received 150 of etc during the whole irrigation period and iii a regulated deficit irrigation treatment rdi65 which was irrigated at 100 etc during the whole irrigation season except during the kernel filling period when it received the 65 of etc in order to assess the crop water status the leaf water potential ψleaf and the stomatal conductance to water vapour gs were measured at the end of each season the yield kernel unit weight and irrigation water productivity were determined significant differences in physiological behaviour and yield responses among cultivars were found according to the final yield obtained during the experimental seasons guara and lauranne did not show significant improvements in the 150 etc in relation to fi and rdi65 whereas cv marta showed significant improvements under 150 etc moreover yield response followed the physiological trend observed in the different irrigation treatments for each cultivar those cultivars guara and lauranne that had not shown significant differences in terms of yield evidenced a similar pattern in terms of gs unlike marta the obtained results allow us to conclude that there is a clear differential response in terms of the cultivar taking into account the adaptation capacity of different cultivars to different irrigation doses keywords deficit irrigation crop physiological parameters irrigation water productivity nut yield 1 introduction almond prunus dulcis mill represents the third crop in terms of surface in spain and contributes to the 84 of the european production of almonds however this performance represents only 5 worldwide usa being the largest international producer with 80 of the world market faostat 2018 almond production in spain is generally low this is because this crop has been traditionally associated to marginal areas i e cultivated under very limited water conditions leading to those low yields 150 kg ha 1 garcía tejero et al 2018a these data contrast with those obtained in other countries such as usa or australia where this crop is cultivated under intensive practices and without irrigation restrictions obtaining higher yields in many cases up to 3000 kg ha 1 goldhamer and fereres 2017 irrigation is considered the main limiting factor for almond trees determining the yield in terms of fruit numbers and kernel unit weight and the nut quality goldhamer et al 2012 estimated that almond water requirements for the climatic conditions of california would range between 9000 and 13 500 m3 ha 1 depending on the plant density rootstock crop management or pruning system among other factors recently lópez lópez et al 2018 defined the optimum irrigation doses for almond cv guara under the climatic conditions of guadalquivir river basin s spain these being close to 8000 m3 ha 1 and similar to other irrigation doses applied under non limiting conditions for this same cultivar by garcía tejero et al 2018b these data contrast with those reported by goldhamer and fereres 2017 who concluded that in california almond crop reached the maximum yield close to 4000 kg ha 1 when the irrigation doses applied were around 1250 mm notwithstanding these results were obtained under other climatic conditions san joaquin river basin california and for a soft shell cultivar cv nonpareil therefore according to the maximum irrigation rates required by this crop its introduction as alternative to other traditional crops in arid and semiarid zones would be justified only if its productivity is improved by means of deficit irrigation di strategies in this sense almond is considered a drought tolerant species and its response under water scarcity conditions has been defined by several authors to improve its development under drought conditions minimizing the losses of production and fruit quality romero et al 2004 girona et al 2005 goldhamer et al 2006 egea et al 2013 in this context egea et al 2009 reported the effects of various irrigation strategies and water stress intensities on the growth and quality of almond nuts these authors demonstrated that di strategies does not affect the overall fruit growth pattern but a negative impact on the final kernel dry weight for the most severely stressed treatment was found in the same vein garcía tejero et al 2018b concluded that the kernel filling period would be a suitable phenological stage to apply water withholdings close to 50 etc for a long term period minimizing the yield losses on the other hand the cultivar is also important because not all have the same behaviour when a di strategy is applied up to day there are few works related to the study of the differential response of almond cultivars when these are subjected to different irrigation doses among the known experiments gomes laranjo et al 2006 studied the physiological response of five almond cultivars cvs lauranne masbovera ferragnès francoli and glorieta under non watered and a watered situations these authors concluded that cv ferragnès was the most sensitive to drought conditions something similar was reported by oliveira et al 2018 who compared the leaf anatomy and water relations in different cultivars of almond cvs ferragnès glorieta bonita casanova parada and pegarinhos concluding that cv ferragnès was the most sensitive to water stress due to its thin cuticle and the high stomatal density taking into account the previous experiments we hypothesize that on one hand a differential responsiveness in terms of yield can be observed depending on the cultivar when different irrigation regimes are applied in almond and on other hand a sustainable di strategy could be defined obtaining maximum yields for total irrigation doses close to 6000 m3 ha 1 thus the aim of the present study was to assess the nut yield and physiological response of three most popular almond cultivars cvs guara marta and lauranne when a moderate di strategy is imposed and corroborate the tree response when these three cultivars are subjected to different irrigation regimes in a semiarid mediterranean environment sw spain 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental conditions the trial was conducted during two seasons 2017 2018 in a commercial almond orchard prunus dulcis mill d a webb cvs guara marta and lauranne grafted onto gn15 rootstock located in the guadalquivir river basin 37 29 3 19 n 5 59 55 1 o seville sw spain trees were planted in 2007 spaced 8 6 m and drip irrigated using two pipe lines with emitters of 2 3 l h 1 spaced 0 75 m the soil is silty loam typical fluvisol usda 2010 with more than 2 5 m deep and organic matter content 1 5 roots are located predominately in the first 50 cm of soil 90 corresponding to the intended wetting depth although these exceed more than one meter in depth soil water content values at field capacity 0 033 mpa and permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa are 0 42 and 0 17 m3 m 3 respectively with an allowable soil water depletion level of 0 35 m3 m 3 the climatic classification of the study area is attenuated meso mediterranean with an annual et0 rate of 1400 mm and accumulated rainfall of 540 mm mainly distributed from october to april historical data for the last 20 years own development from the andalusian weather information network depending on the andalusian institute of training and agricultural research ifapa in spanish 2 2 irrigation regimes and experimental design the irrigation strategies design was performed in a mature and uniform almond orchards simulating three different scenarios i a full irrigated treatment fi which was irrigated in order to cover the 100 of the crop evapotranspiration etc during the irrigation period ii an over irrigated treatment 150 etc which was irrigated at 150 of etc during the entire irrigation period iii and a regulated deficit irrigation rdi65 covering the full irrigation requirements during the whole irrigation period 100 etc except during the kernel filling stage from the beginning of this to harvesting when was irrigated at 65 etc fi treatment was developed in order to simulate a scenario of optimum conditions in which trees would receive irrigation doses between 7500 and 8500 m3 ha 1 being these doses very similar to those irrigation requirements defined by lópez lópez et al 2018 in mature almond trees in the guadalquivir river basin the 150 etc treatment was designed considering the information provided by goldhamer and fereres 2017 these authors concluded that for mature almond trees well developed and cultivated under the climatic conditions of california similar to the current conditions in the experimental area the maximum yield values 4000 kg ha 1 would be reached under irrigation doses between 12 500 and 13 000 m3 ha 1 thus in spite of being these irrigation doses beyond the crop water requirements estimated in the experimental area this treatment was defined with the aim of testing if the final yield could be improved when almond trees were subjected to the irrigation amounts close to those irrigation doses reported by goldhamer and fereres 2017 finally rdi65 strategy was designed in order to define a moderate di strategy in which the total water applied at the end of the irrigation period were around 5000 and 6500 m3 ha 1 these doses being similar to others applied in traditional crops developed in the guadalquivir river basin under irrigated conditions such as citrus garcía tejero et al 2010a 2010b or olives carr 2013 this strategy was developed assuming that the kernel filling stage is the phenological period in which the water stress would cause a minor impact on yield garcía tejero et al 2018a this stage was determined by taking biweekly 12 samples of almonds for each irrigation treatment and cultivar and manually opened in order to observe the kernel status from the beginning of may till observing that grain was completely filled onset kernel filling period irrigation doses were calculated according to the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 obtaining the values of reference evapotranspiration et0 by using a weather station installed in the same experimental orchard davis advance pro2 davis instruments valencia spain the local crop coefficients used during the experimental period ranged from 0 4 to 1 2 according to the results obtained by garcía tejero et al 2015 we used a randomized block design with four replications per irrigation treatment and cultivar each replication had 12 trees 3 rows and 4 trees per row being monitored the two central trees for each replication n 8 2 3 plant measurements during the irrigation period crop water monitoring was done throughout the measurements of leaf water potential ψleaf in shaded leaves and the stomatal conductance to water vapour gs in well exposed sunny leaves these readings being taken between 12 00 and 13 30 gtm and with a periodicity of 7 10 days regarding to the measurements of ψleaf we took into account the experiments previously developed by other authors such as goldhamer and fereres 2004 these authors reported that water potential of shaded leaves covered with a damp cloth immediately prior to excision and quickly transported to the pressure chamber were highly correlated with stem water potential in almond ψleaf was measured using a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp sta barbara ca usa monitoring 8 trees per irrigation treatment two leaves per tree located in the north side of the tree and being totally mature fresh and shaded at 1 5 m of height approximately additionally in these same trees we measured the gs using a porometer sc 1 decagon devices inc wa usa these measurements being done in two leaves per monitored tree completely exposed to the sun and at 1 5 m of height approximately additionally with the aim of quantifying total water stress supported by the crop the stress integral si was calculated from ψleaf and gs data following the methodology proposed by myers 1988 1 2 1 s i l e a f ψ l e a f a v ψ l e a f m a x n where sileaf is the stress integral in terms of leaf water potential values ψ l e a f a v is the average leaf water potential for any interval ψ l e a f m a x is the maximum value of leaf water potential registered during the experimental period and n is the days numbers within each interval 2 s i g s g s m a x g s a v n where sigs is the stress integral in terms of stomatal conductance values g s a v is the average stomatal conductance for any interval g s m a x is the maximum value of stomatal conductance during the experimental period and n is the days numbers within each interval according to these indexes as higher values of sileaf and si gs higher water stress gathered by the crop in this sense these indexes provide information to quantify the water stress of a crop accumulated along a period this index allows to quantify the effect of water stress provided by the water restriction beyond its temporal distribution integrating the global stress supported by the crop in comparison to the punctual measurements at the end of each season it was monitored the final yield in terms of nut and kernel weight harvesting was carried out by using specific machinery for almond in this regard it was used a mechanic vibrator to throw the almond on the ground previously covered with a plastic mesh collected almonds were processed with a mechanic peeling to remove the hull finally once cleaned almonds were left to air dry and weighing once reached am humidity content around 6 finally almonds were processed with shelling machine obtaining the kernel yield for each irrigation treatment and cultivar in relation to the harvesting dates these were different for each cultivar and season in this sense in 2017 harvesting was developed at 207 220 and 234 doy for guara marta and lauranne respectively whereas in 2018 harvesting was carried out at 226 233 and 243 doy for guara marta and lauranne respectively moreover we randomly selected 100 almonds per replication n 8 of irrigation treatment and cultivar obtaining the ratio between kernel and nut yield and the kernel unit weight finally and considering the total irrigation applied in each treatment it was estimated the irrigation water productivity iwp defined as the ratio between kernel yield and irrigation water applied 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was developed by using the sigma plot statistical software version 12 5 systat software inc san jose ca usa first of all an exploratory descriptive analysis of data was done for each measurement day ψleaf and g s applying a levene s test to check the variance homogeneity of the variables studied within each cultivar significant differences between irrigation treatments p 0 05 in these physiological variables were identified by applying a one way anova and a tukey s test to study the means separation between treatments the relationships between sileaf and sigs for each cultivar were examined using a linear correlation analysis between these values comparing the obtained regressions slope and intercept using a covariance analysis to determine the variation in terms of the cultivar at the end of each season the kernel yield was analysed together with the unit weight and the ratio between kernel weight vs almond weight kernel shell for each treatment within each cultivar applying a levene s test to check the variance homogeneity and a one way anova with a tukey s test to study the means separation between treatments finally the water use efficiency was calculated thus the best irrigation strategy in terms of irrigation water applied and almond yield in order to study the whole of yield data obtained in both seasons a dataset normalization for each irrigation treatment and cultivar was done taken into consideration the methodology proposed by sterk and stein 1997 this methodology tries to minimize the variability associated to the particular conditions in each season grouping the values and allowing to apply an overall analysis with the entire of data according to this equation y n y i e l d i y i e l d a n u a l a v y i e l d t o t a l a v where y n is the normalized yield for each treatment and cultivar y i e l d i is the yield obtained for each replication y i e l d a n u a l a v is the average yield for a single treatment and cultivar in a year and y i e l d t o t a l a v is the average yield for a single treatment and cultivar during all the studied years 3 results 3 1 climatic conditions and water supply during the studied seasons the climatic conditions were very similar to those historically registered in the experimental area during 2017 table 1 total rainfall and reference evapotranspiration was 210 and 1337 mm respectively according to these conditions fi 150 etc etc and rdi65 received 852 1279 and 554 mm respectively fig 1 a considering that rdi65 from the beginning to 13th june doy 164 when water stress was applied and after harvesting it was irrigated with similar irrigation amounts than fi 100 etc during 2018 table 2 rainfall and reference evapotranspiration were 514 mm and 1102 mm respectively according to this the accumulative amounts of irrigation water applied in fi 150 etc and rdi65 were 687 1030 and 541 mm respectively fig 1b regarding to rdi65 from the beginning of the irrigation period to 12th june doy 163 when water stress was imposed and after harvesting it was irrigated with similar irrigation amounts than fi 3 2 physiological response to irrigation during the first studied season 2017 similar values of ψleaf were observed among the different irrigation treatments in the periods of low evaporative demand which correspond to fruit growth and postharvest stages these being significant different during the kernel filling stage fig 2 in this regard the values of ψleaf in 150 etc etc treatment were significantly higher than those obtained in the remaining three studied treatments in relation to rdi65 the ψleaf values were similar to fi during the fruit growth period and significantly lower when water withholding was applied during the kernel filling period from 172 doy to harvesting finally after harvesting ψleaf recovered till reach similar levels than those registered in 150 etc fig 2 a similar trend was observed in gs for each cultivar and irrigation regime in 2017 fig 3 as it was observed for ψleaf the most noticeable differences among irrigation treatments were observed during the kernel filling period specially between 150 etc etc and the remining treatments these differences being more pronounced at 192 199 200 and 234 doys moreover it is noticeable that cv guara reached the highest values of gs in contrast with cv marta which reached the lowest especially during maximum evapotranspirative demand period during the second experimental year as it was in 2017 the differences in ψleaf between irrigation treatments were negligible during the fruit growth period and more significant during the kernel filling stage especially between 150 etc etc and the remaining irrigation regimes fig 4 in relation to rdi65 the ψleaf values were similar to fi during the fruit growth period and sensitively lower when the stress started in 163 doy regarding to gs values during 2018 fig 5 the most remarkable were the significant differences in cv marta between 150 etc etc and rdi65 in contrast with cultivars guara and lauranne were these differences were not as patent as in the previous cultivar more interesting were the obtained values for the stress integral in terms of ψleaf during the kernel filling period table 3 in this sense during 2017 as guara as lauranne offered similar values for fi and rdi65 within each cultivar and these being significant higher p 0 05 than those registered in 150 etc however for marta these differences were slightly different not appearing significant differences between fi and 150 etc etc during 2018 this pattern was very similar to those registered in the previous season in this regard the registered values in 150 etc for cv marta were 9 and 20 lower than those registered in fi and rdi65 whereas for cvs lauranne and guara these differences were equal to those registered in the previous season regarding to the values of si gs during the kernel filling period in both studied seasons cv guara showed similar levels of accumulated water stress in terms of the stomatal conductance values there were observed increases in fi and rdi65 in comparison to 150 etc during 2017 and these were negligible for fi and close to 17 for rdi65 moreover during 2018 these reductions did not appear for fi and were close to 10 for rdi65 the opposite situation was observed for cv marta in this line during 2017 these increases were 27 in fi and rdi65 comparing to 150 etc whereas during 2018 these were 14 and 17 for fi and rdi65 respectively considering these differences among cultivars in terms of the accumulated water stress the relationships between the si leaf and sigs were estimated for each measurement interval fig 6 according to these relationships it can be observed that cv marta registered higher si gs values for similar si leaf in comparison to the remaining studied cultivars this was similar in both seasons showing the same patterns for cvs lauranne and guara moreover for 2017 significant differences were observed as in the slope as in the interception points between cultivars but during 2018 the obtained relationships for guara and lauranne were similar and different with marta 3 3 yield response and irrigation water productivity iwp figs 7 and 8 show the yield for each cultivar and irrigation treatment in 2017 and 2018 the same pattern being observed during the two year monitoring period for cvs guara and lauranne no differences were obtained while for cv marta a clear pattern was fixed with significant improvements for 150 etc in addition the kernel unit weight was calculated in both seasons these results being summarized in table 4 there were no significant differences between treatments within each cultivar in 2017 except in the cv marta that showed higher values in the 150 etc etc treatment something similar was observed in 2018 for the case of marta although during this second year some differences between irrigation treatments were observed in the case of guara finally and taking into account the normalization of the final yield according to the sterk and stein 1997 methodology no significant differences among irrigation regimes were registered for cvs guara and lauranne whereas for marta 150 etc etc treatment reached significant higher values than fi and rdi65 as it was previously discussed within each experimental season regarding to the irrigation water productivity iwp kernel yield per unit of irrigation water applied the obtained data for the two seasons are shown in table 5 in both years and for all the cultivars the treatment with better values of iwp were reached in rdi65 this treatment with 35 less water than the fi treatment was able to produce about 10 14 more of kernel yield in terms of unit of irrigation regime applied 4 discussion this experiment was developed in order to define the response of three almond cultivars to different irrigation regimes confronting both the physiological and agronomical responses although the climatic conditions were something different the results showed a similar pattern in both seasons these being enough robust to extract relevant responses to the issues considered at the beginning of this experiment in this regard two main issues were raised the importance of the cultivar when a di strategy is going to be imposed and corroborate the almond response when is subjected to the three irrigation regimes is clearly differentiated in relation to the first issue and according to the obtained results two differential patterns were observed in the studied cultivars on one side guara and lauranne showed similar responses when an over irrigation and a regulated deficit irrigation treatment was applied with similar values of ψleaf during entire study period figs 2 and 4 this similarity between these cultivars was confirmed by means of the si values table 3 and the relationships between them fig 6 unlike this latter higher values of ψleaf were registered for case of cv marta together with lower values of gs in fi and especially in rdi65 in comparison to the observed in the remaining cultivars indicating that cv marta would have more pronounced stomatal sensitiveness comparing to cvs guara and lauranne on the other hand these physiological responses were directly related with the observed results in terms of final yield in this sense not all the studied cultivars showed similar responses to the over irrigated treatment comparing to the obtained yields in the remaining treatments that is cv marta evidenced a higher sensibility to water stress showed significant improvements on yield when this received irrigation amounts above to the theoretical requirements 150 etc etc vs fi in spite of the absence of similar works comparing the differential responses of almond cultivars to water stress gomes laranjo et al 2006 evidenced that lauranne was a cultivar with a higher capability of maintaining similar photosynthesis rates directly related with the stomatal conductance under moderate to severe drought conditions than those obtained under full irrigation conditions in comparison to other almond cultivars such as cvs ferragnès masbovera glorieta and francoli in our case the highest values of gs were registered in guara and lauranne being able to keep higher transpiration rates than cv marta for similar values of ψleaf as it can be observed in figs 2 5 this relation makes strong the hypothesis that cv marta would show a higher sensitiveness in terms stomatal control under a water stress adopting a conservative approach to water use under drought scenarios these findings endorse the obtained in our experiment and corroborate that to establish a proper irrigation strategy we must know the physiological behavior for a given cultivar relating to the second issue considered in this work the obtained results sustain the viability of the rdi65 treatment which was able to reach similar yield values to those under full irrigated conditions in the three studied cultivars and even similar to the yields registered under over irrigation conditions with cvs guara and lauranne in relation to these findings si gs were similar in the three irrigation treatments in both cultivars table 3 which would largely explain the absence of effects in the yields similar responses to these obtained for cvs guara and lauranne have been reported by other authors girona et al 2005 in a four year experiment with the cultivar ferragnès concluded that any improvement was detected for an irrigation treatment in which crop was irrigated at 130 of etc this capability of reaching similar yield values under a moderate water stress situation encouraged significant improvements in the iwp for rdi65 treatment table 5 these values being similar to those reported by egea et al 2010 for stressed treatments reporting values from 0 25 to 0 45 kg m 3 thus according to our findings significant yields could be reached under a moderate water stress situation in the guadalquivir river basin with water savings around 2000 m3 ha 1 5 conclusions almond is a drought tolerant crop and many works have been developed in order to perform the best di strategy however up to day no differences between cultivars have been considered in this way we have determined that guara and lauranne can reach similar yields with water savings close to 3000 m3 ha 1 whereas marta would be more sensitive to drought conditions as it has been corroborated by using the stress integral defined in terms of water potential and stomatal conductance in this regard according to our findings the cultivar was a determinant factor to take into consideration when a di is going to be apply moreover according to the final yield harvested in the studied cultivars we can conclude that on overall similar production values to full irrigated conditions can be reached with annual irrigation doses around 6000 m3 ha 1 acknowledgments the author s gutiérrez gordillo has

10948,increased water productivity is critical for global water supply as it reduces the need for additional water and land in irrigated and rainfed systems it can also ensure a balance between food production and ecological protection for sustainable human existence this study determined the effects of water and soil management on rice oryza sativa productivity in the wet and dry seasons under tropical inland valley swamp conditions the water management included alternate wetting and drying continuous flooding irrigation and aerobic rice system then the soil amendment included biochar addition to soil in alternate wetting and drying water was added to the depth of 60 mm over the land surface and allowed to dry to the depth of 150 mm below the surface before replenishment in continuous flooding irrigation 60 mm depth of water was maintained on the land surface for the entire growing period then in aerobic rice system water was added to saturation only after 50 of the soil moisture was depleted the irrigation treatments were for the dry season and rainfed treatment in the wet season both with and without biochar based on the study yields were generally higher in the dry season than in the wet season also biochar treatments outperformed non biochar treatments across the seasons and water treatments not only water productivity expressed as grain yield per unit water but also biochar productivity grain yield per unit biochar was higher in the dry season than the wet season although 114 411 mm more water was used in continuous flooding irrigation without biochar 774 mm than in aerobic rice system with biochar 362 mm during the 2015 2016 dry season cultivation period rice yield under continuous flooding irrigation was only 15 533 kg ha higher again even though 97 883 mm more water was used in continuous flooding irrigation without biochar than in aerobic rice system with biochar during the 2016 2017 dry season rice yield under continuous flooding irrigation was only 11 400 kg ha higher then while the effect of either biochar or water on crop productivity was significant that of their interaction was limited most importantly average water use across the treatments in the wet season 1235 mm exceeded by 26 that in the dry season 984 mm cultivation period in the study area this suggested that irrigation increases productivity during second cropping in the dry season it also suggested that biochar addition reduces irrigation while increasing productivity under continuous flooding irrigation system in tropical inland valley swamp ecologies keywords

accounts for some 50 of irrigation water use barker et al 1999 various techniques can be used to reduce irrigation water amount without significant yield loss including awd alternate wetting and drying cabangon et al 2001 tan et al 2013 ars aerobic rice system bouman et al 2007 peng et al 2006 and irs intensive rice system uphoff and randriamiharisoa 2002 awd is the practice of alternating flood irrigation with dry spell the duration of which depends on the soil condition bouman et al 2007 under awd field water depth which gradually decreases with time following irrigation is monitored using field water tube bouman et al 2007 re irrigated to the initial depth 50 mm is done when the water level in the tube falls to 150 mm below the land surface at flowering from one week before until one week after full blossom the water depth is kept at 50 mm to prevent water stress and severe yield loss this so called safe awd threshold prevents yield loss during this critical period djaman et al 2018 the aerobic rice system ars is a production method where rice is grown under non puddled non flooded and non saturated soil conditions bouman et al 2001 here the soils is kept aerobic almost continuously throughout the rice growing season wang et al 2002 special varieties the so called aerobic rice thrive better and produce more under ars conditions peng et al 2006 although water use and hence yield are lower in ars than in cfi system peng et al 2006 bouman et al 2007 water productivity is higher under ars by 20 40 and in some cases by as much as 80 peng et al 2006 although less water is used than in cfi continuous flooding irrigation yields are not always consistent under ars system li et al 2001 li and barker 2004 cfi as used in this study is a water management system where a plot is flooded to a maximum depth of 60 mm and re irrigated when the water level falls to 50 mm above the ground kangoma et al 2017 water productivity is a vital parameter in assessing the performance of irrigated and rainfed systems and is expressed in physical or economic terms platonov et al 2008 here the physical term is used to define water productivity as the ratio of crop yield to water use nangia et al 2008 reduced tillage direct seeding and rainwater irrigation under ars can save not only water increasing water productivity but also ensure high crop yield humphreys et al 2008 water productivity can be increased through water saving irrigation and improved agronomic practices molden et al 2010 on the other hand crop productivity is the ratio of crop produced to a unit treatment or combination of treatments in ssa rice yields are generally 30 60 lower in the wet season ws than in the dry season ds with irrigation in the ds yields can still be higher in the ds than in the ws the aim of this study was to determine rice productivity under different seasons soil and water management conditions in ivs ecologies in sierra leone the specific objectives of the study were to determine rice productivity under different 1 water management conditions 2 soil management conditions and 3 different combinations of soil and water management the findings of the study could positively influence crop productivity food security and rural livelihood in sierra leone and beyond 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted during two agronomic years four cultivation seasons july to nov 2014 wet season crop oct 2014 to feb 2015 dry season crop july to nov 2016 wet season crop oct 2016 to feb 2017 dry season crop the ivs belongs to njala university 08 07 n 12 03 w which is located in southern sierra leone fig 1 according to kottek et al 2006 köppen 1900 divided the world into five agro climatic zones equatorial arid warm temperate snow and polar which was later modified by geiger 1954 1961 peel et al 2007 also further adjusted the koppen geiger global climate map with three main climatic zones in africa tropical 31 0 arid 57 2 and temperate 11 8 based on the map the land area of sierra leone is over 80 in the rainforest and less than 20 in the monsoon climatic zone also based on this divisions the study area is in the rainforest climate zone of africa peel et al 2007 here there are two distinct seasons the wet season ws and dry season ds the ws may to oct is characterized by clouds heavy rains and low temperatures solar radiation photoperiod and sunshine hours but high humidity in the ds nov to apr the climatic condition is the near reverse of that of the ws the rainfall is unimodal with average annual rainfall and temperature of 2526 mm and 31 c respectively over 80 of the rainfall is in the ws but solar radiation is highest in the month of march 604 mj m2 day generally regions of the world with high solar radiation also have high rice yield venkateswarlu and visperas 1987 the stud area is in the tropical rainforest zone peel et al 2007 where radiation is high solar and therefore rice yield potential high too the soil at the experimental site is typic plinthaquult or pelewahun loam van et al 1972 odell et al 1974 kamara et al 2015 here the top 0 0 2 m soil layer is sandy clay loam with texture having 68 g 100 g sand 12 g 100 g silt and 20 g 100 g clay carbon content of 0 32 g 100 g ph of 4 6 and bulk density of 1 7 mg m3 the relatively high soil bulk density was due to puddling compaction mousavi et al 2009 a required land preparation operation other measured properties of the soil are summarized in table 1 a 26 500 m3 rainwater harvesting micro dam was built in the catchment area of the swamp to store water for irrigation in the downstream region irrigation water was released into the field from the reservoir through a sluice the reservoir was constructed using a 2 5 m high earthen embankment across the headwater region of the swamp a flow meter was installed on the piped gate to measure released water from the reservoir for supplemental irrigation in the dry season an intake gate fitted on each subplot was regulated closed or opened based on designed water management in the plot this approach made it possible to use the single meter at the reservoir gate to separately measure the water delivered to each subplot the experimental site which was under natural wood shrub fallow was manually cleared and prepared using simple hand tools such as machete axe and hoe in subsequent seasons the rice stubble was puddled into the soil the field was partitioned into plots by clay earth bunds compacted in 50 mm layers to a height of 0 2 m and width of 0 5 m to control water and allow access prior to transplanting the field was wetted tilled puddled and leveled 2 2 site plot design the experiment consisted of three water management treatments ars awd and cfi with and without biochar replicated three times in space and four times in time a split plot randomized complete block design was used where the main treatment plots were water management strategies for the ds and sub treatment plots biochar treatment while all the plots had water management in the ds only 50 of the plots had biochar treatment across both the ws and ds the treatments were conducted in both the ws and ds and for a period of two years july 2014 to feb 2017 thus it was a 3 2 3 4 treatment the total area of the plots was 640 m2 but the individual plots varied in area 16 4 40 3 m2 the plots were constructed downstream from the reservoir to allow gravity flow of irrigation water under the cfi treatment water depth was managed such that it did not exceed 60 mm or fall below 50 mm for 95 days after transplanting the water depth was checked in the morning and in the evening and was refilled to 60 mm any time it dropped to 50 mm above the ground mondal et al 2017 under the awd treatment irrigation was done to the depth of 60 mm above the ground and replenished to the same depth only after dropping to 150 mm below the ground the water level in the treatment was monitored in graduated and perforated tubes a technique developed at the international rice research institute irri in the philippines bouman et al 2007 the tubes were installed on the sides of the plots close to the bunds to ease access and reading the awd treatment was initiated from transplanting to panicle initiation then the plots continuously flooded with water to the depth of 60 mm for 15 days following panicle initiation after that period the water treatment was reverted to the normal conditions described above until harvest djaman et al 2018 for the ars treatment the plots were irrigated to saturation after 50 of the available soil moisture was depleted also both awd and ars plots were saturated with 40 50 mm depth of water for 14 days after transplanting following which the different water saving conditions for the respective treatments were initiated a total of two tubes each 300 mm long and 50 mm in diameter were installed per plot half of the tube 150 mm was driven into the soil and the other half left protruding above the ground the tubes were perforated with micro pores along the entire length to enhance water flow while limiting soil particles from slipping into the tubes the acacia species used as the biochar feedstock were cut chopped into small bits air dried and pyrolyzed in a vertical kiln at 400 500 c under low oxygen condition kim et al 2012 nigussie et al 2012 suliman et al 2016 this temperature range was used because biochar yield and those of nitrogen hydrogen and oxygen generally decrease while ash ph and carbon content increase with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 400 to 700 c lehmann et al 2006 gai et al 2014 brewer et al 2014 after pyrolysis the biochar was collected ground into dust and passed through a 2 mm sieve lehmann et al 2006 kamara et al 2015 wang and liu 2017 the grinding mad the biochar to blend with the soil similar to the pre historic amazonian biochar soil lehmann et al 2006 hunt et al 2010 also grinding enhances adsorption of nutrients onto biochar particles by increasing its specific surface area mclaughlin et al 2012 suliman et al 2016 the specific surface area of biochar particle was 650 m2 g determined using the polar liquid ethylene glycol eg retention method bower and gschwend 1952 pennell 2016 water eg and egme ethylene glycol monoethyl ether are good bipolar liquids that penetrate interlayer spaces of expandable solids after drying and therefore provide a good measure of total internal and external surface area this method was chosen because biochar is generally highly porous suliman et al 2016 here a dry biochar sample was placed in vacuum desiccator and liquid eg added in droplets to the solid sample until complete wetting a suction of 13 332 pa 0 1 mmhg was applied and the sample weighed over time to a constant weight and the specific surface area determined as pennell 2016 1 a s w e g w o d e g c f where weg is the weight of eg retained by the biochar sample at the applied suction wod is the oven dry weight of the biochar and cf is the mass surface area conversion factor for eg taken at 3 1 10 4 kg m 2 after grinding the biochar was tested for ph and ec electrical conductivity which were 9 81 for ph and 0 13 μs cm for ec here the orion model 520a ph meter orion technologies beverly mass with a gel filled sensorex s200c ph probe sensorex garden grove cal was used for ph measurement and the orion model 130 electro conductivity meter used for ec measurement a volume ratio of 1 soil to 1 water 1 1 50 ml of biochar was placed in a 250 ml beaker and 50 ml of distilled water added stirred thoroughly and let sit for 1 h before the taking ph measurement by inserting the meter probe into the solution whipker et al 2002 followed by ec measurement biochar is generally in the ph range of 10 12 weber and quicker 2018 the biochar dust was evenly spread on the split plots at 3333 kg ha and thoroughly plowed into the soil to the depth of 0 3 m while the rate was within the range of applications of biochar in the soil nigussie et al 2012 cha et al 2016 plowing beyond the average topsoil depth 0 2 m to 0 3 m made it possible to cover the entire rice rooting depth in the field the soils in the region as across most of west africa are oxisols and ultisols which are generally slightly acidic denis et al 2013 but nonetheless good for rice cultivation 2 3 agronomic treatment a rice rice rotation system was adopted for the wet and dry cropping seasons the ws rice cultivation was from june through september and the ds rice cultivation from november through march all the plots were planted with nerica new rice for africa l 19 rice cultivar an improved hybrid of oryza sativa and oryza glaberrina cross for lowlands the rice seedlings were transplanted at 0 25 m 0 25 m spacing and one seedling per hill because of the depth of water in cfi treatment 21 day old seedlings were used in all the treatments while also the ws rice was transplanted in july and harvested in october ds rice was transplanted in november and harvested in february fertilizer was applied in two splits the first split npk 15 15 15 granular complex was applied one day before transplanting at 40 kg ha and the second split urea npk 46 0 0 applied 40 days after transplanting at 20 kg ha the plots were hand weeded repeatedly to eliminate competition with treatment crops 2 4 crop performance at maturity which was about 100 105 days after transplanting an area of 2 5 m 2 m excluding border rows was demarcated for harvest and all the rice panicles cut and put in a container threshing was done to separate the grains from the fresh panicles and the grains then winnowed taking care not to lose any filled grains during threshing and winnowing operations the filled grains after threshing and winnowing were weighed and then sun dried for 2 3 days to 104 moisture content which is considered suitable for grain storage the moisture content was measured using the pfeuffer he 50 moisture meter the dried grains were next weighed and adjusted at 14 moisture content this process was repeated for each plot in the study 2 5 meteorological data daily meteorological data were obtained from a watchdog weather station the 2009 et model spectrum technologies inc usa located next to the study area the weather station measures calculates and logs on data logger potential evapotranspiration pet solar radiation wind speed and direction wind chill dew point temperature relative humidity and rainfall see operation manual for further detail thus all the weather variables were directly obtained from the watchdog data logger 2 6 water and biochar productivity the irrigation amount per plot was measured using a water meter installed at the sluice gate of the reservoir then the gate at each sub plot was regulated to control the amount of water flow into the plots based on the specific water requirement of the treatment plot rainfall was recorded at half hourly interval at the watchdog weather station water productivity was calculated as grain weight per unit amount of water oecd fao 2016 total water input i e irrigation and rainfall was used to calculate water productivity as bouman et al 2007 2 w p g y σ i r where wp is water productivity kg m3 gy is grain yield kg and i and r are the irrigation and rainfall fractions of water input m3 note that during the ws the variable i is zero similarly biochar productivity was expressed as 3 b p g y b b w where bp is biochar productivity kg kg gyb is grain yield under biochar treatment kg and bw is amount of biochar applied kg 2 7 statistical analysis the data were analyzed in spss statistical package for social sciences version 18 with the transfer of proprietorship from spss inc to ibm international business machines the software has been renamed as ibm or pasw predictive analytics software statistics quintero et al 2012 spss was preferred over other statistical packages in this study because of its ready availability wide global application and high reliability kangoma et al 2017 the data from the randomized block design in three replicates were evaluated for three factors water management at three levels soil management at two levels and seasonal at two levels effects the analysis of variance anova test was done to isolate the effects of each treatment and treatment interaction effects on yield for cases with significant anova effects at p 0 05 the means were separated using the student newman keuls test sorrenti et al 2016 also the stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the interdependence of the tested variables water use biochar use and seasonality 3 results and analyses 3 1 seasonal climate dynamics the average monthly dynamics of the seasonal climate are plotted in fig 2 top plate depicting the trends in selected climatic variables including precipitation temperature and solar radiation average precipitation for the ws was 1235 mm and that for the ds was 170 mm fig 2 bottom plate also both potential evapotranspiration and solar radiation were higher in the ds than in the ws however while the difference in precipitation between the ws and the ds was large 1065 mm or 625 that in potential evapotranspiration 63 mm or 7 of the total was small but even more so for solar radiation 17 mj m2 or 5 of the total also average temperature was slightly higher in the ds 28 c than in the ws 27 c as both potential evapotranspiration and solar radiation are generally dependent on temperature especially in the tropics the dynamics of the climatic variables were similar to temperature high in the ds and low in the ws this has significant implications for crop productivity especially where water ceases to be a limiting factor as in irrigated conditions 3 2 rice grain yield rice grain yield for the two seasons ws and ds as affected by the various management practices is plotted in fig 3 across the treatments rice grain yield was highest under cfi b 3261 kg ha and lowest under awd b 2289 kg ha on average there was 42 more grain production under cfi b than awd b average grain yield for all the soil and water treatments was 44 1023 kg ha higher in the ds 3331 kg ha than in the ws 2307 kg ha also average grain yield for water treatment was 13 355 kg ha higher for biochar soils 2996 kg ha than for non biochar soils 2642 kg ha since there was sufficient rain during the ws cultivation period no irrigation was done in the ds when there was little rain irrigation was highest under cfi b treatment 1284 mm and lowest under awd b 637 mm on average 80 647 mm more water was used under cfi b than awd b fig 3 more water was use in biochar than in non biochar soils under awd 308 mm or 28 and ars 81 mm or 6 water treatments on the contrary there was 564 mm 63 more water use in non biochar than in biochar soils under cfi water treatment table 2 precipitation in the ws 1235 was 1065 76 of the total higher than that in the ds cultivation period 170 mm and 251 mm 11 of the total higher than average irrigation in the ds cultivation period 984 mm also precipitation in the ds 170 was 814 mm 70 of the total less than average irrigation 984 table 2 this implied that in the ds the sum of precipitation and irrigation 1155 mm was 80 mm 7 less than precipitation in the ws 1235 mm it then suggested that water use but also crop yield in terms of grain production was higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period like rice grain yield both solar radiation 10 and potential evapotranspiration 15 were higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period figs 2 and 3 3 3 water productivity from eq 1 water productivity given as grain yield per unit volume of water is plotted in fig 4 for both the ws and ds cultivation periods in the study area as shown in the figure water productivity along the ds and ws cultivation periods was highest for cfi b treatment 321 kg m3 but lowest for the awd b treatment 144 kg m3 for the combined ds and ws cultivation periods water productivity was on average still highest under cfi b 526 kg m3 and lowest under cfi b 366 kg m3 treatment note that under the continuous flooding irrigation cfi 50 60 mm depth of water was maintained above the ground throughout the growing season also because of some precipitation occurred during the ds period 170 mm irrigation was only done as and when required to maintain the 50 60 mm water depth it therefore suggested that while biochar reduced water loss through soil and or crop under continuous water supply as in cfi system it did not reduce water loss under intermittent water supply as in ars and awd systems biochar in the form of dust has large surface area and high potential for ion exchange which properties enhance water and nutrient adsorption and limit leaching lehmann et al 2006 kangoma et al 2017 on average water productivity was 38 higher in the ds than ws cultivation period generally water productivity was higher under biochar treatments on average by 17 than non biochar treatments yields for biochar treatments were higher than non biochar treatments by 2 for awd 6 for ars and 44 for cfi treatment this showed that while water productivity was on average higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period biochar always enhanced water productivity across the various water treatments basso et al 2013 this agreed with earlier reports that biochar enhances not only soil physical properties such as soil texture and structure but also soil water content in agricultural fields gray et al 2014 kangoma et al 2017 3 4 biochar productivity from eq 2 biochar productivity was calculated as a function of grain yield and plotted in fig 5 for both the ws and ds cultivation periods in the study area however biochar productivity was calculated only for biochar treatments like water productivity biochar productivity was 40 higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period for individual treatments across both ws and ds cultivation periods the highest biochar productivity was under cfi b 1 13 kg kg and the lowest under awd b 0 70 kg kg in terms of average biochar productivity along the ws and ds cultivation periods it was still highest for cfi b 0 98 kg kg and lowest for awd b 0 81 kg kg specifically biochar productivity was higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period by 31 for awd b 37 for cfi b and 51 for ars b treatment 4 discussions over 80 of the farming in sierra leone is rainfed meaning that cultivation is mostly done during the ws however it is during the ds that sunshine solar radiation temperature and other climatic variables are most conducive for crop growth but as less than 13 of the precipitation falls during the ds cultivation period extending cropping season into the ds a potentially highly productive period is impossible without irrigation with water made available through rainwater harvesting for example the useful life of the land can be extended into ds this study investigated crop water and biochar productivity for both the ws and ds cultivation periods under tropical ivs conditions based on the results crop productivity was generally higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period the ws accounted for about 41 of annual rice grain yield in the study area suggesting that 59 more grain can be produced under irrigated ivs conditions the higher yield in the ds 59 was partly attributed to the higher net solar radiation with the availability of water the productivity potential of crops in the ds in the tropics increases bouman et al 2007 while solar radiation was 5 higher rice grain yield was 18 higher in the ds than in the ws as there was no significant damage due to pests or diseases anoxia conditions due to puddling could have contributed to the yield differences between the ds and ws in the study area this was evident in the differences in yield between the biochar and non biochar treatments where all the biochar treatments outperformed the non biochar treatments in both the ws and ds periods the addition of biochar reduced anoxia effect of puddling and thereby increased rice grain yield fujihara et al 2013 this also explained the yield difference between the ws and ds for the two cfi water treatments cfi b and cfi b while yield was 16 higher in the ds than in the ws under cfi b treatment it was 25 higher in the ds than in the ws under cfi b treatment this suggested that the compaction effect of puddling evident in the high bulk density of 1 7 mg m3 induced anoxia conditions in the ivs soil which was mitigated by the de compaction effect of biochar under the biochar treatments even under non biochar soil conditions productivity in the ds was higher than in the ws chen et al 2017 water productivity was on average 39 higher and biochar productivity 50 higher in the ds than in the ws although the individual differences in the weather variables were small between the ws and ds with those in the ds higher except for precipitation but which was compensated for by irrigation the sum of the effect of the differences led to the much higher yield in the ds than in the ws cultivation period across the three irrigation treatments awd ars and cfi in the ds cultivation period cfi water treatment had the highest crop productivity this further showed how important it is to maintain water throughout crop growth period hu et al 2010 kangoma et al 2017 on average crop productivity in terms of grain yield was higher under biochar soil than non biochar soil this suggested that biochar not only loosens agricultural soils but also adsorbs nutrients on its particle surfaces and thereby enhances crop productivity graber et al 2010 jeffery et al 2011 for biochar soil crop productivity under cfi water treatment was 8 higher than ars and 20 higher than awd water treatment then for the non biochar soils crop productivity under cfi was 3 higher than ars and 25 higher than awd water treatment this suggested that water management in awd was better under biochar than non biochar conditions conversely water management in ars was better under non biochar than biochar conditions while biochar improves soil water content lehmann et al 2006 dry conditions could limit the ability of soils to support crop productivity srinivasarao et al 2013 water use was higher under biochar than non biochar soils for awd and ars irrigation treatments and the reverse was the case for cfi irrigation treatment this is significant because farmers will normally prefer cfi under non limited supply of water as biochar has the potential to reduce water requirement and increase yield it can be incorporated into cfi systems as an agriculture water saving technique without necessarily reducing crop yield kangoma et al 2017 in this study crop water and biochar productivities were highest under cfi b condition even with the same agronomic operations during each growing season except for irrigation differences existed between the same cropping season in different agronomic years the yield differences were attributed to the additive effect of the agronomic operations but also to the differences in weather conditions in the different years while crop productivity was a function of water biochar and season water and biochar productivities were a function of season sohi et al 2009 this implied that the addition of water and or biochar enhances crop productivity and this varies with cropping season in tropical ivs conditions while water is critical for crop growth biochar improves soil physical chemical and biological properties which combined effect enhances crop productivity jeffery et al 2011 srinivasarao et al 2013 wang et al 2013 apart from change in physical properties texture porosity bulk density structure etc the addition of biochar to soils enhances soil chemical and biological properties nigussie et al 2012 sorrenti et al 2016 biochar increases microbial population in the soil increases soil ph ec and cec while reducing leaching of soil nutrient etc all of which support vigorous crop growth and productivity suliman et al 2016 speratti et al 2018 studies show that crop productivity is positively correlated with both biochar and irrigation treatment sohi et al 2009 kangoma et al 2017 further analysis showed that while for both biochar and non biochar treatments the difference in crop yield between the ws and ds cultivation periods was significant p 0 05 it was higher for non biochar than for biochar treatment while again the difference in crop yield between biochar and non biochar treatment for ws and ds period was significant it was higher in the ds than in the ws interestingly though the differences in crop water and biochar productivity were similar the general linear anova model results showed that the individual effects of biochar water and season on crop productivity were statistically significant however the effects of their interactions biochar water biochar season water season and biochar water season on crop productivity were insignificant table 3 stepwise regression analysis at p 0 05 showed that biochar was a far more significant factor in terms of its effect on crop productivity than water and season this was followed by water and then season this statistic suggested that while water is indeed critical for crop productivity biochar addition to soil further improves crop productivity however biochar without water is hardly effective as a productivity enhancing factor weather condition as a determinant irrigation factor is therefore critical for the effectiveness of biochar in increasing crop productivity with standing water on the land surface basso et al 2013 crop productivity in the ds was higher than in the ws makombe et al 2007 this agronomic operation complemented further the effect of biochar to the soil and crop graber et al 2010 kangoma et al 2017 this is critical particularly for ssa where agriculture is challenged by rapid land degradation soon after cultivation zinkina and korotayev 2014 conteh et al 2015 the main limitation to a second or third rice cultivation in ivs in the ds is water wimdmeijer and andriesse 1993 which use can be reduced by the addition of biochar to the soil 5 conclusions this study investigated crop water and biochar productivity under alternate wetting and drying aerobic rice system and continuous flooding irrigation systems of water management across both the wet season and dry season cultivation periods in tropical inland valley swamp conditions based on the results the study showed that both water and biochar enhanced rice grain productivity with a higher positive effect in the dry season than in the wet season the wet season accounted for 41 and the dry season 59 of the average annual grain yield also water productivity was on average 39 higher and biochar productivity 50 higher in the dry season than in the wet season in terms of individual treatments rice grain yield under continuous flooding irrigation was simply highest followed by aerobic rice system with biochar and then alternate wetting and drying had the least yield for biochar soils crop productivity under continuous flooding irrigation treatment was 8 higher than under aerobic rice system which was in turn 20 higher than alternate wetting and drying water management then for the non biochar soils crop productivity under continuous flooding irrigation was 3 higher than under aerobic rice system which was in turn 25 higher than alternate wetting and drying water management this showed that amendment of agricultural soils with biochar has the potential to make continuous flooding irrigation sustainable even under global water shortage conditions especially during the dry season biochar use can make this earliest mode of irrigation and still farmers most preferred choice sustainable and a feasible modern agriculture under increasing global water scarcity and land degradation this research showed that biochar use reduces water use while also increasing crop yield from this perspective farmers can either be encouraged to use biochar or governments take the lead to promote biochar technology in continuous flooding irrigation system of farming there is also the need to design incremental applications of water and biochar to develop the threshold point beyond which the combination use of these factors will not result in a meaningful increase in crop productivity acknowledgements we are

10948,increased water productivity is critical for global water supply as it reduces the need for additional water and land in irrigated and rainfed systems it can also ensure a balance between food production and ecological protection for sustainable human existence this study determined the effects of water and soil management on rice oryza sativa productivity in the wet and dry seasons under tropical inland valley swamp conditions the water management included alternate wetting and drying continuous flooding irrigation and aerobic rice system then the soil amendment included biochar addition to soil in alternate wetting and drying water was added to the depth of 60 mm over the land surface and allowed to dry to the depth of 150 mm below the surface before replenishment in continuous flooding irrigation 60 mm depth of water was maintained on the land surface for the entire growing period then in aerobic rice system water was added to saturation only after 50 of the soil moisture was depleted the irrigation treatments were for the dry season and rainfed treatment in the wet season both with and without biochar based on the study yields were generally higher in the dry season than in the wet season also biochar treatments outperformed non biochar treatments across the seasons and water treatments not only water productivity expressed as grain yield per unit water but also biochar productivity grain yield per unit biochar was higher in the dry season than the wet season although 114 411 mm more water was used in continuous flooding irrigation without biochar 774 mm than in aerobic rice system with biochar 362 mm during the 2015 2016 dry season cultivation period rice yield under continuous flooding irrigation was only 15 533 kg ha higher again even though 97 883 mm more water was used in continuous flooding irrigation without biochar than in aerobic rice system with biochar during the 2016 2017 dry season rice yield under continuous flooding irrigation was only 11 400 kg ha higher then while the effect of either biochar or water on crop productivity was significant that of their interaction was limited most importantly average water use across the treatments in the wet season 1235 mm exceeded by 26 that in the dry season 984 mm cultivation period in the study area this suggested that irrigation increases productivity during second cropping in the dry season it also suggested that biochar addition reduces irrigation while increasing productivity under continuous flooding irrigation system in tropical inland valley swamp ecologies keywords water productivity biochar productivity continuous flooding irrigation aerobic rice system alternate wetting and drying 1 introduction due to population and socio economic growth there is need for more efficient and productive use of natural resources water shortage has increased with the expansion of water use beyond traditional sectors domestic and agricultural into new areas including

useful life of the land and increasing crop productivity fao 2001 agricultural irrigation is the highest consumer of freshwater accounting for some 72 of global water use and 87 of water use in developing countries barker et al 1999 for the special case of sub saharan africa ssa food production is almost entirely dependent on rainfall only 4 6 106 ha of the total cultivated area in ssa is irrigated compared to 37 in asia and 14 in latin america oecd fao 2016 also there is evidence that irrigated agriculture in ssa is 1 5 3 0 times as productive as rainfed agriculture you et al 2010 hanjra et al 2009 showed that investment in crop irrigation farm management and education can reduce poverty and hunger in the ssa region the extent of inland valley swamp ivs ecosystems justifies their characterization for agricultural production fao 2001 hakkeling et al 1989 ivs is a seasonal or permanent hydromorphic valley bottom that occurs mostly in the upper reaches of river systems with no alluvial sedimentations floodplains or levees windmeijer and andriesse 1993 because of their high agricultural production potential water availability and soil fertility compared with upland landscapes ivs ecologies are critical for food security poverty alleviation and socio economic development the efficient use of even 10 of ivs ecologies in africa could produce sufficient rice to support current food demand on the continent these ecologies form a common landscape across not only west africa but the entire tropical region peel et al 2007 of the 690 000 ha of ivs in sierra leone

less than 5 in the west of the country also 37 of rice production in country is in ivs ecologies where yields are high even under traditional cultivation practices bapat 1979 acre 1983a 1983b because of their productivity potential ivs ecologies require detailed characterization for sustainable crop cultivation with decreasing arable lands and increasing global population restoration of soil fertility is key for future food production and energy supply spokas et al 2012 to this end biochar is increasingly used to build soils to support agriculture and increase crop productivity biochar is the porous carbon rich product of biomass pyrolysis that is applied to the soil in fine dust or lumps sohi et al 2009 hunt et al 2010 biochar can improve soil physical properties carbon sequestration water content nutrient availability and crop productivity basso et al 2013 wang et al 2013 xiao et al 2016 kangoma et al 2017 biochar use in agriculture dates back over 2000 years lehmann et al 2006 with evidence of extensive use in the highly fertile terra preta soils the amazonian o neill et al 2009 unlike the infertile terra mulata soils common in the region large amounts of biochar in terra preta soils have kept the soils unusually fertile even after centuries of prevailing torrential rains and leaching in the amazon lehmann et al 2006 despite extensive research on the use of biochar in upland soils xiao et al 2016 kangoma et al 2017 its use in ivs ecologies is limited this especially the case for the ssa region irrespective of the soil and climate the addition of biochar to the soil increases crop productivity soil microbial biomass soil nutrient total soil carbon and soil ph lori et al 2018 rice oryza sativa is the stable food for over half of the global population which is also increasing in importance as a welfare and security commodity in ssa although rainfed rice covers up to 45 of the cultivated area in the world it accounts for only 25 of total global rice production bouman et al 2001 in contrast irrigated rice which uses 24 30 of global freshwater resources accounts for 75 of global rice production bouman et al 2007 rice is grown in over 30 of irrigated lands and accounts for some 50 of irrigation water use barker et al 1999 various techniques can be used to reduce irrigation water amount without significant yield loss including awd alternate wetting and drying cabangon et al 2001 tan et al 2013 ars aerobic rice system bouman et al 2007 peng et al 2006 and irs intensive rice system uphoff and randriamiharisoa 2002 awd is the practice of alternating flood irrigation with dry spell the duration of which depends on the soil condition bouman et al 2007 under awd field water depth which gradually decreases with time following irrigation is monitored using field water tube bouman et al 2007 re irrigated to the initial depth 50 mm is done when the water level in the tube falls to 150 mm below the land surface at flowering from one week before until one week after full blossom the water depth is kept at 50 mm to prevent water stress and severe yield loss this so called safe awd threshold prevents yield loss during this critical period djaman et al 2018 the aerobic rice system ars is a production method where rice is grown under non puddled non flooded and non saturated soil conditions bouman et al 2001 here the soils is kept aerobic almost continuously throughout the rice growing season wang et al 2002 special varieties the so called aerobic rice thrive better and produce more under ars conditions peng et al 2006 although water use and hence yield are lower in ars than in cfi system peng et al 2006 bouman et al 2007 water productivity is higher under ars by 20 40 and in some cases by as much as 80 peng et al 2006 although less water is used than in cfi continuous flooding irrigation yields are not always consistent under ars system li et al 2001 li and barker 2004 cfi as used in this study is a water management system where a plot is flooded to a maximum depth of 60 mm and re irrigated when the water level falls to 50 mm above the ground kangoma et al 2017 water productivity is a vital parameter in assessing the performance of irrigated and rainfed systems and is expressed in physical or economic terms platonov et al 2008 here the physical term is used to define water productivity as the ratio of crop yield to water use nangia et al 2008 reduced tillage direct seeding and rainwater irrigation under ars can save not only water increasing water productivity but also ensure high crop yield humphreys et al 2008 water productivity can be increased through water saving irrigation and improved agronomic practices molden et al 2010 on the other hand crop productivity is the ratio of crop produced to a unit treatment or combination of treatments in ssa rice yields are generally 30 60 lower in the wet season ws than in the dry season ds with irrigation in the ds yields can still be higher in the ds than in the ws the aim of this study was to determine rice productivity under different seasons soil and water management conditions in ivs ecologies in sierra leone the specific objectives of the study were to determine rice productivity under different 1 water management conditions 2 soil management conditions and 3 different combinations of soil and water management the findings of the study could positively influence crop productivity food security and rural livelihood in sierra leone and beyond 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted during two agronomic years four cultivation seasons july to nov 2014 wet season crop oct 2014 to feb 2015 dry season crop july to nov 2016 wet season crop oct 2016 to feb 2017 dry season crop the ivs belongs to njala university 08

which was later modified by geiger 1954 1961 peel et al 2007 also further adjusted the koppen geiger global climate map with three main climatic zones in africa tropical 31 0 arid 57 2 and temperate 11 8 based on the map the land area of sierra leone is over 80 in the rainforest and less than 20 in the monsoon climatic zone also based on this divisions the study area is in the rainforest climate zone of africa peel et al 2007 here there are two distinct seasons the wet season ws and dry season ds the ws may to oct is characterized by clouds heavy rains and low temperatures solar radiation photoperiod and sunshine hours but high humidity in the ds nov to apr the climatic condition is the near reverse of that of the ws the rainfall is unimodal with average annual rainfall and temperature of 2526 mm and 31 c respectively over 80 of the rainfall is in the ws but solar radiation is highest in the month of march 604 mj m2 day generally regions of the world with high solar radiation also have high rice yield venkateswarlu and visperas 1987 the stud area is in the tropical rainforest zone peel et al 2007 where radiation is high solar and therefore rice yield potential high too the soil at the experimental site is typic plinthaquult or pelewahun loam van et al 1972 odell et al 1974 kamara et al 2015 here the top 0 0 2 m soil layer is sandy clay loam with texture having 68 g 100 g sand 12 g 100 g silt and 20 g 100 g clay carbon content of 0 32 g 100 g ph of 4 6 and bulk density of 1 7 mg m3 the relatively high soil bulk density was due to puddling compaction mousavi et al 2009 a required land preparation operation other measured properties of the soil are summarized in table 1 a 26 500 m3 rainwater harvesting micro dam was built in the catchment area of the swamp to store water for irrigation in the downstream region irrigation water was released into the field from the reservoir through a sluice the reservoir was constructed using a 2 5 m high earthen embankment across the headwater region of the swamp a flow meter was installed on the piped gate to measure released water from the reservoir for supplemental irrigation in the dry season an intake gate fitted on each subplot was regulated closed or opened based on designed water management in the plot this approach made it possible to use the single meter at the reservoir gate to separately measure the water delivered to each subplot the experimental site which was under natural wood shrub fallow was manually cleared and prepared using simple hand tools such as machete axe and hoe in subsequent seasons the rice stubble was puddled into the soil the field was partitioned into plots by clay earth bunds compacted in 50 mm layers to a height of 0 2 m and width of 0 5 m to control water and allow access prior to transplanting the field was wetted tilled puddled and leveled 2 2 site plot design the experiment consisted of three water management treatments ars awd and cfi with and without biochar replicated three times in space and four times in time a split plot randomized complete block design was used where the main treatment plots were water management strategies for the ds and sub treatment plots biochar treatment while all the plots had water management in the ds only 50 of the plots had biochar treatment across both the ws and ds the treatments were conducted in both the ws and ds and for a period of two years july 2014 to feb 2017 thus it was a 3 2 3 4 treatment the total area of the plots was 640 m2 but the individual plots varied in area 16 4 40 3 m2 the plots were constructed downstream from the reservoir to allow gravity flow of irrigation water under the cfi treatment water depth was managed such that it did not exceed 60 mm or fall below 50 mm for 95 days after transplanting the water depth was checked in the morning and in the evening and was refilled to 60 mm any time it dropped to 50 mm above the ground mondal et al 2017 under the awd treatment irrigation was done to the depth of 60 mm above the ground and replenished to the same depth only after dropping to 150 mm below the ground the water level in the treatment was monitored in graduated and perforated tubes a technique developed at the international rice research institute irri in the philippines bouman et al 2007 the tubes were installed on the sides of the plots close to the bunds to ease access and reading the awd treatment was initiated from transplanting to panicle initiation then the plots continuously flooded with water to the depth of 60 mm for 15 days following panicle initiation after that period the water treatment was reverted to the normal conditions described above until harvest djaman et al 2018 for the ars treatment the plots were irrigated to saturation after 50 of the available soil moisture was depleted also both awd and ars plots were saturated with 40 50 mm depth of water for 14 days after transplanting following which the different water saving conditions for the respective treatments were initiated a total of two tubes each 300 mm long and 50 mm in diameter were installed per plot half of the tube 150 mm was driven into the soil and the other half left protruding above the ground the tubes were perforated with micro pores along the entire length to enhance water flow while limiting soil particles from slipping into the tubes the acacia species used as the biochar feedstock were cut chopped into small bits air dried and pyrolyzed in a vertical kiln at 400 500 c under low oxygen condition kim et al 2012 nigussie et al 2012 suliman et al 2016 this temperature range was used because biochar yield and those of nitrogen hydrogen and oxygen generally decrease while ash ph and carbon content increase with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 400 to 700 c lehmann et al 2006 gai et al 2014 brewer et al 2014 after pyrolysis the biochar was collected ground into dust and passed through a 2 mm sieve lehmann et al 2006 kamara et al 2015 wang and liu 2017 the grinding mad the biochar to blend with the soil similar to the pre historic amazonian biochar soil lehmann et al 2006 hunt et al 2010 also grinding enhances adsorption of nutrients onto biochar particles by increasing its specific surface area mclaughlin et al 2012 suliman et al 2016 the specific surface area of biochar particle was 650 m2 g determined using the polar liquid ethylene glycol eg retention method bower and gschwend 1952 pennell 2016 water eg and egme ethylene glycol monoethyl ether are good bipolar liquids that penetrate interlayer spaces of expandable solids after drying and therefore provide a good measure of total internal and external surface area this method was chosen because biochar is generally highly porous suliman et al 2016 here a dry biochar sample was placed in vacuum desiccator and liquid eg added in droplets to the solid sample until complete wetting a suction of 13 332 pa 0 1 mmhg was applied and the sample weighed over time to a constant weight and the specific surface area determined as pennell 2016 1 a s w e g w o d e g c f where weg is the weight of eg retained by the biochar sample at the applied suction wod is the oven dry weight of the biochar and cf is the mass surface area conversion factor for eg taken at 3 1 10 4 kg m 2 after grinding the biochar was tested for ph and ec electrical conductivity which were 9 81 for ph and 0 13 μs cm for ec here the orion model 520a ph meter orion technologies beverly mass with a gel filled sensorex s200c ph probe sensorex garden grove cal was used for ph measurement and the orion model 130 electro conductivity meter used for ec measurement a volume ratio of 1 soil to 1 water 1 1 50 ml of biochar was placed in a 250 ml beaker and 50 ml of distilled water added stirred thoroughly and let sit for 1 h before the taking ph measurement by inserting the meter probe into the solution whipker et al 2002 followed by ec measurement biochar is generally in the ph range of 10 12 weber and quicker 2018 the biochar dust was evenly spread on the split plots at 3333 kg ha and thoroughly plowed into the soil to the depth of 0 3 m while the rate was within the range of applications of biochar in the soil nigussie et al 2012 cha et al 2016 plowing beyond the average topsoil depth 0 2 m to 0 3 m made it possible to cover the entire rice rooting depth in the field the soils in the region as across most of west africa are oxisols and ultisols which are generally slightly acidic denis et al 2013 but nonetheless good for rice cultivation 2 3 agronomic treatment a rice rice rotation system was adopted for the wet and dry cropping seasons the ws rice cultivation was from june through september and the ds rice cultivation from november through march all the plots were planted with nerica new rice for africa l 19 rice cultivar an improved hybrid of oryza sativa and oryza glaberrina cross for lowlands the rice seedlings were transplanted at 0 25 m 0 25 m spacing and one seedling per hill because of the depth of water in cfi treatment 21 day old seedlings were used in all the treatments while also the ws rice was transplanted in july and harvested in october ds rice was transplanted in november and harvested in february fertilizer was applied in two splits the first split npk 15 15 15 granular complex was applied one day before transplanting at 40 kg ha and the second split urea npk 46 0 0 applied 40 days after transplanting at 20 kg ha the plots were hand weeded repeatedly to eliminate competition with treatment crops 2 4 crop performance at maturity which was about 100 105 days after transplanting an area of 2 5 m 2 m excluding border rows was demarcated for harvest and all the rice panicles cut and put in a container threshing was done to separate the grains from the fresh panicles and the grains then winnowed taking care not to lose any filled grains during threshing and winnowing operations the filled grains after threshing and winnowing were weighed and then sun dried for 2 3 days to 104 moisture content which is considered suitable for grain storage the moisture content was measured using the pfeuffer he 50 moisture meter the dried grains were next weighed and adjusted at 14 moisture content this process was repeated for each plot in the study 2 5 meteorological data daily meteorological data were obtained from a watchdog weather station the 2009 et model spectrum technologies inc usa located next to the study area the weather station measures calculates and logs on data logger potential evapotranspiration pet solar radiation wind speed and direction wind chill dew point temperature relative humidity and rainfall see operation manual for further detail thus all the weather variables were directly obtained from the watchdog data logger 2 6 water and biochar productivity the irrigation amount per plot was measured using a water meter installed at the sluice gate of the reservoir then the gate at each sub plot was regulated to control the amount of water flow into the plots based on the specific water requirement of the treatment plot rainfall was recorded at half hourly interval at the watchdog weather station water productivity was calculated as grain weight per unit amount of water oecd fao 2016 total water input i e irrigation and rainfall was used to calculate water productivity as bouman et al 2007 2 w p g y σ i r where wp is water productivity kg m3 gy is grain yield kg and i and r are the irrigation and rainfall fractions of water input m3 note that during the ws the variable i is zero similarly biochar productivity was expressed as 3 b p g y b b w where bp is biochar productivity kg kg gyb is grain yield under biochar treatment kg and bw is amount of biochar applied kg 2 7 statistical analysis the data were analyzed in spss statistical package for social sciences version 18 with the transfer of proprietorship from spss inc to ibm international business machines the software has been renamed as ibm or pasw predictive analytics software statistics quintero et al 2012 spss was preferred over other statistical packages in this study because of its ready availability wide global application and high reliability kangoma et al 2017 the data from the randomized block design in three replicates were evaluated for three factors water management at three levels soil management at two levels and seasonal at two levels effects the analysis of variance anova test was done to isolate the effects of each treatment and treatment interaction effects on yield for cases with significant anova effects at p 0 05 the means were separated using the student newman keuls test sorrenti et al 2016 also the stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the interdependence of the tested variables water use biochar use and seasonality 3 results and analyses 3 1 seasonal climate dynamics the average monthly dynamics of the seasonal climate are plotted in fig 2 top plate depicting the trends in selected climatic variables including precipitation temperature and solar radiation average precipitation for the ws was 1235 mm and that for the ds was 170 mm fig 2 bottom plate also both potential evapotranspiration and solar radiation were higher in the ds than in the ws however while the difference in precipitation between the ws and the ds was large 1065 mm or 625 that in potential evapotranspiration 63 mm or 7 of the total was small but even more so for solar radiation 17 mj m2 or 5 of the total also average temperature was slightly higher in the ds 28 c than in the ws 27 c as both potential evapotranspiration and solar radiation are generally dependent on temperature especially in the tropics the dynamics of the climatic variables were similar to temperature high in the ds and low in the ws this has significant implications for crop productivity especially where water ceases to be a limiting factor as in irrigated conditions 3 2 rice grain yield rice grain yield for the two seasons ws and ds as affected by the various management practices is plotted in fig 3 across the treatments rice grain yield was highest under cfi b 3261 kg ha and lowest under awd b 2289 kg ha on average there was 42 more grain production under cfi b than awd b average grain yield for all the soil and water treatments was 44 1023 kg ha higher in the ds 3331 kg ha than in the ws 2307 kg ha also average grain yield for water treatment was 13 355 kg ha higher for biochar soils 2996 kg ha than for non biochar soils 2642 kg ha since there was sufficient rain during the ws cultivation period no irrigation was done in the ds when there was little rain irrigation was highest under cfi b treatment 1284 mm and lowest under awd b 637 mm on average 80 647 mm more water was used under cfi b than awd b fig 3 more water was use in biochar than in non biochar soils under awd 308 mm or 28 and ars 81 mm or 6 water treatments on the contrary there was 564 mm 63 more water use in non biochar than in biochar soils under cfi water treatment table 2 precipitation in the ws 1235 was 1065 76 of the total higher than that in the ds cultivation period 170 mm and 251 mm 11 of the total higher than average irrigation in the ds cultivation period 984 mm also precipitation in the ds 170 was 814 mm 70 of the total less than average irrigation 984 table 2 this implied that in the ds the sum of precipitation and irrigation 1155 mm was 80 mm 7 less than precipitation in the ws 1235 mm it then suggested that water use but also crop yield in terms of grain production was higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period like rice grain yield both solar radiation 10 and potential evapotranspiration 15 were higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period figs 2 and 3 3 3 water productivity from eq 1 water productivity given as grain yield per unit volume of water is plotted in fig 4 for both the ws and ds cultivation periods in the study area as shown in the figure water productivity along the ds and ws cultivation periods was highest for cfi b treatment 321 kg m3 but lowest for the awd b treatment 144 kg m3 for the combined ds and ws cultivation periods water productivity was on average still highest under cfi b 526 kg m3 and lowest under cfi b 366 kg m3 treatment note that under the continuous flooding irrigation cfi 50 60 mm depth of water was maintained above the ground throughout the growing season also because of some precipitation occurred during the ds period 170 mm irrigation was only done as and when required to maintain the 50 60 mm water depth it therefore suggested that while biochar reduced water loss through soil and or crop under continuous water supply as in cfi system it did not reduce water loss under intermittent water supply as in ars and awd systems biochar in the form of dust has large surface area and high potential for ion exchange which properties enhance water and nutrient adsorption and limit leaching lehmann et al 2006 kangoma et al 2017 on average water productivity was 38 higher in the ds than ws cultivation period generally water productivity was higher under biochar treatments on average by 17 than non biochar treatments yields for biochar treatments were higher than non biochar treatments by 2 for awd 6 for ars and 44 for cfi treatment this showed that while water productivity was on average higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period biochar always enhanced water productivity across the various water treatments basso et al 2013 this agreed with earlier reports that biochar enhances not only soil physical properties such as soil texture and structure but also soil water content in agricultural fields gray et al 2014 kangoma et al 2017 3 4 biochar productivity from eq 2 biochar productivity was calculated as a function of grain yield and plotted in fig 5 for both the ws and ds cultivation periods in the study area however biochar productivity was calculated only for biochar treatments like water productivity biochar productivity was 40 higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period for individual treatments across both ws and ds cultivation periods the highest biochar productivity was under cfi b 1 13 kg kg and the lowest under awd b 0 70 kg kg in terms of average biochar productivity along the ws and ds cultivation periods it was still highest for cfi b 0 98 kg kg and lowest for awd b 0 81 kg kg specifically biochar productivity was higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period by 31 for awd b 37 for cfi b and 51 for ars b treatment 4 discussions over 80 of the farming in sierra leone is rainfed meaning that cultivation is mostly done during the ws however it is during the ds that sunshine solar radiation temperature and other climatic variables are most conducive for crop growth but as less than 13 of the precipitation falls during the ds cultivation period extending cropping season into the ds a potentially highly productive period is impossible without irrigation with water made available through rainwater harvesting for example the useful life of the land can be extended into ds this study investigated crop water and biochar productivity for both the ws and ds cultivation periods under tropical ivs conditions based on the results crop productivity was generally higher in the ds than in the ws cultivation period the ws accounted for about 41 of annual rice grain yield in the study area suggesting that 59 more grain can be produced under irrigated ivs conditions the higher yield in the ds 59 was partly attributed to the higher net solar radiation with the availability of water the productivity potential of crops in the ds in the tropics increases bouman et al 2007 while solar radiation was 5 higher rice grain yield was 18 higher in the ds than in the ws as there was no significant damage due to pests or diseases anoxia conditions due to puddling could have contributed to the yield differences between the ds and ws in the study area this was evident in the differences in yield between the biochar and non biochar treatments where all the biochar treatments outperformed the non biochar treatments in both the ws and ds periods the addition of biochar reduced anoxia effect of puddling and thereby increased rice grain yield fujihara et al 2013 this also explained the yield difference between the ws and ds for the two cfi water treatments cfi b and cfi b while yield was 16 higher in the ds than in the ws under cfi b treatment it was 25 higher in the ds than in the ws under cfi b treatment this suggested that the compaction effect of puddling evident in the high bulk density of 1 7 mg m3 induced anoxia conditions in the ivs soil which was mitigated by the de compaction effect of biochar under the biochar treatments even under non biochar soil conditions productivity in the ds was higher than in the ws chen et al 2017 water productivity was on average 39 higher and biochar productivity 50 higher in the ds than in the ws although the individual differences in the weather variables were small between the ws and ds with those in the ds higher except for precipitation but which was compensated for by irrigation the sum of the effect of the differences led to the much higher yield in the ds than in the ws cultivation period across the three irrigation treatments awd ars and cfi in the ds cultivation period cfi water treatment had the highest crop productivity this further showed how important it is to maintain water throughout crop growth period hu et al 2010 kangoma et al 2017 on average crop productivity in terms of grain yield was higher under biochar soil than non biochar soil this suggested that biochar not only loosens agricultural soils but also adsorbs nutrients on its particle surfaces and thereby enhances crop productivity graber et al 2010 jeffery et al 2011 for biochar soil crop productivity under cfi water treatment was 8 higher than ars and 20 higher than awd water treatment then for the non biochar soils crop productivity under cfi was 3 higher than ars and 25 higher than awd water treatment this suggested that water management in awd was better under biochar than non biochar conditions conversely water management in ars was better under non biochar than biochar conditions while biochar improves soil water content lehmann et al 2006 dry conditions could limit the ability of soils to support crop productivity srinivasarao et al 2013 water use was higher under biochar than non biochar soils for awd and ars irrigation treatments and the reverse was the case for cfi irrigation treatment this is significant because farmers will normally prefer cfi under non limited supply of water as biochar has the potential to reduce water requirement and increase yield it can be incorporated into cfi systems as an agriculture water saving technique without necessarily reducing crop yield kangoma et al 2017 in this study crop water and biochar productivities were highest under cfi b condition even with the same agronomic operations during each growing season except for irrigation differences existed between the same cropping season in different agronomic years the yield differences were attributed to the additive effect of the agronomic operations but also to the differences in weather conditions in the different years while crop productivity was a function of water biochar and season water and biochar productivities were a function of season sohi et al 2009 this implied that the addition of water and or biochar enhances crop productivity and this varies with cropping season in tropical ivs conditions while water is critical for crop growth biochar improves soil physical chemical and biological properties which combined effect enhances crop productivity jeffery et al 2011 srinivasarao et al 2013 wang et al 2013 apart from change in physical properties texture porosity bulk density structure etc the addition of biochar to soils enhances soil chemical and biological properties nigussie et al 2012 sorrenti et al 2016 biochar increases microbial population in the soil increases soil ph ec and cec while reducing leaching of soil nutrient etc all of which support vigorous crop growth and productivity suliman et al 2016 speratti et al 2018 studies show that crop productivity is positively correlated with both biochar and irrigation treatment sohi et al 2009 kangoma et al 2017 further analysis showed that while for both biochar and non biochar treatments the difference in crop yield between the ws and ds cultivation periods was significant p 0 05 it was higher for non biochar than for biochar treatment while again the difference in crop yield between biochar and non biochar treatment for ws and ds period was significant it was higher in the ds than in the ws interestingly though the differences in crop water and biochar productivity were similar the general linear anova model results showed that the individual effects of biochar water and season on crop productivity were statistically significant however the effects of their interactions biochar water biochar season water season and biochar water season on crop productivity were insignificant table 3 stepwise regression analysis at p 0 05 showed that biochar was a far more significant factor in terms of its effect on crop productivity than water and season this was followed by water and then season this statistic suggested that while water is indeed critical for crop productivity biochar addition to soil further improves crop productivity however biochar without water is hardly effective as a productivity enhancing factor weather condition as a determinant irrigation factor is therefore critical for the effectiveness of biochar in increasing crop productivity with standing water on the land surface basso et al 2013 crop productivity in the ds was higher than in the ws makombe et al 2007 this agronomic operation complemented further the effect of biochar to the soil and crop graber et al 2010 kangoma et al 2017 this is critical particularly for ssa where agriculture is challenged by rapid land degradation soon after cultivation zinkina and korotayev 2014 conteh et al 2015 the main limitation to a second or third rice cultivation in ivs in the ds is water wimdmeijer and andriesse 1993 which use can be reduced by the addition of biochar to the soil 5 conclusions this study investigated crop water and biochar productivity under alternate wetting and drying aerobic rice system and continuous flooding irrigation systems of water management across both the wet season and dry season cultivation periods in tropical inland valley swamp conditions based on the results the study showed that both water and biochar enhanced rice grain productivity with a higher positive effect in the dry season than in the wet season the wet season accounted for 41 and the dry season 59 of the average annual grain yield also water productivity was on average 39 higher and biochar productivity 50 higher in the dry season than in the wet season in terms of individual treatments rice grain yield under continuous flooding irrigation was simply highest followed by aerobic rice system with biochar and then alternate wetting and drying had the least yield for biochar soils crop productivity under continuous flooding irrigation treatment was 8 higher than under aerobic rice system which was in turn 20 higher than alternate wetting and drying water management then for the non biochar soils crop productivity under continuous flooding irrigation was 3 higher than under aerobic rice system which was in turn 25 higher than alternate wetting and drying water management this showed that amendment of agricultural soils with biochar has the potential to make continuous flooding irrigation sustainable even under global water shortage conditions especially during the dry season biochar use can make this earliest mode of irrigation and still farmers most preferred choice sustainable and a feasible modern agriculture under increasing global water scarcity and land degradation this research showed that biochar use reduces water use while also increasing crop yield from this perspective farmers can either be encouraged to use biochar or governments take the lead to promote biochar technology in continuous flooding irrigation system of farming there is also the need to design incremental applications of water and biochar to develop the threshold point beyond which the combination use of these factors will not result in a meaningful increase in crop productivity acknowledgements we are

course of global change aranjuelo et al 2011 and investigations were performed over the past decades at different levels of plant organization and functioning covering areas ranging from eco physiology to cellular metabolism turner 1986 bollig and feller 2014 sanchez et al 2015 along with other abiotic stresses some negative effects of drought stress on plants are reversible during a subsequent recovery phase while other effects are partially reversible or irreversible mathur et al 2011 kuhn et al 2015 for better agricultural water management detection of crop water stress relies on conventional methods such as soil moisture measurement and meteorological variables to estimate the amount of water lost from plant soil system at crop growth period gonzález dugo et al 2006 however these processes are time consuming and hence plant based phenotyping approaches using physiological traits such as stomatal conductance photosynthetic rate and relative water content has been preferred agam et al 2013 ballester et al 2013 wang et al 2015 similarly advances in remote sensing techniques and spectral reflectance based assessment of photosynthetic limitations and crop water status under drought stress has immense potential of stress detection in crops sun et al 2014 the simplified rapid assessment of the plant water status through these methods are not only useful for irrigation management purposes but would also allow for the efficient screening of plants under different abiotic stresses as part of a high throughput system to precisely evaluate these traits elsayed and darwish 2017 this also allows us to advocate the role of stress detection based on spectral data for plant water status rather on the classical gravitational or soil based moisture assessment methods which are time consuming and also unsuited to tracking frequent changes in environmental conditions which requires rapid measurements ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 kerala state in india is a typical humid tropical region and its hydrology varies significantly from the other parts of india the hydrological characteristics include rainfall variations following annual cycle with spatial variations at micro level the drought event exists for shorter periods of a few months but causes severe losses to the crops cwrdm 2012 2013 kerala state receives a mean annual rainfall of

phosphorus magnesium calcium potassium and other minerals dilruba et al 2009 as discussed above cultivation area of this crop is increasing in kerala however water availability during summer season is a major constraint to crop production in the region controlled irrigation is essential for high yield because the crop is sensitive to both over and under irrigation al harbi et al 2008 hence optimum irrigation at the proper time can play an important role in better growth yield and quality of the crop and detection of plant water status becomes very important in that aspect with this background in this study growth photosynthetic response and leaf spectral reflectance were evaluated in okra during specific growth stages exposed to drought stress of known extent to identify the sensitive growth stage quantify the severity of moderate drought stress at respective stages and changes in plant water status and physiological disfunctioning on the basis of leaf spectral signature as a viable option to tailor physiological trait based mechanistic understanding on growth biomass partitioning and yield of okra under drought stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and experimental

plant material and treatment hybrid seeds bhindi no 10 mahyco maharashtra hybrid seeds company pvt ltd mumbai india were used for sowing the seeds were soaked in water for 24 h before sowing and sowing was performed with 2 seeds in each pot at 1 2 inch depth on 13th march 2018 in fifty clay pots all the seeds germinated within 5 7 days after sowing after which thinning was performed in all the pots to secure one seedling in each pot the seedlings were grown under ambient condition and irrigated at 100 field capacity till they reached the 3rd leaf stage all necessary management practices for pest and weed control were done according to the recommended practices out of fifty pots five blocks of ten pots each for different treatments were divided in general there were five treatments including four drought stress treatment at different growth stages viz at vegetative stage t1 flowering stage t2 late pod filling stage t3 and at flowering to late pod filling stage t4 of okra with one control treatment drought stress 60 field capacity fc was imposed by withholding watering till the achieved moisture stress 60 fc initially gravimetric method was used to estimate soil moisture

was watered regularly to have optimum moisture level 100 fc throughout the experimentation for better understanding the schematic representative diagram with different treatment structure is represented in fig 1 and the treatment details are shown in table 1 completely randomized design crd was followed for the experimentation with ten true replicates for each treatment 2 3 sampling and data collection 2 3 1 morphological parameters the morphological parameters were collected in okra under different treatments at different time intervals 22 40 53 and 67 days after sowing das the growth parameters measured were plant height using meter scale number of leaves by counting and leaf area using leaf area meter li 3100 licor usa 2 3 2 relative water content rwc fresh samples of youngest and fully expanded leaves were collected during different time intervals and cut into small pieces of length 1 cm without any damage and weighed 0 5 g in weighing balance then the samples are moved to the test tubes and soaked in water for 4 h and weighed to determine the turgid weight after 4 h of water absorption the samples are moved to petri dishes and oven dried at 80 c for 24 h and

stomatal conductance gs 2 3 5 spectral measurements and indices field based hyper spectral measurements were carried out by a portable spectroradiometer field spec fr 350 2500 nm asd inc boulder co usa the instrument measures spectral reflectance between 350 2500 nm to a spectral resolution of 2 nm measurements were taken at a height of approximately 0 5 m above the canopy cover with 25 field of view resulting in a sample area of 150 cm2 with a 14 cm diameter at the canopy surface while capturing the data from each sample three measurements were taken and averaged to get single set of spectral reflectance the reflectance from white reference panel made of polytetraflouroethylene ptfe and cintered halon was taken before capturing spectra for each sample conversely leaf spectral reflectance at each wavelength is affected by a number of variables stress as well as stages of the plants due to biochemical changes as well as leaf water content spectral indices are calculated at different wavelengths sensitive to different properties of the biochemical and water stress level the derived indices are used for understanding drought impact on these indices a summary of spectral measurement used within the study is presented in supplementary table s2 the data captured from the device is processed for splice correction and mean was calculated mean for different samples for removing the water absorption bands at the 1350 nm 1400 nm and 1800 nm 2000 nm the ascii exported file is viewed so that those specific wavelengths are removed manually 2 3 6 biomass partitioning dry matter partitioning in different plant parts was assessed at the final stage of plant development three plants were uprooted and separated into leaves stems and roots and then the samples were dried in an oven at 70 c until constant dry weight dw was obtained dw was recorded during the final growth stage and expressed in g per plant 2 3 7 yield attributes the picking of pods was performed three times at 63 68 and 73 das when pods were 3 4 inches long total number of pods and total pod fresh weight per plant cumulative yield was calculated from each treatment 2 4 statistical analysis experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design crd with ten replicates for each treatment the data was statistically verified through analysis of variance anova comparison of means was tested p 0 05 by appropriate post hoc tests such as fisher s least significant difference lsd test or tukey s post hoc test using spss v 10 for windows spss inc chicago usa pearson s correlation coefficients were worked out to compare explanatory variables spectral indices and response variables physiological traits under drought stress over control plants of okra 3 results and discussion assessment of crop response to water stress for detection of sensitive growth stage is an important aspect for devising irrigation planning for specific crops stress detection and associated mechanisms requires special insights on physiological processes regulating the yield penalty due to drought stress evaluation of growth gas exchange attributes and leaf spectral reflectance under drought stress at different growth stages in okra revealed interesting results on morphology physiological processes as well as yield attributes 3 1 meteorological observations during the experimental period mean daytime 06 00 18 00 h night time 18 00 06 00 h temperature and relative humidity were recorded from the date of sowing till harvesting fig 2 the average day time temperature was 32 5 c sd 1 5 while night time temperature recorded as 27 3 c sd 1 3 during the experimental period fig 2a average day time and night time rh was 69 0 sd 6 4 and 88 0 sd 3 7 respectively during the experimental period fig 2b fig 2c shows average daily photosynthetic photon flux density and daily total rainfall during the experimental period 3 2 effect of drought stress on morphological parameters of okra significant differences p 0 001 were recorded across treatment days after sowing das and also with respect to the interaction between das and treatment fig 3 a among the morphological traits decreased plant height under moisture stress conditions relative to control depending on the growth stage supports the previous findings with other crops like maize mallet and de jager 1971 and eggplant kirnak et al 2001 at 67 das plant height was significantly lower p 0 001 in all the treatments over control maximum plant height 122 4 4 0 cm was recorded in control plants and minimum 41 4 2 8 cm in t1 at 67 das at this stage plants in t2 and t4 treatment showed a reduction of 41 2 and 47 1 respectively in plant height over control conversely t3 treatment showed a minimum reduction 28 1 in plant height over control at 67 das fig 3a during the final stage 73 das plant height was significantly p 0 001 lower in all the treatments over control at this growth stage maximum plant height 123 4 3 4 cm was recorded for control plants followed t3 92 2 3 1 cm t2 74 4 0 7 cm t4 63 4 2 1 cm and t1 42 2 3 4 cm fig 3a the reduction in plant height was more in t1 65 8 where drought stress was imposed covering entire vegetative stage in t2 and t4 treatments plant height reduced by 39 7 and 48 6 over control where drought stress was imposed during critical flowering stage t2 and flowering to late pod filling stage t4 conversely in t3 treatment plant height reduced to a lesser extent by 25 3 over control due to the stress exposure only at late pod filling stage this indicates that in case of okra drought stress has maximum impact on the plant height at the vegetative followed by flowering and late pod filling stages since the vegetative stage corresponds to the period of active mitotic cell division moisture stress during this growth stage is likely to impair the overall development of those plant organs that depend on the extent of cell division taking place during this phenological stage mbagwu and adesipe 1987 earlier reports also supports our finding suggesting that the reduction in the plant height may go up to 53 79 over control depending on the variety moisture stress period stage sankar et al 2007 such reduction may also be attributed to declined cell enlargement and cell growth due to the low turgor pressure and more leaf senescence under drought stress at flowering pod filling stages drought stress commencing only at late pod filling stage in our case t3 might be less effective to induce stress signals compared to other stages t1 t2 and t4 fig 3 a significant treatment x days after sowing das effect p 0 001 was recorded for number of leaves per plant at 53 das relative decrease in number of leaves under t1 t2 and t4 treatments were 37 5 3 1 and 3 1 respectively conversely in t3 treatment number of leaves remained similar to that of control at 67 das there was significant p 0 001 reduction in number of leaves in all treatments over control the maximum reduction 39 1 was recorded in t1 while minimum reduction 13 0 was observed in t3 over control on the other hand in t2 and t4 treatments number of leaves was less by 15 2 and 26 1 respectively when compared to control plants at the final stage 73das relative decrease in number of leaves was more for t1 34 8 followed by t4 23 9 t2 13 0 and t3 13 0 respectively over control plants fig 3c number of leaves per plant individual leaf size and leaf longevity reduced due to decreasing soil water status reduction in leaf number was owing to poor assimilate supply since t1 plants experienced drought during vegetative stage which is the physiologically most active stage for development and stress exposure at this time might impaired the physiological processes on the other hand in t4 treatments plants were subjected to drought stress during flowering podding stage hence leaf senescence could be the cause of reduction in leaf number however in t2 and t3 treatment plants showed more plasticity for the leaf number showing 13 reduction fig 3 a significant treatment x das effect p 0 001 was noted for total leaf area of okra plants similar to plant height and leaf number there was no significant difference at initial stages of the measurement i e 22 das fig 3b after achieving the stress level during 40 das in t1 treatment 70 2 reduction in total leaf area over the control was recorded on the other hand at this stage no other treatment showed any difference compared to control fig 3b at 53 das relative reduction in t1 t2 and t4 were 85 3 55 7 and 56 0 respectively for total leaf area compared to control while no significant change in total leaf area occurred in t3 treatment drought stress caused significant reduction in total leaf area of all the treatments over control at 67 das maximum reduction in total leaf area was observed in t1 77 5 while in t4 and t2 it was 58 2 and 55 7 reduction over control conversely in t3 it was comparable to control fig 3b similar pattern of reduction in total leaf area was observed at the final stage i e 73das recording maximum leaf area 649 8 37 5 cm2 in control plants and minimum 151 8 11 9 cm2 under t1 fig 3b it is well known that leaf turgor temperature and assimilate supply for growth are affected by drought reddy et al 2004 our results are in line with other reported works on drought stress which report significant reduction in leaf area under water deficit condition in okra cultivars mbagwu and adesipe 1987 bhatt and srinivasa rao 2005 sankar et al 2007 maize mallet and de jager 1971 and sorghum yadav et al 2005 the reduction of total leaf area depending on the drought imposition at different stages i e at vegetative stage t1 followed by t4 flowering late pod filling stage and t2 flowering stage reveals that leaf area was significantly affected by moisture stress in all the growth stages relative to the control altaf et al 2015 mbagwu and adesipe 1987 sankar et al 2007 however there were no change in leaf area when applied only at late pod filling stage t3 which indicates that leaf area plasticity at pod filling stage was able to maintain control of water use in okra reduction in total leaf area under drought reportedly explains the reduction in photosynthesis due to poor assimilate supply kramer and boyer 1995 reddy et al 2004 this suggests that t3 plants drought imposed at late pod filling stage showed less reduction in leaf area compared to control 3 3 effect of drought stress on relative water content rwc of leaves of okra drought stress caused significant differences p 0 001 in relative water content rwc of leaves of plants sampled at different das the interaction between treatments and das was also significant p 0 001 fig 4 a at 28 das during initial stage of the plant samples there was no significant difference in relative water content of leaves in any of the treatment as the drought stress progressed at 41 das significant reduction in rwc 50 of t1 plants was observed over control fig 4a while in the other treatments there was no change in rwc at 64 das rwc was significantly p 0 001 lower in t1 t2 and t4 treatments compared to control the pattern of reduction in rwc was maximum in t1 37 followed by t2 and t4 28 over control while in t3 it did not vary from control at the last stage 70 das maximum rwc 82 4 0 2 was recorded in control plants and minimum was recorded in t4 treatment 39 8 2 8 on the other hand in t1 t2 and t3 it was 57 8 2 1 60 6 1 7 and 66 8 1 7 respectively fig 4a the leaf relative water content reduces in a manner of imposing period under drought stress similar observations were reported in pea turkan et al 2005 pepper kaya and higgs 2003 ground nut shinde et al 2010 melon tuna et al 2010 as well as in okra under drought and salinity kucukkomurcu 2011 where water stress significantly reduced leaf proportional water content leaf relative water content is an important characteristic that influences plant water relations in our study okra leaves showed higher leaf relative water content initially in all the treatments during leaf development later as the dry matter accumulated and leaf matured it was reduced in a stage specific manner fig 4a exposure of plants to drought stress substantially decreased the leaf water potential relative water content and transpiration rate which might be associated with a concomitant increase in leaf temperature as reported in wheat siddique et al 2001 the results of the study revealed that drought stress during vegetative stage t1 flowering t2 and flowering to late pod filling t4 stages was more detrimental compared to late pod filling stage t3 in okra fig 4a earlier reports on the crop are available showing leaf relative water content of 47 58 under drought stress compared to control plants 98 11 deveci et al 2017 another study on the response of okra to drought by barzegar et al 2016 also reveals that relative water content rwc was significantly reduced in water deficit treatments high crop canopy temperature in water stressed plants may also be related with decreased rwc values kirnak et al 2001 it general under conditions of water deficit decrease in the leaf relative water content is related to decrease in the fruit yield and wue 3 4 effect of drought stress on membrane stability index of okra similar to leaf relative water content there was significant differences p 0 001 in membrane stability index msi of leaves sampled at different das under different treatments the interaction between treatment and das was also highly significant p 0 001 fig 4b it is accepted that the maintenance of integrity and stability of membranes under water stress is a major component of drought tolerance in plants bajji et al 2002 maintained membrane stability index reciprocal to cell membrane injury in t3 treatment explains that stress at late pod filling stage doesn t cause significant membrane injury in okra leaves it also explains that continued drought exposure from flowering late pod filling stage t4 treatment caused a significant alteration in membrane composition and hence it s permeability characteristics fig 4b on the other hand t1 treatment at vegetative stage showed maximum reduction 57 6 over control at 41 das showing membrane damage earlier in the growth phase of plants contributing to reduced assimilate movement for dry matter production our results confirm the previous works which show decrease in membrane stability index under water stress in various crops including okra kucukkomurcu 2011 beans kaya and dasgan 2013 groundnut shinde et al 2010 3 5 effect of drought stress on gas exchange attributes of okra the treatment x das effect was significant p 0 001 for all gas exchange parameters at 27 das there was no significant difference in gas exchange traits in any treatment compared with control plants fig 5 in our study drought induced reduction in photosynthesis at different stages was attributed to decrease in leaf expansion causing reduced leaf area impaired photosynthetic machinery due to membrane leakage and reduced leaf relative water content wahid and rasul 2005 both stomatal and non stomatal limitations may occur to photosynthesis under drought stress in okra as in t4 drought imposed at flowering to late pod filling stage reduction in photosynthesis is largely attributed to reduced stomatal conductance fig 5c as well as reduced leaf relative water content fig 4a and the reduction in membrane stability index fig 4b which suggests that other biochemical processes besides co2 uptake might be damaged the role of drought induced stomatal closure which limits co2 uptake by leaves may also possibly lead to increased susceptibility to photo damage cornic and massacci 1996 in the case of t1 treatment drought stress imposed at vegetative stage there were no significant improvement in the net photosynthetic rate even after further re watering which suggests that in case of okra drought stress during vegetative stage is more detrimental for overall growth performance and carbon assimilation and assimilate flow for triggering flowering flowering did not commence in t1 therefore as suggested the decrease in net co2 assimilation during a stress period might be initially reversible but depending on the stage and duration of the stress it may be only partially reversible or even irreversible haldimann et al 2008 zwicke et al 2015 plant performance depends on the processes during a stress period as well as during the pre stress phase and during a subsequent recovery phase after the stress period lipiec et al 2013 as in t2 and t4 treatment drought was imposed at flowering stage but in t2 re watering was done after covering flowering stage while in t4 plants were under drought from flowering late pod filling stage which might have caused irreversible damage to the photosynthetic machinery thereby affecting carbon assimilation fig 5a for net carbon assimilation on the whole plant level the export via phloem and further utilization of assimilates are relevant in addition to photosynthetic performance of leaves the supply of roots with energy in the form of organic solutes is equally important as the supply of other shoot parts like expanding leaves or maturing fruits and seeds lipiec et al 2013 feller et al 2015 similarly active transport of assimilates to developing sink also becomes important to decide the yield which could be possible through maintained membrane integrity as well as sustained biomass partitioning in our study t3 treatment plants experienced drought only during late pod filling stage hence the utilization of assimilates or pod filling was least affected which might have resulted in least decrease in yield under t3 treatment compared to other treatments 3 6 spectral signature of okra under drought stress and relationship of leaf spectral indices with different physiological traits water use optimizing in agriculture requires innovations in detection of plant water stress at various stages of the growing season of particular crop in order to increase water savings and enhance agricultural sustainability implementation of suitable irrigation scheduling methods is essential osroosh et al 2015 and requires early detection of water stress in crops before it causes irreversible damage and yield loss conventional methods for monitoring crop water stress rely on in situ soil moisture measurements during a given period gonzález dugo et al 2006 in regular sampling of soil water depletion from plant root zone is assumed as the water holding capacity of soil remains uniform so only a few point measurements are used clarke 1997 other methods of detecting plant water status involve direct and indirect measurement of plant water status via stomatal conductance and leaf water potential etc ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 recent studies have focused on the use of remotely sensed data as an alternative to traditional field measurements of plant stress parameters providing information about the spatial and temporal variability of crops panigada et al 2014 dangwal et al 2015 in the present study we have measured the spectral reflectance under different treatment to quantify the drought stress impact fig 6 shows the leaf spectral signature under different treatments at different time interval visual interpretation of the mean reflectance spectra of okra under different treatments revealed overlapping and crossing at initial stage i e 25 das fig 6 a of plant development while at 40 das there was a significant different visible in t1 treatment where the plants were under stress in vegetative stage fig 6b conversely at 64 and 71 das there were statistically significant differences at most of the wavebands allowing different treatments to be discriminated easily fig 6c d on the basis of these spectral signatures various spectral indices for illustrative purpose are displayed in

in the epoxidation state of xanthophyll pigments pertaining to non photochemical quenching garbulsky et al 2011 it has been used to detect photosynthetic activity at different scales from plant biochemistry to the canopy level under drought as well as heat stress garbulsky et al 2011 dobrowski et al 2005 steady state chlorophyll fluorescence tracked by pri suggests pri as a more effective indicator of photosynthetic disturbances than other leaf water and pigment based indices our finding for okra under drought stress corroborates previous findings showing strong relationships table 2 between photosynthetic activity and pri subjected to water stress for different plant species ripullone et al 2011 tsonev et al 2014 it also followed a similar trend as in the case of ndvi and lai fig

64das fig 7g these differential responses resulted in significant positive relationships between rwc and rvi and between leaf transpiration rate and wi table 2 since all these indices are formulated by several water absorption wavelengths these relationships indicate the consistent sensitivity of rvi and wi to mild or severe drought conditions furthermore these spectral indices show significant correlation to gs and e due to stomatal behavior dependence and transpirational water loss conversely wi was related to e and hence was more sensitive to physiological parameters than other water

with leaf transpiration rate r 0 54 p 0 05 table 2 this study confirms the possibility of using spectral signatures to identify stress at particular stages of crops without tedious laboratory analysis for water stress severity duration and timing of stress as well as responses of plants after stress removal and interaction between stress and other factors are extremely important plaut 2003 3 7 effect of drought stress on total dry matter of okra at final harvest dry weight of different plant parts was recorded to understand the biomass partitioning under drought stress total dry weight was significantly p 0 001 reduced under drought stress higher reduction 87 4 over control in total dry weight was found in t1 followed by t4 63 2 t2 53 2 and t3 41 8 compared to control fig 8 the decrease in total weight under drought conditions might be associated with suppression of cell expansion and cell growth due to low turgor pressure sankar et al 2007 dry matter partitioning also revealed that plants under t1 and t4 were not able to provide assimilate supply properly for the structural growth and developing tissues it has already been reported that drought stress not only limits the size of the source and sink tissues but also the phloem loading assimilate translocation and impaired dry matter partitioning however the extent of effects varies with the plant species stage duration and severity of drought farooq et al 2009 in the present study reduction in dry weight of t2 and t4 plants might be largely attributed to leaf dry matter partitioning however stem biomass also contributed to reduction in total plant biomass fig 8 similar reductions in plant dry biomass were observed for eggplants kirnak et al 2001 kiwi fruits chartzoulakis et al 1993 wheat rane et al 2001 pearl millet kusaka et al 2005 peanut nautiyal et al 2002 under drought stress decreased total dry weight in okra under drought stress in t1 treatment was attributed to the considerable decrease in plant growth photosynthesis and canopy structure bhatt and srinivasa rao 2005 3 8 effect of drought stress on number of pods and pod yield of okra studies have reported the effects of water stress on fruit yield reduction for a range of agricultural and horticultural crops such as sorghum chaudhuri and kanemasu 1982 tomato rudich et al 1977 tan 1988 peach tan and buttery 1982 and strawberry kirnak et al 2001 in present study total numbers of pods significantly reduced p 0 001 under drought stress in t2 t3 and t4 treatments pod formation did not commence in t1 stress covering vegetative stage in t4 and t2 treatment reduction in number of pods was 69 2 and 51 9 over control conversely in t3 treatment there was a reduction of 23 1 in number of pods over control plants fig 9 a pod yield was significantly p 0 001 reduced under drought stress treatments fig 9 b maximum reduction 83 7 over control was recorded in t4 treatment followed by t2 55 1 over control in t3 pod fresh weight was lesser with a decrease of 37 9 over control plants fig 9b our study suggests that yield reduction in okra to drought stress was attributed to physiological alteration disturbing plant processes for growth and carbon assimilation at specific growth stage the extent of yield reduction in okra due to moisture stress depends on the phenological age at which the stress is imposed as well as the cultivar mbagwu and adesipe 1987 similar observations were made on cowpeas babalola 1980 and snap beans millar and gardner 1972 drought stress covering vegetative stage might hamper the plant growth and even plant may not commence flowering while in t2 and t4 where stress imposition was during the flowering stage it might have affected flowering or abortion of flowers and pod filling duration with improper biomass partitioning to developing sink conversely t3 treatment plants experienced drought only during late pod filling stage affecting impaired meiotic cell divisions taking place during that stage 4 conclusion drought stress is the one of the most detrimental stress factors governing yield in crop plants including vegetables like okra optimum irrigation at the proper time plays an important role in better growth and yield in okra in present study we found that vegetative flowering as well as early pod filling stage are the sensitive stages to drought stress in okra based on total photosynthetic leaf area membrane damage and overall growth biomass and yield performance stress detection is one of the important aspects for devising water management options for crops in our study we could explore the potential of non destructive leaf spectral measurement as a new tool for detection of stress at particular stage contrary to time consuming conventional soil moisture measurement or destructive plant based measurement of leaf relative water content a strong relationship between leaf spectral reflectance and gas exchange measurement explored the physiological mechanism of reduction in carbon assimilation governed by stomatal limitation at flowering late pod filling stage flowering and vegetative stages under drought stress further dry matter partitioning and yield parameters have reconfirmed that the reduction in pod yield of okra is attributed to poor assimilate transport reduced photosynthetic efficiency and membrane damage to summarize plant based stress detection based on leaf photosynthetic attributes could be utilized for enhancing water use efficiency at specific growth stage and to help in for devising agricultural water management options with

physiology to cellular metabolism turner 1986 bollig and feller 2014 sanchez et al 2015 along with other abiotic stresses some negative effects of drought stress on plants are reversible during a subsequent recovery phase while other effects are partially reversible or irreversible mathur et al 2011 kuhn et al 2015 for better agricultural water management detection of crop water stress relies on conventional methods such as soil moisture measurement and meteorological variables to estimate the amount of water lost from plant soil system at crop growth period gonzález dugo et al 2006 however these processes are time consuming and hence plant based phenotyping approaches using physiological traits such as stomatal conductance photosynthetic rate and relative water content has been preferred agam et al 2013 ballester et al 2013 wang et al 2015 similarly advances in remote sensing techniques and spectral reflectance based assessment of photosynthetic limitations and crop water status under drought stress has immense potential of stress detection in crops sun et al 2014 the simplified rapid assessment of the plant water status through these methods are not only useful for irrigation management purposes but would also allow for the efficient screening of plants under different abiotic stresses as part of a high throughput system to precisely evaluate these traits elsayed and darwish 2017 this also allows us to advocate the role of stress detection based on spectral data for plant water status rather on the classical gravitational or soil based moisture assessment methods which are time consuming and also unsuited to tracking frequent changes in environmental conditions which requires rapid measurements ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 kerala state in india is a typical humid tropical region and its hydrology varies significantly from the other parts of india the hydrological characteristics include rainfall variations following annual cycle with

a major constraint to crop production in the region controlled irrigation is essential for high yield because the crop is sensitive to both over and under irrigation al harbi et al 2008 hence optimum irrigation at the proper time can play an important role in better growth yield and quality of the crop and detection of plant water status becomes very important in that aspect with this background in this study growth photosynthetic response and leaf spectral reflectance were evaluated in okra during specific growth stages exposed to drought stress of known extent to identify the sensitive growth stage quantify the severity of moderate drought stress at respective stages and changes in plant water status and physiological disfunctioning on the basis of leaf spectral signature as a viable option to tailor physiological trait based mechanistic understanding on growth biomass partitioning and yield of okra under drought stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and experimental

plant material and treatment hybrid seeds bhindi no 10 mahyco maharashtra hybrid seeds company pvt ltd mumbai india were used for sowing the seeds were soaked in water for 24 h before sowing and sowing was performed with 2 seeds in each pot at 1 2 inch depth on 13th march 2018 in fifty clay pots all the seeds germinated within 5 7 days after sowing after which thinning was performed in all the pots to secure one seedling in each pot the seedlings were grown under ambient condition and irrigated at 100 field capacity till they reached the 3rd leaf stage all necessary management practices for pest and weed control were done according to the recommended practices out of fifty pots five blocks of ten pots each for different treatments were divided in general there were five treatments including four drought stress treatment at different growth stages viz at vegetative stage t1 flowering stage t2 late pod filling stage t3 and at flowering to late pod filling stage t4 of okra with

was watered regularly to have optimum moisture level 100 fc throughout the experimentation for better understanding the schematic representative diagram with different treatment structure is represented in fig 1 and the treatment details are shown in table 1 completely randomized design crd was followed for the experimentation with ten true replicates for each treatment 2 3 sampling and data collection 2 3 1 morphological parameters the morphological parameters were collected in okra under different treatments at different time intervals 22 40 53 and 67 days after sowing das the growth parameters measured were plant height using meter scale number of leaves by counting and leaf area using leaf area meter li 3100 licor usa 2 3 2 relative water content rwc fresh samples of youngest and fully expanded leaves were collected during different time intervals and cut into small pieces of length 1 cm without any damage and weighed 0 5 g in weighing balance then the samples are moved to the test tubes and soaked in water for 4 h and weighed to determine the turgid weight after 4 h of water absorption the samples are moved to petri dishes and oven dried at 80 c for 24 h and

stomatal conductance gs 2 3 5 spectral measurements and indices field based hyper spectral measurements were carried out by a portable spectroradiometer field spec fr 350 2500 nm asd inc boulder co usa the instrument measures spectral reflectance between 350 2500 nm to a spectral resolution of 2 nm measurements were taken at a height of approximately 0 5 m above the canopy cover with 25 field of view resulting in a sample area of 150 cm2 with a 14 cm diameter at the canopy surface while capturing the data from each sample three measurements were taken and averaged to get single set of spectral reflectance the reflectance from white reference panel made of polytetraflouroethylene ptfe and cintered halon was taken before capturing spectra for each sample conversely leaf spectral reflectance at each wavelength is affected by a number of variables stress as well as stages of the plants due to biochemical changes as well as leaf water content spectral indices are calculated at different wavelengths sensitive to different properties of the biochemical and water stress level the derived indices are used for understanding drought impact on these indices a summary of spectral measurement used within the study is presented in supplementary table s2 the data captured from the device is processed for splice correction and mean was calculated mean for different samples for removing the water absorption bands at the 1350 nm 1400 nm and 1800 nm 2000 nm the ascii exported file is viewed so that those specific wavelengths are removed manually 2 3 6 biomass partitioning dry matter partitioning in different plant parts was assessed at the final stage of plant development three plants were uprooted and separated into leaves stems and roots and then the samples were dried in an oven at 70 c until constant dry weight dw was obtained dw was recorded during the final growth stage and expressed in g per plant 2 3 7 yield attributes the picking of pods was performed three times at 63 68 and 73 das when pods were 3 4 inches long total number of pods and total pod fresh weight per plant cumulative yield was calculated from each treatment 2 4 statistical analysis experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design crd with ten replicates for each treatment the data was statistically verified through analysis of variance anova comparison of means was tested p 0 05 by appropriate post hoc tests such as fisher s least significant difference lsd test or tukey s post hoc test using spss v 10 for windows spss inc chicago usa pearson s correlation coefficients were worked out to compare explanatory variables spectral indices and response variables physiological traits under drought stress over control plants of okra 3 results and discussion assessment of crop response to water stress for detection of sensitive growth stage is an important aspect for devising irrigation planning for specific crops stress detection and associated mechanisms requires special insights on physiological processes regulating the yield penalty due to drought stress evaluation of growth gas exchange attributes and leaf spectral reflectance under drought stress at different growth stages in okra revealed interesting results on morphology physiological processes as well as yield attributes 3 1 meteorological observations during the experimental period mean daytime 06 00 18 00 h night time 18 00 06 00 h temperature and relative humidity were recorded from the date of sowing till harvesting fig 2 the average day time temperature was 32 5 c sd

period fig 2b fig 2c shows average daily photosynthetic photon flux density and daily total rainfall during the experimental period 3 2 effect of drought stress on morphological parameters of okra significant differences p 0 001 were recorded across treatment days after sowing das and also with respect to the interaction between das and treatment fig 3 a among the morphological traits decreased plant height under moisture stress conditions relative to control depending on the growth stage supports the previous findings with other crops like maize mallet and de jager 1971 and eggplant kirnak et al 2001 at 67 das plant height was significantly lower p 0 001 in all the treatments over control maximum plant height 122 4 4 0 cm was recorded in control plants and minimum 41 4 2 8 cm in t1 at 67 das at this stage plants in t2 and t4 treatment showed a reduction of 41 2 and 47 1 respectively in plant height over control conversely t3 treatment showed a minimum reduction 28 1 in plant height over control at 67 das fig 3a during the final stage 73 das plant height was significantly p 0 001 lower in all the treatments over control at this growth stage maximum plant height 123 4 3 4 cm was recorded for control plants followed t3 92 2 3 1 cm t2 74 4 0 7 cm t4 63 4 2 1 cm and t1 42 2 3 4 cm fig 3a the reduction in plant height was more in t1 65 8 where drought stress was imposed covering entire vegetative stage in t2 and t4 treatments plant height reduced by 39 7 and 48 6 over control where drought stress was imposed during critical flowering stage t2 and flowering to late pod filling stage t4 conversely in t3 treatment plant height reduced to a lesser extent by 25 3 over control due to the stress exposure only at late pod filling stage this indicates that in case of okra drought stress has maximum impact on the plant height at the vegetative followed by flowering and late pod filling stages since the vegetative stage corresponds to the period of active mitotic cell division moisture stress during this growth stage is likely to impair the overall development of those plant organs that depend on the extent of cell division taking place during this phenological stage mbagwu and adesipe 1987 earlier reports also supports our finding suggesting that the reduction in the plant height may go up to 53 79 over control depending on the variety moisture stress period stage sankar et al 2007 such reduction may also be attributed to declined cell enlargement and cell growth due to the low turgor pressure and more leaf senescence under drought stress at flowering pod filling stages drought stress commencing only at late pod filling stage in our case t3 might be less effective to induce stress signals compared to other stages t1 t2 and t4 fig 3 a significant treatment x days after sowing das effect p 0 001 was recorded for number of leaves per plant at 53 das relative decrease in number of leaves under t1 t2 and t4 treatments were 37 5 3 1 and 3 1 respectively conversely in t3 treatment number of leaves remained similar to that of control at 67 das there was significant p 0 001 reduction in number of leaves in all treatments over control the maximum reduction 39 1 was recorded in t1 while minimum reduction 13 0 was observed in t3 over control on the other hand in t2 and t4 treatments number of leaves was less by 15 2 and 26 1 respectively when compared to control plants at the final stage 73das relative decrease in number of leaves was more for t1 34 8 followed by t4 23 9 t2 13 0 and t3 13 0 respectively over control plants fig 3c number of leaves per plant individual leaf size and leaf longevity reduced due to decreasing soil water status reduction in leaf number was owing to poor assimilate supply since t1 plants experienced drought during vegetative stage which is the physiologically most active stage for development and stress exposure at this time might impaired the physiological processes on the other hand in t4 treatments plants were subjected to drought stress during flowering podding stage hence leaf senescence could be the cause of reduction in leaf number however in t2 and t3 treatment plants showed more plasticity for the leaf number showing 13 reduction fig 3 a significant treatment x das effect p 0 001 was noted for total leaf area of okra plants similar to plant height and leaf number there was no significant difference at initial stages of the measurement i e 22 das fig 3b after achieving the stress level during 40 das in t1 treatment 70 2 reduction in total leaf area over the control was recorded on the other hand at this stage no other treatment showed any difference compared to control fig 3b at 53 das relative reduction in t1 t2 and t4 were 85 3 55 7 and 56 0 respectively for total leaf area compared to control while no significant change in total leaf area occurred in t3 treatment drought stress caused significant reduction in total leaf area of all the treatments over control at 67 das maximum reduction in total leaf area was observed in t1 77 5 while in t4 and t2 it was 58 2 and 55 7 reduction over control conversely in t3 it was comparable to control fig 3b similar pattern of reduction in total leaf area was observed at the final stage i e 73das recording maximum leaf area 649 8 37 5 cm2 in control plants and minimum 151 8 11 9 cm2 under t1 fig 3b it is well known that leaf turgor temperature and assimilate supply for growth are affected by drought reddy et al 2004 our results are in line with other reported works on drought stress which report significant reduction in leaf area under water deficit condition in okra cultivars mbagwu and adesipe 1987 bhatt and srinivasa rao 2005 sankar et al 2007 maize mallet and de jager 1971 and sorghum yadav et al 2005 the reduction of total leaf area depending on the drought imposition at different stages i e at vegetative stage t1 followed by t4 flowering late pod filling stage and t2 flowering stage reveals that leaf area was significantly affected by moisture stress in all the growth stages relative to the control altaf et al 2015 mbagwu and adesipe 1987 sankar et al 2007 however there were no change in leaf area when applied only at late pod filling stage t3 which indicates that leaf area plasticity at pod filling stage was able to maintain control of water use in okra reduction in total leaf area under drought reportedly explains the reduction in photosynthesis due to poor assimilate supply kramer and boyer 1995 reddy et al 2004 this suggests that t3 plants drought imposed at late pod filling stage showed less reduction in leaf area compared to control 3 3 effect of drought stress on relative water content rwc of leaves of okra drought stress caused significant differences p 0 001 in relative water content rwc of leaves of plants sampled at different das the interaction between treatments and das was also significant p 0 001 fig 4 a at 28 das during initial stage of the plant samples there was no significant difference in relative water content of leaves in any of the treatment as the drought stress progressed at 41 das significant reduction in rwc 50 of t1 plants was observed over control fig 4a while in the other treatments there was no change in rwc at 64 das rwc was significantly p 0 001 lower in t1 t2 and t4 treatments compared to control the pattern of reduction in rwc was maximum in t1 37 followed by t2 and t4 28 over control while in t3 it did not vary from control at the last stage 70 das maximum rwc 82 4 0 2 was recorded in control plants and minimum was recorded in t4 treatment 39 8 2 8 on the other hand in t1 t2 and t3 it was 57 8 2 1 60 6 1 7 and 66 8 1 7 respectively fig 4a the leaf relative water content reduces in a manner of imposing period under drought stress similar observations were reported in pea turkan et al 2005 pepper kaya and higgs 2003 ground nut shinde et al 2010 melon tuna et al 2010 as well as in okra under drought and salinity kucukkomurcu 2011 where water stress significantly reduced leaf proportional water content leaf relative water content is an important characteristic that influences plant water relations in our study okra leaves showed higher leaf relative water content initially in all the treatments during leaf development later as the dry matter accumulated and leaf matured it was reduced in a stage specific manner fig 4a exposure of plants to drought stress substantially decreased the leaf water potential relative water content and transpiration rate which might be associated with a concomitant increase in leaf temperature as reported in wheat siddique et al 2001 the results of the study revealed that drought stress during vegetative stage t1 flowering t2 and flowering to late pod filling t4 stages was more detrimental compared to late pod filling stage t3 in okra fig 4a earlier reports on the crop are available showing leaf relative water content of 47 58 under drought stress compared to control plants 98 11 deveci et al 2017 another study on the response of okra to drought by barzegar et al 2016 also reveals that relative water content rwc was significantly reduced in water deficit treatments high crop canopy temperature in water stressed plants may also be related with decreased rwc values kirnak et al 2001 it general under conditions of water deficit decrease in the leaf relative water content is related to decrease in the fruit yield and wue 3 4 effect of drought stress on membrane stability index of okra similar to leaf relative water content there was significant differences p 0 001 in membrane stability index msi of leaves sampled at different das under different treatments the interaction between treatment and das was also highly significant p 0 001 fig 4b it is accepted that the maintenance of integrity and stability of membranes under water stress is a major component of drought tolerance in plants bajji et al 2002 maintained membrane stability index reciprocal to cell membrane injury in t3 treatment explains that stress at late pod filling stage doesn t cause significant membrane injury in okra leaves it also explains that continued drought exposure from flowering late pod filling stage t4 treatment caused a significant alteration in membrane composition and hence it s permeability characteristics fig 4b on the other hand t1 treatment at vegetative stage showed maximum reduction 57 6 over control at 41 das showing membrane damage earlier in the growth phase of plants contributing to reduced assimilate movement for dry matter production our results confirm the previous works which show decrease in membrane stability index under water stress in various crops including okra kucukkomurcu 2011 beans kaya and dasgan 2013 groundnut shinde et al 2010 3 5 effect of drought stress on gas exchange attributes of okra the treatment x das effect was significant p 0 001 for all gas exchange parameters at 27 das there was no significant difference in gas exchange traits in any treatment compared with control plants fig 5 in our study drought induced reduction in photosynthesis at different stages was attributed to decrease in leaf expansion causing reduced leaf area impaired photosynthetic machinery due to membrane leakage and reduced leaf relative water content wahid and rasul 2005 both stomatal and non stomatal limitations may occur to photosynthesis under drought stress in okra as in t4 drought imposed at flowering to late pod filling stage reduction in photosynthesis is largely attributed to reduced stomatal conductance fig 5c as well as reduced leaf relative water content fig 4a and the reduction in membrane stability index fig 4b which suggests that other biochemical processes besides co2 uptake might be damaged the role of drought induced stomatal closure which limits co2 uptake by leaves may also possibly lead to increased susceptibility to photo damage cornic and massacci 1996 in the case of t1 treatment drought stress imposed at vegetative stage there were no significant improvement in the net photosynthetic rate even after further re watering which suggests that in case of okra drought stress during vegetative stage is more detrimental for overall growth performance and carbon assimilation and assimilate flow for triggering flowering flowering did not commence in t1 therefore as suggested the decrease in net co2 assimilation during a stress period might be initially reversible but depending on the stage and duration of the stress it may be only partially reversible or even irreversible haldimann et al 2008 zwicke et al 2015 plant performance depends on the processes during a stress period as well as during the pre stress phase and during a subsequent recovery phase after the stress period lipiec et al 2013 as in t2 and t4 treatment drought was imposed at flowering stage but in t2 re watering was done after covering flowering stage while in t4 plants were under drought from flowering late pod filling stage which might have caused irreversible damage to the photosynthetic machinery thereby affecting carbon assimilation fig 5a for net carbon assimilation on the whole plant level the export via phloem and further utilization of assimilates are relevant in addition to photosynthetic performance of leaves the supply of roots with energy in the form of organic solutes is equally important as the supply of other shoot parts like expanding leaves or maturing fruits and seeds lipiec et al 2013 feller et al 2015 similarly active transport of assimilates to developing sink also becomes important to decide the yield which could be possible through maintained membrane integrity as well as sustained biomass partitioning in our study t3 treatment plants experienced drought only during late pod filling stage hence the utilization of assimilates or pod filling was least affected which might have resulted in least decrease in yield under t3 treatment compared to other treatments 3 6 spectral signature of okra under drought stress and relationship of leaf spectral indices with different physiological traits water use optimizing in agriculture requires innovations in detection of plant water stress at various stages of the growing season of particular crop in order to increase water savings and enhance agricultural sustainability implementation of suitable irrigation scheduling methods is essential osroosh et al 2015 and requires early detection of water stress in crops before it causes irreversible damage and yield loss conventional methods for monitoring crop water stress rely on in situ soil moisture measurements during a given period gonzález dugo et al 2006 in regular sampling of soil water depletion from plant root zone is assumed as the water holding capacity of soil remains uniform so only a few point measurements are used clarke 1997 other methods of detecting plant water status involve direct and indirect measurement of plant water status via stomatal conductance and leaf water potential etc ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 recent studies have focused on the use of remotely sensed data as an alternative to traditional field measurements of plant stress parameters providing information about the spatial and temporal variability of crops panigada et al 2014 dangwal et al 2015 in the present study we have measured the spectral reflectance under different treatment to quantify the drought stress impact fig 6 shows the leaf spectral signature under different treatments at different time interval visual interpretation of the mean reflectance spectra of okra under different treatments revealed overlapping and crossing at initial stage i e 25 das fig 6 a of plant development while at 40 das there was a significant different visible in t1 treatment where the plants were under stress in vegetative stage fig 6b conversely at 64 and 71 das there were statistically significant differences at most of the wavebands allowing different treatments to be discriminated easily fig 6c d on the basis of these spectral signatures various spectral indices for illustrative purpose are displayed in fig 7 in general drought stress at various stages of the okra showed significant differences p 0 001 for normalized difference value index ndvi red edge chlorophyll index rci green chlorophyll index gci photochemical reflectance index pri structural independent pigment index sipi leaf area index lai ratio vegetation index rvi simple ratio water index srvi normalized difference water index ndwi and water index wi supplementary table s3 leaf spectral signatures confirmed the drought stress affected the photochemistry of okra and it was stage dependent as observed form different indices such ndvi lai was significantly p 0 001 higher in control and t3 plants compared to t1 t2 and t4 treatment fig 7 similarly t3 treatment plants maintained physiological status and total chlorophyll content as evident form red edge chlorophyll index rci and green chlorohyll index gci xie et al 2016 and it was comparable to control plants fig 7b c photochemical reflectance index pri provides the changes in the epoxidation state of xanthophyll pigments pertaining to non photochemical quenching garbulsky et al 2011 it has been used to detect photosynthetic activity at different scales from plant biochemistry to the canopy level under drought as well as heat stress garbulsky et al 2011 dobrowski et al 2005 steady state chlorophyll fluorescence tracked by pri suggests pri as a more effective indicator of photosynthetic disturbances than other leaf water and pigment based indices our finding for okra under drought stress corroborates previous findings showing strong relationships table 2 between photosynthetic activity and pri subjected to water stress for different plant species ripullone et al 2011 tsonev et al 2014 it also followed a similar trend as in the case of ndvi and lai fig 7d similarly variations in structural independent pigment index sipi peňuelas and filella 1998 reflects corresponding changes in the ratio of carotenoids to chlorophyll indicating the plant s ability for photo protective thermal dissipation by xanthophyll cycle carotenoids pertaining to water status demmig adams and adams 2000 however sipi was less effective than pri in gauging carotenoid concentration fig 7e the results were further confirmed with pearson correlation analysis showing strong association of key leaf spectral traits with other physiological traits table 2 leaf relative water content rwc and membrane stability index msi showed significant p 0 01 positive correlation with ndvi rci gci pri lai and rvi table 2 similar confirmation were obtained for gas exchange traits gs e and a with significant p 0 05 to 0 01 positive correlation with ndvi rci gci pri lai and rvi among different reflectance indices rvi srwi ndwi and wi calculated for plant water status rvi values were significantly p 0 001 higher in control and t3 plants compared to t1 t2 and t4 treatments at 40 64 and 71 das fig 7g on the other hand prominent changes in srwi ndwi and wi values were noticed at 64das fig 7g these differential responses resulted in significant positive relationships between rwc and rvi and between leaf transpiration rate and wi table 2 since all these indices are formulated by several water absorption wavelengths these relationships indicate the consistent sensitivity of rvi and wi to mild or severe drought conditions furthermore these spectral indices show significant correlation to gs and e due to stomatal behavior dependence and transpirational water loss conversely wi was related to e and hence was more sensitive to physiological parameters than other water indices water index wi has been used as one of the most reliable tool in predicting parameters of plant water status serrano et al 2010 marino et al 2014 in our study wi was significantly correlated with leaf transpiration rate r 0 54 p 0 05 table 2 this study confirms the possibility of using spectral signatures to identify stress at particular stages of crops without tedious laboratory analysis for water stress severity duration and timing of stress as well as responses of plants after stress removal and interaction between stress and other factors are extremely important plaut 2003 3 7 effect of drought stress on total dry matter of okra at final harvest dry weight of different plant parts was recorded to understand the biomass partitioning under drought stress total dry weight was significantly p 0 001 reduced under drought stress higher reduction 87 4 over control in total dry weight was found in t1 followed by t4 63 2 t2 53 2 and t3 41 8 compared to control fig 8 the decrease in total weight under drought conditions might be associated with suppression of cell expansion and cell growth due to low turgor pressure sankar et al 2007 dry matter partitioning also revealed that plants under t1 and t4 were not able to provide assimilate supply properly for the structural growth and developing tissues it has already been reported that drought stress not only limits the size of the source and sink tissues but also the phloem loading assimilate translocation and impaired dry matter partitioning however the extent of effects varies with the plant species stage duration and severity of drought farooq et al 2009 in the present study reduction in dry weight of t2 and t4 plants might be largely attributed to leaf dry matter partitioning however stem biomass also contributed to reduction in total plant biomass fig 8 similar reductions in plant dry biomass were observed for eggplants kirnak et al 2001 kiwi fruits chartzoulakis et al 1993 wheat rane et al 2001 pearl millet kusaka et al 2005 peanut nautiyal et al 2002 under drought stress decreased total dry weight in okra under drought stress in t1 treatment was attributed to the considerable decrease in plant growth photosynthesis and canopy structure bhatt and srinivasa rao 2005 3 8 effect of drought stress on number of pods and pod yield of okra studies have reported the effects of water stress on fruit yield reduction for a range of agricultural and horticultural crops such as sorghum chaudhuri and kanemasu 1982 tomato rudich et al 1977 tan 1988 peach tan and buttery 1982 and strawberry kirnak et al 2001 in present study total numbers of pods significantly reduced p 0 001 under drought stress in t2 t3 and t4 treatments pod formation did not commence in t1 stress covering vegetative stage in t4 and t2 treatment reduction in number of pods was 69 2 and 51 9 over control conversely in t3 treatment there was a reduction of 23 1 in number of pods over control plants fig 9 a pod yield was significantly p 0 001 reduced under drought stress treatments fig 9 b maximum reduction 83 7 over control was recorded in t4 treatment followed by t2 55 1 over control in t3 pod fresh weight was lesser with a decrease of 37 9 over control plants fig 9b our study suggests that yield reduction in okra to drought stress was attributed to physiological alteration disturbing plant processes for growth and carbon assimilation at specific growth stage the extent of yield reduction in okra due to moisture stress depends on the phenological age at which the stress is imposed as well as the cultivar mbagwu and adesipe 1987 similar observations were made on cowpeas babalola 1980 and snap beans millar and gardner 1972 drought stress covering vegetative stage might hamper the plant growth and even plant may not commence flowering while in t2 and t4 where stress imposition was during the flowering stage it might have affected flowering or abortion of flowers and pod filling duration with improper biomass partitioning to developing sink conversely t3 treatment plants experienced drought only during late pod filling stage affecting impaired meiotic cell divisions taking place during that stage 4 conclusion drought stress is the one of the most detrimental stress factors governing yield in crop plants including vegetables like okra optimum irrigation at the proper time plays an important role in better growth and yield in okra in present study we found that vegetative flowering as well as early pod filling stage are the sensitive stages to drought stress in okra based on total photosynthetic leaf area membrane damage and overall growth biomass and yield performance stress detection is one of the important aspects for devising water management options for crops in our study we could explore the potential of non destructive leaf spectral measurement as a new tool for detection of stress at particular stage contrary to time consuming conventional soil moisture measurement or destructive plant based measurement of leaf relative water content a strong relationship between leaf spectral reflectance and gas exchange measurement explored the physiological mechanism of reduction in carbon assimilation governed by stomatal limitation at flowering late pod filling stage flowering and vegetative stages under drought stress further dry matter partitioning and yield parameters have reconfirmed that the reduction in pod yield of okra is attributed to poor assimilate transport reduced photosynthetic efficiency and membrane damage to summarize plant based stress detection based on leaf photosynthetic attributes could be utilized for enhancing water use efficiency at specific growth stage and to help in for devising agricultural water management options with
