12845,mismanaged antibiotics ending up in aquatic environment due to inadequate conventional treatment urges the need to develop powerful advanced oxidation techniques in this study hybrid bifunctional rotating drum reactor brdr has been developed and its potency in enhancing the degradation of ciprofloxacin has been demonstrated brdr is a hybrid reactor that integrates photoelectrocatalysis pec and photo electro fenton pef processes with uva irradiation it consists of mos2 tio2 coated carbon cloth as anode and ferrocene functionalized graphene coated graphite felt as cathode brdr system significantly improved the removal efficiency 99 9 as compared to individual efficiencies of pec 71 and pef 78 8 processes an increase in electrode rotation speed significantly

potential from open circuit voltage to 1 5 v improved the removal rate from 0 005 min 1 to 0 040 min 1 the mechanism of reactive oxygen species production in brdr system is elaborated brdr is demonstrated to be cleaner treatment system which excludes the external chemical addition aeration and sludge formation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rotating electrodes hybrid eaop process photoelectrocatalysis photo electro fenton removal of ciprofloxacin mos2 tio2 and ferrocene data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction rampant use of antibiotics in medical and livestock industry illegal disposal of untreated waste and wastewater from municipalities and pharmaceutical manufacturing sectors have been raising serious public health concerns worldwide 1 advanced oxidation processes aops are well demonstrated treatment options for the complete mineralization of a wide variety of persistent organic pollutants through highly reactive and non selective reactive oxygen species ros highly reactive oxygen species can be generated through various aops methods such as chemical photochemical and electrochemical processes 2 5 photocatalysis pc has been extensively studied to removal of persistent organic pollutants from various waters and wastewaters 6 7 in pc tio2 being the photocatalyst absorbs the photons with sufficient energy and promotes the electrons e from valence band to conduction band thus generating holes h subsequently photo excited e h pair move to the surface of the catalyst further as the h comes in contact with water it forms ho which in turn oxidizes the pollutants eqs 1 2 8 however the recombination rate of e h pairs is quite high resulting in the decrease in removal efficiency of the system 9 several researchers report photoelectrocatalysis pec as one of the efficient ways to reduce recombination rates 10 11 this is made possible by applying an external positive potential to the tio2 based photoanode to drive away the conduction band electrons to the cathode 1 tio 2 hυ e cb h 2 h vb h 2 o h o h fenton is also a widely explored aop for the oxidation of organic pollutants 12 ho radicals are generated based on the reaction between the h2o2 and fe2 ions at a ph of 2 03 0 eqs 3 and 4 electro fenton ef process is developed to eliminate the drawbacks of conventional fenton process through i continuous generation of ho radicals via reaction between electrogenerated h2o2 and fe2 ions ii cathodic regeneration of fe2 ions eqs 5 and 6 resulting in reduced sludge formation and increased reaction rate 13 mineralization efficiency of ef process can be significantly enhanced by uv or visible light irradiation this is called as photo electro fenton pef process the enhanced mineralization of contaminants under the irradiation of uv light due to the additional regeneration of fe2 species occurred as given in the eq 7 degradation of carboxylic intermediates eq 8 and decomposition of h2o2 to ho radicals also occurs under the irradiation of uvc 14 15 3 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho ho 4 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ho 2 h 5 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 6 fe 3 e fe 2 7 fe oh 2 hν fe 2 ho 8 fe oocr 2 hν fe 2 co 2 r in pec and pef processes the anode and cathode are the working electrodes respectively 14 16 integrating these two different eaops in a single unit exploits the merits of both these technologies when the anodic potential is applied to photoanode the photoexcited electrons are continuously driven toward cathode that enhances the radical production in both electrodes hence the mineralization of antibiotics can happen on both anode and cathode which could significantly enhance the contaminant removal rates 11 17 18 however the reactor configuration plays a major role in the formation of reactive oxygen species and influences the operational cost of the system 19 20 recently rotating disc electrode systems are being reported to have advantages over conventional static electrode configurations in both pec and pef processes 19 20 in common lower half of the rotating disc electrode is immersed in reaction liquid and the upper half is exposed to air as the disc rotates it promotes the mass transfer reactions due to the formation of thin liquid film which gets revived at the end of every rotation 19 in pec process the formation of thin liquid film on tio2 electrode surface enhances the uv exposure 10 21 in the case of ef the atmospheric o2 molecules tend to adsorb onto the active sites present on the surface of rotating drum electrode and promotes the overall electro generation of h2o2 in the system as it rotates 19 in conventional ef the solubility of o2 is a major limiting factor that affects the efficiency of the system 22 hence the rotating electrode eliminates the external purging of air oxygen into the system with respect to electrodes most researchers have used the disc type electrodes perpendicular to the floor of the reactor which limits the exposure of uv on either side of the tio2 electrode 10 21 in this study in addition to exploiting both anode and cathode for the formation of ros rotating electrode configuration for better mass transfer reactions along with effective uv exposure in the integrated pec pef system is also examined here a bifunctional rotating drum reactor brdr was designed by integrating pec and pef in a single unit and the degradation of ciprofloxacin was investigated mos2 tio2 composite coated carbon cloth was used as anode and ferrocene functionalized graphene coated carbon felt was used as cathode recently mos2 hybridized with tio2 photoanode was shown to exhibit better pec performance due to its improved active sites and enhanced electron transfer ability 23 24 similarly graphene based electrodes have proven to be efficient electro fenton electrodes 25 ferrocene fc is an iron based organometallic compound with high reversible redox properties 26 ferrocene functionalized graphene electrode used in the ef process effectively generates ho radicals and subsequently oxidizes organic contaminants at the surface of the electrode 27 for the above reasons mos2 tio2 composite coated carbon cloth and ferrocene functionalized graphene coated carbon felt have been used as electrodes to enhance the integrated pec pef process influence of rotational speed of electrodes solution ph

was carried out in two steps initially tio2 nanobelts were synthesized through hydrothermal method and later mos2 tio2 composite was formed on the pre synthesized tio2 nanobelts as elaborated in the sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 2 2 1 tio2 nanobelts synthesis tio2 nanobelts were synthesized as the primary source for the synthesis of mos2 hybridized tio2 composite using the synthesis procedure mentioned in liu et al 28 with some modifications 0 65 g of p 25 degussa was dissolved in 100 ml of naoh 10 m by stirring constantly for 30 min the tio2 solution was transferred to a 150 ml capacity teflon lined hydrothermal autoclave and was kept at 180 c for 24 h on cooling the residual powder was washed with hcl until it reached a ph of 7 this was followed by a deionized water wash and absolute ethanol wash and was subsequently placed at 80 c in an oven the synthesized tio2 nanobelts were subjected to a temperature of 600 c for obtaining a dry powder of the catalyst 2 2 2 synthesis

continuous stirring of 30 min it was then transferred into the hydrothermal autoclave and was incubated at 180 c for 24 h subsequently the cooled powder was washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol numerous times and dried at 80 c in an oven for 12 h to obtain mos2 tio2 composite 2 3 fabrication of photoanode the synthesized mos2 tio2 composite was ground into a fine powder and 2 g of it was weighed and dispersed in 100 ml absolute ethanol by ultrasonication 0 2 g of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe was added to the dispersion as a binder the fine dispersion was coated on the carbon cloth 10 30 cm2 by means of dip coating followed by heating and this was repeated ten times thereafter it was calcinated at 300 c for 60 min consequently the mos2 tio2 composite coated carbon cloth was fixed around the electrode drum and was ready to use for experiments 2 4 fabrication of cathode ferrocene functionalized graphene oxide was synthesized following the protocol given by divyapriya et al 27 fc go 2 g was dispersed well in 100 ml ethanol ptfe was added as the binder with a ratio of 10 1 w w the graphite felt 10 30 cm2 was dip coated with fc go dispersion followed by heating at 100 c this was repeated for ten times fc go coated graphite felt was electrochemically reduced at a constant applied potential mode in a rotating drum reactor details of the electrode and reactor configuration are given in the section 2 5 plain carbon cloth was used anode 10 30 cm2 and ag agcl was employed as reference electrode a potential of 1 5 v was applied across the electrodes for 30 min 100 mm of ph 7 0 phosphate buffer solution was used as the electrolyte the rotational speed of the drum was set to 30 rpm the resulted electrode ferrocene functionalized electrochemically reduced graphene oxide fc ergo coated graphite felt is used as cathode material in the cip degradation experiments 2 5 reactor configuration the hybrid brdr reactor was fabricated at heber scientific chennai india the schematic representation of the designed reactor is given in fig 1a along with the detailed labeling of all the parts of the brdr reactor the inside view of the brdr reactor is given in fig 1b the reaction tank containing reaction solution was made up of a rectangular shaped poly methyl methacrylate pmma thermoplastic polymer sheet with the dimensions of 20 10 15 cm3 the working volume of the reactor was 1 5 l the above prepared electrode materials were wrapped on two non conductive pmma cylinders drums with a diameter and length of 10 cm and 15 cm respectively mos2 tio2 coated carbon cloth wrapped drum was used as anode and the fc ergo coated graphite felt wrapped drum was employed as cathode the distance between the drum electrodes was 2 25 cm a motor connecting to the drums controlled the rotational speed of the electrodes both the drums were operated with the same rotational speed ranging from 0 to 60 rpm in experiments probing the effect of rotational speed 20 40 60 rpm on removal efficiency the rpm of both drums was increased commensurately during the reaction half of the drums were submerged in electrolyte and the other half was open to atmospheric air a stainless steel plate ss 316 of thickness 1 mm and length 15 cm was used to provide electrical contact to the drums three 8 w uva lamps with a wavelength of 365 nm were used for pc pec and hybrid systems the lamps were kept at 10 cm from top of the drums two cooling fans were placed on two sides of the reactor to ensure that the temperature of the reaction solution does not increase significantly due to uv lamps during the process and enables effective air exchange into the system 2 6 degradation experiments degradation of ciprofloxacin was studied to understand the feasibility of the integrated brdr pec pef hybrid system and to compare it with pc pec tio2 mos2 tio2 ef and pef gf fc ergo processes 0 05 m na2so4 was used as the electrolyte for all experiments specified potential was given through potentiostat biologic inc during the degradation process to eliminate the effect of adsorption the electrodes were saturated with ciprofloxacin at the start of every experiment 2 7 analysis ciprofloxacin was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with c18 reverse phase column and uv detector dinoex usa mobile phase was consisting of 80 of 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 4 and 20 of acetonitrile solvent flow rate and detection wavelength was fixed to be 1 5 ml min 1 and 280 nm scanning electron microscopy sem images of pure tio2 nanobelts and mos2 tio2 composite was performed using feg quanta 400 and elemental analysis was performed using bruker x flash 6i10 x ray powder diffraction xrd of tio2 and mos2 tio2 composite was analyzed using bruker d8 mos2 tio2 composite coated carbon cloth was subjected to thermogravimetric analysis tga to understand the change in weight before and after treatment tga was performed in the temperature

laser at the wavelength of 532 nm electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was performed on i plain carbon cloth ii tio2 coated carbon cloth and iii mos2 tio2 coated carbon cloth to understand the level of electrical conductivity of the electrode materials cyclic voltammetry cv linear sweep voltammetry lsv and eis studies were performed using a three electrode electrochemical system consisting of pt anode as prepared cathodes and ag agcl reference electrode 0 05 m na2so4 was used as the electrolyte solution 100 ml for cv and lsv studies and 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 in 1 m kcl was used as electrolyte solution for eis studies the above electrochemical studies were conducted using a potentiostat pgstat 100 characterization of fc go nanocomposite and the electrode has been elaborately discussed in our previous studies 27 29 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the electrode materials fig 2a shows the cyclic voltammogram obtained due to the result of electrochemical reduction of oxygen functional groups presented on fc ergo electrode it indicates that the oxygen functional groups of fc go were successfully reduced to gain its electrical property along with recovery of its π bonding system which could enhance the specific capacitance owing to the rapid diffusion of ionic species at electrode electrolyte interface the redox peak observed on the cyclic voltammetric curve shows that ferrocene can effectively involve in the electron transfer reactions to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species ros 27 lsv was carried out to understand the fc ergo electrode ability to perform the two electron oxygen reduction reaction for producing hydrogen peroxide fig 2b shows a strong reduction peak at 0 64 v indicating oxygen reduction reactions are effective around the potential and further increase in potential could also involve other side reactions such as reduction of h2o2 h and h2o molecules at acidic condition 30 the sem images of pure tio2 nanobelts low and high magnification mos2 tio2 heterojunction structure low and high magnification and energy dispersive x ray edx image of mos2 tio2 composite are presented in fig s1 as seen from figs s1 a and b the pure tio2 nanobelts have a relatively uniform morphology with a smooth surface texture the mos2 tio2 heterojunction structures are not uniform in size and have an uneven surface figs s1 c and d some of the mos2 nanoparticles have self assembled to form mos2 microspheres the elemental mapping of mos2 tio2 composite is presented in figs s1 e and f the spatial distribution of mo clearly indicates the fact that mos2 is homogeneously distributed across the tio2 matrix the sem images of pure tio2 nanobelts low and high magnification mos2 tio2 heterojunction structure low and high magnification and energy dispersive x ray edx image of mos2 tio2 composite are presented in fig s1 as seen from figs s1 a and b the pure tio2 nanobelts have a relatively uniform morphology with a smooth surface texture the mos2 tio2 heterojunction structures are not uniform in size and have an uneven surface figs s1 c and d some of the mos2 nanoparticles have self assembled to form mos2 microspheres the elemental mapping of mos2 tio2 composite is presented in figs s1 e and f the spatial distribution of mo clearly indicates the fact that mos2 is homogeneously distributed across the tio2 matrix xrd patterns of tio2 red curve and mos2 tio2 blue curve are presented in fig 2c x ray diffraction peaks were found in the tio2 curve for the crystal planes 101 004 200 105 211 204 and 116 of tio2 these diffraction peaks were also found in mos2 tio2 curve which confirmed that the tio2 structures were not destroyed in addition there were a few diffraction peaks characteristic of mos2 for the crystal planes 100 106 and 110 this confirms that mos2 has been successfully incorporated in the mos2 tio2 composite that was synthesized fig 2d shows the nyquist plot and the equivalent circuit obtained using randle s circuit model faradaic impedance refers to i an active charge transfer resistance represented by rct and ii a warburg element w the diameter of the semicircle is equal to the faradaic charge transfer resistance mos2 tio2 coated carbon cloth shows higher conductivity due to a more efficient charge transfer process this can be attributed to the favorable charge transfer property of mos2 tio2 3 2 removal of ciprofloxacin in pc pec ef pef and brdr system ciprofloxacin degradation experiments were carried out through different processes such as pc pec tio2 mos2 tio2 ef pef gf fc ergo and brdr pec pef hybrid system to understand the performance of the system in real conditions degradation experiments were conducted in neutral ph as shown in fig 3a and b there was no significant removal observed in experiments conducted in the absence of uva illumination and catalysts tio2 mos2 tio2 and in the case of experiments conducted in the absence of external applied voltage and fc ergo pc process showed degradation efficiencies of 40 1 and 54 2 for tio2 and mos2 tio2 catalysts respectively pec process with tio2 photoanode and plain graphite felt counter electrode showed 56 1 removal efficiency and mos2 tio2 based photoanode exhibited 71 removal efficiency in neutral ph fig 3a mos2 acts as the co catalyst which helps in trapping the photo excited electrons and efficiently transfers them to the counter electrode via the conductive carbon cloth supporting matrix 31 thus the mos2 assisted pec process enhances the overall contaminant removal efficiency by about 1 26 times compared to tio2 assisted pec process ef system with fc ergo coated graphite felt electrode showed up to 69 3 removal efficiency at neutral ph ferrocene functionalized graphene acts as an active redox species which catalyzes the formation of ho radicals through the decomposition of h2o2 molecules due to enhanced charge transfer rate in the case of pef system enhancement in the removal efficiency of ciprofloxacin up to 78 8 was achieved under irradiation of uva light fig 3b during the uva irradiation fe3 containing ferrocenium molecule fc is converted to fe2 containing fc through photoregeneration resulting in increased production of ho radicals thus enhanced the removal rate the hybrid system comprises of pef and pec units tio2 photoanode with fc ergo coated graphite felt counter electrode showed 99 3 removal in 180 min at ph 7 0 and 1 5 v mos2 tio2 photoanode and fc ergo cathode based brdr system showed 99 5 removal in 120 min fig 3c for different systems namely pc pec ef pef and brdr ciprofloxacin removal efficiency and respective pseudo first order kinetic rate constants were estimated fig 3d for tio2 fc ergo based brdr system the rate constant was found to be 0 026 min 1 with the regression coefficient r2 of 0 982 similarly mos2 tio2 fc ergo based brdr system exhibited the highest rate constant 0 04 min 1 with the regression coefficient r2 of 0 984 it was 6 times higher than the mos2 tio2 photoanode pec system 0 007 min 1 and 4 times higher than pef system 0 009 min 1 the improvement in degradation rate confirms the existence of synergistic effects in the hybrid pec and pef processes resulted due to the enhancement in the production of reactive oxygen species at photoanode the photoexcited electrons from the photoanode is transferred to the cathode which reduces the recombination rate of e h pair thus increasing the radical generation at cathode radical generation is enhanced because of combined ef reactions along with the additional photoregeneration of ferrocene through uva irradiation removal of toc in pc pec ef pef and brdr systems was studied fig 4a mos2 tio2 composite based pc and pec systems showed the toc removal efficiency of 25 3 and 42 7 respectively similarly enhanced mineralization was observed in fc ergo based pef process 52 9 compared to ef process 41 4 the change in the concentration of ciprofloxacin in the system was also qualitatively studied using uv visible spectrophotometry fig 4b a spectrum scan was performed between 200 and 450 nm for water samples sampled at 0 30 60 90 120 and 180 min of reaction maximum absorbance wavelength λmax was found to be at λ 280 nm significant decrease in the absorbance with time at λmax indicated the degradation of ciprofloxacin 3 3 effect of rotational speed of electrode as previously mentioned both pef and pec systems could be strongly influenced by the electrode rotation speed the electrode rotation speed plays a key role in accelerating mass transfer phenomenon the mass transfer rate increases with increasing rotation speed until the optimum level is reached 10 in the case of pec when the speed of the drum electrode is less than the optimum value the water thin film formed on the electrode will be insufficient to provide enough contaminant for the oxidation at the rate which is equal or more than the oxidation capacity of the pec process 10 in pef process when rotation speed of the electrode is increased it enhances more diffusion of oxygen to the liquid film of the cathode surface and the uniform irradiation of uv on cathode increases the photoregeneration of fe2 in ferrocene when the upper part of the electrode touches the liquid portion it produces high amount of h2o2 thus the contaminant oxidation rate of the system is improved furthermore an optimum rotational speed is required to prevent the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide on anode by isolating it in the liquid thin film of the upper region of the electrode 19 in the brdr system both the phenomenona are likely to happen on the respective electrodes fig 5a and b shows that when the rotational speed of the electrode was increased from 0 to 40 rpm the removal rate was increased from 0 002 min 1 to 0 040 min 1 when the rotational speed was increased further from 40 rpm to 60 rpm reaction rate was increased to 0 059 min 1 for 60 rpm therefore 40 rpm was chosen as optimum for the brdr system the overall brdr reaction is influenced by uv illumination and mass transfer phenomena the enhancement in the degradation is achieved due to the following bifunctional drum reactions i uniform uv irradiation on the surface of the liquid thin film enhances photocatalytic degradation ii mos2 tio2 anode improves the electron transfer rate iii rotating drum electrodes enhance atmospheric oxygen adsorption on the cathode surface iv fc ergo cathode generates more reactive oxygen species due to effective redox reactions v uniform uv irradiation on cathode enhances the additional photoregeneration of fe2 in ferrocene and vi degradation products of ciprofloxacin removed and new ciprofloxacin contaminants are adsorbed on each rotation with the maximum contaminant load on the liquid thin film 3 4 effect of initial ph solution ph is an important factor for obtaining the maximum removal efficiency since it directly influences the generation of reactive oxygen species experiments were conducted at initial ph 3 5 7 and 9 fig 5c shows the removal efficiency and the kinetic rate constants obtained in brdr system at different ph the maximum removal rate was achieved at ph 3 0 0 061 min 1 followed by 5 0 0501 min 1 7 0 041 min 1 and 9 0 020 min 1 the removal efficiency was found to be 99 98 at ph 3 99 96 at ph 7 and 98 at ph 9 at 180 min at different ph physico chemical properties of ciprofloxacin also vary thus significantly influencing the removal process ciprofloxacin has two pka values 6 08 and 8 74 which are corresponding to two different functional groups namely carboxylic acid and amine groups respectively 32 at ph 3 ciprofloxacin acts as positively charged species and at ph 9 it possesses negative charge hence the charged species could be electrosorbed to the oppositely charged electrodes and subsequently the compounds which are adsorbed electrosorbed on the surface of electrode will be oxidized through the pec pef mechanism 33 the predominant removal mechanism of ciprofloxacin at ph 3 could be the pef process via the negatively charged cathode based oxidation it is a well known fact that optimum condition for the removal of contaminants for pef is acidic since more h ions are available for the formation of h2o2 moreover h2o2 is highly unstable at alkaline condition it decomposes to form water and oxygen 12 however complete removal efficiency was achieved even at neutral condition at ph 9 a removal efficiency of 91 was observed at 120 min of reaction period and 98 was reached in 180 min overall brdr system reduces the ph sensitiveness of the conventional pef and pec systems moreover it reduces the necessity of adjusting the ph of the system before the start of every cycle of treatment process 3 5 effect of applied potential effect of applied potential was studied at open circuit voltage ocv 1 0 1 5 and 2 5 v increase in applied potential from ocv to 1 5 v drastically improved the efficiency of degradation from 45 to 99 5 at 120 min and their corresponding rate constants from 0 005 min 1 to 0 040 min 1 fig 5d further increase of potential from 1 5 v to 2 5 v exhibited relatively less change in the rate constants from 0 040 min 1 to 0 048 min 1 however 99 9 removal efficiency was achieved both in the case of 1 5 v and 2 5 v in case of ocv and 1 0 v 55 6 and 97 removal efficiencies were obtained respectively in pec the main role of applied potential is to reduce the recombination rate of the photo excited e h pair by driving the electrons to the counter electrode which in turn enhances the removal rate hence the further increase in applied potential does not create a significant impact on the removal rate 34 in the case of pef increasing the applied potential accelerates electron transfer reactions to generate h2o2 through the two electron oxygen reduction reaction which in turn enhances the rate of removal furthermore it mediates the ferrocene redox reactions to produce ho radicals for the oxidation of ciprofloxacin however when the applied potential is further increased other electrochemical side reactions such as h2 gas evolution eq 9 and four electron reduction of o2 which produces h2o molecules instead of h2o2 eq 10 could take place which reduces the removal efficiency 22 hence the integrated brdr process involves complicated combined reactions of both pec and pef processes 9 2 h 2 e h 2 10 o 2 4 h 4 e h 2 o 3 6 effect of initial concentration of ciprofloxacin and uva light intensity the effect of initial concentration was studied at different concentrations of ciprofloxacin 10 20 50 and 70 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency was found to be 99 9 99 9 62 48 for 10 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 and 70 mg l 1 of ciprofloxacin respectively fig 5e it is an evident fact that more ho radicals are required for the oxidation of higher concentrations of contaminants however the removal of ciprofloxacin mainly happens through the mass transfer enhanced liquid thin film mechanism the main advantage of this configuration being removal of contaminants increases with increase in concentration until it reaches the maximum load onto the electrode surface 10 when the initial concentration of ciprofloxacin was increased from 10 to 70 mg l 1 the removal rate was getting declined since it requires more radicals for the oxidation of contaminants the amount of ciprofloxacin removed was estimated to be 14 24 mg for 10 mg l 1 29 86 mg for 20 mg l 1 49 5 mg for 50 mg l 1and 55 5 mg for 70 mg l 1 at varied initial concentrations the influence of uv illumination intensity on the brdr based degradation process was studied by varying the number of lamps fig 5f in the case of one uva lamp light intensity is 8 w when the number of lamps used was two and three the light intensity was represented as 16 w and 24 w respectively an increase in the light intensity increased the degradation rate evidently the degradation efficiency was found to be 69 3 for ef process in the case of pef the degradation efficiency was observed to be 80 6 for 8 w 0 01 min 1 97 1 for 16 w 0 019 min 1 and 99 7 for 24 w 0 040 min 1 the increase in light intensity by adding the lamps directly increases the photoenergy of the system as the photoenergy increased the generation of reactive oxygen species through pec and pef processes was enhanced since the hybrid system basically depends on both pec and pef system the influence of the photoenergy on the degradation rate is a significant factor table 1 represents the summary of various experimental conditions and their removal efficiency and kinetic rate constants 3 7 radical estimation in hybrid pec and pef degradation ros are primarily of ho and o2 it is important to understand the mechanism of formation of key ros involved in the oxidation process the concentration of hydroxyl radicals was estimated using dmso as ho radical trapping agent and analyzed by hplc due to the reaction between dmso and ho radicals formaldehyde hcho is formed in the presence of dnph derivatizing agent hcho subsequently forms hydrazone hcho dnph that was quantified using hplc the concentration of hydroxyl radicals was estimated to be 544 μm for ph 3 0 357 μm for ph 7 0 and 221 μm for ph 9 0 fig 6a fig 6b shows the hplc chromatogram obtained during dmso based ho radicals estimation peak observed at retention time 4 7 min is corresponding to dnph whereas peak observed at 7 2 min is corresponding to hcho dnph adduct the peak area of the hcho dnph adduct was found to be higher than dnph due to the conversion of dnph into hydrazone hcho dnph occurred because of the reaction between dmso and ho radicals to understand the contribution of ho and o2 radicals at acidic and neutral ph condition radicals scavenging chemicals were used isopropanol was used as ho radical scavenger 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 35 and ethanol was used as the scavenger of both ho and o2 radicals 36 series of experiments were carried out in both ph 3 0 and 7 0 with and without radical scavengers during the integrated process of pec and pef these radical scavengers were added in the range of 103 higher than the ciprofloxacin concentration 35 fig 6c shows that in ph 3 0 72 and 81 9 inhibition was observed with addition of isopropanol and ethanol respectively similarly at ph 7 0 44 and 78 inhibition were observed with addition of isopropanol and ethanol respectively it represents that both the radicals contributed to oxidation however ho radicals primarily contribute at acidic medium likewise o2 radicals majorly contributes at neutral medium 3 8 mechanism of oxidation of ciprofloxacin in brdr system the possible degradation mechanism for the removal of ciprofloxacin using the integrated bifunctional rotating electrode system is proposed in this section fig 7 removal of ciprofloxacin happens through multiple pathways such as adsorption photolysis photocatalysis photoelectrocatalysis and electro fenton the proposed photoelectrocatalytic oxidation through the charge transfer mechanism of mos2 tio2 anode is given in fig 7 tio2 has two major shortcomings i large optical band gap 3 2 ev limiting its operation under the visible region and in field applications and ii rapid recombination rate of electron hole pairs resulting in ineffective ho generation 37 mos2 on the other hand has a much smaller energy band gap 1 9 ev as compared to tio2 38 when mos2 tio2 is irradiated by light the electrons in the valence band get excited to the conduction band further tio2 acts as photoelectronic receiver since the conduction band of tio2 is lower than that of mos2 hence the electrons from the conduction band of mos2 are transferred to that of tio2 the holes generated in the valence band of mos2 are trapped right there this enables in the efficient separation of electrons and holes thus preventing recombination 28 the other advantage of mos2 tio2 composite is that due to its smaller band gap the electrons get transferred to the conduction band forming electron hole pairs with lower external energies as compared to plain tio2 these separated electron hole pairs e h can participate in redox reactions on the surface of the electrode furthermore the electrons from the surface of mos2 are transferred to the cathode 39 when ciprofloxacin cip comes in contact with the light induced hvb it gets oxidized into intermediate products cipox as per the eq 11 as a side reaction superoxide o2 can be produced when the photoexcited electrons encounter oxygen molecules eq 12 superoxide can involve in the following sequential reactions to produce other reactive oxygen species such as h2o2 and ho as represented in the eqs 13 15 which in turn

graphene cathode is hypothesized to happen as given initially the atmospheric o2 molecules get adsorbed on the surface of the cathode the oxygen functional groups of rgo act as active site to form h2o2 through the two electron oxygen reduction reaction once h2o2 is generated in the system it is subsequently transformed into ho in reaction with the ferrocene catalyst as given in eq 16 27 29 fe2 containing fc get converted to fe3 containing fc in reaction with h2o2 and generate ho radicals 42 subsequently fc get reduced to fc through the one electron reduction reaction because of its reversible redox nature eqs 17 and 18 and partially can be regenerated through the reaction with h2o2 43 further uniform irradiation of uv light on the surface of cathode could contribute to the photoregeneration of fc with fe2 from fc with fe3 as given in the eq 19 in addition photo assisted decomposition of electrogenerated h2o2 into ho radicals can also occur due to the uv irradiation eq

radicals subsequently moreover the degraded products get desorbed from the electrode and adsorb the new ciprofloxacin for further degradation in a continuous manner schematic explaining the enhanced mass transfer and oxidation process in the brdr system is given in fig 7b enhancement in degradation efficiencies can be attributed to some of the salient features of brdr that include i formation of a thin contaminant film on the electrode surfaces ii uniform uv exposure and effective penetration of uv light due to the thin film formation iii improved electron transfer rate and reduced recombination rate due to the mos2 tio2 anode iv generation of more reactive oxygen species due to effective redox reactions facilitated by the fc ergo cathode v the rotating drum electrode design that enhances the adsorption of atmospheric oxygen on the electrode and hence improves surface and bulk dominated degradation vi uniform uv irradiation on cathode enhances additional photo regeneration of fe2 in ferrocene vii the synergy caused by the integrated electrochemical system enhances overall reaction efficiency through improved ros production 3 9 electrode reusability study to study the reactivity and stability of the electrode materials in multiple runs the degradation experiments were carried out as conventional pec and pef processes independently not in combination pec system comprised of mos2 tio2 anode and graphite felt cathode operated under uv illumination and 1 5 v applied potential pef system consist of plain carbon cloth anode and fc ergo graphite felt cathode 1 5 v of applied potential was given without uv illumination degradation studies were repeated five times with both pec and pef systems fig 8a the change in removal efficiency from the first cycle to fifth cycle was found to be less than 3 and 5 for pec and pef systems respectively it shows that the electrodes are highly active and stable moreover there is no sludge formation in the system fig 8b shows the raman spectra of fc ergo electrode obtained before and after the treatment spectrum for fc ergo consists of disordered d and graphitic g peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1589 cm 1 respectively the ratio of d g peak intensity was estimated to be 1 31 for fresh fc ergo electrode whereas fc ergo electrode after five cycles of treatment showed 1 35 it represents that there is an increase in disorder however it does not significantly impact the removal efficiency tga studies the mass difference with respect to temperature and provides a picture about decomposition temperature decomposition reactions absorbed moisture content and in some cases composition and purity of sample the before and after treatment tg curves displayed four stages as described below the mass difference incurred when the sample was subjected to temperatures ranging from i room temperature up to 150 c can be attributed to loss of moisture ii 150 to 250 c can be due to loss of lower molecular weight compounds iii 250 500 c can be associated to onset of thermal decomposition and iv 500 c and above results in combustion of carbon finally at the temperature of 700 c metal oxides or inorganic salt residue ashes remained the total mass difference in the case of the electrode before and after treatment was differed by 2 4 mass difference the mass gain in the electrode after treatment can be attributed to difference in absorption of moisture otherwise there was no significant difference in the mass of electrode indicating its robustness and reusability fig 8c 4 conclusion a hybrid bifunctional rotating drum electrode system comprising pec and pef units equipped with mos2 tio2 composite coated carbon cloth as photoanode and ferrocene functionalized graphene coated carbon felt as the cathode was shown to offer efficient and synergistic performance for the removal of ciprofloxacin this system significantly enhanced the removal efficiency due to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species across a wider ph range the ciprofloxacin degradation efficiency of the brdr system was compared with stand alone pec and pef processes and was found that the brdr 99 9 outweighed both pec 71 and pef 78 8 stand alone processes increase in electrode rotation speed significantly enhanced the removal rate without external aeration from 0 002 min 1 fixed electrode to 0 059 min 1 60 rpm enhancement in degradation efficiencies can be attributed because of improved overall mass transfer uniform uv exposure improved electron transfer rate and generation of more reactive oxygen species due to effective redox reactions the removal across all the systems followed the order pc with mos2 tio2 ef with fc ergo pec with mos2 tio2 pef with fc ergo brdr pec pef the mechanism of mos2 as a co catalyst and the role of fc ergo in effective redox reactions both leading to enhanced ho generation and hence higher degradation efficiency along with uva irradiation has been elaborated along with possible ciprofloxacin degradation pathways the change in removal efficiency from the first cycle to fifth cycle shows minor reduction in removal efficiency

12845,mismanaged antibiotics ending up in aquatic environment due to inadequate conventional treatment urges the need to develop powerful advanced oxidation techniques in this study hybrid bifunctional rotating drum reactor brdr has been developed and its potency in enhancing the degradation of ciprofloxacin has been demonstrated brdr is a hybrid reactor that integrates photoelectrocatalysis pec and photo electro fenton pef processes with uva irradiation it consists of mos2 tio2 coated carbon cloth as anode and ferrocene functionalized graphene coated graphite felt as cathode brdr system significantly improved the removal efficiency 99 9 as compared to individual efficiencies of pec 71 and pef 78 8 processes an increase in electrode rotation speed significantly enhanced the removal without external aeration 0 059 min 1 for 60 rpm maximum removal rate was achieved at ph 3 0 061 min 1 followed by 7 0 040 min 1 and 9 0 020 min 1 the increase in applied potential from open circuit voltage to 1 5 v improved the removal rate from 0 005 min 1 to 0 040 min 1 the mechanism of reactive oxygen species production in brdr system is elaborated brdr is demonstrated to be cleaner treatment system which excludes the external chemical addition aeration and sludge formation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rotating electrodes hybrid eaop process photoelectrocatalysis photo electro fenton removal of ciprofloxacin mos2 tio2 and ferrocene data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction rampant use of antibiotics in medical and livestock industry illegal disposal of untreated waste and wastewater from municipalities and pharmaceutical manufacturing sectors have been raising serious public health concerns worldwide 1 advanced oxidation processes aops are well demonstrated treatment options for the complete mineralization of a wide variety of persistent organic pollutants through highly reactive and non selective reactive oxygen species ros highly reactive oxygen species can be generated through various aops methods such as chemical photochemical and electrochemical processes 2 5 photocatalysis pc has been extensively studied to removal of persistent organic pollutants from various waters and wastewaters 6 7 in pc tio2 being the photocatalyst absorbs the photons with sufficient energy and promotes the electrons e from valence band to conduction band thus generating holes h subsequently photo excited e h pair move to the surface of the catalyst further as the h comes in contact with water it forms ho which in turn oxidizes the pollutants eqs 1 2 8 however the recombination rate of e h pairs is quite high resulting in the decrease in removal efficiency of the system 9 several researchers report photoelectrocatalysis pec as one of the efficient ways to reduce recombination rates 10 11 this is made possible by applying an external positive potential to the tio2 based photoanode to drive away the conduction band electrons to the cathode 1 tio 2 hυ e cb h 2 h vb h 2 o h o h fenton is also a widely explored aop for the oxidation of organic pollutants 12 ho radicals are generated based on the reaction between the h2o2 and fe2 ions at a ph of 2 03 0 eqs 3 and 4 electro fenton ef process is developed to eliminate the drawbacks of conventional fenton process through i continuous generation of ho radicals via reaction between electrogenerated h2o2 and fe2 ions ii cathodic regeneration of fe2 ions eqs 5 and 6 resulting in reduced sludge formation and increased reaction rate 13 mineralization efficiency of ef process can be significantly enhanced by uv or visible light irradiation this is called as photo electro fenton pef process the enhanced mineralization of contaminants under the irradiation of uv light due to the additional regeneration of fe2 species occurred as given in the eq 7 degradation of carboxylic intermediates eq 8 and decomposition of h2o2 to ho radicals also occurs under the irradiation of uvc 14 15 3 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho ho 4 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ho 2 h 5 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 6 fe 3 e fe 2 7 fe oh 2 hν fe 2 ho 8 fe oocr 2 hν fe 2 co 2 r in pec and pef processes the anode and cathode are the working electrodes respectively 14 16 integrating these two different eaops in a single unit exploits the merits of both these technologies when the anodic potential is applied to photoanode the photoexcited electrons are continuously driven toward cathode that enhances the radical production in both electrodes hence the mineralization of antibiotics can happen on both anode and cathode which could significantly enhance the contaminant removal rates 11 17 18 however the reactor configuration plays a major role in the formation of reactive oxygen species and influences the operational cost of the system 19 20 recently rotating disc electrode systems are being reported to have advantages over conventional static electrode configurations in both pec and pef processes 19 20 in common lower half of the rotating disc electrode is immersed in reaction liquid and the upper half is exposed to air as the disc rotates it promotes the mass transfer reactions due to the formation of thin liquid film which gets revived at the end of every rotation 19 in pec process the formation of thin liquid film on tio2 electrode surface enhances the uv exposure 10 21 in the case of ef the atmospheric o2 molecules tend to adsorb onto the active sites present on the surface of rotating drum electrode and promotes the overall electro generation of h2o2 in the system as it rotates 19 in conventional ef the solubility of o2 is a major limiting factor that affects the efficiency of the system 22 hence the rotating electrode eliminates the external purging of air oxygen into the system with respect to electrodes most researchers have used the disc type electrodes perpendicular to the floor of the reactor which limits the exposure of uv on either side of the tio2 electrode 10 21 in this study in addition to exploiting both anode and cathode for the formation of ros rotating electrode configuration for better mass transfer reactions along with effective uv exposure in the integrated pec pef system is also examined here a bifunctional rotating drum reactor brdr was designed by integrating pec and pef in a single unit and the degradation of ciprofloxacin was investigated mos2 tio2 composite coated carbon cloth was used as anode and ferrocene functionalized graphene coated carbon felt was used as cathode recently mos2 hybridized with tio2 photoanode was shown to exhibit better pec performance due to its improved active sites and enhanced electron transfer ability 23 24 similarly graphene based electrodes have proven to be efficient electro fenton electrodes 25 ferrocene fc is an iron based organometallic compound with high reversible redox properties 26 ferrocene functionalized graphene electrode used in the ef process effectively generates ho radicals and subsequently oxidizes organic contaminants at the surface of the electrode 27 for the above reasons mos2 tio2 composite coated carbon cloth and ferrocene functionalized graphene coated carbon felt have been used as electrodes to enhance the integrated pec pef process influence of rotational speed of electrodes solution ph applied potential initial concentration of the contaminant and uva light intensity was studied in the hybrid brdr system electrode reuse experiments were performed to understand the catalytic

was carried out in two steps initially tio2 nanobelts were synthesized through hydrothermal method and later mos2 tio2 composite was formed on the pre synthesized tio2 nanobelts as elaborated in the sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 2 2 1 tio2 nanobelts synthesis tio2 nanobelts were synthesized as the primary source for the synthesis of mos2 hybridized tio2 composite using the synthesis procedure mentioned in liu et al 28 with some modifications 0 65 g of p 25 degussa was dissolved in 100 ml of naoh 10 m by stirring constantly for 30 min the tio2 solution was transferred to a 150 ml capacity teflon lined hydrothermal autoclave and was kept at 180 c for 24 h on cooling the residual powder was washed with hcl until it reached a ph of 7 this was followed by a deionized water wash and absolute ethanol wash and was subsequently placed at 80 c in an oven the synthesized tio2 nanobelts were subjected to a temperature of 600 c for obtaining a dry powder of the catalyst 2 2 2 synthesis

continuous stirring of 30 min it was then transferred into the hydrothermal autoclave and was incubated at 180 c for 24 h subsequently the cooled powder was washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol numerous times and dried at 80 c in an oven for 12 h to obtain mos2 tio2 composite 2 3 fabrication of photoanode the synthesized mos2 tio2 composite was ground into a fine powder and 2 g of it

10 30 cm2 by means of dip coating followed by heating and this was repeated ten times thereafter it was calcinated at 300 c for 60 min consequently the mos2 tio2 composite coated carbon cloth was fixed around the electrode drum and was ready to use for experiments 2 4 fabrication of cathode ferrocene functionalized graphene oxide was synthesized following the protocol given by divyapriya et al 27 fc go 2 g was dispersed well in 100 ml ethanol ptfe was added as the binder with a ratio of 10 1 w w the graphite felt 10 30 cm2 was dip coated with fc go dispersion followed by heating at 100 c this was repeated for ten times fc go coated graphite felt was electrochemically reduced at a constant applied potential mode in a rotating drum reactor details of the electrode and reactor

100 mm of ph 7 0 phosphate buffer solution was used as the electrolyte the rotational speed of the drum was set to 30 rpm the resulted electrode ferrocene functionalized electrochemically reduced graphene oxide fc ergo coated graphite felt is used as cathode material in the cip degradation experiments 2 5 reactor configuration the hybrid brdr reactor was fabricated at heber scientific chennai india the schematic representation of the designed reactor is given in fig 1a along with the detailed labeling of all the parts of the brdr reactor the inside view of the brdr reactor is given in fig 1b the reaction tank containing reaction solution was made up of a rectangular shaped poly methyl methacrylate pmma thermoplastic polymer sheet with the dimensions of 20 10 15 cm3 the working volume of the reactor was 1 5 l the above prepared electrode materials were wrapped on two non conductive pmma cylinders drums with a diameter and length of 10 cm and 15 cm respectively mos2 tio2 coated carbon cloth wrapped drum was used as anode and the fc ergo coated graphite felt wrapped drum was employed as cathode the distance between the drum electrodes was 2 25 cm a motor connecting to the drums controlled the rotational speed of the electrodes both the drums were operated with the same rotational speed ranging from 0 to 60 rpm in experiments probing the effect of rotational speed 20 40 60 rpm on removal efficiency the rpm of both drums was increased commensurately during the reaction half of the drums were submerged in electrolyte and the other half was open to atmospheric air a stainless steel plate ss 316 of thickness 1 mm and length 15 cm was used to provide electrical contact to the drums three 8 w uva lamps with a wavelength of 365 nm were used for pc pec and hybrid systems the lamps were kept at 10 cm from top of the drums two cooling fans were placed on two sides of the reactor to ensure that the temperature of the reaction solution does not increase significantly due to uv lamps during the process and enables effective air exchange into the system 2 6 degradation experiments degradation of ciprofloxacin was studied to understand the feasibility of the integrated brdr pec pef hybrid system and to compare it with pc pec tio2 mos2 tio2 ef and pef gf fc ergo processes 0 05 m na2so4 was used as the electrolyte for all experiments specified potential was given through potentiostat biologic inc during the degradation process to eliminate the effect of adsorption the electrodes were saturated with ciprofloxacin at the start of every experiment 2 7 analysis ciprofloxacin was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with c18 reverse phase column and uv detector dinoex usa mobile phase was consisting of 80 of 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 4 and 20 of acetonitrile solvent flow rate and detection wavelength was fixed to be 1 5 ml min 1 and 280 nm scanning electron microscopy sem images of pure tio2 nanobelts and mos2 tio2 composite was performed using feg quanta 400 and elemental analysis was performed using bruker x flash 6i10 x ray powder diffraction xrd of tio2 and mos2 tio2 composite was analyzed using bruker d8 mos2 tio2 composite coated carbon cloth was subjected to thermogravimetric analysis tga to understand the change in weight before and after treatment tga was performed in the temperature range starting from room temperature up to 700 c in nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 perkin elmer tga7 raman spectroscopic studies were performed using witec alpha 300 nd yag laser at the wavelength of 532 nm electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was performed on i plain carbon cloth ii tio2 coated carbon cloth and iii mos2 tio2 coated carbon cloth to understand the level of electrical conductivity of the electrode materials cyclic voltammetry cv linear sweep voltammetry lsv and eis studies were performed using a three electrode electrochemical system consisting of pt anode as prepared cathodes and ag agcl reference electrode 0 05 m na2so4 was used as the electrolyte solution 100 ml for cv and lsv studies and 5 mm fe cn 6 3 4 in 1 m kcl was used as electrolyte solution for eis studies the above electrochemical studies were conducted using a potentiostat pgstat 100 characterization of fc go nanocomposite and the electrode has been elaborately discussed in our previous studies 27 29 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the electrode materials fig 2a shows the cyclic voltammogram obtained due to the result of electrochemical reduction of oxygen functional groups presented on fc ergo electrode it indicates that the oxygen functional groups of fc go were successfully reduced to gain its electrical property along with recovery of its π bonding system which could enhance the specific capacitance owing to the rapid diffusion of ionic species at electrode electrolyte interface the redox peak observed on the cyclic voltammetric curve shows that ferrocene can effectively involve in the electron transfer reactions to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species ros 27 lsv was carried out to understand the fc ergo electrode ability to perform the two electron oxygen reduction reaction for producing hydrogen peroxide fig 2b shows a strong reduction peak at 0 64 v indicating oxygen reduction reactions are effective around the potential and further increase in potential could also involve other side reactions such as reduction of h2o2 h and h2o molecules at acidic condition 30 the sem images of pure tio2 nanobelts low and high magnification mos2 tio2 heterojunction structure low and high magnification and energy dispersive x ray edx image of mos2 tio2 composite are presented in fig s1 as seen from figs s1 a and b the pure tio2 nanobelts have a relatively uniform morphology with a smooth surface texture the mos2 tio2 heterojunction structures are not uniform in size and have an uneven surface figs s1 c and d some of the mos2 nanoparticles have self assembled to form mos2 microspheres the elemental mapping of mos2 tio2 composite is presented in figs s1 e and f the spatial distribution of mo clearly indicates the fact that mos2 is homogeneously distributed across the tio2 matrix the sem images of pure tio2 nanobelts low and high magnification mos2 tio2 heterojunction

to form mos2 microspheres the elemental mapping of mos2 tio2 composite is presented in figs s1 e and f the spatial distribution of mo clearly indicates the fact that mos2 is homogeneously distributed across the tio2 matrix xrd patterns of tio2 red curve and mos2 tio2 blue curve are presented in fig 2c x ray diffraction peaks were found in the tio2 curve for the crystal planes 101 004 200 105 211 204 and 116 of tio2 these diffraction peaks were also found in mos2 tio2 curve which confirmed that the tio2 structures were not destroyed in addition there were a few diffraction peaks characteristic of mos2 for the crystal planes 100 106 and 110 this confirms that mos2 has been successfully incorporated in the mos2 tio2 composite that was synthesized fig 2d shows the nyquist plot and the equivalent circuit obtained using randle s circuit model faradaic impedance refers to i an active charge transfer resistance represented by rct and ii a warburg element w the diameter of the semicircle is equal to the faradaic charge transfer resistance mos2 tio2 coated carbon cloth shows higher conductivity due to a more efficient charge transfer process this can be attributed to the favorable charge transfer property of mos2 tio2 3 2 removal of ciprofloxacin in pc pec ef pef and brdr system ciprofloxacin degradation experiments were carried out through different processes such as pc pec tio2 mos2 tio2 ef pef gf fc ergo and brdr pec pef hybrid system to understand the performance of the system in real conditions degradation experiments were conducted in neutral ph as shown in fig 3a and b there was no significant removal observed in experiments conducted in the absence of uva illumination and catalysts tio2 mos2 tio2 and in the case of experiments conducted in the absence of external applied voltage and fc ergo pc process showed degradation efficiencies of 40 1 and 54 2 for tio2 and mos2 tio2 catalysts respectively pec process with tio2 photoanode and plain graphite felt counter electrode showed 56 1 removal efficiency and mos2 tio2 based photoanode exhibited 71 removal efficiency in neutral ph fig 3a mos2 acts as the co catalyst which helps in trapping the photo excited electrons and efficiently transfers them to the counter electrode via the conductive carbon cloth supporting matrix 31 thus the mos2 assisted pec process enhances the overall contaminant removal efficiency by about 1 26 times compared to tio2 assisted pec process ef system with fc ergo coated graphite felt electrode showed up to 69 3 removal efficiency at neutral ph ferrocene functionalized graphene acts as an active redox species which catalyzes the formation of ho radicals through the decomposition of h2o2 molecules due to enhanced charge transfer rate in the case of pef system enhancement in the removal efficiency of ciprofloxacin up to 78 8 was achieved under irradiation of uva light fig 3b during the uva irradiation fe3 containing ferrocenium molecule fc is converted to fe2 containing fc through photoregeneration resulting in increased production of ho radicals thus enhanced the removal rate the hybrid system comprises of pef and pec units tio2 photoanode with fc ergo coated graphite felt counter electrode showed 99 3 removal in 180 min at ph 7 0 and 1 5 v mos2 tio2 photoanode and fc ergo cathode based brdr system showed 99 5 removal in 120 min fig 3c for different systems namely pc pec ef pef and brdr ciprofloxacin removal efficiency and respective pseudo first order kinetic rate constants were estimated fig 3d for tio2 fc ergo based brdr system the rate constant was found to be 0 026 min 1 with the regression coefficient r2 of 0 982 similarly mos2 tio2 fc ergo based brdr system exhibited the highest rate constant 0 04 min 1 with the regression coefficient r2 of 0 984 it was 6 times higher than the mos2 tio2 photoanode pec system 0 007 min 1 and 4 times higher than pef system 0 009 min 1 the improvement in degradation rate confirms the existence of synergistic effects in the hybrid pec and pef processes resulted due to the enhancement in the production of reactive oxygen species at photoanode the photoexcited electrons from the photoanode is transferred to the cathode which reduces the recombination rate of e h pair thus increasing the radical generation at cathode radical generation is enhanced because of combined ef reactions along with the additional photoregeneration of ferrocene through uva irradiation removal of toc in pc pec ef pef and brdr systems was studied fig 4a mos2 tio2 composite based pc and pec systems showed the toc removal efficiency of 25 3 and 42 7 respectively similarly enhanced mineralization was observed in fc ergo based pef process 52 9 compared to ef process 41 4 the change in the concentration of ciprofloxacin in the system was also qualitatively studied using uv visible spectrophotometry fig 4b a spectrum scan was performed between 200 and 450 nm for water samples sampled at 0 30 60 90 120 and 180 min of reaction maximum absorbance wavelength λmax was found to be at λ 280 nm significant decrease in the absorbance with time at λmax indicated the degradation of ciprofloxacin 3 3 effect of rotational speed of electrode as previously mentioned both pef and pec systems could be strongly influenced by the electrode rotation speed the electrode rotation speed plays a key role in accelerating mass transfer phenomenon the mass transfer rate increases with increasing rotation speed until the optimum level is reached 10 in the case of pec when the speed of the drum electrode is less than the optimum value the water thin film formed on the electrode will be insufficient to provide enough contaminant for the oxidation at the rate which is equal or more than the oxidation capacity of the pec process 10 in pef process when rotation speed of the electrode is increased it enhances more diffusion of oxygen to the liquid film of the cathode surface and the uniform irradiation of uv on cathode increases the photoregeneration of fe2 in ferrocene when the upper part of the electrode touches the liquid portion it produces high amount of h2o2 thus the contaminant oxidation rate of the system is improved furthermore an optimum rotational speed is required to prevent the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide on anode by isolating it in the liquid thin film of the upper region of the electrode 19 in the brdr system both the phenomenona are likely to happen on the respective electrodes fig 5a and b shows that when the rotational speed of the electrode was increased from 0 to 40 rpm the removal rate was increased from 0 002 min 1 to 0 040 min 1 when the rotational speed was increased further from 40 rpm to 60 rpm reaction rate was increased to 0 059 min 1 for 60 rpm therefore 40 rpm was chosen as optimum for the brdr system the overall brdr reaction is influenced by uv illumination and mass transfer phenomena the enhancement in the degradation is achieved due to the following bifunctional drum reactions i uniform uv irradiation on the surface of the liquid thin film enhances photocatalytic degradation ii mos2 tio2 anode improves the electron transfer rate iii rotating drum electrodes enhance atmospheric oxygen adsorption on the cathode surface iv fc ergo cathode generates more reactive oxygen species due to effective redox reactions v uniform uv irradiation on cathode enhances the additional photoregeneration of fe2 in ferrocene and vi degradation products of ciprofloxacin removed and new ciprofloxacin contaminants are adsorbed on each rotation with the maximum contaminant load on the liquid thin film 3 4 effect of initial ph solution ph is an important factor for obtaining the maximum removal efficiency since it directly influences the generation of reactive oxygen species experiments were conducted at initial ph 3 5 7 and 9 fig 5c shows the removal efficiency and the kinetic rate constants obtained in brdr system at different ph the maximum removal rate was achieved at ph 3 0 0 061 min 1 followed by 5 0 0501 min 1 7 0 041 min 1 and 9 0 020 min 1 the removal efficiency was found to be 99 98 at ph 3 99 96 at ph 7 and 98 at ph 9 at 180 min at different ph physico chemical properties of ciprofloxacin also vary thus significantly influencing the removal process ciprofloxacin has two pka values 6 08 and 8 74 which are corresponding to two different functional groups namely carboxylic acid and amine groups respectively 32 at ph 3 ciprofloxacin acts as positively charged species and at ph 9 it possesses negative charge hence the charged species could be electrosorbed to the oppositely charged electrodes and subsequently the compounds which are adsorbed electrosorbed on the surface of electrode will be oxidized through the pec pef mechanism 33 the predominant removal mechanism of ciprofloxacin at ph 3 could be the pef process via the negatively charged cathode based oxidation it is a well known fact that optimum condition for the removal of contaminants for pef is acidic since more h ions are available for the formation of h2o2 moreover h2o2 is highly unstable at alkaline condition it decomposes to form water and oxygen 12 however complete removal efficiency was achieved even at neutral condition at ph 9 a removal efficiency of 91 was observed at 120 min of reaction period and 98 was reached in 180 min overall brdr system reduces the ph sensitiveness of the conventional pef and pec systems moreover it reduces the necessity of adjusting the ph of the system before the start of every cycle of treatment process 3 5 effect of applied potential effect of applied potential was studied at open circuit voltage ocv 1 0 1 5 and 2 5 v increase in applied potential from ocv to 1 5 v drastically improved the efficiency of degradation from 45 to 99 5 at 120 min and their corresponding rate constants from 0 005 min 1 to 0 040 min 1 fig 5d further increase of potential from 1 5 v to 2 5 v exhibited relatively less change in the rate constants from 0 040 min 1 to 0 048 min 1 however 99 9 removal efficiency was achieved both in the case of 1 5 v and 2 5 v in case of ocv and 1 0 v 55 6 and 97 removal efficiencies were obtained respectively in pec the main role of applied potential is to reduce the recombination rate of the photo excited e h pair by driving the electrons to the counter electrode which in turn enhances the removal rate hence the further increase in applied potential does not create a significant impact on the removal rate 34 in the case of pef increasing the applied potential accelerates electron transfer reactions to generate h2o2 through the two electron oxygen reduction reaction which in turn enhances the rate of removal furthermore it mediates the ferrocene redox reactions to produce ho radicals for the oxidation of ciprofloxacin however when the applied potential is further increased other electrochemical side reactions such as h2 gas evolution eq 9 and four electron reduction of o2 which produces h2o molecules instead of h2o2 eq 10 could take place which reduces the removal efficiency 22 hence the integrated brdr process involves complicated combined reactions of both pec and pef processes 9 2 h 2 e h 2 10 o 2 4 h 4 e h 2 o 3 6 effect of initial concentration of ciprofloxacin and uva light intensity the effect of initial concentration was studied at different concentrations of ciprofloxacin 10 20 50 and 70 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency was found to be 99 9 99 9 62 48 for 10 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 50 mg l 1 and 70 mg l 1 of ciprofloxacin respectively fig 5e it is an evident fact that more ho radicals are required for the oxidation of higher concentrations of contaminants however the removal of ciprofloxacin mainly happens through the mass transfer enhanced liquid thin film mechanism the main advantage of this configuration being removal of contaminants increases with increase in concentration until it reaches the maximum load onto the electrode surface 10 when the initial concentration of ciprofloxacin was increased from 10 to 70 mg l 1 the removal rate was getting declined since it requires more radicals for the oxidation of contaminants the amount of ciprofloxacin removed was estimated to be 14 24 mg for 10 mg l 1 29 86 mg for 20 mg l 1 49 5 mg for 50 mg l 1and 55 5 mg for 70 mg l 1 at varied initial concentrations the influence of uv illumination intensity on the brdr based degradation process was studied by varying the number of lamps fig 5f in the case of one uva lamp light intensity is 8 w when the number of lamps used was two and three the light intensity was represented as 16 w and 24 w respectively an increase in the light intensity increased the degradation rate evidently the degradation efficiency was found to be 69 3 for ef process in the case of pef the degradation efficiency was observed to be 80 6 for 8 w 0 01 min 1 97 1 for 16 w 0 019 min 1 and 99 7 for 24 w 0 040 min 1 the increase in light intensity by adding the lamps directly increases the photoenergy of the system as the photoenergy increased the generation of reactive oxygen species through pec and pef processes was enhanced since the hybrid system basically depends on both pec and pef system the influence of the photoenergy on the degradation rate is a significant factor table 1 represents the summary of various experimental conditions and their removal efficiency and kinetic rate constants 3 7 radical estimation in hybrid pec and pef degradation ros are primarily of ho and o2 it is important to understand the mechanism of formation of key ros involved in the oxidation process the concentration of hydroxyl radicals was estimated using dmso as ho radical trapping agent and analyzed by hplc due to the reaction between dmso and ho radicals formaldehyde hcho is formed in the presence of dnph derivatizing agent hcho subsequently forms hydrazone hcho dnph that was quantified using hplc the concentration of hydroxyl radicals was estimated to be 544 μm for ph 3 0 357 μm for ph 7 0 and 221 μm for ph 9 0 fig 6a fig 6b shows the hplc chromatogram obtained during dmso based ho radicals estimation peak observed at retention time 4 7 min is corresponding to dnph whereas peak observed at 7 2 min is corresponding to hcho dnph adduct the peak area of the hcho dnph adduct was found to be higher than dnph due to the conversion of dnph into hydrazone hcho dnph occurred because of the reaction between dmso and ho radicals to understand the contribution of ho and o2 radicals at acidic and neutral ph condition radicals scavenging chemicals were used isopropanol was used as ho radical scavenger 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 35 and ethanol was used as the scavenger of both ho and o2 radicals 36 series of experiments were carried out in both ph 3 0 and 7 0 with and without radical scavengers during the integrated process of pec and pef these radical scavengers were added in the range of 103 higher than the ciprofloxacin concentration 35 fig 6c shows that in ph 3 0 72 and 81 9 inhibition was observed with addition of isopropanol and ethanol respectively similarly at ph 7 0 44 and 78 inhibition were observed with addition of isopropanol and ethanol respectively it represents that both the radicals contributed to oxidation however ho radicals primarily contribute at acidic medium likewise o2 radicals majorly contributes at neutral medium 3 8 mechanism of oxidation of ciprofloxacin in brdr system the possible degradation mechanism for the removal of ciprofloxacin using the integrated bifunctional rotating electrode system is proposed in this section fig 7 removal of ciprofloxacin happens through multiple pathways such as adsorption photolysis photocatalysis photoelectrocatalysis and electro fenton the proposed photoelectrocatalytic oxidation through the charge transfer mechanism of mos2 tio2 anode is given in fig 7 tio2 has two major shortcomings i large optical band gap 3 2 ev limiting its operation under the visible region and in field applications and ii rapid recombination rate of electron hole pairs resulting in ineffective ho generation 37 mos2 on the other hand has a much smaller energy band gap 1 9 ev as compared to tio2 38 when mos2 tio2 is irradiated by light the electrons in the valence band get excited to the conduction band further tio2 acts as photoelectronic receiver since the conduction band of tio2 is lower than that of mos2 hence the electrons from the conduction band of mos2 are transferred to that of tio2 the holes generated in the valence band of mos2 are trapped right there this enables in the efficient separation of electrons and holes thus preventing recombination 28 the other advantage of mos2 tio2 composite is that due to its smaller band gap the electrons get transferred to the conduction band forming electron hole pairs with lower external energies as compared to plain tio2 these separated electron hole pairs e h can participate in redox reactions on the surface of the electrode furthermore the electrons from the surface of mos2 are transferred to the cathode 39 when ciprofloxacin cip comes in contact with the light induced hvb it gets oxidized into intermediate products cipox as per the eq 11 as a side reaction superoxide o2 can be produced when the photoexcited electrons encounter oxygen molecules eq 12 superoxide can involve in the following sequential reactions to produce other reactive oxygen species such as h2o2 and ho as represented in the eqs 13 15 which in turn can oxidize the ciprofloxacin 40 41 11 h vb cip cip ox 12 e cb o 2 o 2 13 o 2 h h o 2 14 h o 2 o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 15 h 2 o 2 o 2 o h o h o 2 degradation of ciprofloxacin on ferrocene functionalized graphene cathode is hypothesized to happen as given initially the atmospheric o2 molecules get adsorbed on the surface of the cathode the oxygen functional groups of rgo act as active site to form h2o2 through the two electron oxygen reduction reaction once h2o2 is generated in the system it is subsequently transformed into ho in reaction with the ferrocene catalyst as given in eq 16 27 29 fe2 containing fc get converted to fe3 containing fc in reaction with h2o2 and generate ho radicals 42 subsequently fc get reduced to fc through the one electron reduction reaction because of its reversible redox nature eqs 17 and 18 and partially can be regenerated through the reaction with h2o2 43 further uniform irradiation of uv light on the surface of cathode could contribute to the photoregeneration of fc with fe2 from fc with fe3 as given in the eq 19 in addition photo assisted decomposition of electrogenerated h2o2 into ho radicals can also occur due to the uv irradiation eq 20 44 16 fc h 2 o 2 fc ho ho 17 fc h 2 o 2 fc ho 2 h 18 fc e fc 19 fc hν fc 20 h 2 o 2 hν 2 ho since the electrode continuously rotates there is continuous adsorption of oxygen and generation of radicals subsequently moreover the degraded products get desorbed from the electrode and adsorb the new ciprofloxacin for further degradation in a continuous manner schematic explaining the enhanced mass transfer and oxidation process in the brdr system is given in fig 7b enhancement in degradation efficiencies can be attributed to some of the salient features of brdr that include i formation of a thin contaminant film on the electrode surfaces ii uniform uv exposure and effective penetration of uv light due to the thin film formation iii improved electron transfer rate and reduced recombination rate due to the mos2 tio2 anode iv generation of more reactive oxygen species due to effective redox reactions facilitated by the fc ergo cathode v the rotating drum electrode design that enhances the adsorption of atmospheric oxygen on the electrode and hence improves surface and bulk dominated degradation vi uniform uv irradiation on cathode enhances additional photo regeneration of fe2 in ferrocene vii the synergy caused by the integrated electrochemical system enhances overall reaction efficiency through improved ros production 3 9 electrode reusability study to study the reactivity and stability of the electrode materials in multiple runs the degradation experiments were carried out as conventional pec and pef processes independently not in combination pec system comprised of mos2 tio2 anode and graphite felt cathode operated under uv illumination and 1 5 v applied potential pef system consist of plain carbon cloth anode and fc ergo graphite felt cathode 1 5 v of applied potential was given without uv illumination degradation studies were repeated five times with both pec and pef systems fig 8a the change in removal efficiency from the first cycle to fifth cycle was found to be less than 3 and 5 for pec and pef systems respectively it shows that the electrodes are highly active and stable moreover there is no sludge formation in the system fig 8b shows the raman spectra of fc ergo electrode obtained before and after the treatment spectrum for fc ergo consists of disordered d and graphitic g peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1589 cm 1 respectively the ratio of d g peak intensity was estimated to be 1 31 for fresh fc ergo electrode whereas fc ergo electrode after five cycles of treatment showed 1 35 it represents that there is an increase in disorder however it does not significantly impact the removal efficiency tga studies the mass difference with respect to temperature and provides a picture about decomposition temperature decomposition reactions absorbed moisture content and in some cases composition and purity of sample the before and after treatment tg curves displayed four stages as described below the mass difference incurred when the sample was subjected to temperatures ranging from i room temperature up to 150 c can be attributed to loss of moisture ii 150 to 250 c can be due to loss of lower molecular weight compounds iii 250 500 c can be associated to onset of thermal decomposition and iv 500 c and above results in combustion of carbon finally at the temperature of 700 c metal oxides or inorganic salt residue ashes remained the total mass difference in the case of the electrode before and after treatment was differed by 2 4 mass difference the mass gain in the electrode after treatment can be attributed to difference in absorption of moisture otherwise there was no significant difference in the mass of electrode indicating its robustness and reusability fig 8c 4 conclusion a hybrid bifunctional rotating drum electrode system comprising pec and pef units equipped with mos2 tio2 composite coated carbon cloth as photoanode and ferrocene functionalized graphene coated carbon felt as the cathode was shown to offer efficient and synergistic performance for the removal of ciprofloxacin this system significantly enhanced the removal efficiency due to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species across a wider ph range the ciprofloxacin degradation efficiency of the brdr system was compared with stand alone pec and pef processes and was found that the brdr 99 9 outweighed both pec 71 and pef 78 8 stand alone processes increase in electrode rotation speed significantly enhanced the removal rate without external aeration from 0 002 min 1 fixed electrode to 0 059 min 1 60 rpm enhancement in degradation efficiencies can be attributed because of improved overall mass transfer uniform uv exposure improved electron transfer rate and generation of more reactive oxygen species due to effective redox reactions the removal across all the systems followed the order pc with mos2 tio2 ef with fc ergo pec with mos2 tio2 pef with fc ergo brdr pec pef the mechanism of mos2 as a co catalyst and the role of fc ergo in effective redox reactions both leading to enhanced ho generation and hence higher degradation efficiency along with uva irradiation has been elaborated along with possible ciprofloxacin degradation pathways the change in removal efficiency from the first cycle to fifth cycle shows minor reduction in removal efficiency in both the pec and pef processes development of brdr with highly efficient electrodes and non selective oxidizing ability paves way for the effective treatment of real and complex wastewaters further brdr system proves to be a cleaner way of treating contaminants effectively with the exclusion of external chemical addition aeration and sludge formation the following is the supplementary data

12846,superparamagnetic nanocomposite microparticles ncmps modified with various layered double hydroxides ldhs mgfe mgal and their zr doped equivalents were investigated for phosphorus p removal screening of optimum composition was performed based on the p removal performance of ncmp ldh particles as well as their magnetic separability in a flow through column as a function of ncmp content 100 1000 mg and stability as a function of ldh content 20 100 the results showed that except for ncmp mgfe zr all the other particles exhibited a partial dissolution of ldh components at each of the examined ldh contents however ncmp mgfe zr showed no dissolution up to a ldh content of 60 at all whereas a partial dissolution occurred at a ldh content of 80 and 100 results of magnetic separability test revealed that the ncmp mgfe zr composed of 500 mg magnetic particle ncmp and 60 ldh was separated from the solution with a separation efficiency of 96 9 while lower ncmp contents resulted in lower separation efficiencies p removal efficiency and specific removal capacity of the ncmp mgfe zr with the optimized composition was found to be 18 5 and 53 1 mg g respectively the crystal structure chemical composition surface morphology crystallite size and particle size distribution functional groups and magnetic properties of the ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr particles were confirmed by various characterization analysis the observed results clearly demonstrates that the ncmp mgfe zr with the optimized composition remained stable during the removal experiments and enabled the removal of p under the conditions of acidic ph and relatively high p concentration without ldh dissolution graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords p removal magnetic ncmp ldh dissolution stability 1 introduction phosphorus p is a crucial element that is essential to all known forms of life despite its essential nature p has been dubbed life s bottleneck due to the relatively low abundance compared to other essential nutrients 1 the ever growing global population has resulted in an increasing demand for food production and consequently an increasing need for p to support agricultural activity 2 this has required intensive mining of phosphate rock pr as the agricultural activity is heavily dependent on the mined pr the only known primary source of p 3 according to the estimations 43 7 million tons pr had to be mined for 12 9 million tons of fertilizer in 1961 whereas 526 million tons of pr will need to be mined for 90 1 million tons of fertilizer by 2050 4 the natural p cycle has been interrupted by converting mined and relatively inactive pr into a range of more soluble and reactive p compounds this increased availability of highly reactive p in the environment has led to several undesirable consequences for ecosystem services such as reduced soil and aquatic biodiversity and increasing risks to human health due to eutrophication to manage p resources efficiently an acceleration for its recovery and reuse from various waste sectors has been needed due to the increasing cost of phosphate fertilizer a scarcity of high quality pr and increasing surface water pollution 5 therefore there has been a growing interest in the technical and economic feasibility of large scale systems for p recovery 6 to address the increasing water scarcity reducing pollution of water bodies and water related issues which are the most serious and longest term global problems of the present century efforts have been directed at innovating technologies related to water treatment 7 8 to remove p from wastewater in order to control and reduce the eutrophication problem various techniques including chemical precipitation biological p removal and adsorption etc have been developed however the chemical and biological removal of p involve several major drawbacks and challenges such as using of excessive chemical reagents secondary pollution arising from sludge formation and difficult optimization of biological removal systems as a well established technology adsorption processes often show good potential for p removal from wastewaters by offering several advantages such as low sludge production and simple operation 9 11 nanomaterials such as graphene carbon nanotubes layered double hydroxides and metal organic frameworks have been considered emerging options for wastewater remediation however their practical applications are limited by several drawbacks such as high cost complicated preparation process low removal ability and chemical instability 12 by means of recent advances in material chemistry and nanotechnology various nanocomposites ncs have been developed by combining different nanomaterials or modifying nanomaterials with functional molecules 13 for preparing magnetic ncs iron oxide nanoparticles ionps have been widely used as magnetic carrier nanomaterial due to their unique magnetic property and great biocompatibility 14 15 which render them attractive for their wide range of applications in fields such as magnetic storage medicine and chemical industries 16 as well as water purification applications 17 due to the great versatility of ionps their use in water purification and remediation of wastewaters have been reported in detail by several reviews 18 20 hence ionps have been extensively studied so far as they can achieve treatment performances with minimum masses reduction on materials and energy costs compared to conventional macroscale adsorbent materials such as activated carbons or zeolites furthermore the most highlighted utilization of ionps in water treatment applications has been of the adsorption of pollutants 21 after adsorbing the target pollutant ionps can be easily and rapidly extracted from aqueous mediums via magnetic separation processes without using filtration or sedimentation techniques by being utilized their superparamagnetic properties 14 22 however adsorption capacity of a magnetic nc is relatively small if its surface has not been initially subjected to any modification procedure allowing the selective removal of a target pollutant 23 therefore functionalization of the surface of magnetic ncs is often needed to enhance their adsorption performance for the selective adsorption of pollutants 17 23 layered double hydroxides ldhs are known as three dimensional nanostructured anionic clays composed of a mixture of di tri and tetra valent metal cations and n valent anion 22 24 25 ldhs possess a sandwich like structure in which the anions are sandwiched into the cationic metal layers in a repeating manner 26 in recent years ldhs have been investigated for removing dyes 27 28 and heavy metals 29 as well as different anions 30 31 among the anions p has been of the most investigated pollutant for removal studies by ldhs since the interlayer anions in the structure of ldhs are easily exchangeable and therefore ldhs exhibit excellent adsorption ability to anions 32 they have been suggested to be promising adsorbents for p removal from wastewaters 33 due to the lamellar structure and sub to micrometer size of ldh particles their use in packed filter columns and separation by filtration or sedimentation techniques become a challenge 25 on the other hand the application of ldhs as adsorbent is limited by their major drawbacks such as the aggregation of particles and difficulty in their regeneration and reusability 33 however it is possible to synthesize ldh based ncs by reacting the ncs with ldhs due to the rich ionic surface oh group and the inherent positive charge of ldhs 13 thus the combination of ldhs with magnetic ncs would efficiently improve the separation property of ldhs and enhance the adsorption performance of ncs 17 a wide variety of metal cations and interlayer anions can be used for synthesis of ldhs 34 the easy tunability of the cations and anions ensures constructing a flexible chemical composition for ldhs within a certain range 35 that can be specifically designed for the removal of a target pollutant thus various ldhs with different chemical compositions can be used to test and screen their removal performances for example the highest p removal performance was obtained by znfe zr and caznfe zr ldhs 36 fe3o4 mgfe zr ldh 37 or fe3o4 znal ldh 30 compared to the other tested ldh materials besides exhibiting a flexible chemical composition property ldhs need to be environmentally benign materials as the cations included in the composition of ldhs are released to the aqueous medium due to the dissolution of the cations depending on several influencing factors such as medium ph and initial p concentration 25 therefore ldhs may show poor stability and low sorption affinity under certain ambient conditions 38 nevertheless stability of ldhs can be improved by tuning the chemical composition this was evidenced in a recent study 38 where the p removal properties of mnfe ldhs mniifeiifeiii cl mniifeiii co3 and mnivfeiii co3 ldhs and their stability during exchanging interlayer cl with co3 and oxidation of mnii to mniv were investigated in the mentioned study it was demonstrated that up to 70 of total mn was released from the mniifeiifeiii cl ldhs at ph 7 in aqueous suspensions however lower mn dissolution 5 4 occurred when interlayer cl was exchanged with co3 moreover the stability of mniifeiii co3 was further improved by oxidizing mnii to mniv it was found out that the final material mnivfeiii co3 ldh showed no mn dissolution at all but relatively lower p sorption capacity as compared to the other materials in another study 37 mandel et al 2013 the experimental results showed that relatively lower ldh contents 20 and 40 did not cause significant dissolution from different ldh magnetic particles at the end of four cycles of p adsorption desorption whereas introducing a ldh content of 60 into the composition stimulated the dissolution of ldhs based on these findings it was suggested that relatively lower ldh contents e g 20 would be more favorable in terms of preventing significant particle losses and ensuring complete magnetic separation of particles for technical applications such as wastewater treatment therefore screening of optimal chemical composition and development of stable materials is of necessity and significance to reach practical environmental applications 35 38 since the dissolution from ldhs may pose a risk due to the release of hazardous substances e g components of pure ldhs or ldh based ncs to the environment during the removal of pollutant environmental applications of such materials are limited by the resultant material instability that may also affect the removal performance and magnetic separability of the materials considering ldh based nc materials are composed of fractions of the ldh and nc improving the stability and magnetic separability for such materials will require adjusting both the content of ldh and nc individually wt ldh versus a known amount of nc particle or vice versa in the composition of the final material however to the current knowledge of the authors screening of the optimum chemical composition based on both the content of ldh and nc has not yet been examined in the existing literature until now to determine structural properties of ldhs various and complementary measurement techniques are needed since synthetic ldhs are commonly not highly crystalline 39 in several studies dissolution of ldhs has been investigated by using various measurement techniques such as 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy 31p magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy powder x ray diffraction 25 atomic absorption spectroscopy 32 38 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry 40 41 or atomic emission spectroscopy 42 taking into consideration that dissolution of ldh components may result in a change in the particle weight the stability of particles can also be investigated based on the particle weight change that can be determined by measuring the dry particle weight before and after the removal experiment as it has been reported in previous studies 43 44 the magnetic ncs need to have a sufficient particle size in micrometer scale to achieve a faster solid liquid separation in lower magnetic field gradients in the current study taking advantage of the micron size of the synthesized particles the solids in the aqueous medium were filtered through filter papers under vacuum filtration in order to determine the dry weight of particles according to the well known technique apha 2540d used to determine total suspended solids thus the obtained results were used to investigate whether a particle weight change occurred during the p removal although the removal of p using pure ldhs or ldh based nc particles mgfe mgal and their zr doped equivalents has been extensively studied 25 32 37 40 41 the proposed approach has not yet been investigated until now while determining the optimum chemical composition and evaluating the stability of the tested materials to the current knowledge of the authors motivated by these concepts the main subjects of the present study were to i develop micron sized magnetic nc particles composed of superparamagnetic ionps and a protective and modifiable sio2 matrix ii modify the surface of nc particles using various ldhs iii screen the optimal composition as functions of varying ldh content and magnetic particle content iv evaluate the stability and magnetic separability of the particles v determine the best performing particle for p removal and vi characterize the particles 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical grade and were

2 synthesis of iron oxide particles iops iop sio2 and iop sio2 ldh particles synthesis of micron sized iop sio2 particle referred to as nanocomposite microparticle ncmp and its surface modification using various ldhs mgfe mgal and their zr doped equivalents were carried out as described by previously reported methods 37 43 45 the synthesized final material was referred to as ncmp ldh in this study 2 2 1 synthesis of well defined ncmps well defined ncmps were obtained by performing three sequential synthesis procedures as described by mandel 45 firstly iron oxide magnetic core nanomaterial was synthesized by chemical co precipitation of iron salts in an alkaline environment then the as precipitated nanoparticles were subjected to a dispersion procedure using diluted hno3 solution to obtain a sol a citric acid solution was used as stabilizing agent in this study finally the stabilized nanoparticles were incorporated in a protective and modifiable sio2 matrix by reacting the obtained sol with sodium silicate water glass solution 2 2 1 1 synthesis of iops an iron salt solution was prepared by dissolving 3 18 g fecl2 4h2o and 8 64 g fecl3 6h2o molar ratio of fe2 fe3 1 2 in 100 ml distilled water an ammonia solution was prepared by diluting 20 ml of nh4oh solution 25 wt in 100 ml distilled water these two solutions were mixed by pumping through peristaltic pumps longerpump bt100 1j with a flow rate corresponding to 20 and 22 rpm into a separatory funnel the black suspension formed in the outlet of the funnel was collected in a beaker that was placed on nine sets 3 3 of ndfeb ring magnets 6 pieces of magnets in each set to magnetically separate the nanoparticles the overall procedure was illustrated in fig s1 the nanoparticles were washed with 300 ml distilled water three times the particle concentration in the suspension was determined from the dry weight per volume of suspension to measure the dry weight of the particles a known volume of sample was taken and then filtered through a filter paper millipore ap40 drying of the filter paper was carried out in an oven at 105 c for 1 h based on the determined dry weight of the particle approximately 3 7 g a scale up was done by increasing the amount of starting solutions 2 2 1 2 dispersion and stabilization of the nanoparticles the washed nanoparticles 3 7 g were re suspended in 120 ml distilled water by stirring in a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm 0 66 m hno3 solution 45 was added dropwise using a burette into the nanoparticle suspension under stirring until ph value of the mixture was measured milwaukee mi150 as 1 5 while the resulting brown black sol stirred 10 ml of c6h8o7 h2o solution 0 5 g ml 46 47 was added and the mixture was further stirred for 30 min under the ambient temperature 2 2 1 3 synthesis of the ncmps 88 ml of nh4oh solution 25 wt was diluted in 80 ml distilled water the mixture was added to the stabilized nanoparticle sol and heated to 70 c while stirring at 300 rpm a sodium silicate water glass solution molar ratios nh3 hno3 na2o 3sio2 was added slowly through a syringe needle the reaction mixture was stirred for 5 min at 70 c after the mixture was cooled down to room temperature the obtained particles were magnetically separated and washed with 300 ml distilled water three times to prepare a stock ncmp suspension the synthesized particles were re suspended in a volumetrically scaled beaker an example was shown in fig s6c using a known volume of distilled water the stock suspension was stored at room temperature and left undisturbed until further use the particle concentration in the stock suspension was determined as described in section 2 2 1 1 the desired weight of the ncmps was adjusted by sampling a known volume of suspension from the homogeneously stirred stock suspension 2 2 2 synthesis of ldhs and deposition on the ncmps surface modification of the obtained ncmp was performed using various ldhs mgal mgfe mgal zr and mgfe zr ldhs for a selective p removal synthesis of the ldhs were carried out as described by drenkova tuhtan et al 22 briefly ldhs were precipitated by adding the respective metal ion precursor solution of 100 ml into a 0 15 m naoh solution 400 ml under stirring the mixtures were then neutralized with hcl solution 3 m to prepare the next step of ncmp ldhs a scale up was done by increasing the amount of the solutions in order to prepare stock ldh solutions the stock solutions pure ldh solution were stored at room temperature and left undisturbed until further use before using the solutions were stirred in magnetic stirrers to homogenize the ldh precipitates to prepare the ncmp ldhs a certain volume of ldh solution was added in a beaker and an identical volume of ncmp suspension containing the desired weight of ncmp was added into the ldh solution the mixture was stirred in a magnetic stirrer for 1 min transferred to 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks and exposed to ultrasonic treatment in an ultrasonic bath elmasonic s 80h for 3 min the obtained particles were magnetically separated and washed with 300 ml distilled water once after each of the synthesis procedures explained above was completed a proper volume of suspension was sampled for characterization analyses powdered samples were obtained by drying the magnetically separated particles in a vacuum drying oven daihan wisd thermostable ov 70 under the conditions of 50 c 24 h and 0 04 mpa and then grinding the dried material in a porcelain mortar the drying procedure was only applied to the particles for which the characterization analyses were performed through powdered form of the particles in order to maintain the characteristic features e g particle size distribution of the synthesized particles ncmp or ncmp ldhs used for p removal experiments the drying procedure was not applied to the particles 2 3 screening of the optimum composition of ncmp ldhs the optimum composition was screened based on the p removal performance stability and magnetic separability of the prepared ncmp ldhs particles for this purpose a series of batch experiments was carried out to determine the p removal performances of the ncmp ldhs as a function of ldh and ncmp content in the particle composition to determine the optimum ldh content and the most effective ncmp ldh the stability of the particles see section 2 4 for details during the p removal experiments and their p removal performances were evaluated the optimum ncmp content was determined based on the calculated data for the efficiency of magnetic separation in a flow through magnetic separation column see section 2 5 for details as well as the p removal performance of the particles 2 3 1 determination of the optimum ldh content and the most effective ncmp ldh experiment 1 to investigate the influence of ldh content on the p removal performance and stability of the ncmp ldhs the desired ldh content was adjusted before preparing the ncmp ldhs either by directly using the prepared stock ldh solution 100 ldh or by diluting a certain volume of the stock ldh solution with distilled water to obtain a ldh content of 20 40 60 or 80 in the ldh solution for each experimental run a certain volume of the stock ldh solution was transferred to a volumetrically scaled beaker and diluted to 150 ml with distilled water if required a ncmp suspension of 150 ml which contained approximately 200 mg ncmp particle was also transferred to another volumetrically scaled beaker to determine the weight of ldh precipitates and ncmps 25 ml of sample was taken with a pipette from each of the prepared ldh solutions and ncmp suspensions to prepare the ncmp ldhs the remaining ldh solution 125 ml was mixed with the remaining ncmp suspension 125 ml in a magnetic stirrer for 1 min and the mixture was subjected to the ultrasonic treatment as described in section 2 2 2 the obtained final mixtures of ncmp ldhs 250 ml were used for the p removal experiments a final mixture containing no ldh precipitate but only ncmp was also prepared by adding 125 ml distilled water into 125 ml ncmp suspension this particle without ldh modification was tested as control sample to determine any possible change in the weight of particle during the removal experiment the experimental procedure was illustrated in fig s2 2 3 2 determination of the optimum ncmp content experiment 2 the most effective ncmp ldh particle with the determined optimum ldh content was tested in this experimental stage the particle was prepared as described in section 2 3 1 but varying the weight of the ncmp ncmp content in mg in the ncmp suspension between 100 and 1000 mg adjusting the desired ncmp content was handled by transferring 150 ml of ncmp suspension that contained the desired weight of the particles into volumetrically scaled beakers through peristaltic pumps before transferring of the suspension it was mixed gently in a magnetic stirrer to homogenize the particles determination of the weight of ldh precipitates and ncmps in the respective solutions or suspensions were performed as described in section 2 3 1 a final mixture 125 ml ldh solution 125 ml distilled water containing no ncmp but only ldh precipitates was tested as control sample in addition a control group including the ncmps without ldh modification was also tested for that purpose a series of final mixtures 250 ml was prepared by adding 125 ml distilled water into 125 ml ncmp suspension containing the tested ncmp content the obtained final mixtures containing ncmp ldhs or ncmp were used for the p removal experiments the experimental procedure was illustrated in fig s3 2 3 3 p removal experiments for the p removal experiments in the experiment 1 and 2 aqueous solutions were prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of kh2po4 to give an initial p concentration of 150 mg l in each experimental run 750 ml of p solutions were added into the final mixtures of 250 ml a dilution factor of 0 25 was taken into account while calculating the specific removal capacity or removal efficiency ph of the resulting mixture was adjusted to 4 5 by adding 0 5 m hcl solution and the mixture was stirred in a magnetic stirrer daihan wisd wisestir msh 20d at 350 rpm for 1 h at the end of the experiment 50 ml of sample was taken and filtered through filter paper millipore ap40 after the filter paper was dried in an oven for 1 h the particle weight in the 1 l mixture was calculated residual p concentrations were determined in the filtrate samples and were measured by the vanadomolybdate method using merck test kit 114842 and an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer hach dr6000 according to the obtained data p removal capacity q in mg g and removal efficiency were calculated by the following equations 48 51 1 q c i c e m v 2 removal efficieny c i c e c i 100 where c i and c e are the initial and the residual p concentrations in mg l respectively m is the weight of particles measured before the removal experiment in g v is the volume of the resulting mixture in l 2 4 evaluation of the stability of the particles the stability of the particles was evaluated according to the change in the weight of the particles during the p removal experiments which was determined based on the dry weight of the particles measured before and after the p removal for the measurement procedure see section 2 2 1 1 the weight of the ncmps and ldh precipitates measured before the p removal experiments experiment 1 and 2 were presented in fig s2 and s3 the total weight change δwt in mg during the removal experiment for each of the tested ncmp ldhs was calculated from the weight of the ncmp ldh before wi in mg and after we in mg the removal experiment if the calculated value of the δwt was negative then it was denoted as a weight loss calculation of the net weight change δwn in mg which was equal to the net weight loss if present was done according to the calculated data for the removed p prem in mg and the δwt the data for the wi we δwt prem and δwn and the related calculations were presented in table s1 and s2 2 5 separability of the particles in a flow through magnetic separator to evaluate the separability of the ncmp ldhs the experimental setup illustrated in fig s6a was used the separation procedure was carried out as described in a previous study 44 accordingly control valve of the glass funnel containing the ncmp ldh suspension was turned on to drain the suspension towards the glass column diameter 15 0 mm volume 35 ml magnetic separation of the particles during the flow inside the column was achieved with the help of a magnet set consisting of 6 pieces of ndfeb permanent ring magnets diameter 15 7 mm and enclosing the external wall of the column fig s6b the liquid phase was drained from the column through the control valve and collected in a beaker the flow rate in the column was regulated through the control valves to determine the dry weight of the particles a known volume of sample was taken from the effluent and filtered through a filter paper millipore ap40 drying of the filter paper was carried out in an oven at 105 c for 1 h the separation efficiency was calculated by the following equation 3 separation efficieny w i w e w i 100 where w i and w e are the dry weight of the particles measured before and after the separation in mg respectively 2 6 characterization of the particles a scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss gemini 300 sem equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer eds system bruker xflash 6i100 was employed to reveal the morphology and chemical composition of the particles sem and eds was carried out at 5 kev field emission and 15 kev respectively functional groups were determined through an attenuated total reflectance atr fourier transformation infrared spectrophotometer ftir shimadzu irprestige 21 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the specific surface area was measured using the multi point n2 brunauer emmett teller bet method by a specific surface and pore size analyzer micromeritics tristar ii 3200 prior to the measurement the samples were degassed at 105 c for at least 8 h the crystal structure of the particles was obtained by x ray diffraction xrd analysis conducted on an x ray diffractometer bruker d8 advance employing a cukα radiation λ 0 15418 nm data were collected in the range of 2θ 0 90 with an angular step of 0 02 at a scanning speed of 2 5 s diffraction patterns were indicated relying on the inorganic crystal structure database icsd the crystallite sizes were determined from the width of the x ray diffraction peaks using the scherrer equation for the most intense diffraction peaks particle size distribution of the particles dispersed in distilled water were determined via fraunhofer diffraction fd with a malvern mastersizer 3000e the magnetic properties of the particles were determined using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm dexing magnet vsm 550 with an applied field between 10 0 to 10 0 koe at room temperature 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of the ldh content on the p removal performance and stability of the particles the experimental results of the effect of varying ldh content on the p removal efficiency and specific removal capacity were presented in fig 1a and b respectively the removal efficiency of the control sample was found to be 2 2 fig 1a on the other hand higher removal efficiencies were obtained for each type of the ncmp ldhs at each ldh content due to the introduction of ldh precipitates into the particle composition as compared to the control sample the modifications with the examined ldhs increased the removal efficiency in the range of 4 4 and 25 8 depending on the ldh content and type of the ldh for example zr doped mgfe ldhs exhibited higher p removal at each ldh contents than those of their undoped equivalents whereas zr doped mgal ldhs did not reflect the same effect according to the results the highest removal efficiencies were obtained at 100 ldh content for ncmp mgal ncmp mgal zr and ncmp mgfe zr with a removal efficiency of 28 0 22 8 and 18 9 respectively while ncmp mgfe ldh showed the best performance at 60 ldh content with a removal efficiency of 14 2 the specific removal capacity of the control sample was determined as 15 5 mg g fig 1b comparing the results for the ncmp ldhs it was observed that the specific removal capacity generally increased for all ncmp ldhs with the increasing ldh content up to 60 but it decreased at a ldh content of 80 and 100 the highest removal capacity was obtained in the order ncmp mgal 69 2 mg g ncmp mgfe zr 69 0 mg g ncmp mgal zr 67 3 mg g and ncmp mgfe 60 2 mg g at 60 ldh content as a result of evaluation of the findings it could be concluded that the best performing particle and the optimal ldh content was ncmp mgal ldh and 100 respectively according to the removal efficiency values on the other hand the optimal ldh content was 60 and the best performing particle was ncmp mgal or ncmp mgfe zr according to the specific removal capacity values these findings clearly showed that evaluating only the results of p removal performances did not help to decide on selecting the optimal ldh content and the most effective particle therefore further evaluations were performed in order to determine the stability of the particles by taking the results of particle weight change and weight loss if present during the p removal experiments into account for further details on the calculation of the particle weight change and weight loss see section 2 4 according to the data for the control sample it was observed that the increase in the particle weight change δwt was 3 mg and that it was almost equal to the calculated value of the removed p prem of 2 7 mg table s1 this result revealed that no weight loss occurred for the non ldh functionalized particle confirming no dissolution of either silica or iron took place from the particle a similar result was also obtained for ncmp mgfe zr where no weight loss δwt occurred up to 60 ldh content however increasing the ldh content above 60 caused a net weight loss δwn of 24 7 and 49 8 mg at 80 and 100 ldh content respectively fig 2 for the other particles δwn values were determined in the range of 1 9 and 66 8 mg for ncmp mgfe 9 4 and 81 3 mg for ncmp mgal zr and 13 9 and 160 3 mg for ncmp mgal as a function of the increasing ldh content the highest δwn values for a given ldh content followed the order ncmp mgal ncmp mgal zr ncmp mgfe and ncmp mgfe zr the weight losses occurred were also evaluated by comparing the data i wldh ratio of the weight of ldh precipitates to the total weight of ncmp ldh particle measured before the removal experiment wi and ii nwl the ratio of the δwn to the wi fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3 the wldh value for a given type of ncmp ldh increased with the increasing ldh content the highest wldh values for a given ldh content followed the order ncmp mgal ncmp mgal zr ncmp mgfe zr and ncmp mgfe except for the ncmp mgfe zr the same trend was also observed for the nwl values which ranged between 5 7 and 25 5 for ncmp mgal 4 3 and 18 1 for ncmp mgal zr and 0 81 and 16 6 for ncmp mgfe these results clearly revealed that there was a relationship between the nwl and the wldh values meaning the weight loss increased as the weight of the ldh precipitate in the particle composition ldh content increased this relationship was also reported in a study showing that the weight losses due to the dissolution of the ldh magnetic particles including 20 and 40 ldh content were in the range of 3 and 5 after four cycles of p adsorption desorption but the weight losses were significantly higher for the particles with 60 of ldh content 37 it has been known that although non ldh functionalized magnetic nc materials which are composed of ionps included in a protective silica matrix are chemically stable over a wide range of ph 0 12 acidic environments cause partial or severe dissolution of ldh shells from ldh functionalized ncs depending on the ph level 45 this phenomenon was evidenced in a study 32 showing that p adsorption capacity of mgal ldh decreased with the increase of ph from 3 to 10 and reached maximum at the ph of 3 0 where a certain amount of mg2 and al3 were being released from the ldh into the solution as a result of the mg and al dissolution it was suggested that the resulting formation of mg and al p precipitates contributed to the removal of p as well as the removal by chemical and electrostatic interaction between the ldh surface and p anion in another study 25 it was also demonstrated that acidic ph conditions stimulated mgfe ldh dissolution resulting in formation of ferrihydrite particles and caused poor material stability as compared to alkaline ph level conditions in addition relatively high solution p concentrations also stimulated the dissolution at alkaline ph levels resulting in formation of mg p precipitates based on the ldh instability the main p removal pathway at acidic ph level was suggested as sorption by ferrihydrite particles as also demonstrated by the previous studies 32 41 42 the adsorption of p by ldhs may take place via complex combination of several mechanisms including electrostatic and chemical interaction between the ldh surface and p anion ligand exchange and precipitation of secondary p phases 32 40 the mechanism of p uptake by magnetic composite microparticles modified with mgfe zr ldh was suggested to involve ion exchange and intercalation into the ldh structure under the ph condition of 4 5 5 44 furthermore it was suggested that monovalent phosphate species h2po4 was preferentially intercalated into the ldh structure in exchange with hydroxyl ions at the ph level between 3 and 6 however half of the dissociated species were divalent ions hpo4 2 at neutral ph resulting in a decrease in the p uptake 22 considering the explained removal mechanisms it should be noteworthy to mention that the δwn values were calculated based on the assumption that all the removed p ions were already present in the filterable forms of the ncmp ldhs particles and or cation p precipitates regardless of which of the removal mechanisms contributed to the p removal filtration of the solids in the p solution and subsequent determination of the dry particle weight enabled to obtain the data required to calculate the δwn values and determine the stability of the particles according to the results it was revealed that the ncmp mgal exhibiting the highest p removal performance fig 1 was the particle where the highest weight loss occurred as compared to the other particles figs 2 and 3 however it was found that the ncmp mgfe zr was quite stable in the case of the ldh content was lower than 60 and showed no dissolution at all consequently it was decided that the optimal ldh content was 60 which also maximized the p removal performance for all ncmp ldhs and that the most effective particle was ncmp mgfe zr 3 2 effect of the ncmp content on the p removal performance and magnetic separability of the particles the experimental results of the effect of ncmp content on the p removal performance of ncmp mgfe zr particles were presented in fig 4 the results related to removal efficiencies showed that the ncmp mgfe zr particles performed higher p removal than the non ldh functionalized control samples fig 4a the removal efficiencies for the control group varied between 5 6 and 9 2 while the removal efficiency of the control sample containing only mgfe zr ldh was determined as 19 8 the removal efficiency of ncmp mgfe zr particles varied between 18 5 and 21 2 these results revealed that the variation of ncmp content in the particle composition did not cause any considerable impact on the p removal efficiency the specific removal capacities of ncmp mgfe zr particles were higher than that of the non ldh functionalized control samples at each ncmp content fig 4b the specific removal capacity of the control sample containing no ncmp but only mgfe zr ldh was determined as 143 4 mg g which was the highest specific removal capacity as compared for all the other particles the specific removal capacity of ncmp mgfe zr particles varied between 18 6 and 92 5 mg g as a function of the ncmp content and decreased as the ncmp content increased this was because approximately the same amount of p ions was removed per unit mass of the particle for each of the ncmp mgfe zr particles fig 4a although the control sample pure ldh performed the highest specific removal capacity it was not chosen as the best performing particle since pure ldhs without fe exhibit diamagnetic properties 37 and therefore it is almost impossible to magnetically separate and reuse them in a cycling removal recovery process the examined ncmp mgfe zr particles were further evaluated based on the results of the weight change and the separability test carried out in the flow through magnetic separation column the results related to the weight change showed that there was no weight loss for all ncmp mgfe zr particles which composed of the same ldh content and for the control samples containing no ldh but only ncmp even though the increasing ncmp content table s2 these results indicated that no dissolution occurred during the p removal and confirmed the earlier results obtained for the ncmp mgfe zr particle with 60 ldh content and the control sample as can be seen in the table s3 the percentage of the weight of ncmp wncmp in the composition of each of the ncmp mgfe zr particles varied as a function of the ncmp content and it increased as the ncmp content increased the increasing value of the wncmp was expected to let the particles to be separated at relatively high separation efficiency in the magnetic separation column it was calculated that the particle contained 100 mg ncmp which was found out to have the highest specific removal capacity fig 4b contained the lowest ncmp content 42 2 whereas the particle containing 1000 mg ncmp with the lowest specific removal capacity contained the highest ncmp content 86 7 as understood from these results deciding on the most effective particle by taking only the removal performances into consideration was not reasonable in a study the most suitable composition was determined by examining the effect of different amounts of alkali treated calcium silicate composite asc and fe3o4 included in the composition of fe3o4 asc particles on the p removal performance 14 according to the experimental results the specific removal capacity increased from 82 to 128 mg g as the ratio of fe3o4 to asc decreased from 2 1 to 1 3 as a function the increasing asc content in the composition of fe3o4 asc particles and selection of the best performing particle was done by considering the magnetism as well as the p removal capacity in the separability tests only the particles containing 100 250 and 500 mg of ncmp was tested the particles containing 750 and 1000 mg ncmp were not tested as those particles had relatively lower specific removal capacity fig 4b although they contained relatively higher ncmp table s3 and therefore would be probably separated with higher efficiency in the magnetic separation column the separability tests were carried out using one fourth of the 1000 ml ncmp mgfe zr mixtures that were used in the removal experiment therefore one fourth of the calculated we values were taken into calculation table s3 according to the results efficiency of the magnetic separation increased with the increasing value of the wncmp in the composition of the tested ncmp mgfe zr particles the highest separation efficiency was calculated to be 96 9 for the particle containing 500 mg ncmp fig s6c whereas lower separation efficiencies 80 8 and 89 0 were obtained for the other tested particles containing lower ncmp contents based on the obtained experimental results the ncmp mgfe zr particle composing of 60 ldh content and 500 mg ncmp was investigated to determine its characteristic features 3 3 characterization results 3 3 1 crystal structure and chemical composition the xrd patterns of the iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr were illustrated in fig 5 the reflections 220 311 400 422 511 440 and 533 obtained for the iop the black diffractogram were observed at diffraction peaks at 2θ of 30 1 35 5 37 1 43 1 57 0 62 6 and 74 1 respectively a similar diffraction pattern was also reported by earlier studies 14 27 52 53 the obtained pattern with intense and sharp peaks well fitted the reference crystal surface structure of fe3o4 inorganic crystal structure database icsd collection code 77588 54 and revealed the formation of single phase cubic spinel structure with lattice constant a 8 377 å which was very close to the reported value for fe3o4 55 as is known chemical co precipitation of fe2 and fe3 salts in an alkaline environment usually produces a mixture magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe2o3 56 since diffraction patterns of both species are very similar differentiation between both species is not possible 57 therefore it should be noted that the particle synthesized in the current study was referred to as iron oxide particle iop because any differentiation analysis was not conducted to decide whether fe3o4 or γ fe2o3 was obtained but at least it could be concluded that the iop obtained in the current study was neither goethite α feooh nor hematite α fe2o3 based on the absence of peaks at 2θ of 21 2 110 and 33 1 104 in the obtained xrd pattern 58 in addition to that hwang et al 59 reported that the synthesized particle was α fe2o3 of which the xrd pattern was well matched with the α fe2o3 structures with lattice constant of a 5 0356 å the diffraction pattern for the ncmp the red diffractogram resulted a good matching with the reference crystal surface structure of iron oxide silicon icsd collection code 87459 the lattice constant a 8 374 å confirmed the formation of single phase cubic particles the reflections and the intensities and sharpness of peaks remained almost the same as those obtained for the iop fig 5 as also previously observed by lee et al 60 this result implied that dispersion with diluted hno3 solution and stabilization with citric acid solution did not cause any remarkable distortion in the crystal structure of the ncmp and thus it was synthesized as a composite particle after coating the stabilized iop with sio2 without any remarkable alter in the phase property of the iop the diffraction pattern for the ncmp mgfe zr the blue diffractogram showed that the reflection intensities decreased after modifying the ncmp with mgfe zr ldh in addition to this two new peaks appeared at 2θ of 31 5 and 45 1 which could be attributed to the presence of mgfe zr shells the results of eds analysis for the iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr were presented in fig s4 according to the results it was observed that oxygen o and fe were the major elements with a mass of 22 7 and 73 7 respectively in the composition of the iop fig s4a this result indicated that the resulting composition was quite close to the chemical composition of pure fe3o4 which has a mass based composition of 27 6 o and 72 3 fe however fe content of the ncmp decreased to 12 7 with the introduction of sio2 fig s4b on the other hand mass of o and carbon c increased to 33 8 and 6 0 respectively the reason of these increases was most likely due to the introduction of an additional c source from citric acid and an additional o source from either citric acid or sio2 the mass for si was measured to be 47 4 meaning that a robust sio2 coating was performed the results obtained for the ncmp mgfe zr confirmed the presence of metal precursor ions of the ldh mg fe and zr and their corresponding salts cl in the composition of the synthesized material as well as a negligible amount of sodium fig s4c it was observed that the mass of fe did not change remarkably since fe ions in the mgfe zr made an additional contribution to the chemical composition although its mass value was expected to decrease as compared to its mass value in the ncmp as a summary it was concluded that each of the synthesized materials was consistent with its elements which further supported the xrd results 3 3 2 crystallite size and particle size distribution according to the results the average crystallite size calculated via the scherrer equation was found to be 53 3 and 82 0 nm for the bare iop and ncmp respectively data not shown depending on the variations in the procedures applied to synthesize bare iops different average crystallite sizes were reported in the literature varying in the range of 8 10 nm 55 15 20 nm 9 32 55 nm 10 62 5 nm 61 and 395 nm 48 in the current study the increase in the crystallite size of the ncmp by 53 8 could be attributed to the stabilization of the bare iop with citric acid and then incorporation of the stabilized particles into the sio2 matrix a similar result was also found out by ajmal et al 10 showing that there was an increase in the size of the nanoparticles by 18 7 after coating with sio2 intertwining of the ncmp with mgfe zr ldhs by ultrasonic treatment caused an important decrease in the average crystallite size of ncmp mgfe zr by 85 1 which equals to a size of 12 2 nm this result showed that crystallites in the ncmp mgfe zr became smaller in size as compared to those in the bare iop this was attributed to the ultrasonic treatment which allowed to distribute and break a great portion of the ncmp crystallites and re arrange them as individual crystallites a similar finding was also reported by koilraj et al 62 demonstrated that the average particle dimension for the ultrasonically treated ldh was smaller than the other examined ldhs which were subjected to a hydrothermal or mechanical shaking treatment due to the tearing breaking of nanosheets during the ultrasonic treatment the results obtained in the current study revealed that each of the synthesized iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr materials were composed of nano sized crystallites smaller than an average size of 100 nm sem micrographs of the particles were also supported this finding fig s5g h and i the results of the particle size distribution determined via fd technique and the relevant particle size parameters for the synthesized particles were presented in fig 6 and table 1 respectively according to the results particle sizes ranged between 0 128 and 31 1 μm for the bare iop 0 405 and 31 1 μm for the ncmp and 0 276 and 27 4 μm for the ncmp mgfe zr fig 6 similarly qiao et al 24 found out that most of the magnetic fe3o4 zn al fe la ldh particles had a diameter ranging between 2 and 50 μm and the mean diameter was measured to be 41 28 μm depending on the particle size distribution results obtained in the current study it can be concluded that each of the synthesized iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr materials were micron sized particles these finding was also supported with the sem micrographs fig s5a b and c comparing the particle size results and the sem micrographs it could be questioned that why a micron sized iop was obtained rather than nano sized particles which can be synthesized through a well known nanoparticle synthesis procedure this might be considered as a valid question however it should always be kept in mind that agglomerated iops are obtained in the first step when co precipitation of iron salts from solutions by the addition of an alkali is used to prepare superparamagnetic nanoparticles 45 that was the reason why a dispersion procedure using a diluted hno3 solution was performed to obtain a ferrofluid a sol with nano sized crystallites after obtaining the agglomerated iops in the current study in addition the micron sized ncmp was synthesized intentionally in order to address the objectives of the study it should be noted that the given particle size results and the sem micrographs need to be carefully interpreted in the view of the information given above rawle 63 reported the reasons for the different interpretations of the result sets of particle size measurements obtained by bet measurements and laser diffraction technique for the term nano and micron based on the experimental results it was suggested that the term nano could be applied to the bet measurements and micron could be applied to the laser diffraction technique consequently it was emphasized that a great care should be taken while describing particulate systems in terms of nano or micro since the term size in particle size analysis are related to the type of measurement undertaken comparing results of percentile of the cumulative volume distribution dv it was observed that size of the particles showed a correlation with the average size of the crystallites table 1 accordingly the highest average particle size dv50 followed the order ncmp iop and ncmp mgfe zr the dv90 results were measured to be 17 1 18 7 and 13 9 μm for the iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr particles respectively meaning that 90 the total volume of the particles was smaller than those measured dv90 values table 1 the calculated values for the change in the particle size based on the dv90 results showed that the particle size of ncmp increased by 9 3 after coating with sio2 whereas a decrease by 25 6 was observed after modifying the ncmp with mgfe zr ldh 3 3 3 surface morphology surface morphology of the particles was investigated by sem micrographs and measuring the bet specific surface area sem micrographs for the iop revealed the formation of nano sized crystallites fig s5g which were packed in micron sized agglomerated particles fig s5a and d from fig s5b it can be obviously seen that less agglomerated and well dispersed ncmp particles were formed as explained by a proposed mechanism for dispersion and stabilization of iops 57 dispersion of as precipitated iops with diluted hno3 solution allowed to suppress agglomeration of the particles and functionalization of particle surface with carboxylates using citric acid solution resulted in stabilization of the particles sterically thus hindering the formation of agglomerated particles during synthesis of the ncmp fig s5e clearly exhibited that the iops were confined in a sio2 matrix formation of a raspberry like micron sized particle including the nano sized spherical crystallites was more obviously seen in fig s5h sem micrographs for the ncmp mgfe zr revealed that the particles became denser and showed a sponge like porous structure after modifying the ncmp with mgfe zr ldh fig s5c f and i the bet specific surface area of the particles was 84 0 89 5 and 105 9 m2 g for the iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr respectively data not shown mandel 45 reported that the iops had a specific surface area of 50 to 75 m2 g and composite particles modified with ldhs had a specific surface area of 90 to 105 m2 g in addition several studies 10 11 14 48 reported that nanoparticles with specific surface area values ranged between 85 8 and 137 m2 g were synthesized the obtained results in the present study were in accordance with those reported results ajmal et al 10 found out that bet surface area of the materials showed a reverse correlation with particle size distributions meaning the highest specific surface area was obtained for the particle with the lowest particle size interestingly a higher specific surface area was obtained for the ncmp mgfe zr compared to those of the iop and ncmp although the measured particle size of the ncmp mgfe zr was lower than those of the other particles table 1 this result could be attributed to the sponge like porous structure of the ncmp mgfe zr created after the ultrasonic treatment obtaining such a result could be important and desirable because particles with relatively small specific surface area and large particle size were considered ineffective for their application as a magnetic host in loading functional reagents 11 moreover the particles with large surface area were thought to be promising candidates for their modifications required for specific removal applications 45 the increase in the surface area of the ncmp mgfe zr compared to the iop and ncmp showed that the ncmp was successfully modified with mgfe zr ldh as supported by eds results given in fig s4c a similar finding was also reported by nyaba et al 64 as a result it was concluded that the ultrasonic treatment had a key role in order to obtain a composite microparticle with relatively higher specific surface area as well as deposition of modification reagents on the particle surface 3 3 4 functional groups the atr ft ir spectra of the synthesized particles were presented in fig 7a d fig 7a showed the typical ft ir spectrum of as precipitated iops which exhibited various characteristic peaks at 548 1622 and 3282 cm 1 the peak at 548 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of the fe o bonds 65 although several literature studies reported this characteristic fe o vibration peak at near 580 cm 1 region 11 58 66 68 however these data were reported to be the measurement reflections which were yielded in a polar environment of kbr pellet and thereby resulted in a shift in the peak position 65 the peaks at 1622 and 3282 cm 1 were assigned to the characteristic bands of bending vibration of absorbed water and surface hydroxyl and o h stretching mode respectively 58 60 67 69 it was reported that these two characteristic bands of oh groups appeared in the ft ir spectrum since surface of iops were readily covered with oh groups during preparation of iops by the chemical co precipitation method 70 although the chemical co precipitation is considered as the simplest and most cost effective technique used to synthesize iops lack of good colloidal stability and inadequate repulsive forces leading to agglomeration of particles due to electrostatic stabilization via na ions in an alkaline medium are the main disadvantages of this technique 53 58 to overcome these problems de agglomeration of the particles after precipitation is necessary at first then the particles should be sterically stabilized against re agglomeration over a wide ph range using a proper stabilizing agent 45 in the current study diluted hno3 solution was used to disperse the as precipitated iops and citric acid solution was used as stabilizing agent it has been known that a citric acid molecule possessing two terminal coohs one central cooh and one c oh group makes contribution to the binding with iops via the fe oh groups 71 in the ft ir spectrum of the stabilized iop it was observed that transmittance of the stretching vibration of the fe o bonds at 543 cm 1 was not decreased fig 7b this indicated that there was no interaction between fe molecules and oxygen molecules of carbonyl c o groups the peaks at the region between 823 and 1116 cm 1 could be attributed the c c stretching bonds 65 compared to the iop two additional intense peaks were observed for the stabilized iop at the wavelengths 1386 and 1539 cm 1 these peaks corresponded to coo fe bonds 72 which appeared due to the absorption of citric acid radicals on the particle surface several studies examining the ft ir spectra of pure citric acid and citric acid modified iops reported that c o vibration of the cooh group appeared as a characteristic band for pure citric acid at a wavelength ranging from 1710 to 1739 cm 1 and that the band shifted to an intense wavelength 1547 to 1615 cm 1 after the modification 53 55 71 based on these literature findings it could be concluded that the intense peaks at 1386 and 1539 cm 1 resulted from the interaction between the c o group of the three carboxyl groups cooh and the fe molecules present in the particle surface this result revealed that the binding of citric acid radicals to the surface of the particle took place by chemisorption of carboxyl groups transmittance of the broadened band from 2800 to 3200 cm 1 corresponding to the oh group did not decrease significantly indicating the carboxylate groups were not completely protonated this result also confirmed that the carboxylate groups remarkably contributed to the binding of citric acid radical to the surface of the particle zhang et al 73 conducted a study on the role of oh groups from citric acid in coordination with fe3o4 nanoparticles and explained the binding mechanism in detail according to the results it was found out that the c oh group did not participate in the coordination at acidic ph level and the binding of citric acid radicals on the particle surface totally took place via the cooh group on the other hand the c oh only contributed to the binding mechanism at ph 10 considering the stabilization was processed at a ph level around 1 5 in the current study the peaks observed at 1386 and 1539 cm 1 led the authors to think that the binding of the carboxyl groups of citric acid resulted in a complex formation of coo fe bonds at the mentioned peaks based on the ft ir results and the related literature findings it could be concluded that the iop was successfully stabilized using citric acid via the chemisorption of carboxylate groups the ft ir spectrum of the ncmp revealed the formation of two additional peaks at 561 and 586 cm 1 near the characteristic fe o band at 542 cm 1 which were assignable to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of si o fe bonds respectively fig 7c the peak at 798 and 977 cm 1 corresponded to the characteristic bands representing vibrations of si o si and si o bonds respectively another characteristic band appeared at 1068 cm 1 representing the stretching vibrations of si o si bonds comparable results were also reported by previous studies 72 74 77 these results showed that all the peaks were characteristic band reflections arising from the interaction between the iop and sio2 and that the particles were incorporated into the sio2 matrix as also revealed by xrd eds and sem results the ft ir spectrum of the ncmp mgfe zr showed that the characteristic band of the oh stretching shifted to 3363 cm 1 and the transmittance of the band increased slightly fig 7d this result was attributed to the introduction of the ldh precipitates into the particle composition which were initially prepared by precipitation of metal ion precursors in an alkaline medium it was observed that the si o fe band shifted to 578 cm 1 and intensity of both the si o fe and si o si bonds at 798 and 1066 cm 1 decreased slightly these spectral changes revealed that surface of the ncmp was successfully modified with the mgfe zr ldh 3 3 5 magnetic properties magnetization curves and data for magnetic characterization parameters were presented in fig 8 and table 2 respectively the obtained results demonstrated that the saturation magnetization value ms decreased in the order iop 64 6 emu g ncmp 38 2 emu g and ncmp mgfe zr 24 5 emu g fig 8a this expected result was due to the decrease in fe content with the addition of diamagnetic materials such as sio2 and mgfe zr ldh in the particle composition as demonstrated by eds results remanent magnetization mr and coercive force hc values were determined in the range of 2 57 and 3 83 emu g and 45 0 and 51 5 oe respectively a hysteresis loop was also obtained for the ncmp mg fe zr and depicted as inset fig 8b based on the relatively high ms and low hc and mr values obtained in a recent study 11 it was reported that the investigated particles exhibited ferromagnetic properties and possessed a possible magnetic softness leading to an effective particle separation from aqueous solutions in 2 s by applying an external magnetic field nevertheless no particle size analysis was performed in the mentioned study based on an evaluation of particle size dependent magnetization gregorio jauregui et al 56 reported that all of the examined nanoparticles having an average diameter below 15 0 nm exhibited a superparamagnetic behavior although the vsm measurements showed very small hc and mr values that were very similar to those obtained in the present study according to the given literature examples it would be difficult to conclude whether the particles exhibited superparamagnetic behavior since the crystallite size for all the particles were determined in the range of 12 2 and 82 0 nm in the present study a more realistic evaluation for determining the magnetic behavior of the particles was done according to an indicator the ratio of mr to ms if this value is below 0 1 90 of the magnetization is lost upon the removal of the applied magnetic field 78 according to the given mr to ms results table 2 the ratio was calculated to be 0 05 0 09 and 0 1 for the iop ncmp and ncmp mg fe zr respectively indicating that all the particles exhibited superparamagnetic behavior these results also showed that the superparamagnetic properties weakened as the fe content in the particle composition decreased the physical and chemical characteristics of the ncmp mgfe zr particle and their comparison with the previous reports were summarized in table 3 4 conclusions in the present study the composition of various ncmp ldh particles was screened based on their p removal performance stability and magnetic separability modification of the ncmp particle with various type of ldhs led to a nanocomposite material which exhibited higher p uptake as compared to the unmodified particle the increasing ldh content in the chemical composition of ncmp mgal ncmp mgfe and ncmp mgal zr particles resulted in an increase in the particle weight loss even at the lowest ldh content suggesting that a partial dissolution from these particles took place during the p removal on the other hand ncmp mgfe zr showed no dissolution at all up to a ldh content of 60 these results demonstrated that ncmp mgfe zr particle had a potential to exhibit excellent stability under even acidic ph and relatively high initial p concentration when the composition was adjusted optimally in addition to the ldh content magnetic ncmp content in the composition had also an influence on the magnetic separability of the particle the separation efficiency increased with the increasing ncmp content it was determined that the ncmp mgfe zr composed of 75 6 wt ncmp 500 mg ncmp was separated from the solution with a separation efficiency of 96 9 characterization results showed that the synthesized ncmp mgfe zr was a micron sized superparamagnetic particle that composed of nano sized crystallites and had a relatively large specific surface area in conclusion ncmp mgfe zr can be used for p removal as environmentally benign material due to its excellent stability however it is strongly recommended that further investigations should be performed to improve p removal performance of the particle desorption studies are also required to determine influencing factors for

12846,superparamagnetic nanocomposite microparticles ncmps modified with various layered double hydroxides ldhs mgfe mgal and their zr doped equivalents were investigated for phosphorus p removal screening of optimum composition was performed based on the p removal performance of ncmp ldh particles as well as their magnetic separability in a flow through column as a function of ncmp content 100 1000 mg and stability as a function of ldh content 20 100 the results showed that except for ncmp mgfe zr all the other particles exhibited a partial dissolution of ldh components at each of the examined ldh contents however ncmp mgfe zr showed no dissolution up to a ldh content of 60 at all whereas a partial dissolution occurred at a ldh content of 80 and 100 results of magnetic separability test revealed that the ncmp mgfe zr composed of 500 mg magnetic particle ncmp and 60 ldh was separated from the solution with a separation efficiency of 96 9 while lower ncmp contents resulted in lower separation efficiencies p removal efficiency and specific removal capacity of the ncmp mgfe zr with the optimized composition was found to be 18 5 and 53 1 mg g respectively the crystal structure chemical composition surface morphology crystallite size and particle size distribution functional groups and magnetic properties of the ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr particles were confirmed by various characterization analysis the observed results clearly demonstrates that the ncmp mgfe zr with the optimized composition remained stable during the removal experiments and enabled the removal of p under the conditions of acidic ph and relatively high p concentration without ldh dissolution graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords p removal magnetic ncmp ldh dissolution stability 1 introduction phosphorus p is a crucial element that is essential to all known forms of life despite its essential nature p has been dubbed life s bottleneck due to the relatively low abundance compared to other essential nutrients 1 the ever growing global population has resulted in an increasing demand for food production and consequently an increasing need for p to support agricultural activity 2 this has required intensive mining of phosphate rock pr as the agricultural activity is heavily dependent on the mined pr the only known primary source of p 3 according to the estimations 43 7 million tons pr had to be mined for 12 9 million tons of fertilizer in 1961 whereas 526 million tons of pr will need to be mined for 90 1 million tons of fertilizer by 2050 4 the natural p cycle has been interrupted by converting mined and relatively inactive pr into a range of more soluble and reactive p compounds this increased availability of highly reactive p in the environment has led to several undesirable consequences for ecosystem services such as reduced soil and aquatic biodiversity and increasing risks to human health due to eutrophication to manage p resources efficiently an acceleration for its recovery and reuse from various waste sectors has been needed due to the increasing cost of phosphate fertilizer a scarcity of high quality pr and increasing surface water pollution 5 therefore there has been a growing interest in the technical and economic feasibility of large scale systems for p recovery 6 to address the increasing water scarcity reducing pollution of water bodies and water related issues which are the most serious and longest term global problems of the present century efforts have been directed at innovating technologies related to water treatment 7 8 to remove p from wastewater in order to control and reduce the eutrophication problem various techniques including chemical precipitation biological p removal and adsorption etc have been developed however the chemical and biological removal of p involve several major drawbacks and challenges such as using of excessive chemical reagents secondary pollution arising from sludge formation and difficult optimization of biological removal systems as a well established technology adsorption processes often show good potential for p removal from wastewaters by offering several advantages such as low sludge production and simple operation 9 11 nanomaterials such as graphene carbon nanotubes layered double hydroxides and metal organic frameworks have been considered emerging options for wastewater remediation however their practical applications are limited by several drawbacks such as high cost complicated preparation process low removal ability and chemical instability 12 by means of recent advances in material chemistry and nanotechnology various nanocomposites ncs have been developed by combining different nanomaterials or modifying nanomaterials with functional molecules 13 for preparing magnetic ncs iron oxide nanoparticles ionps have been widely used as magnetic carrier nanomaterial due to their unique magnetic property and great biocompatibility 14 15 which render them attractive for their wide range of applications in fields such as magnetic storage medicine and chemical industries 16 as well as water purification applications 17 due to the great versatility of ionps their use in water purification and remediation of wastewaters have been reported in detail by several reviews 18 20 hence ionps have been extensively studied so far as they can achieve treatment performances with minimum masses reduction on materials and energy costs compared to conventional macroscale adsorbent materials such as activated carbons or zeolites furthermore the most highlighted utilization of ionps in water treatment applications has been of the adsorption of pollutants 21 after adsorbing the target pollutant ionps can be easily and rapidly extracted from aqueous mediums via magnetic separation processes without using filtration or sedimentation techniques by being utilized their superparamagnetic properties 14 22 however adsorption capacity of a magnetic nc is relatively small if its surface has not been initially subjected to any modification procedure allowing the selective removal of a target pollutant 23 therefore functionalization of the surface of magnetic ncs is often needed to enhance their adsorption performance for the selective adsorption of pollutants 17 23 layered double hydroxides ldhs are known as three dimensional nanostructured anionic clays composed of a mixture of di tri and tetra valent metal cations and n valent anion 22 24 25 ldhs possess a sandwich like structure in which the anions are sandwiched into the cationic metal layers in a repeating manner 26 in recent years ldhs have been investigated for removing dyes 27 28 and heavy metals 29 as well as different anions 30 31 among the anions p has been of the most investigated pollutant for removal studies by ldhs since the interlayer anions in the structure of ldhs are easily exchangeable and therefore ldhs exhibit excellent adsorption ability to anions 32 they have been suggested to be promising adsorbents for p removal from wastewaters 33 due to the lamellar structure and sub to micrometer size of ldh particles their use in packed filter columns and separation by filtration or sedimentation techniques become a challenge 25 on the other hand the application of ldhs as adsorbent is limited by their major drawbacks such as the aggregation of particles and difficulty in their regeneration and reusability 33 however it is possible to synthesize ldh based ncs by reacting the ncs with ldhs due to the rich ionic surface oh group and the inherent positive charge of ldhs 13 thus the combination of ldhs with magnetic ncs would efficiently improve the separation property of ldhs and enhance the adsorption performance of ncs 17 a wide variety of metal cations and interlayer anions can be used for synthesis of ldhs 34 the easy tunability of the cations and anions ensures constructing a flexible chemical composition for ldhs within a certain range 35 that can be specifically designed for the removal of a target pollutant thus various ldhs with different chemical compositions can be used to test and screen their removal performances for example the highest p removal performance was obtained by znfe zr and caznfe zr ldhs 36 fe3o4 mgfe zr ldh 37 or fe3o4 znal ldh 30 compared to the other tested ldh materials besides exhibiting a flexible chemical composition property ldhs need to be environmentally benign materials as the cations included in the composition of ldhs are released to the aqueous medium due to the dissolution of the cations depending on several influencing factors such as medium ph and initial p concentration 25 therefore ldhs may show poor stability and low sorption affinity under certain ambient conditions 38 nevertheless stability of ldhs can be improved by tuning the chemical composition this was evidenced in a recent study 38 where the p removal properties of mnfe ldhs mniifeiifeiii cl mniifeiii co3 and mnivfeiii co3 ldhs and their stability during exchanging interlayer cl with co3 and oxidation of mnii to mniv were investigated in the mentioned study it was demonstrated that up to 70 of total mn was released from the mniifeiifeiii cl ldhs at ph 7 in aqueous suspensions however lower mn dissolution 5 4 occurred when interlayer cl was exchanged with co3 moreover the stability of mniifeiii co3 was further improved by oxidizing mnii to mniv it was found out that the final material mnivfeiii co3 ldh showed no mn dissolution at all but relatively lower p sorption capacity as compared to the other materials in another study 37 mandel et al 2013 the experimental results showed that relatively lower ldh contents 20 and 40 did not cause significant dissolution from different ldh magnetic particles at the end of four cycles of p adsorption desorption whereas introducing a ldh content of 60 into the composition stimulated the dissolution of ldhs based on these findings it was suggested that relatively lower ldh contents e g 20 would be more favorable in terms of preventing significant particle losses and ensuring complete magnetic separation of particles for technical applications such as wastewater treatment therefore screening of optimal chemical composition and development of stable materials is of necessity and significance to reach practical environmental applications 35 38 since the dissolution from ldhs may pose a risk due to the release of hazardous substances e g components of pure ldhs or ldh based ncs to the environment during the removal of pollutant environmental applications of such materials are limited by the resultant material instability that may also affect the removal performance and magnetic separability of the materials considering ldh based nc materials are composed of fractions of the ldh and nc improving the stability and magnetic separability for such materials will require adjusting both the content of ldh and nc individually wt ldh versus a known amount of nc particle or vice versa in the composition of the final material however to the current knowledge of the authors screening of the optimum chemical composition based on both the content of ldh and nc has not yet been examined in the existing literature until now to determine structural properties of ldhs various and complementary measurement techniques are needed since synthetic ldhs are commonly not highly crystalline 39 in several studies dissolution of ldhs has been investigated by using various measurement techniques such as 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy 31p magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy powder x ray diffraction 25 atomic absorption spectroscopy 32 38 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry 40 41 or atomic emission spectroscopy 42 taking into consideration that dissolution of ldh components may result in a change in the particle weight the stability of particles can also be investigated based on the particle weight change that can be determined by measuring the dry particle weight before and after the removal experiment as it has been reported in previous studies 43 44 the magnetic ncs need to have a sufficient particle size in micrometer scale to achieve a faster solid liquid separation in lower magnetic field gradients in the current study taking advantage of the micron size of the synthesized particles the solids in the aqueous medium were filtered through filter papers under vacuum filtration in order to determine the dry weight of particles according to the well known technique apha 2540d used to determine total suspended solids thus the obtained results were used to investigate whether a particle weight change occurred during the p removal although the removal of p using pure ldhs or ldh based nc particles mgfe mgal and their zr doped equivalents has been extensively studied 25 32 37 40 41 the proposed approach has not yet been investigated until now while determining the optimum chemical composition and evaluating the stability of the tested materials to the current knowledge of the authors motivated by these concepts the main subjects of the present study were to i develop micron sized magnetic nc particles composed of superparamagnetic ionps and a protective and modifiable sio2 matrix ii modify the surface of nc particles using various ldhs iii screen the optimal composition as functions of varying ldh content and magnetic particle content iv evaluate the stability and magnetic separability of the particles v determine the best performing particle for p removal and vi characterize the particles 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical grade and were

2 synthesis of iron oxide particles iops iop sio2 and iop sio2 ldh particles synthesis of micron sized iop sio2 particle referred to as nanocomposite microparticle ncmp and its surface modification using various ldhs mgfe mgal and their zr doped equivalents were carried out as described by previously reported methods 37 43 45 the synthesized final material was referred to as ncmp ldh in this study 2 2 1 synthesis of well defined ncmps well defined ncmps were obtained by performing three sequential synthesis procedures as described by mandel 45 firstly iron oxide magnetic core nanomaterial was synthesized by chemical co precipitation of iron salts in an alkaline environment then the as precipitated nanoparticles were subjected to a dispersion procedure using diluted hno3 solution to obtain a sol a citric acid solution was used as stabilizing agent in this study finally the stabilized nanoparticles were incorporated in a protective and modifiable sio2 matrix by reacting the obtained sol with sodium silicate water glass solution 2 2 1 1 synthesis of iops an iron salt solution was prepared by dissolving 3 18 g fecl2 4h2o and 8 64 g fecl3 6h2o molar ratio of fe2 fe3 1 2 in 100 ml distilled water an ammonia solution was prepared by diluting 20 ml of nh4oh solution 25 wt in 100 ml distilled water these two solutions were mixed by pumping through peristaltic pumps longerpump bt100 1j with a flow rate corresponding to 20 and 22 rpm into a separatory funnel the black suspension formed in the outlet of the funnel was collected in a beaker that was placed on nine sets 3 3 of ndfeb ring magnets 6 pieces of magnets in each set to magnetically separate the nanoparticles the overall procedure was illustrated in fig s1 the nanoparticles were washed with 300 ml distilled water three times the particle concentration in the suspension was determined from the dry weight per volume of suspension to measure the dry weight of the particles a known volume of sample was taken and then filtered through a filter paper millipore ap40 drying of the filter paper was carried out in an oven at 105 c for 1 h based on the determined dry weight of the particle approximately 3 7 g a scale up was done by increasing the amount of starting solutions 2 2 1 2 dispersion and stabilization of the nanoparticles the washed nanoparticles 3 7 g were re suspended in 120 ml distilled water by stirring in a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm 0 66 m hno3 solution 45 was added dropwise using a burette into the nanoparticle suspension under stirring until ph value of the mixture was measured milwaukee mi150 as 1 5 while the resulting brown black sol stirred 10 ml of c6h8o7 h2o solution 0 5 g ml 46 47 was added and the mixture was further stirred for 30 min under the ambient temperature 2 2 1 3 synthesis of the ncmps 88 ml of nh4oh solution 25 wt was diluted in 80 ml distilled water the mixture was added to the stabilized nanoparticle sol and heated to 70 c while stirring at 300 rpm a sodium silicate water glass solution molar ratios nh3 hno3 na2o 3sio2 was added slowly through a syringe needle the reaction mixture was stirred for 5 min at 70 c after the mixture was cooled down to room temperature the obtained particles were magnetically separated and washed with 300 ml distilled water three times to prepare a stock ncmp suspension the synthesized particles were re suspended in a volumetrically scaled beaker an example was shown in fig s6c using a known volume of distilled water the stock suspension was stored at room temperature and left undisturbed until further use the particle concentration in the stock suspension was determined as described in section 2 2 1 1 the desired weight of the ncmps was adjusted by sampling a known volume of suspension from the homogeneously stirred stock suspension 2 2 2 synthesis of ldhs and deposition on the ncmps surface modification of the obtained ncmp was performed using various ldhs mgal mgfe mgal zr and mgfe zr ldhs for a selective p removal synthesis of the ldhs were carried out as described by drenkova tuhtan et al 22 briefly ldhs were precipitated by adding the respective metal ion precursor solution of 100 ml into a 0 15 m naoh solution 400 ml under stirring the mixtures were then neutralized with hcl solution 3 m to prepare the next step of ncmp ldhs a scale up was done by increasing the amount of the solutions in order to prepare stock ldh solutions the stock solutions pure ldh solution were stored at room temperature and left undisturbed until further use before using the solutions were stirred in magnetic stirrers to homogenize the ldh precipitates to prepare the ncmp ldhs a certain volume of ldh solution was added in a beaker and an identical volume of ncmp suspension containing the desired weight of ncmp was added into the ldh solution the mixture was stirred in a magnetic stirrer for 1 min transferred to 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks and exposed to ultrasonic treatment in an ultrasonic bath elmasonic s 80h for 3 min the obtained particles were magnetically separated and washed with 300 ml distilled water once after each of the synthesis procedures explained above was completed a proper volume of suspension was sampled for characterization analyses powdered samples were obtained by drying the magnetically separated particles in a vacuum drying oven daihan wisd thermostable ov 70 under the conditions of 50 c 24 h and 0 04 mpa and then grinding the dried material in a porcelain mortar the drying procedure was only applied to the particles for which the characterization analyses were performed through powdered form of the particles in order to maintain the characteristic features e g particle size distribution of the synthesized particles ncmp or ncmp ldhs used for p removal experiments the drying procedure was not applied to the particles 2 3 screening of the optimum composition of ncmp ldhs the optimum composition was screened based on the p removal performance stability and magnetic separability of the prepared ncmp ldhs particles for this purpose a series of batch experiments was carried out to determine the p removal performances of the ncmp ldhs as a function of ldh and ncmp content in the particle composition to determine the optimum ldh content and the most effective ncmp ldh the stability of the particles see section 2 4 for details during the p removal experiments and their p removal performances were evaluated the optimum ncmp content was determined based on the calculated data for the efficiency of magnetic separation in a flow through magnetic separation column see section 2 5 for details as well as the p removal performance of the particles 2 3 1 determination of the optimum ldh content and the most effective ncmp ldh experiment 1 to investigate the influence of ldh content on the p removal performance and stability of the ncmp ldhs the desired ldh content was adjusted before preparing the ncmp ldhs either by directly using the prepared stock ldh solution 100 ldh or by diluting a certain volume of the stock ldh solution with distilled water to obtain a ldh content of 20 40 60 or 80 in the ldh solution for each experimental run a certain volume of the stock ldh solution was transferred to a volumetrically scaled beaker and diluted to 150 ml with distilled water if required a ncmp suspension of 150 ml which contained approximately 200 mg ncmp particle was also transferred to another volumetrically scaled beaker to determine the weight of ldh precipitates and ncmps 25 ml of sample was taken with a pipette from each of the prepared ldh solutions and ncmp suspensions to prepare the ncmp ldhs the remaining ldh solution 125 ml was mixed with the remaining ncmp suspension 125 ml in a magnetic stirrer for 1 min and the mixture was subjected to the ultrasonic treatment as described in section 2 2 2 the obtained final mixtures of ncmp ldhs 250 ml were used for the p removal experiments a final mixture containing no ldh precipitate but only ncmp was also prepared by adding 125 ml distilled water into 125 ml ncmp suspension this particle without ldh modification was tested as control sample to determine any possible change in the weight of particle during the removal experiment the experimental procedure was illustrated in fig s2 2 3 2 determination of the optimum ncmp content experiment 2 the most effective ncmp ldh particle with the determined optimum ldh content was tested in this experimental stage the particle was prepared as described in section 2 3 1 but varying the weight of the ncmp ncmp content in mg in the ncmp suspension between 100 and 1000 mg adjusting the desired ncmp content was handled by transferring 150 ml of ncmp suspension that contained the desired weight of the particles into volumetrically scaled beakers through peristaltic pumps before transferring of the suspension it was mixed gently in a magnetic stirrer to homogenize the particles determination of the weight of ldh precipitates and ncmps in the respective solutions or suspensions were performed as described in section 2 3 1 a final mixture 125 ml ldh solution 125 ml distilled water containing no ncmp but only ldh precipitates was tested as control sample in addition a control group including the ncmps without ldh modification was also tested for that purpose a series of final mixtures 250 ml was prepared by adding 125 ml distilled water into 125 ml ncmp suspension containing the tested ncmp content the obtained final mixtures containing ncmp ldhs or ncmp were used for the p removal experiments the experimental procedure was illustrated in fig s3 2 3 3 p removal experiments for the p removal experiments in the experiment 1 and 2 aqueous solutions were prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of kh2po4 to give an initial p concentration of 150 mg l in each experimental run 750 ml of p solutions were added into the final mixtures of 250 ml a dilution factor of 0 25 was taken into account while calculating the specific removal capacity or removal efficiency ph of the resulting mixture was adjusted to 4 5 by adding 0 5 m hcl solution and the mixture was stirred in a magnetic stirrer daihan wisd wisestir msh 20d at 350 rpm for 1 h at the end of the experiment 50 ml of sample was taken and filtered through filter paper millipore ap40 after the filter paper was dried in an oven for 1 h the particle weight in the 1 l mixture was calculated residual p concentrations were determined in the filtrate samples and were measured by the vanadomolybdate method using merck test kit 114842 and an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer hach dr6000 according to the obtained data p removal capacity q in mg g and removal efficiency were calculated by the following equations 48 51 1 q c i c e m v 2 removal efficieny c i c e c i 100 where c i and c e are the initial and the residual p concentrations in mg l respectively m is the weight of particles measured before the removal experiment in g v is the volume of the resulting mixture in l 2 4 evaluation of the stability of the particles the stability of the particles was evaluated according to the change in the weight of the particles during the p removal experiments which was determined based on the dry weight of the particles measured before and after the p removal for the measurement procedure see section 2 2 1 1 the weight of the ncmps and ldh precipitates measured before the p removal experiments experiment 1 and 2 were presented in fig s2 and s3 the total weight change δwt in mg during the removal experiment for each of the tested ncmp ldhs was calculated from the weight of the ncmp ldh before wi in mg and after we in mg the removal experiment if the calculated value of the δwt was negative then it was denoted as a weight loss calculation of the net weight change δwn in mg which was equal to the net weight loss if present was done according to the calculated data for the removed p prem in mg and the δwt the data for the wi we δwt prem and δwn and the related calculations were presented in table s1 and s2 2 5 separability of the particles in a flow through magnetic separator to evaluate the separability of the ncmp ldhs the experimental setup illustrated in fig s6a was used the separation procedure was carried out as described in a previous study 44 accordingly control valve of the glass funnel containing the ncmp ldh suspension was turned on to drain the suspension towards the glass column diameter 15 0 mm volume 35 ml magnetic separation of the particles during the flow inside the column was achieved with the help of a magnet set consisting of 6 pieces of ndfeb permanent ring magnets diameter 15 7 mm and enclosing the external wall of the column fig s6b the liquid phase was drained from the column through the control valve and collected in a beaker the flow rate in the column was regulated through the control valves to determine the dry weight of the particles a known volume of sample was taken from the effluent and filtered through a filter paper millipore ap40 drying of the filter paper was carried out in an oven at 105 c for 1 h the separation efficiency was calculated by the following equation 3 separation efficieny w i w e w i 100 where w i and w e are the dry weight of the particles measured before and after the separation in mg respectively 2 6 characterization of the particles a scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss gemini 300 sem equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer eds system bruker xflash 6i100 was employed to reveal the morphology and chemical composition of the particles sem and eds was carried out at 5 kev field emission and 15 kev respectively functional groups were

using the multi point n2 brunauer emmett teller bet method by a specific surface and pore size analyzer micromeritics tristar ii 3200 prior to the measurement the samples were degassed at 105 c for at least 8 h the crystal structure of the particles was obtained by x ray diffraction xrd analysis conducted on an x ray diffractometer bruker d8 advance employing a cukα radiation λ 0 15418 nm data were

magnet vsm 550 with an applied field between 10 0 to 10 0 koe at room temperature 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of the ldh content on the p removal performance and stability of the particles the experimental results of the effect of varying ldh content on the p removal efficiency and specific removal capacity were presented in fig 1a and b respectively the removal efficiency of the control sample was found to be 2 2 fig 1a on the other hand higher removal efficiencies were obtained for each type of the ncmp ldhs at each ldh content due to the introduction of ldh precipitates into the particle composition as compared to the control sample the modifications with the examined ldhs increased the removal efficiency in the range of 4 4 and 25 8 depending on the ldh content and type of the ldh for example zr doped mgfe ldhs exhibited higher p removal at each ldh contents than those of their undoped equivalents whereas zr doped mgal ldhs did not reflect the same effect according to the results the highest removal efficiencies were obtained at 100 ldh content for ncmp mgal ncmp mgal zr and ncmp mgfe zr with a removal efficiency of 28 0 22 8 and 18 9 respectively while ncmp mgfe ldh showed the best performance at 60 ldh content with a removal efficiency of 14 2 the specific removal capacity of the control sample was determined as 15 5 mg g fig 1b comparing the results for the ncmp ldhs it was observed that the specific removal capacity generally increased for all ncmp ldhs with the increasing ldh content up to 60 but it decreased at a ldh content of 80 and 100 the highest removal capacity was obtained in the order ncmp mgal 69 2 mg g ncmp mgfe zr 69 0 mg g ncmp mgal zr 67 3 mg g and ncmp mgfe 60 2 mg g at 60 ldh content as a result of evaluation of the findings it could be concluded that the best performing particle and the optimal ldh content was ncmp mgal ldh and 100 respectively according to the removal efficiency values on the other hand the optimal ldh content was 60 and the best performing particle was ncmp mgal or ncmp mgfe zr according to the specific removal capacity values these findings clearly showed that evaluating only the results of p removal performances did not help to decide on selecting the optimal ldh content and the most effective particle therefore further evaluations were performed in order to determine the stability of the particles by taking the results of particle weight change and weight loss if present during the p removal experiments into account for further details on the calculation of the particle weight change and weight loss see section 2 4 according to the data for the control sample it was observed that the increase in the particle weight change δwt was 3 mg and that it was almost equal to the calculated value of the removed p prem of 2 7 mg table s1 this result revealed that no weight loss occurred for the non ldh functionalized particle confirming no dissolution of either silica or iron took place from the particle a similar result was also obtained for ncmp mgfe zr where no weight loss δwt occurred up to 60 ldh content however increasing the ldh content above 60 caused a net weight loss δwn of 24 7 and 49 8 mg at 80 and 100 ldh content respectively fig 2 for the other particles δwn values were determined in the range of 1 9 and 66 8 mg for ncmp mgfe 9 4 and 81 3 mg for ncmp mgal zr and 13 9 and 160 3 mg for ncmp mgal as a function of the increasing ldh content the highest δwn values for a given ldh content followed the order ncmp mgal ncmp mgal zr ncmp mgfe and ncmp mgfe zr the weight losses occurred were also evaluated by comparing the data i wldh ratio of the weight of ldh precipitates to the total weight of ncmp ldh particle measured before the removal experiment wi and ii nwl the ratio of the δwn to the wi fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3 the wldh value for a given type of ncmp ldh increased with the increasing ldh content the highest wldh values for a given ldh content followed the order ncmp mgal ncmp mgal zr ncmp mgfe zr and ncmp mgfe except for the ncmp mgfe zr the same trend was also observed for the nwl values which ranged between 5 7 and 25 5 for ncmp mgal 4 3 and 18 1 for ncmp mgal zr and 0 81 and 16 6 for ncmp mgfe these results clearly revealed that there was a relationship between the nwl and the wldh values meaning the weight loss increased as the weight of the ldh precipitate in the particle composition ldh content increased this relationship was also reported in a study showing that the weight losses due to the dissolution of the ldh magnetic particles including 20 and 40 ldh content were in the range of 3 and 5 after four cycles of p adsorption desorption but the weight losses were significantly higher for the particles with 60 of ldh content 37 it has been known that although non ldh functionalized magnetic nc materials which are composed of ionps included in a protective silica matrix are chemically stable over a wide range of ph 0 12 acidic environments cause partial or severe dissolution of ldh shells from ldh functionalized ncs depending on the ph level 45 this phenomenon was evidenced in a study 32 showing that p adsorption capacity of mgal ldh decreased with the increase of ph from 3 to 10 and reached maximum at the ph of 3 0 where a certain amount of mg2 and al3 were being released from the ldh into the solution as a result of the mg and al dissolution it was suggested that the resulting formation of mg and al p precipitates contributed to the removal of p as well as the removal by chemical and electrostatic interaction between the ldh surface and p anion in another study 25 it was also demonstrated that acidic ph conditions stimulated mgfe ldh dissolution resulting in formation of ferrihydrite particles and caused poor material stability as compared to alkaline ph level conditions in addition relatively high solution p concentrations also stimulated the dissolution at alkaline ph levels resulting in formation of mg p precipitates based on the ldh instability the main p removal pathway at acidic ph level was suggested as sorption by ferrihydrite particles as also demonstrated by the previous studies 32 41 42 the adsorption of p by ldhs may take place via complex combination of several mechanisms including electrostatic and chemical interaction between the ldh surface and p anion ligand exchange and precipitation of secondary p phases 32 40 the mechanism of p uptake by magnetic composite microparticles modified with mgfe zr ldh was suggested to involve ion exchange and intercalation into the ldh structure under the ph condition of 4 5 5 44 furthermore it was suggested that monovalent phosphate species h2po4 was preferentially intercalated into the ldh structure in exchange with hydroxyl ions at the ph level between 3 and 6 however half of the dissociated species were divalent ions hpo4 2 at neutral ph resulting in a decrease in the p uptake 22 considering the explained removal mechanisms it should be noteworthy to mention that the δwn values were calculated based on the assumption that all the removed p ions were already present in the filterable forms of the ncmp ldhs particles and or cation p precipitates regardless of which of the removal mechanisms contributed to the p removal filtration of the solids in the p solution and subsequent determination of the dry particle weight enabled to obtain the data required to calculate the δwn values and determine the stability of the particles according to the results it was revealed that the ncmp mgal exhibiting the highest p removal performance fig 1 was the particle where the highest weight loss occurred as compared to the other particles figs 2 and 3 however it was found that the ncmp mgfe zr was quite stable in the case of the ldh content was lower than 60 and showed no dissolution at all consequently it was decided that the optimal ldh content was 60 which also maximized the p removal performance for all ncmp ldhs and that the most effective particle was ncmp mgfe zr 3 2 effect of the ncmp content on the p removal performance and magnetic separability of the particles the experimental results of the effect of ncmp content on the p removal performance of ncmp mgfe zr particles were presented in fig 4 the results related to removal efficiencies showed that the ncmp mgfe zr particles performed higher p removal than the non ldh functionalized control samples fig 4a the removal efficiencies for the control group varied between 5 6 and 9 2 while the removal efficiency of the control sample containing only mgfe zr ldh was determined as 19 8 the removal efficiency of ncmp mgfe zr particles varied between 18 5 and 21 2 these results revealed that the variation of ncmp content in the particle composition did not cause any considerable impact on the p removal efficiency the specific removal capacities of ncmp mgfe zr particles were higher than that of the non ldh functionalized control samples at each ncmp content fig 4b the specific removal capacity of the control sample containing no ncmp but only mgfe zr ldh was determined as 143 4 mg g which was the highest specific removal capacity as compared for all the other particles the specific removal capacity of ncmp mgfe zr particles varied between 18 6 and 92 5 mg g as a function of the ncmp content and decreased as the ncmp content increased this was because approximately the same amount of p ions was removed per unit mass of the particle for each of the ncmp mgfe zr particles fig 4a although the control sample pure ldh performed the highest specific removal capacity it was not chosen as the best performing particle since pure ldhs without fe exhibit diamagnetic properties 37 and therefore it is almost impossible to magnetically separate and reuse them in a cycling removal recovery process the examined ncmp mgfe zr particles were further evaluated based on the results of the weight change and the separability test carried out in the flow through magnetic separation column the results related to the weight change showed that there was no weight loss for all ncmp mgfe zr particles which composed of the same ldh content and for the control samples containing no ldh but only ncmp even though the increasing ncmp content table s2 these results indicated that no dissolution occurred during the p removal and confirmed the earlier results obtained for the ncmp mgfe zr particle with 60 ldh content and the control sample as can be seen in the table s3 the percentage of the weight of ncmp wncmp in the composition of each of the ncmp mgfe zr particles varied as a function of the ncmp content and it increased as the ncmp content increased the increasing value of the wncmp was expected to let the particles to be separated at relatively high separation efficiency in the magnetic separation column it was calculated that the particle contained 100 mg ncmp which was found out to have the highest specific removal capacity fig 4b contained the lowest ncmp content 42 2 whereas the particle containing 1000 mg ncmp with the lowest specific removal capacity contained the highest ncmp content 86 7 as understood from these results deciding on the most effective particle by taking only the removal performances into consideration was not reasonable in a study the most suitable composition was determined by examining the effect of different amounts of alkali treated calcium silicate composite asc and fe3o4 included in the composition of fe3o4 asc particles on the p removal performance 14 according to the experimental results the specific removal capacity increased from 82 to 128 mg g as the ratio of fe3o4 to asc decreased from 2 1 to 1 3 as a function the increasing asc content in the composition of fe3o4 asc particles and selection of the best performing particle was done by considering the magnetism as well as the p removal capacity in the separability tests only the particles containing 100 250 and 500 mg of ncmp was tested the particles containing 750 and 1000 mg ncmp were not tested as those particles had relatively lower specific removal capacity fig 4b although they contained relatively higher ncmp table s3 and therefore would be probably separated with higher efficiency in the magnetic separation column the separability tests were carried out using one fourth of the 1000 ml ncmp mgfe zr mixtures that were used in the removal experiment therefore one fourth of the calculated we values were taken into calculation table s3 according to the results efficiency of the magnetic separation increased with the increasing value of the wncmp in the composition of the tested ncmp mgfe zr particles the highest separation efficiency was calculated to be 96 9 for the particle containing 500 mg ncmp fig s6c whereas lower separation efficiencies 80 8 and 89 0 were obtained for the other tested particles containing lower ncmp contents based on the obtained experimental results the ncmp mgfe zr particle composing of 60 ldh content and 500 mg ncmp was investigated to determine its characteristic features 3 3 characterization results 3 3 1 crystal structure and chemical composition the xrd patterns of the iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr were illustrated in fig 5 the reflections 220 311 400 422 511 440 and 533 obtained for the iop the black diffractogram were observed at diffraction peaks at 2θ of 30 1 35 5 37 1 43 1 57 0 62 6 and 74 1 respectively a similar diffraction pattern was also reported by earlier studies 14 27 52 53 the obtained pattern with intense and sharp peaks well fitted the reference crystal surface structure of fe3o4 inorganic crystal structure database icsd collection code 77588 54 and revealed the formation of single phase cubic spinel structure with lattice constant a 8 377 å which was very close to the reported value for fe3o4 55 as is known chemical co precipitation of fe2 and fe3 salts in an alkaline environment usually produces a mixture magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe2o3 56 since diffraction patterns of both species are very similar differentiation between both species is not possible 57 therefore it should be noted that the particle synthesized in the current study was referred to as iron oxide particle iop because any differentiation analysis was not conducted to decide whether fe3o4 or γ fe2o3 was obtained but at least it could be concluded that the iop obtained in the current study was neither goethite α feooh nor hematite α fe2o3 based on the absence of peaks at 2θ of 21 2 110 and 33 1 104 in the obtained xrd pattern 58 in addition to that hwang et al 59 reported that the synthesized particle was α fe2o3 of which the xrd pattern was well matched with the α fe2o3 structures with lattice constant of a 5 0356 å the diffraction pattern for the ncmp the red diffractogram resulted a good matching with the reference crystal surface structure of iron oxide silicon icsd collection code 87459 the lattice constant a 8 374 å confirmed the formation of single phase cubic particles the reflections and the intensities and sharpness of peaks remained almost the same as those obtained for the iop fig 5 as also previously observed by lee et al 60 this result implied that dispersion with diluted hno3 solution and stabilization with citric acid solution did not cause any remarkable distortion in the crystal structure of the ncmp and thus it was synthesized as a composite particle after coating the stabilized iop with sio2 without any remarkable alter in the phase property of the iop the diffraction pattern for the ncmp mgfe zr the blue diffractogram showed that the reflection intensities decreased after modifying the ncmp with mgfe zr ldh in addition to this two new peaks appeared at 2θ of 31 5 and 45 1 which could be attributed to the presence of mgfe zr shells the results of eds analysis for the iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr were presented in fig s4 according to the results it was observed that oxygen o and fe were the major elements with a mass of 22 7 and 73 7 respectively in the composition of the iop fig s4a this result indicated that the resulting composition was quite close to the chemical composition of pure fe3o4 which has a mass based composition of 27 6 o and 72 3 fe however fe content of the ncmp decreased to 12 7 with the introduction of sio2 fig s4b on the other hand mass of o and carbon c increased to 33 8 and 6 0 respectively the reason of these increases was most likely due to the introduction of an additional c source from citric acid and an additional o source from either citric acid or sio2 the mass for si was measured to be 47 4 meaning that a robust sio2 coating was performed the results obtained for the ncmp mgfe zr confirmed the presence of metal precursor ions of the ldh mg fe and zr and their corresponding salts cl in the composition of the synthesized material as well as a negligible amount of sodium fig s4c it was observed that the mass of fe did not change remarkably since fe ions in the mgfe zr made an additional contribution to the chemical composition although its mass value was expected to decrease as compared to its mass value in the ncmp as a summary it was concluded that each of the synthesized materials was consistent with its elements which further supported the xrd results 3 3 2 crystallite size and particle size distribution according to the results the average crystallite size calculated via the scherrer equation was found to be 53 3 and 82 0 nm for the bare iop and ncmp respectively data not shown depending on the variations in the procedures applied to synthesize bare iops different average crystallite sizes were reported in the literature varying in the range of 8 10 nm 55 15 20 nm 9 32 55 nm 10 62 5 nm 61 and 395 nm 48 in the current study the increase in the crystallite size of the ncmp by 53 8 could be attributed to the stabilization of the bare iop with citric acid and then incorporation of the stabilized particles into the sio2 matrix a similar result was also found out by ajmal et al 10 showing that there was an increase in the size of the nanoparticles by 18 7 after coating with sio2 intertwining of the ncmp with mgfe zr ldhs by ultrasonic treatment caused an important decrease in the average crystallite size of ncmp mgfe zr by 85 1 which equals to a size of 12 2 nm this result showed that crystallites in the ncmp mgfe zr became smaller in size as compared to those in the bare iop this was attributed to the ultrasonic treatment which allowed to distribute and break a great portion of the ncmp crystallites and re arrange them as individual crystallites a similar finding was also reported by koilraj et al 62 demonstrated that the average particle dimension for the ultrasonically treated ldh was smaller than the other examined ldhs which were subjected to a hydrothermal or mechanical shaking treatment due to the tearing breaking of nanosheets during the ultrasonic treatment the results obtained in the current study revealed that each of the synthesized iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr materials were composed of nano sized crystallites smaller than an average size of 100 nm sem micrographs of the particles were also supported this finding fig s5g h and i the results of the particle size distribution determined via fd technique and the relevant particle size parameters for the synthesized particles were presented in fig 6 and table 1 respectively according to the results particle sizes ranged between 0 128 and 31 1 μm for the bare iop 0 405 and 31 1 μm for the ncmp and 0 276 and 27 4 μm for the ncmp mgfe zr fig 6 similarly qiao et al 24 found out that most of the magnetic fe3o4 zn al fe la ldh particles had a diameter ranging between 2 and 50 μm and the mean diameter was measured to be 41 28 μm depending on the particle size distribution results obtained in the current study it can be concluded that each of the synthesized iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr materials were micron sized particles these finding was also supported with the sem micrographs fig s5a b and c comparing the particle size results and the sem micrographs it could be questioned that why a micron sized iop was obtained rather than nano sized particles which can be synthesized through a well known nanoparticle synthesis procedure this might be considered as a valid question however it should always be kept in mind that agglomerated iops are obtained in the first step when co precipitation of iron salts from solutions by the addition of an alkali is used to prepare superparamagnetic nanoparticles 45 that was the reason why a dispersion procedure using a diluted hno3 solution was performed to obtain a ferrofluid a sol with nano sized crystallites after obtaining the agglomerated iops in the current study in addition the micron sized ncmp was synthesized intentionally in order to address the objectives of the study it should be noted that the given particle size results and the sem micrographs need to be carefully interpreted in the view of the information given above rawle 63 reported the reasons for the different interpretations of the result sets of particle size measurements obtained by bet measurements and laser diffraction technique for the term nano and micron based on the experimental results it was suggested that the term nano could be applied to the bet measurements and micron could be applied to the laser diffraction technique consequently it was emphasized that a great care should be taken while describing particulate systems in terms of nano or micro since the term size in particle size analysis are related to the type of measurement undertaken comparing results of percentile of the cumulative volume distribution dv it was observed that size of the particles showed a correlation with the average size of the crystallites table 1 accordingly the highest average particle size dv50 followed the order ncmp iop and ncmp mgfe zr the dv90 results were measured to be 17 1 18 7 and 13 9 μm for the iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr particles respectively meaning that 90 the total volume of the particles was smaller than those measured dv90 values table 1 the calculated values for the change in the particle size based on the dv90 results showed that the particle size of ncmp increased by 9 3 after coating with sio2 whereas a decrease by 25 6 was observed after modifying the ncmp with mgfe zr ldh 3 3 3 surface morphology surface morphology of the particles was investigated by sem micrographs and measuring the bet specific surface area sem micrographs for the iop revealed the formation of nano sized crystallites fig s5g which were packed in micron sized agglomerated particles fig s5a and d from fig s5b it can be obviously seen that less agglomerated and well dispersed ncmp particles were formed as explained by a proposed mechanism for dispersion and stabilization of iops 57 dispersion of as precipitated iops with diluted hno3 solution allowed to suppress agglomeration of the particles and functionalization of particle surface with carboxylates using citric acid solution resulted in stabilization of the particles sterically thus hindering the formation of agglomerated particles during synthesis of the ncmp fig s5e clearly exhibited that the iops were confined in a sio2 matrix formation of a raspberry like micron sized particle including the nano sized spherical crystallites was more obviously seen in fig s5h sem micrographs for the ncmp mgfe zr revealed that the particles became denser and showed a sponge like porous structure after modifying the ncmp with mgfe zr ldh fig s5c f and i the bet specific surface area of the particles was 84 0 89 5 and 105 9 m2 g for the iop ncmp and ncmp mgfe zr respectively data not shown mandel 45 reported that the iops had a specific surface area of 50 to 75 m2 g and composite particles modified with ldhs had a specific surface area of 90 to 105 m2 g in addition several studies 10 11 14 48 reported that nanoparticles with specific surface area values ranged between 85 8 and 137 m2 g were synthesized the obtained results in the present study were in accordance with those reported results ajmal et al 10 found out that bet surface area of the materials showed a reverse correlation with particle size distributions meaning the highest specific surface area was obtained for the particle with the lowest particle size interestingly a higher specific surface area was obtained for the ncmp mgfe zr compared to those of the iop and ncmp although the measured particle size of the ncmp mgfe zr was lower than those of the other particles table 1 this result could be attributed to the sponge like porous structure of the ncmp mgfe zr created after the ultrasonic treatment obtaining such a result could be important and desirable because particles with relatively small specific surface area and large particle size were considered ineffective for their application as a magnetic host in loading functional reagents 11 moreover the particles with large surface area were thought to be promising candidates for their modifications required for specific removal applications 45 the increase in the surface area of the ncmp mgfe zr compared to the iop and ncmp showed that the ncmp was successfully modified with mgfe zr ldh as supported by eds results given in fig s4c a similar finding was also reported by nyaba et al 64 as a result it was concluded that the ultrasonic treatment had a key role in order to obtain a composite microparticle with relatively higher specific surface area as well as deposition of modification reagents on the particle surface 3 3 4 functional groups the atr ft ir spectra of the synthesized particles were presented in fig 7a d fig 7a showed the typical ft ir spectrum of as precipitated iops which exhibited various characteristic peaks at 548 1622 and 3282 cm 1 the peak at 548 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of the fe o bonds 65 although several literature studies reported this characteristic fe o vibration peak at near 580 cm 1 region 11 58 66 68 however these data were reported to be the measurement reflections which were yielded in a polar environment of kbr pellet and thereby resulted in a shift in the peak position 65 the peaks at 1622 and 3282 cm 1 were assigned to the characteristic bands of bending vibration of absorbed water and surface hydroxyl and o h stretching mode respectively 58 60 67 69 it was reported that these two characteristic bands of oh groups appeared in the ft ir spectrum since surface of iops were readily covered with oh groups during preparation of iops by the chemical co precipitation method 70 although the chemical co precipitation is considered as the simplest and most cost effective technique used to synthesize iops lack of good colloidal stability and inadequate repulsive forces leading to agglomeration of particles due to electrostatic stabilization via na ions in an alkaline medium are the main disadvantages of this technique 53 58 to overcome these problems de agglomeration of the particles after precipitation is necessary at first then the particles should be sterically stabilized against re agglomeration over a wide ph range using a proper stabilizing agent 45 in the current study diluted hno3 solution was used to disperse the as precipitated iops and citric acid solution was used as stabilizing agent it has been known that a citric acid molecule possessing two terminal coohs one central cooh and one c oh group makes contribution to the binding with iops via the fe oh groups 71 in the ft ir spectrum of the stabilized iop it was observed that transmittance of the stretching vibration of the fe o bonds at 543 cm 1 was not decreased fig 7b this indicated that there was no interaction between fe molecules and oxygen molecules of carbonyl c o groups the peaks at the region between 823 and 1116 cm 1 could be attributed the c c stretching bonds 65 compared to the iop two additional intense peaks were observed for the stabilized iop at the wavelengths 1386 and 1539 cm 1 these peaks corresponded to coo fe bonds 72 which appeared due to the absorption of citric acid radicals on the particle surface several studies examining the ft ir spectra of pure citric acid and citric acid modified iops reported that c o vibration of the cooh group appeared as a characteristic band for pure citric acid at a wavelength ranging from 1710 to 1739 cm 1 and that the band shifted to an intense wavelength 1547 to 1615 cm 1 after the modification 53 55 71 based on these literature findings it could be concluded that the intense peaks at 1386 and 1539 cm 1 resulted from the interaction between the c o group of the three carboxyl groups cooh and the fe molecules present in the particle surface this result revealed that the binding of citric acid radicals to the surface of the particle took place by chemisorption of carboxyl groups transmittance of the broadened band from 2800 to 3200 cm 1 corresponding to the oh group did not decrease significantly indicating the carboxylate groups were not completely protonated this result also confirmed that the carboxylate groups remarkably contributed to the binding of citric acid radical to the surface of the particle zhang et al 73 conducted a study on the role of oh groups from citric acid in coordination with fe3o4 nanoparticles and explained the binding mechanism in detail according to the results it was found out that the c oh group did not participate in the coordination at acidic ph level and the binding of citric acid radicals on the particle surface totally took place via the cooh group on the other hand the c oh only contributed to the binding mechanism at ph 10 considering the stabilization was processed at a ph level around 1 5 in the current study the peaks observed at 1386 and 1539 cm 1 led the authors to think that the binding of the carboxyl groups of citric acid resulted in a complex formation of coo fe bonds at the mentioned peaks based on the ft ir results and the related literature findings it could be concluded that the iop was successfully stabilized using citric acid via the chemisorption of carboxylate groups the ft ir spectrum of the ncmp revealed the formation of two additional peaks at 561 and 586 cm 1 near the characteristic fe o band at 542 cm 1 which were assignable to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of si o fe bonds respectively fig 7c the peak at 798 and 977 cm 1 corresponded to the characteristic bands representing vibrations of si o si and si o bonds respectively another characteristic band appeared at 1068 cm 1 representing the stretching vibrations of si o si bonds comparable results were also reported by previous studies 72 74 77 these results showed that all the peaks were characteristic band reflections arising from the interaction between the iop and sio2 and that the particles were incorporated into the sio2 matrix as also revealed by xrd eds and sem results the ft ir spectrum of the ncmp mgfe zr showed that the characteristic band of the oh stretching shifted to 3363 cm 1 and the transmittance of the band increased slightly fig 7d this result was attributed to the introduction of the ldh precipitates into the particle composition which were initially prepared by precipitation of metal ion precursors in an alkaline medium it was observed that the si o fe band shifted to 578 cm 1 and intensity of both the si o fe and si o si bonds at 798 and 1066 cm 1 decreased slightly these spectral changes revealed that surface of the ncmp was successfully modified with the mgfe zr ldh 3 3 5 magnetic properties magnetization curves and data for magnetic characterization parameters were presented in fig 8 and table 2 respectively the obtained results demonstrated that the saturation magnetization value ms decreased in the order iop 64 6 emu g ncmp 38 2 emu g and ncmp mgfe zr 24 5 emu g fig 8a this expected result was due to the decrease in fe content with the addition of diamagnetic materials such as sio2 and mgfe zr ldh in the particle composition as demonstrated by eds results remanent magnetization mr and coercive force hc values were determined in the range of 2 57 and 3 83 emu g and 45 0 and 51 5 oe respectively a hysteresis loop was also obtained for the ncmp mg fe zr and depicted as inset fig 8b based on the relatively high ms and low hc and mr values obtained in a recent study 11 it was reported that the investigated particles exhibited ferromagnetic properties and possessed a possible magnetic softness leading to an effective particle separation from aqueous solutions in 2 s by applying an external magnetic field nevertheless no particle size analysis was performed in the mentioned study based on an evaluation of particle size dependent magnetization gregorio jauregui et al 56 reported that all of the examined nanoparticles having an average diameter below 15 0 nm exhibited a superparamagnetic behavior although the vsm measurements showed very small hc and mr values that were very similar to those obtained in the present study according to the given literature examples it would be difficult to conclude whether the particles exhibited superparamagnetic behavior since the crystallite size for all the particles were determined in the range of 12 2 and 82 0 nm in the present study a more realistic evaluation for determining the magnetic behavior of the particles was done according to an indicator the ratio of mr to ms if this value is below 0 1 90 of the magnetization is lost upon the removal of the applied magnetic field 78 according to the given mr to ms results table 2 the ratio was calculated to be 0 05 0 09 and 0 1 for the iop ncmp and ncmp mg fe zr respectively indicating that all the particles exhibited superparamagnetic behavior these results also showed that the superparamagnetic properties weakened as the fe content in the particle composition decreased the physical and chemical characteristics of the ncmp mgfe zr particle and their comparison with the previous reports were summarized in table 3 4 conclusions in the present study the composition of various ncmp ldh particles was screened based on their p removal performance stability and magnetic separability modification of the ncmp particle with various type of ldhs led to a nanocomposite material which exhibited higher p uptake as compared to the unmodified particle the increasing ldh content in the chemical composition of ncmp mgal ncmp mgfe and ncmp mgal zr particles resulted in an increase in the particle weight loss even at the lowest ldh content suggesting that a partial dissolution from these particles took place during the p removal on the other hand ncmp mgfe zr showed no dissolution at all up to a ldh content of 60 these results demonstrated that ncmp mgfe zr particle had a potential to exhibit excellent stability under even acidic ph and relatively high initial p concentration when the composition was adjusted optimally in addition to the ldh content magnetic ncmp content in the composition had also an influence on the magnetic separability of the particle the separation efficiency increased with the increasing ncmp content it was determined that the ncmp mgfe zr composed of 75 6 wt ncmp 500 mg ncmp was separated from the solution with a separation efficiency of 96 9 characterization results showed that the synthesized ncmp mgfe zr was a micron sized superparamagnetic particle that composed of nano sized crystallites and had a relatively large specific surface area in conclusion ncmp mgfe zr can be used for p removal as environmentally benign material due to its excellent stability however it is strongly recommended that further investigations should be performed to improve p removal performance of the particle desorption studies are also required to determine influencing factors for

12847,this study aims to define effects of industrial wastewater treatment iwt and water recovery wr processes by using life cycle assessment lca and environmental life cycle cost elcc methodologies the functional unit was applied as 1 m3 of treated water the environmental impacts were evaluated using cml ia baseline and recipe midpoint h impact assessment methods according to the results abiotic depletion potential fossil fuel adpff 14 1 global warming potential gwp 9 6 marine ecotoxicity potential metp 43 9 photochemical oxidation potential pop 9 4 acidification potential ap 16 9 are main impact categories for cml ia whereas human carcinogenic toxicity potential 6 6 human non carcinogenic toxicity potential 6 8 and water consumption potential 81 2 are those for recipe midpoint h the lca results show that electrical energy is the dominant process with higher than 90 of these main impacts except metp 17 wr process has remarkable benefits from the point of impact categories such as adpff gwp pop and ap elcc value of wr process is approximately 20 higher than that of iwt process as a conclusion electricity consumption is the first step of more efficient energy use and the general and local authorities for industrial parks need to create an appropriate energy policy for wastewater treatment plants keywords environmental life cycle cost life cycle assessment wastewater treatment water recovery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction industrial production is one of the main causes of water consumption worldwide organized industrial parks oips are the hot points that consume high volumes of process water in europe manufacturing industry accounts for about 40 of total water abstractions furthermore the industrial sector is a major water polluter as only up to 60 value based on data from eight countries of industrial wastewater receives treatment before being disposed of into the environment 1 according to turkey statistical institute for oips water and wastewater statistics records it was stated that 185 million m3 of water was taken by the oips from the water supply network in 2018 besides about 252 million m3 of wastewater was treated in oips wastewater treatment plant wwtp 2 on the other hand since there are many different companies or manufacturers in oips the characteristic of wastewater has very diverse in terms of pollutants to meet the requirement of the environmental impacts of municipal or industrial zones discharges the conventional wwt process includes various combined treatment processes such as mechanical chemical treatment biological treatment additionally recently the tertiary treatment stages have been started to construct to provide recycled water to use where is possible to solve the certain problem such as water scarcity 3 and quality impairment 4 in the foreground the reuse of wastewater process might be complex due to its components high cost investment technology energy and resource demanding 5 on the other hand in the background the use of chemical materials and energy consumption during the treatment of wastewater causes environmental impacts the amount of these impacts alters according to the wwt method therefore it is necessary to use appropriate assessment methods to determine its impacts on the environment environmental performance information of wastewater systems for decision makers can be evaluated by life cycle assessment lca methodology which is a transparent and standardized approach 6 the lca is an analysis method that can assess measure and report the environmental impact of a product system or a process during the lifecycle from deriving raw material to processing production usage end of life and elimination and inform source efficiency and amount of waste 7 lca methodology has been used to determine the environmental impacts of wwtps some literature studies with the keywords of lca and wwtp were detail examined and the remarkable findings are given in table 1 as seen from the table 1 the literature studies focus on the environmental impacts on the other hand the cost of environmental impacts also should be considered to see the big picture from this point this study aims to combine life cycle assessment with environmental life cycle cost elcc methodology ellc is a type of lcc methodology it is an assessment of all costs associated with the life cycle of a product that are directly included by one or more of the actors in the product life cycle with complementary inclusion of externalities that are anticipated to be internalized in the decision relevant future 8 the methodology used in this study previously applied by günkaya 8 was expressed as the way to cover external environmental costs in elcc is to use monetary weighted results which are gathered from the environmental assessment analysis for instance lca in the lca analysis monetary assessment is not widely applied as the decision support tool however certain studies 9 11 discussed the advantages of using monetary valuation in the weighting stage of the lca the weighting step aims to make comparisons between the environmental effects measured by different units and therefore incomparable companies that can control environmental costs can be more competitive and minimize the negative impact of social life pizzol et al 12 and nguyen et al 13 examined the results of the lca in together with the monetization model moreover european monetization models such as eps2000 14 ecotax 15 stepwise2006 16 and recipe 17 were used to particularly the implementation of the market price method in lca however there are limited studies examines on the environmental and economic assessment by using the lca of industrial wastewater treatment for recovery application in the industrial park therefore this study considers defining the effects of industrial wastewater treatment iwt and water recovery wr processes by means of lca and elcc methodologies lca and elcc analysis were conducted in two steps the first one was carried out to define the environmental effects of iwt plant and the second was applied to define environmental effects and benefits of the recovery of iwt effluent through and advanced treatment 2 life cycle assessment lca lca methodology performed in this study is based on the iso 14040 framework 27 and iso 14044 guidelines and requirements 28 including of four steps goal and scope definition life cycle inventory lci life cycle impact assessment lcia and interpretation 2 1 goal and scope definition this study has two aims to define the environmental effects of iwt process and to define environmental effects and benefits of the recovery of iwt effluent through advanced treatment in these aims the iwt plant takes place in kocaeli organized industrial park 40 78 n 30 04 e was studied as the case study the reason behind selecting this plant is it is one of the most intensified industrialization areas in turkey 2 1 1 description of the system the treatment capacity of the iwt plant is 4000 m3 per day flow chart of iwt process applied in kocaeli oip is given in fig 1 the iwt plant is operated based on primary treatment secondary treatment and sludge dewatering process the primary treatment includes coarse and fine screen oil sand chamber and balancing tank the capacity of screens is 150 m3 h the oil sand chamber 282 m3 h has a rotary scraper that is run by a pump capacity of about 10 m3 h the balancing tank is operated by level sensors and the power capacity of a rotor is 10 kw the secondary treatment consists of moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr dissolved air flotation daf chemical treatment units the mbbr system provides bod nitrogen and phosphorus removal the capacity of the mbbr process is about 6750 m3 day and its retention time is about 12 5 h biological treatment is carried out through the bacteria on the media by giving air 3500 nm3 h into the pool with a blower media is the filling materials made of polyethylene or polypropylene with a density slightly less than water and a diameter of 9 64 mm unlike conventional systems sludge does not recycle and the amount of sludge formed is less than other biological treatment systems the excess sludge produced breaks off over the filling material passes through the outlet grids and is transmitted to the next unit sludge dewatering unit decanter the daf system with a capacity of 280 m3 h is used for the separation of industrial oils and particles in wastewater pressure is created by accumulating the compressed air produced in the compressor in the pressure tank micro bubbles created in the system adhere to the surface of these substances with the buoyancy effect of these micro bubbles the clusters of particles and air bubbles float towards the surface where it takes the form of foam while the water passes through the lamella separators placed in the tank the flocs that tend to float hold onto the surface of the lamellae heavy particles settle to the bottom particles and air bubble clusters in the form of foam formed on the water surface are scraped from the surface with a mechanical scraper and collected in the foam sludge collection chamber the treated water is pumped into the chemical treatment unit through the outlet weir chemical treatment involves coagulation and flocculation processes with contact time is 5 min and 20 min respectively coagulation is designed to destabilize the surface negative charges of colloidal forms by neutralizing them the coagulant injection and mixing take place in the coagulation tank with a rapid mixer chemical dosage is determined by the jar test according to raw water quality in flocculation water is mixed gently preventing the previously formed flocs from breaking flocculation kinetics is the probability function of collisions between particles in the process this possibility is high thus minimizing the duration of the mixing process and reducing the required tank size sludge dewatering is sustained by a decanter centrifuge with a capacity of 5 m3 h it consists of a drum rotating at high speed and the spiral rotating at different speed in the same axis with the drum consisted of the drive group adjusting the speed difference and the body carrying the rotating elements sludge enters the drum from the spiral feeding chamber with the effect of the centrifugal force and stratifies towards the drum surface with the difference in specific weights the inlet concentration is about 3 whereas the output of cake concentration is between 20 and 25 flow chart of the wr process applied in kocaeli oip is given in fig 2 the wr process that has a daily capacity of 3000 m3 and this process includes mechanical filters unit sand filters ultrafiltration active carbon unit reverse osmosis and ultraviolet units processes to advanced treat effluent of iwt into process water ready for industrial production such as steel rolling mechanical filters unit is also known as ultrafiltration pre filters these filters are operated at 198 m3 h production flow and it is placed at the entrance of the system to protect the ultrafiltration membranes from coarse particles the operating pressure is between 2 and 10 bar the structure of the filters consists of coarse filter and fine filter elements sand multimedia filters are used for the removal of suspended solids two types of media are used in sand filters and these two filters are operated at 0 5 m thus large particles are kept at the top of the media while small particles reach the bottom of the filter and are held here suspended solids turbidity and color pigments are removed by the ultrafiltration unit the total number of filtration is 60 with 77 m2 of active area and its operation flux is 49 l m2 h lmh while backwash flux is 120 the activated carbon unit acf process is used to remove odor color turbidity and excess chlorine in the acf process two filters are operated at up to 85 m3 h its operating pressure is between 2 and 6 bar and adsorption and backwash times are 5 and 20 min respectively the parameters such as water conductivity total dissolved solid chloride hardness are removed by the reverse osmosis process for these reverse osmosis units the operation feed flow production flow and concentrate flow are about 188 126 and 42 m3 h respectively its recovery rate is about 70 the total number of reverse osmosis is 216 pieces and the operating flux is between 14 and 16 lmh with 12 bar supply pressure ultraviolet units are used disinfection through inactivating the dna structures of bacteria fungi viruses and similar microorganisms in water by means of ultraviolet rays 2 1 2 system boundaries the system boundaries were applied as to be cradle to grave including the production of chemicals generation of electricity transportation of the chemicals from distributors to the plant and treatment of water and treatment of sludge except infrastructure and demolition of the plants to define the effect of water recovery the system boundaries were enlarged to include water recovery and use of recovered water as process water fig 3 the infrastructure of the treatment plant and transportation of chemicals from the producers abroad to the distributor in turkey were excluded from the system boundaries 2 1 3 functional unit the functional unit was applied as 1 m3 of treated water for iwt process and 1 m3 of recovered water for the wr process individually 2 2 life cycle inventory lci lci was given for iwt and wr processes in tables 2 and 3 respectively in table 2 fecl3 was used as coagulant sodium hydroxide naoh dosing was performed immediately after ph balancing anionic resin polymer was used to provide flocculation cationic polymer was used in the decanter unit for sludge dewatering the dewatered sludge sent to a licensed disposal company chemicals are used for different purposes during the recovery process table 3 sodium hypochlorite naocl dosing done to prevent pathogen formation in the wastewater before mechanical filter in reverse rinsing of ultrafiltration uf units hydrochloric acid hcl naoh and naocl chemicals dosed sodium metabisulfite smbs is dosed prior to the cartridge filter after the activated carbon unit before the wastewater passing through the last cartridge filter into the reverse osmosis system antiscalant dosing takes place the foreground data concerning the treatment chemicals consumption energy consumption transportation distance of materials and discharge values of effluent water was obtained from the personal interviews who contributed to collecting data are given in the acknowledgment section and site specific reports of iwt plant these raw data were calculated based on the functional unit and given as lci in table 2 the background data regarding chemicals production electricity generation the transport was obtained from the ecoinvent database v 3 6 embedded in simapro software the electricity production data the emissions and environmental impacts of its were obtained from the günkaya et al 29 s study which is corresponding to turkey s electricity production profile the electricity production was used in terms of the use of the resources as 32 5 natural gas 14 lignite 2 9 hard coal 17 4 imported coal 24 2 hydraulic energy 6 wind energy 2 geothermal energy and 0 4 solar energy 30 it was assumed that all chemicals using in the plant is transported by road transport vehicles with full capacity and delivery vehicles returns to suppliers with no load transport data is calculated in the kg km unit by multiplying chemical quantity used for 1 m3 and distance between supplier and plant an average distance was assumed as 25 km for the sludge waste disposal site the benefits of water recovery were taken account at three level as avoiding of effluent discharge parameters outputs given in table 3 avoiding use of natural water and avoiding use of electricity used for production of process water the substitution rate for recovered water and natural water was assumed as 1 1 the amount of electricity consumption is averagely reached 0 25 kwh to obtain m3 treated water 31 2 3 life cycle impact assessment lcia the lcia was performed using the cml ia baseline v 3 06 and recipe 2016 v1 04 midpoint method hierarchist h version impact assessment methods which are embodied in

using the methods individual normalization methods eu25 for cml ia baseline method and world 2010 h for recipe 2016 midpoint h method 3 environmental life cycle cost in elcc a steady state cost model was used which means no discounting or depreciation was taken into account 32 the economic results of the elcc are complemented by an lca for the same system but special attention should be given to avoid double counting of emissions that is once they are internalized in the economic part they should not be accounted for in the environmental part 33 therefore elcc was applied according to a novel methodology defined by günkaya 2020 8 in this method the lca results were divided into the following two parts to avoid double counting emissions in accordance with lcc 34 resulting from raw material usage lcar and resulting from emissions lcae fig 4 the connection between lca and elcc was established in accordance with the directions shown in fig 4 in this figure lcar corresponds to internal costs and lcae corresponds to external costs according to this division input related impact categories raw material fuel usage related and output related impact categories emissions related are given under the lcar and lcae respectively the system boundaries and the functional units of elcc was applied as in lca internal costs include chemicals transport energy production maintenance and labor costs per functional unit the all internal cost data was obtained from the plant external costs reflect the cost of environmental impact resulting from the emissions generated during the raw material extraction production of chemicals generation of electricity transportation of the chemicals from distributors to the plant and treatment of water and treatment of sludge and water recovery processes the external costs were determined by monetization of lcae results for the monetization of cml results ecovalue08 was applied since it is based on cml life cycle impact methodology which is a global scale weighting method 35 the weighting factors wf to combine the midpoints to a monetized endpoint impact suggested in ecovalue08 are all dependent on market valuations of resource consumption and one willing to pay wtp forecast for environmental quality 8 wf values were calculated from several european valuation applications defined by huysegoms et al 36 1 weighting factors wf turkey wf eu gdp ppp percaptr gdp ppp percapeu where wf is the weighting factor gdp ppp percaptr and gdp ppp percapeu are gdp at purchasing power parity per capita in turkey and in eu respectively on the other hand recipe has a drawback for monetary valuation because the relationship between emissions and endpoints is reported solely as an average global value in addition impacts are not time discounted which means recipe cannot be used to derive values consistent with the premises of welfare theory 37 4 results and discussion the results of the life cycle impact assessment and the interpretation stages of the study were presented as the results and discussion 4 1 life cycle impact assessment results for iwt table 4 shows the total lca lcatotal characterization results for 1 m3 treated water in the iwt plant obtained from cml ia and recipe midpoint h methods in the characterization results lcatotal was divided into two parts as the resulted from the raw materials lcar and the resulted from the emissions lcae this kind of division was made for the combination of lca and elcc to compare the results of similar categories global warming ozone depletion potential human toxicity ecotoxicity and acidification categories of cml ia and recipe midpoint h a compatibility chart was formed table 4 according to this compatibility gwp odp and ap results are compatible whereas human toxicity and ecotoxicity values fetp metp and tetp are different since the different geographic scope of the methods normalized values of these characterization results were given in table s1 in the supplementary material sm further investigation of the impact categories was realized based on the impact categories that have a share of higher than 5 in the total normalized value according to this adpff 14 1 gwp 9 6 metp 43 9 pop 9 4 ap 16 9 are the main impact categories for cml ia whereas the hctp 6 6 hnctp 6 8 and wcp 81 2 are those for recipe midpoint h the characterization results of cml ia and recipe midpoint h method for the selected impact categories were investigated through the fig 5 a g the environmental burdens are resulted from the production of the consumed electrical energy the production of the chemical materials fecl3 naoh anionic and cationic polymers transportation of chemical materials according to fig 5 a e the important findings are summarized below the electrical energy is the main process that caused to environmental impacts it is responsible for the adpff with the 74 5 for gwp with the 80 2 for the pop with the 97 1 and for acidification with the 90 2 on the other hand the electrical energy has impact on maetp with 17 4 the chemical materials production processes have significant impacts on metp 82 5 adpff 24 9 and gwp 19 4 the transportation of materials process has lowest contribution compared to other process on all impact categories as 1 0 the characterization results of recipe midpoint h method for the selected impact categories hctp hnctp and wcp were investigated through the fig 5 f h the environmental impacts are derived from the production of the required electrical energy the production of the chemical materials fecl3 naoh anionic and cationic polymers and transportation of chemical materials the important findings obtained from fig 5 f h are summarized below the contributions of the electrical energy consumption dominated for three impact categories hctp hnctp and wcp with percent of about 88 2 94 0 and 87 8 of total impacts respectively the second major contributor the chemical materials production processes have showed contribution to hctp hnctp and wcp impact categories 11 8 5 9 and 12 2 of total impacts the transportation of materials process has lowest contribution compared to other process on three impact categories as 1 0 4 2 life cycle impact assessment results for wr results for wr was discussed in two subtitles effects and benefits 4 2 1 effects of wr table 5 demonstrates the total lca lcatotal characterization results for 1 m3 treated water in the wr process calculated according to cml ia and recipe midpoint h methods as carried out in the assessment of iwt process these characterization results were divided into two parts as the resulted from the raw materials lcar and emissions lcae in addition the values of similar impact categories as carried out for the iwt process by both methods were compared and these results are summarized in table 5 according to this table gwp odp and ap results are compatible whereas human toxicity and ecotoxicity fetp metp and tetp values are different since the different geographic scope of the methods normalized values of these characterization results were given in table s2 in the sm further investigation of the impact categories was realized based on the impact categories that have a share of higher than 5 in the total normalized value according to this the major important categories in cml ia method are ap 25 8 metp 18 9 adpff 18 2 pop 15 2 gwp 13 2 and ep 7 3 whereas hctp 6 7 hnctp 7 2 and wcp 81 0 are those for recipe midpoint h the contribution of the main processes of wr to the selected impact categories of cml ia and recipe midpoint h are given in fig 6 a i according to fig 6 a f the electrical energy is the main process that caused to environmental impacts it is the dominant process with the higher than 90 for the adpff gwp pop and ap its percentages for the maetp and ep follow with the values of 64 and 40 respectively the environmental loads resulted from the chemical materials production has impacts on the adpff gwp maetp pop ap and ep as 7 9 6 9 35 9 4 7 5 8 and 2 9 respectively the wr process operation has only effects on the ep category due to effluent with phosphorus and cod emissions the transportation of materials process has lowest impacts compared to other process on all impact categories as 0 4 according to fig 6 g i the electrical energy consumption is a dominant factor 94 of total impacts to each investigated impact categories hctp hnctp and wcp the environmental impacts occurred from the chemical materials production leads about 5 of total impacts on the hctp hcntp and wcp impact categories the wr process operation has no impacts on hctp hcntp and wcp impact categories however this operation process has remarkable impacts around 76 on the fep category due to effluent with phosphorus emissions the transportation of materials process has lower impacts on the ctp hcntp and wcp impact categories with 0 1 than compared to electrical energy and chemical materials production processes 4 2 2 benefit from wr the benefit from the wr process was calculated for three cases avoiding the effluent avoiding the electricity consumption and avoiding the water usage in both impact assessment methods the case of effluent will be entered into the wr process after treated in the iwt therefore the effluent will be no longer discharged to river as the receiving environment according to table 6 avoided effluent has a higher benefit share for hctp 100 hcntp 97 maetp 83 and ep 95 avoiding energy consumption to produce the equal amount of the tap water has the dominant benefits 100 for adpff gwp pop and ap in addition avoided electricity has a benefit for wcp 66 the last benefit from the treated water by wr process used to replace water source tap water for industrial usage purposes having benefits from water saving 34 the comparison of impacts given in table 5 and the benefits given in table 6 of the wr process are summarized in table 7 in this table the percentile rate of benefits to impacts is given in the last column according to table 7 it has shown that the wr process has significant benefits higher than 100 on ep hctp and hnctp impact categories due to mainly avoiding the effluent impacts since the electrical energy is the dominant process causing the impacts the wr process should be improved from the point of impact categories such as adpff gwp pop and wcp hence the electricity consumption for the wr process should be reduced or supplied from renewable energy sources besides the metp impact despite the rate is better than the others 70 of total benefits to impact in addition to the electricity consumption chemical consumption should be reconsidered 4 3 comparison of the results with literature the characterization results for iwt and wr processes obtained in this study were compared to literature studies table 8 nevertheless there is a challenge to express compatibility between the results because lca results were based on very specific case studies for instance regarding local conditions and each study has its own goal scope definition system boundaries and so on however this comparison reveals that it is obtained closer results to each other for iwt and wr processes in most of impact categories such as adpff gwp ap on the other hand niero et al 40 expressed that eutrophication and toxicity related impact categories in lca results show uncertain and sensitive results similar to this our results show a difference compared to literature studies in toxicity related impact categories such as htp and ep this might be occurred due to emissions such as metal nitrogen to environment media 4 4 environmental life cycle cost elcc study was realized for cml ia and recipe methods in different ways for cml ia a weighting range using monetary estimates based on individual willingness to pay was obtained and interpreted according to characterization results wf s calculated in this manner in euro2008 and in euro2020 for eu and turkey are given in table s3 on the other hand weights obtained from bijleveld et al 37 table s3 were directly used to normalize the characterization results of recipe midpoint h into a single score in terms of a monetary cost the calculated internal and external costs for iwt and wr processes are detailed given in table 9 10 respectively iwt and wrp processes operating costs chemical costs energy usage costs personal costs and maintenance repair costs were evaluated as internal costs while the overall costs as internal and external costs were calculated as 0 36 0 46 for the iwt process the total cost was calculated 0 43 0 58 regarding functional unit for the wr process for both processes the percentage distribution of the operating costs in the internal cost component as the total cost is as follows energy consumption is 35 9 personal expenditures cost is 34 6 chemical materials cost is 20 2 and maintenance repair cost is 9 3 in addition the mean distribution values of the monetized lca results for iwt and wr processes according to both impact assessment categories were calculated and their results are as follows human toxicity potential 39 3 and 38 4 global warming potential 34 6 and 30 acidification potential 20 3 and 19 4 eutrophication potential 5 7 and 12 and photochemical oxidation potential 0 2 for each process the monetization values of lca results for cml ia and recipe midpoint h methods are 0 13 and 0 23 for the iwt and 0 21 and 0 37 for the wrp processes respectively the monetization results based on recipe midpoint h method for both processes are about two times higher than cml ia method due to total characterization value differences into impact categories it is noteworthy that the external costs should consider in the life cycle perspective particularly when the decision makers aim to reduce the economic expenditures of wwt processes at first they may focus on decreasing of operational costs which are contributed mostly from electricity consumption which are obtained using fossil fuels this approach also might be used to take advantage of reducing global warming impacts the sum of the internal and external cost values elcc values of the iwt and wr processes are presented in table 11 elcc value of wr process is higher than that of the iwt process the main reason is the electricity consumption and the environmental impacts due to the electricity production the share of internal costs for iwt in the cml ia and the recipe midpoint h methods are 63 4 and 49 9 in addition these share values in wr process are 49 6 and 36 4 in the cml ia and the recipe midpoint h methods whereas the externalities are calculated about 36 1 and 50 1 and 50 4 and 63 6 for iwt and wr processes in the cml ia and the recipe midpoint h methods respectively 5 conclusion the comprehensive lca and elcc analysis of the iwt and wr processes that are located in the organized industrial park in turkey was carried out in this study the environmental and economic results of this study are summarized below lca results show that for industrial wastewater treatment electricity consumption is the dominant process that defines the impacts in the cml ia and recipe midpoint h methods for water recovery process although it has 100 benefit for water consumption and remarkable benefits due to avoided effluent of iwt process electricity consumption is the key process that define the real benefit of the process there is a need to use electricity more efficiently or diverse the electricity source to renewable sources a continuous monitoring of electricity consumption is the first step of more efficiently energy use for that reason plants should integrate this kind of monitoring systems to their supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems one option for the latter one can be locating the photo voltaic panels to the site elcc results show that the externalities are the hidden cost components although there would be an economic gain due to the recovery process that can over the operation costs the cost of environmental impacts should be also considered at that point elcc analysis that is conducted by dividing lca results in two categories is very helpful as a conclusion it is believed that this study can be served as a model for managers and the policymakers of wastewater treatment plants and researchers moreover the general and local authorities for industrial parks need to create an appropriate energy policy for wastewater treatment plants credit authorship contribution statement seda

water recovery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction industrial production is one of the main causes of water consumption worldwide organized industrial parks oips are the hot points that consume high volumes of process water in europe manufacturing industry accounts for about 40 of total water abstractions furthermore the industrial sector is a major water polluter as only up to 60 value based on data from eight countries of industrial wastewater receives treatment before being disposed of into the environment 1 according to turkey statistical institute for oips water and wastewater statistics records it was stated that 185 million m3 of water was taken by the oips from the water supply network in 2018 besides about 252 million m3 of wastewater was treated in oips wastewater treatment plant wwtp 2 on the other hand since there are many different companies or manufacturers in oips the characteristic of wastewater has very diverse in terms of pollutants to meet the requirement of the environmental impacts of municipal or industrial zones discharges the conventional wwt process includes various combined treatment processes such as mechanical chemical treatment biological treatment additionally recently the tertiary treatment stages have been started to construct to provide recycled water to use where is possible to solve the certain problem such as water scarcity 3 and quality impairment 4 in the foreground the reuse of wastewater process might be complex due to its components high cost investment technology energy and resource demanding 5 on the other hand in the background the use of chemical materials and energy consumption during the treatment of wastewater causes environmental impacts the amount of these impacts alters according to the wwt method therefore it is necessary to use appropriate assessment methods to determine its impacts on the environment environmental performance information of wastewater systems for decision makers can be evaluated by life cycle assessment lca methodology which is a transparent and standardized approach 6 the lca is an analysis method that can assess measure and report the environmental impact of a product system or a process during the lifecycle from deriving raw material to processing production usage end of life and elimination and inform source efficiency and amount of waste 7 lca methodology has been used to determine the environmental impacts of wwtps some literature studies with the keywords of lca and wwtp were detail examined and the remarkable findings are given in table 1 as seen from the table 1 the literature studies focus on the environmental impacts on the other hand the cost of environmental impacts also should be considered to see the big picture from this point this study aims to combine life cycle assessment with environmental life cycle cost elcc methodology ellc is a type of lcc methodology it is an assessment of all costs associated with the life cycle of a product that are directly included by one or more of the actors in the product life cycle with complementary inclusion of externalities that are anticipated to be internalized in the decision relevant future 8 the methodology used in this study previously applied by günkaya 8 was expressed as the way to cover external environmental costs in elcc is to use monetary weighted results which are gathered from the environmental assessment analysis for instance lca in the lca analysis monetary assessment is not widely applied as the decision support tool however certain studies 9 11 discussed the advantages of using monetary valuation in the weighting stage of the lca the weighting step aims to make comparisons between the environmental effects measured by different units and therefore incomparable companies that can control environmental costs can be more competitive and minimize the negative impact of social life pizzol et al 12 and nguyen et al 13 examined the results of the lca in together with the monetization model moreover european monetization models such as eps2000 14 ecotax 15 stepwise2006 16 and recipe 17 were used to particularly the implementation of the market price method in lca however there are limited studies examines on the environmental and economic assessment by using the lca of industrial wastewater treatment for recovery application in the industrial park therefore this study considers defining the effects of industrial wastewater treatment iwt and water recovery wr processes by means of lca and elcc methodologies lca and elcc analysis were conducted in two steps the first one was carried out to define the environmental effects of iwt plant and the second was applied to define environmental effects and benefits of the recovery of iwt effluent through and advanced treatment 2 life cycle assessment lca lca methodology performed in this study is based on the iso 14040 framework 27 and iso 14044 guidelines and requirements 28 including of four steps goal and scope definition life cycle inventory lci life cycle impact assessment lcia and interpretation 2 1 goal and scope definition this study has two aims to define the environmental effects of iwt process and to define environmental effects and benefits of the recovery of iwt effluent through advanced treatment in these aims the iwt plant takes place in kocaeli organized industrial park 40 78 n 30 04 e was studied as the case study the reason behind selecting this plant is it is one of the most intensified industrialization areas in turkey 2 1 1 description of the system the treatment capacity of the iwt plant is 4000 m3 per day flow chart of iwt process applied in kocaeli oip is given in fig 1 the iwt plant is operated based on primary treatment secondary treatment and sludge dewatering process the primary treatment includes coarse and fine screen oil sand chamber and balancing tank the capacity of screens is 150 m3 h the oil sand chamber 282 m3 h has a rotary scraper that is run by a pump capacity of about 10 m3 h the balancing tank is operated by level sensors and the power capacity of a rotor is 10 kw the secondary treatment consists of moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr dissolved air flotation daf chemical treatment units the mbbr system provides bod nitrogen and phosphorus removal the capacity of the mbbr process is about 6750 m3 day and its retention time is about 12 5 h biological treatment is carried out through the bacteria on the media by giving air 3500 nm3 h into the pool with a blower media is the filling materials made of polyethylene or polypropylene with a density slightly less than water and a diameter of 9 64 mm unlike conventional systems sludge does not recycle and the amount of sludge formed is less than other biological treatment systems the excess sludge produced breaks off over the filling material passes through the outlet grids and is transmitted to the next unit sludge dewatering unit decanter the daf system with a capacity of 280 m3 h is used for the separation of industrial oils and particles in wastewater pressure is created by accumulating the compressed air produced in the compressor in the pressure tank micro bubbles created in the system adhere to the surface of these substances with the buoyancy effect of these micro bubbles the clusters of particles and air bubbles float towards the surface where it takes the form of foam while the water passes through the lamella separators placed in the tank the flocs that tend to float hold onto the surface of the lamellae heavy particles settle to the bottom particles and air bubble clusters in the form of foam formed on the water surface are scraped from the surface with a mechanical scraper and collected in the foam sludge collection chamber the treated water is pumped into the chemical treatment unit through the outlet weir chemical treatment involves coagulation and flocculation processes with contact time is 5 min and 20 min respectively coagulation is designed to destabilize the surface negative charges of colloidal forms by neutralizing them the coagulant injection and mixing take place in the coagulation tank with a rapid mixer chemical dosage is determined by the jar test according to raw water quality in flocculation water is mixed gently preventing the previously formed flocs from breaking flocculation kinetics is the probability function of collisions between particles in the process this possibility is high thus minimizing the duration of the mixing process and reducing the required tank size sludge dewatering is sustained by a decanter centrifuge with a capacity of 5 m3 h it consists of a drum rotating at high speed and the spiral rotating at different speed in the same axis with the drum consisted of the drive group adjusting the speed difference and the body carrying the rotating elements sludge enters the drum from the spiral feeding chamber with the effect of the centrifugal force and stratifies towards the drum surface with the difference in specific weights the inlet concentration is about 3 whereas the output of cake concentration is between 20 and 25 flow chart of the wr process applied in kocaeli oip is given in fig 2 the wr process that has a daily capacity of 3000 m3 and this process includes mechanical filters unit sand filters ultrafiltration active carbon unit reverse osmosis and ultraviolet units processes to advanced treat effluent of iwt into process water ready for industrial production such as steel rolling mechanical filters unit is also known as ultrafiltration pre filters these filters are operated at 198 m3 h production flow and it is placed at the entrance of the system to protect the ultrafiltration membranes from coarse particles the operating pressure is between 2 and 10 bar the structure of the filters consists of coarse filter and fine filter elements sand multimedia filters are used for the removal of suspended solids two types of media are used in sand filters and these two filters are operated at 0 5 m thus large particles are kept at the top of the media while small particles reach the bottom of the filter and are held here suspended solids turbidity and color pigments are removed by the ultrafiltration unit the total number of filtration is 60 with 77 m2 of active area and its operation flux is 49 l m2 h lmh while backwash flux is 120 the activated carbon unit acf process is used to remove odor color turbidity and excess chlorine in the acf process two filters are operated at up to 85 m3

removed by the reverse osmosis process for these reverse osmosis units the operation feed flow production flow and concentrate flow are about 188 126 and 42 m3 h respectively its recovery rate is about 70 the total number of reverse osmosis is 216 pieces and the operating flux is between 14 and 16 lmh with 12 bar supply pressure ultraviolet units are used disinfection through inactivating the dna structures of bacteria fungi viruses and similar microorganisms in water by means of ultraviolet rays 2 1 2 system boundaries the system boundaries were applied as to be cradle to grave including the production of chemicals generation of electricity transportation of the chemicals from distributors to the plant and treatment of water and treatment of sludge except infrastructure and demolition of the plants to define the effect of water recovery the system boundaries were enlarged to include water recovery and use of recovered water as process water fig 3 the infrastructure of the treatment plant and transportation of chemicals from the producers abroad to the distributor in turkey were excluded from the system boundaries 2 1 3 functional unit the functional unit was applied as 1 m3 of treated water for iwt process and 1 m3 of recovered water for the wr process individually 2 2 life cycle inventory lci lci was given for iwt and wr processes in tables 2 and 3 respectively in table 2 fecl3 was used as coagulant sodium hydroxide naoh dosing was performed immediately after ph balancing anionic resin polymer was used to provide flocculation cationic polymer was used in the decanter unit for sludge dewatering the dewatered sludge sent to a licensed disposal company chemicals are used for different purposes during the recovery process table 3 sodium hypochlorite naocl dosing done to prevent pathogen formation in the wastewater before mechanical filter in reverse rinsing of ultrafiltration uf units hydrochloric acid hcl naoh and naocl chemicals dosed sodium metabisulfite smbs is dosed prior to the cartridge filter after the activated carbon unit before the wastewater passing through the last cartridge filter into the reverse osmosis system antiscalant dosing takes place the foreground data concerning the treatment chemicals consumption energy consumption transportation distance of materials and discharge values of effluent water was obtained from the personal interviews who contributed to collecting data are given in the acknowledgment section and site specific reports of iwt plant these raw data were calculated based on the functional unit and given as lci in table 2 the background data regarding chemicals production electricity generation the transport was obtained from the ecoinvent database v 3 6 embedded in simapro software the electricity production data the emissions and environmental impacts of its were obtained from the günkaya et al 29 s study which is corresponding to turkey s electricity production profile the electricity production was used in terms of the use of the resources as 32 5 natural gas 14 lignite 2 9 hard coal 17 4 imported coal 24 2 hydraulic energy 6 wind energy 2 geothermal energy and 0 4 solar energy 30 it was assumed that all chemicals using in the plant is transported by road transport vehicles with full capacity and delivery vehicles returns to suppliers with no load transport data is calculated in the kg km unit by multiplying chemical quantity used for 1 m3 and distance between supplier and plant an average distance was assumed as 25 km for the sludge waste disposal site the benefits of water recovery were taken account at three level as avoiding of effluent discharge parameters outputs given in table 3 avoiding use of natural water and avoiding use of electricity used for production of process water the substitution rate for recovered water and natural water was assumed as 1 1 the amount of electricity consumption is averagely reached 0 25 kwh to obtain m3 treated water 31 2 3 life cycle impact assessment lcia the lcia was performed using the cml ia baseline v 3 06 and recipe 2016 v1 04 midpoint method hierarchist h version impact assessment methods which are embodied in

using the methods individual normalization methods eu25 for cml ia baseline method and world 2010 h for recipe 2016 midpoint h method 3 environmental life cycle cost in elcc a steady state cost model was used which means no discounting or depreciation was taken into account 32 the economic results of the elcc are complemented by an lca for the same system but special attention should be given to avoid double counting of emissions that is once they are internalized in the economic part they should not be accounted for in the environmental part 33 therefore elcc was applied according to a novel methodology defined by günkaya 2020 8 in this method the lca results were divided into the following two parts to avoid double counting emissions in accordance with lcc 34 resulting from raw material usage lcar and resulting from emissions lcae fig 4 the connection between lca and elcc was established in accordance with the directions shown in fig 4 in this figure lcar corresponds to internal costs and lcae corresponds to external costs according to this division input related impact categories raw material fuel usage related and output related impact categories emissions related are given under the lcar and lcae respectively the system boundaries and the functional units of elcc was applied as in lca internal costs include chemicals transport energy production maintenance and labor costs per functional unit the all internal cost data was obtained from the plant external costs reflect the cost of environmental impact resulting from the emissions generated during the raw material extraction production of chemicals generation of electricity transportation of the chemicals from distributors to the plant and treatment of water and treatment of sludge and water recovery processes the external costs were determined by monetization of lcae results for the monetization of cml results ecovalue08 was applied since it is based on cml life cycle impact methodology which is a global scale weighting method 35 the weighting factors wf to combine the midpoints to a monetized endpoint impact suggested in ecovalue08 are all dependent on market valuations of resource consumption and one willing to pay wtp forecast for environmental quality 8 wf values were calculated from several european valuation applications defined by huysegoms et al 36 1 weighting factors wf turkey wf eu gdp ppp percaptr gdp ppp percapeu where wf is the weighting factor gdp ppp percaptr and gdp ppp percapeu are gdp at purchasing power parity per capita in turkey and in eu respectively on the other hand recipe has a drawback for monetary valuation because the relationship between emissions and endpoints is reported solely as an average global value in addition impacts are not time discounted which means recipe cannot be used to derive values consistent with the premises of welfare theory 37 4 results and discussion the results of the life cycle impact assessment and the interpretation stages of the study were presented as the results and discussion 4 1 life cycle impact assessment results for iwt table 4 shows the total lca lcatotal characterization results for 1 m3 treated water in the iwt plant obtained from cml ia and recipe midpoint h methods in the characterization results lcatotal was divided into two parts as the resulted from the raw materials lcar and the resulted from the emissions lcae this kind of division was made for the combination of lca and elcc to compare the results of similar categories global warming ozone depletion potential human toxicity ecotoxicity and acidification categories of cml ia and recipe midpoint h a compatibility chart was formed table 4 according to this compatibility gwp odp and ap results are compatible whereas human toxicity and ecotoxicity values fetp metp and tetp are different since the different geographic scope of the methods normalized values of these characterization results were given in table s1 in the supplementary material sm further investigation of the impact categories was realized based on the impact categories that have a share of higher than 5 in the total normalized value according to this adpff 14 1 gwp 9 6 metp 43 9 pop 9 4 ap 16 9 are the main impact categories for cml ia whereas the hctp 6 6 hnctp 6 8 and wcp 81 2 are those for recipe midpoint h the characterization results of cml ia and recipe midpoint h method for the selected impact categories were investigated through the fig 5 a g the environmental burdens are resulted from the production of the consumed electrical energy the production of the chemical materials fecl3 naoh anionic and cationic polymers transportation of chemical materials according to fig 5 a e the important findings are summarized below the electrical energy is the main process that caused to environmental impacts it is responsible for the adpff with the 74 5 for gwp with the 80 2 for the pop with the 97 1 and for acidification with the 90 2 on the other hand the electrical energy has impact on maetp with 17 4 the chemical materials production processes have significant impacts on metp 82 5 adpff 24 9 and gwp 19 4 the transportation of materials process has lowest contribution compared to other process on all impact categories as 1 0 the characterization results of recipe midpoint h method for the selected impact categories hctp hnctp and wcp were investigated through the fig 5 f h the environmental impacts are derived from the production of the required electrical energy the production of the chemical materials fecl3 naoh anionic and cationic polymers and transportation of chemical materials the important findings obtained from fig 5 f h are summarized below the contributions of the electrical energy consumption dominated for three impact categories hctp hnctp and wcp with percent of about 88 2 94 0 and 87 8 of total impacts respectively the second major contributor the chemical materials production processes have showed contribution to hctp hnctp and wcp impact categories 11 8 5 9 and 12 2 of total impacts the transportation of materials process has lowest contribution compared to other process on three impact categories as 1 0 4 2 life cycle impact assessment results for wr results for wr was discussed in two subtitles effects and benefits 4 2 1 effects of wr table 5 demonstrates the total lca lcatotal characterization results for 1 m3 treated water in the wr process calculated according to cml ia and recipe midpoint h methods as carried out in the assessment of iwt process these characterization results were divided into two parts as the resulted from the raw materials lcar and emissions lcae in addition the values of similar impact categories as carried out for the iwt process by both methods were compared and these results are summarized in table 5 according to this table gwp odp and ap results are compatible whereas human toxicity and ecotoxicity fetp metp and tetp values are different since the different geographic scope of the methods normalized values of these characterization results were given in table s2 in the sm further investigation of the impact categories was realized based on the impact categories that have a share of higher than 5 in the total normalized value according to this the major important categories in cml ia method are ap 25 8 metp 18 9 adpff 18 2 pop 15 2 gwp 13 2 and ep 7 3 whereas hctp 6 7 hnctp 7 2 and wcp 81 0 are those for recipe midpoint h the contribution of the main processes of wr to the selected impact categories of cml ia and recipe midpoint h are given in fig 6 a i according to fig 6 a f the electrical energy is the main process that caused to environmental impacts it is the dominant process with the higher than 90 for the adpff gwp pop and ap its percentages for the maetp and ep follow with the values of 64 and 40 respectively the environmental loads resulted from the chemical materials production has impacts on the adpff gwp maetp pop ap and ep as 7 9 6 9 35 9 4 7 5 8 and 2 9 respectively the wr process operation has only effects on the ep category due to effluent with phosphorus and cod emissions the transportation of materials process has lowest impacts compared to other process on all impact categories as 0 4 according to fig 6 g i the electrical energy consumption is a dominant factor 94 of total impacts to each investigated impact categories hctp hnctp and wcp the environmental impacts occurred from the chemical materials production leads about 5 of total impacts on the hctp hcntp and wcp impact categories the wr process operation has no impacts on hctp hcntp and wcp impact categories however this operation process has remarkable impacts around 76 on the fep category due to effluent with phosphorus emissions the transportation of materials process has lower impacts on the ctp hcntp and wcp impact categories with 0 1 than compared to electrical energy and chemical materials production processes 4 2 2 benefit from wr the benefit from the wr process was calculated for three cases avoiding the effluent avoiding the electricity consumption and avoiding the water usage in both impact assessment methods the case of effluent will be entered into the wr process after treated in the iwt therefore the effluent will be no longer discharged to river as the receiving environment according to table 6 avoided effluent has a higher benefit share for hctp 100 hcntp 97 maetp 83 and ep 95 avoiding energy consumption to produce the equal amount of the tap water has the dominant benefits 100 for adpff gwp pop and ap in addition avoided electricity has a benefit for wcp 66 the last benefit from the treated water by wr process used to replace water source tap water for industrial usage purposes having benefits from water saving 34 the comparison of impacts given in table 5 and the benefits given in table 6 of the wr process are summarized in table 7 in this table the percentile rate of benefits to impacts is given in the last column according to table 7 it has shown that the wr process has significant benefits higher than 100 on ep hctp and hnctp impact categories due to mainly avoiding the effluent impacts since the electrical energy is the dominant process causing the impacts the wr process should be improved from the point of impact categories such as adpff gwp pop and wcp hence the electricity consumption for the wr process should be reduced or supplied from renewable energy sources besides the metp impact despite the rate is better than the others 70 of total benefits to impact in addition to the electricity consumption chemical consumption should be reconsidered 4 3 comparison of the results with literature the characterization results for iwt and wr processes obtained in this study were compared to literature studies table 8 nevertheless there is a challenge to express compatibility between the results because lca results were based on very specific case studies for instance regarding local conditions and each study has its own goal scope definition system boundaries and so on however this comparison reveals that it is obtained closer results to each other for iwt and wr processes in most of impact categories such as adpff gwp ap on the other hand niero et al 40 expressed that eutrophication and toxicity related impact categories in lca results show uncertain and sensitive results similar to this our results show a difference compared to literature studies in toxicity related impact categories such as htp and ep this might be occurred due to emissions such as metal nitrogen to environment media 4 4 environmental life cycle cost elcc study was realized for cml ia and recipe methods in different ways for cml ia a weighting range using monetary estimates based on individual willingness to pay was obtained and interpreted according to characterization results wf s calculated in this manner in euro2008 and in euro2020 for eu and turkey are given in table s3 on the other hand weights obtained from bijleveld et al 37 table s3 were directly used to normalize the characterization results of recipe midpoint h into a single score in terms of a monetary cost the calculated internal and external costs for iwt and wr processes are detailed given in table 9 10 respectively iwt and wrp processes operating costs chemical costs energy usage costs personal costs and maintenance repair costs were evaluated as internal costs while the overall costs as internal and external costs were calculated as 0 36 0 46 for the iwt process the total cost was calculated 0 43 0 58 regarding functional unit for the wr process for both processes the percentage distribution of the operating costs in the internal cost component as the total cost is as follows energy consumption is 35 9 personal expenditures cost is 34 6 chemical materials cost is 20 2 and maintenance repair cost is 9 3 in addition the mean distribution values of the monetized lca results for iwt and wr processes according to both impact assessment categories were calculated and their results are as follows human toxicity potential 39 3 and 38 4 global warming potential 34 6 and 30 acidification potential 20 3 and 19 4 eutrophication potential 5 7 and 12 and photochemical oxidation potential 0 2 for each process the monetization values of lca results for cml ia and recipe midpoint h methods are 0 13 and 0 23 for the iwt and 0 21 and 0 37 for the wrp processes respectively the monetization results based on recipe midpoint h method for both processes are about two times higher than cml ia method due to total characterization value differences into impact categories it is noteworthy that the external costs should consider in the life cycle perspective particularly when the decision makers aim to reduce the economic expenditures of wwt processes at first they may focus on decreasing of operational costs which are contributed mostly from electricity consumption which are obtained using fossil fuels this approach also might be used to take advantage of reducing global warming impacts the sum of the internal and external cost values elcc values of the iwt and wr processes are presented in table 11 elcc value of wr process is higher than that of the iwt process the main reason is the electricity consumption and the environmental impacts due to the electricity production the share of internal costs for iwt in the cml ia and the recipe midpoint h methods are 63 4 and 49 9 in addition these share values in wr process are 49 6 and 36 4 in the cml ia and the recipe midpoint h methods whereas the externalities are calculated about 36 1 and 50 1 and 50 4 and 63 6 for iwt and wr processes in the cml ia and the recipe midpoint h methods respectively 5 conclusion the comprehensive lca and elcc analysis of the iwt and wr processes that are located in the organized industrial park in turkey was carried out in this study the environmental and economic results of this study are summarized below lca results show that for industrial wastewater treatment electricity consumption is the dominant process that defines the impacts in the cml ia and recipe midpoint h methods for water recovery process although it has 100 benefit for water consumption and remarkable benefits due to avoided effluent of iwt process electricity consumption is the key process that define the real benefit of the process there is a need to use electricity more efficiently or diverse the electricity source to renewable sources a continuous monitoring of electricity consumption is the first step of more efficiently energy use for that reason plants should integrate this kind of monitoring systems to their supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems one option for the latter one can be locating the photo voltaic panels to the site elcc results show that the externalities are the hidden cost components although there would be an economic gain due to the recovery process that can over the operation costs the cost of environmental impacts should be also considered at that point elcc analysis that is conducted by dividing lca results in two categories is very helpful as a conclusion it is believed that this study can be served as a model for managers and the policymakers of wastewater treatment plants and researchers moreover the general and local authorities for industrial parks need to create an appropriate energy policy for wastewater treatment plants credit authorship contribution statement seda

12848,in this study fe3o4 was added to the anaerobic fermentation process of waste cooking oil wco and aerobic sludge as and its effects on the production of volatile fatty acids vfas were explored from the perspectives of propionic acid concentration fe2 concentration and microorganisms the results showed that when the dosage of fe3o4 was 5 g l it was conducive to the hydrolysis and acidification of wco and it had a significant effect on the concentration of vfas and propionic acid the maximum concentration of vfas was 7142 84 201 48 mg cod l and the maximum concentration of propionic acid was 4990 92 124 76 mg cod l which increased by 20 65 and 27 65 respectively compared with the blank group meanwhile microbial community analysis showed that firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are the main phylum for the production of vfa in the anaerobic fermentation of wco and as veillonellaceae under firmicutes was the main microorganism to produce propionic acid it provides microbial support for the hydrolysis of wco and the subsequent production of propionic acid this study provides a new idea for fe3o4 to promote the hydrolysis of wco and produce propionic acid and brings potential economic benefits to wco treatment keywords waste cooking oil wco propionic acid volatile fatty acids vfas anaerobic fermentation 1 introduction with the development of the global economy and the improvement of people s living standards kitchen waste is also growing in large quantities as one of kitchen waste annual waste cooking oil wco discharge amounts to over 5 million tons in china 1 wco can be divided into three categories including the oil extracted from floating fatty in sewers or leftovers the oil extracted from low quality pork or pig offal as well as the oil that fried foods that exceed the required time and reused 2 the concentration of organic matter in wco is high which is easy to produce a malodorous smell and easy to be sour if it is discharged or stacked directly without treatment it will seriously pollute the environment and restrict ecological development in addition if the untreated waste grease is discharged into the urban drainage system at will it will react with the wastewater and then deposit in the sewer or adhere to the pipe wall which will greatly reduce the service life of the pipe and even lead to pipe blockage and sanitary overflow 3 therefore it is urgent to find a reasonable disposal method to scientifically manage and utilize the wco recently the recovery of volatile fatty acids vfas from organic wastes via anaerobic fermentation has been a hotspot 4 in particular as a kind of vfas propionic acid has attracted much attention more and more studies have shown that propionic acid has an important impact on downstream applications for example propionic acid can be used as food medicine feed etc 5 in addition many scholars have also proved that vfas rich in propionic acid can significantly improve the efficiency of biological nutrient removal bnr 6 at the same time some researchers have found that wco tends to produce propionic acid during anaerobic fermentation 7 8 in previous studies it was found that aerobic sludge as was the best sludge inoculation source for wco anaerobic fermentation to produce odd carbon volatile fatty acids ocfa 9 according to the research of luo et al veillonellaceae would be enriched in anaerobic fermentation of as and wco and such bacteria are facultative anaerobic aerobic bacteria which have been proved to be the main bacteria for propionic acid production 10 therefore inoculating as in wco is more likely to produce propionic acid fermentation and vfas would also be conducive to the production of propionic acid however in the anaerobic fermentation process of wco there is an imbalance between rapid hydrolysis and acidification 11 12 the ability to convert the hydrolysate of wco into vfas needs to be further improved fe3o4 has good conductivity which is one of many oxides formed by iron in nature different from other common iron oxides such as feo fe2o3 etc fe3o4 contains both fe3 and fe2 valence iron ions which belong to mixed valence magnetite many microorganisms related to acid production can obtain iron in the form of nutrients or electron acceptors donors and can use iron oxide as the terminal electron acceptor donor of microbial extracellular respiration to promote the metabolism of microorganisms themselves yin 13 added fe3o4 into an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr to investigate its effect on the anaerobic treatment process and he found that fe3o4 can increase the conductivity and extracellular electron transport capacity of anaerobic sludge in a methanogenic stage zhang 14 invested fe3o4 nanoparticles in a semi continuous anaerobic fermentation experiment and the results showed that fe3o4 nanoparticles can effectively promote the hydrolysis and acidification process and improve the methane production capacity of the system however there are few studies on fe3o4 in wco anaerobic fermentation and the effect on hydrolysis and acid production has not been reported therefore based on the previous production of vfas by anaerobic fermentation of wco and as this study investigates the hydrolysis of wco the accumulation of vfas the content of propionic acid the change of fe2 concentration and the change of microbial population in the system in different concentrations of fe3o4 the optimum concentration of fe3o4 is found out which provides some ideas for the production of propionic acid by anaerobic fermentation of wco and as 2 material and methods 2 1 raw materials the as used in the test was withdrawn from the aerobic tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china

vegetable residue rice grains etc were removed the frying oil and floating fatty stood for 2 h and were taken to the upper oil slick for standby meanwhile the sorted waste fat meat was soaked in tap water for 0 5 h and boiled for 3 min to eliminate the influence of food additives and other residual impurities then it was taken out and removed the residual oil on the surface put in the crusher

with the purity of 97 is pure black powder with a relative molecular weight of 231 53 2 2 experimental procedures the batch experiments were divided into three 600 ml glass bottles which were recorded as r1 r2 and r3 respectively according to the previous research results of the research group we determined the mixing ratio of sludge and oil 15 16 there were 300 ml of wco fermentation broth and 300 ml of as ts 1 in each glass bottle the main properties of wco fermentation broth are total suspended solids tss 115 2 2 1 g l volatile suspended solids vss 109 2 1 3 g l lipids and oil 11 7 1 1 g l

total reaction time of the whole batch was 15 d each glass bottle was set in a constant temperature water bath at 35 1 c and the oscillation frequency was set to 120 rpm and each bottle was flushed with nitrogen before the trials began 2 3 analytical methods in this experiment 10 ml of sample was taken every day and placed in a centrifuge tube after the sample was centrifuged at 4000 r min for 10 min the supernatant was used for the determination of vfas concentration and components ph scod and the concentration of fe2 according to the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis method fourth edition issued by the national environmental protection agency various routine analyses were carried out ph was measured by ph meter scod was detected by potassium dichromate method fe2 was detected by o phenanthroline spectrophotometry ts and vs were detected by burning weight loss method vfas concentration and components were analyzed by tian mei gc7900 gas chromatograph to solve the problem of volatile acid dissociation and ensure the accuracy of analysis formic acid was added to the sample before gas chromatography analysis to acidify below ph 3 each sample was injected and measured twice and the average value was taken the parameters of the gas chromatograph are as follows the detector was a flame ionization detector fid and the chromatographic column was cnw wax capillary column the carrier pressure was 0 40 mpa for nitrogen 0 40 mpa for air and 0 20 mpa for hydrogen the temperatures of column box injector and fid detector were 80 c 220 c and 250 c respectively the temperature rose procedure of the column box is initially maintained at 80 c for 2 min then increased to 110 c at 20 c min for 1 min and then increased to 180 c at 10 c min for 1 min

rdna gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr 16srrna macro genome sequencing was used to sequence the 0 mg l and the best dosage of fe3o4 the sampling time points were in the stable period numbered a1 a2 respectively 2 4 statistical analysis all tests were conducted in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of the results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe3o4 on the hydrolysis of wco in the process of anaerobic fermentation of organic matter the change of scod represents the hydrolysis and solubilization of organic components in the anaerobic system which can directly reflect the performance of fermentation as shown in fig 1a the scod concentration of each group shows a steady upward trend in the start up stage when the fermentation reached the 5th day the scod concentration of each group reached 6789 mg l 6857 mg l and 7264 mg l respectively after adding fe3o4 scod decreased significantly in all groups this may be because the added fresh fermentation substrate has not yet begun to hydrolyze during repeated fermentation at this time the microorganism was still in the growth delay period and needs to adapt to the newly added fermentation substrate and fe3o4 after gradual adaptation the concentration of scod in each group increased rapidly among them the increase of scod concentration of r2 was the most obvious from the 6th day to the 8th day the concentration of scod increased by 2 41 times from 3600 mg l to 8680 mg l and then the scod remained above 8000 mg l for 4 days until it gradually decreased on the 13th day and finally stabilized to 6139 mg l according to the comparison of experimental results the peak concentration of scod of r2 was up to 8800 mg l which exceeded 21 11 and 16 40 of the maximum concentration of scod of r1 and r3 respectively it is not difficult to see that the dose of 5 g l has the best effect on optimizing the production of vfas from wco the concentration of scod in the blank group r1 was always lower than that in other groups the existence of fe3o4 enhanced the hydrolysis of wco because fe3o4 promoted the hydrolysis and acidification processes were proposed to be via dissimilatory iron reduction it was reported that fe oxides enriched the fe iii reducing microorganisms that are capable of utilizing a variety of substrates and participating in the decomposition of complex organics via the dissimilatory iron reduction 17 but when fe3o4 continued to increase scod would decrease slightly if fe3o4 was excessive it may inhibit the reproduction of anaerobic bacteria and affect the process of hydrolysis 18 moreover the inhibition of high concentration fe3o4 may be due to its magnetism which would enhance the agglomeration of microorganisms and the iron oxide particle layer surrounding microorganisms hinders the metabolism between mutually operating bacteria resulting in adverse effects 19 and another review indicated that high concentration of iron ion had toxicity effect on the bacteria which consequently decreased vfas production 20 therefore controlling the fe3o4 concentration to an appropriate amount has a positive impact on the improvement of the hydrolysis capacity of wco in addition as iron oxide fe3o4 has two valence states of fe2 and fe3 according to m ai 21 the catalysis of iron oxides coexisting in two valence states can significantly enhance the activity of pyruvate and provide basic favorable conditions for its conversion to vfas at this time the proteins lipids and polysaccharides in as and wco were continuously hydrolyzed into smaller molecules after adding fe3o4 to prepare for the next acid production 22 the acid production process of wco and as is shown in fig 2 in addition the bioavailability of water soluble ions released by fe3o4 has been proved to be higher than that of other forms fe is a common metal trace element which is of positive significance to the growth and development of hydrolytic bacteria in the fermentation process it has high bioavailability and can enhance the activity of related enzymes in hydrolytic acid production 23 25 it is worth noting that the scod concentration in r2 increases and then decreases indicating that fe3o4 may have a potential impact on the subsequent methanogenic activity while promoting the hydrolysis and acid production of wco fe3o4 can accelerate the hydrolysis of wco and shorten the fermentation cycle 26 it can be seen from fig 3a that fe3o4 can increase the yield of vfas but with the extension of fermentation time and the advancement of the methanogenic stage scod would be gradually consumed consistent with the research of other researchers fe3o4 can promote the hydrolysis and acid production of organic waste improve enzyme activity and enrich functional microorganisms so as to enhance the degradation and energy recovery of wco 26 it can be seen that although the hydrolysis of waste oil benefits from the addition of fe3o4 it is necessary to strictly control the fermentation time while considering the dosage 27 3 2 effect of fe3o4 on the accumulation of vfas and propionic acid after adding fe3o4 the change of vfas concentration in each reactor is shown in fig 3a the initial vfas concentrations of each group were 213 48 mg cod l 95 21 mg cod l and 171 35 mg cod l respectively the vfas concentration in the start up stage showed a steady upward trend as a whole by the 5th day the vfas concentration in each group reached 6583 94 mg cod l 6534 94 mg cod l and 6317 99 mg cod l respectively with an average value of 6478 95 mg cod l then entering the reaction stage different concentrations of fe3o4 were added to each reactor it can be seen that under any concentration the addition of fe3o4 can improve the vfas yield of the fermentation system r1 r2 and r3 reached the peak value of vfas on the 8th 10th and 8th day of fermentation with the concentrations of 5920 04 mg cod l 7142 84 mg cod l and 6501 25 mg cod l respectively r1 in the blank group decreased after reaching the peak value of acid production on the 8th day and then the concentration was lower than r1 and r2 from the average level of vfas concentration the average vfas concentrations of the three groups in the reaction stage were 4714 50 mg cod l 5622 40 mg cod l and 5035 47 mg cod l respectively compared with r1 the maximum yield of r2 and r3 increased by 20 66 and 9 82 respectively and the average concentration increased by 19 26 and 6 8 in addition compared with the start up stage r1 blank group can t adapt well to the repeated fermentation mode its vfas only rebounded briefly and began to decline gradually after reaching the peak and the acid production was always lower than that in the start up stage this phenomenon indirectly shows that the system has insufficient ability to deal with impact load and the addition of fe3o4 is more conducive to the stability of the fermentation system it can be seen from table 3 that in terms of vfas production r2 has a significant difference compared with r1 and there is no significant difference with r3 there was a significant difference in vfas yield between r2 and r3 the results showed that when the dosage of fe3o4 is 5 g l the promotion effect on the production of vfas from wco was at a significant level which was statistically significant however when fe3o4 was excessive its promoting effect on the acid production of wco was not obvious and the difference between different dosages was significant it shows that in the process of using fe3o4 to optimize the production of vfas from wco we need to pay attention to the control of dosage to achieve better efficiency of acid production the single acid distribution in vfas changes due to the different dosages of fe3o4 added among them the concentration of propionic acid is the highest followed by valeric acid and the fermentation system is propionic acid fermentation the concentration of single acid in each group of reactors is shown as fig 3b the propionic acid contents of r1 r2 and r3 are 3433 05 mg cod l 3980 07 mg cod l and 3410 56 mg cod l it can be seen from the above data that propionic acid production in r2 was higher than that in r1 and r3 5 g l of fe3o4 accelerated the appearance of various vfas during the fermentation of wco and had a certain inhibitory effect on the degradation of propionic acid therefore propionic acid has been accumulated to a certain extent this phenomenon corresponded to the maintenance of scod concentration at a high level propionic acid in vfas had a toxic effect on methane production it had the lowest conversion rate and the largest energy consumption in vfas once accumulated it would imbalance the anaerobic digestion process to inhibit the broken methanogenic pathway of acetyl at the same time the increase of h2 in the fermentation process would inevitably lead to the reduction of propionic acid degradation efficiency thus contributing to further propionic acid accumulation 28 the research showed that the strong inhibition of fe oxide on the degradation of vfas always occurred in the early stage of fermentation 29 at this stage vfas could be maintained at a high level not degraded and could accelerate acid production therefore shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt and making the reaction stay in the acid accumulation stage repeatedly would make it possible to remove almost all vfas except propionic acid and accelerate the generation of high concentration propionic acid 30 although the pathway of propionic acid utilization in methanogenic bacteria was not clear it can be speculated that this is likely to be achieved through the pathway of benzoyl coenzyme a and acetate 5 g l fe3o4 may promote this process because the key enzyme benzoyl coa reductase was found to contain fe 31 3 3 effect of fe2 concentration change in each group as one of the essential metal elements for microbial growth fe participates in many metabolic processes of anaerobic digestion and its positive impact on fermentation performance has been widely reported as a growth cofactor of important fermentation key enzymes fe is of great significance in the regulation of acidogenic and methanogenic stages 32 in the acidic environment of the anaerobic system fe3o4 will precipitate dissolved fe2 and fe3 which is prone to electron transfer between two valence ions to better understand the change and influence of fe3o4 after adding the wco to an anaerobic system the concentration of fe2 in each reactor during fermentation was recorded in this study and the results were shown in fig 1b on the whole the concentration of fe2 in the three groups of reactors increased from the 6th to the 7th day and r1 and r3 reached the peak value in the reaction stage on the 7th day which was 34 53 mg l and 17 89 mg l respectively at this time the concentration of fe2 in r2 was almost the same as that in r3 which was 18 60 mg l this may be caused by a new round of hydrolysis of the original relevant microbial community in the system after adding fresh fermentation broth in these two days the concentration of fe2 in the blank group was higher than r2 and r3 which may be explained by the dominant fe3 in fe3o4 and the oxidation of fe2 subsequently the concentration of fe2 in r1 and r3 began to decrease gradually the difference was that the concentration of fe2 in r2 increased gradually after the 7th day overall the concentration of fe2 in r2 was the highest 40 91 mg l followed by r1 34 53 mg l and r3 17 89 mg l based on the analysis of vfas concentration the acid production efficiency in r2 was the best among the three groups of reactors it showed that when the dosage of fe3o4 was 5 g l the fe2 level in the system was more suitable for the acid production of wco under the stimulation of an appropriate amount of fe2 the activity of relevant hydrolases may be significantly enhanced 33 studies have pointed out that a high fe2 level has a certain toxic effect on the functional groups and protein molecular structure of vfas acid producing microorganisms and may also destroy the structure of extracellular polymer substances eps in sludge 34 eps is of great significance in maintaining the stability of the system and protecting the fermentation system from metal ions based on this it can be speculated that when fe3o4 was added in excess in the reactor r3 fe3o4 may precipitate too high a concentration of fe2 in a short time but it may have a certain toxic effect on relevant microorganisms in the system although more fe3o4 was put into r3 the dissolution of fe2 was inhibited and the electron transfer between fe2 and fe3 became weak therefore fe2 in r3 would continue to decline combined with the difference analysis table 3 it can be seen that the concentration of fe2 between the three groups of reactors showed significant or extremely significant differences indicating that different amounts of fe3o4 would indeed have a significant impact on the concentration of fe2 in the system the results of correlation analysis clearly showed table 4 that when the addition amount of fe3o4 was 5 g l or 10 g l there was a close relationship between the concentration of fe2 vfas production and related acid producing functional microorganisms in the fermentation system and the correlation was more significant when the dosage of 5 g l it is worth noting that the concentration of fe2 of r3 was significantly negatively correlated with the acid concentration indicating that the increase of fe3o4 dosage would inhibit the dissolution of fe2 but it still had a certain promoting effect on the acid production process of wco the reason can be attributed to the complexity of anaerobic fermentation a single influencing factor was not enough to completely affect the whole acid production result some other factors such as the increase of enzyme activity and the interaction of feedback coordination mechanisms between microorganisms may affect the fermentation system 3 4 microbial community analysis to further understand the effect of fe3o4 on the microbial community in the process of anaerobic fermentation and acid production of wco the samples finally selected for microbial detection in this test are the reaction end microbial samples of blank groups r1 and r2 5g l for sampling and analysis and the analysis data correspond to a1 and a2 microbial community analysis shows fig 4a that the top three categories of abundance in a1 and a2 are the same followed by firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidetes these three phyla have been proved to be the dominant phyla in the production of vfas by anaerobic fermentation and have been reported in various organic fermentation 35 36 the results of community composition showed that firmicutes with the highest abundance reached 64 48 and 79 57 in a1 and a2 the relative abundance of a2 became higher with the addition of fe3o4 increased by 15 09 at the same time the relative abundance of proteobacteria in a2 decreased from 16 44 of a1 to 9 54 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes decreased from 11 02 to 6 44 and the relative abundance of the two gates decreased by 6 9 and 4 58 respectively in addition chloroflexi and actinobacteria reached in a1 but decreased slightly in a2 it can be seen that fe3o4 made the bacteria in the wco fermentation system evolve towards firmicutes while the relative abundance of other types decreased slightly firmicutes are a common type of fermentation gate the microorganisms under the gate performed well in the hydrolysis and acidification stage of the fermentation process they can hydrolyze macromolecular organic matter and promote the acidification process metabolize lipids proteins polysaccharides and other organic substrates 37 in particular although proteobacteria was also common fermentation bacteria it was more prone to the degradation of polysaccharides and proteins in terms of substrate specificity because proteobacteria belonged to protein like bacteria it was more conducive to the production of butyric acid and acetic acid at high abundance 38 bacteroidetes as the third dominant was reported to be conducive to the production of acetic acid the decrease of its proportion also confirmed that the reaction was not conductive to acetic acid 39 bacteroidetes was also related to the production of long chain fatty acids lcfa which also showed that it was closely related to the hydrolysis and fermentation of wco 40 corresponding to the increase of propionic acid concentration fe3o4 brought the increase of firmicutes and the decrease of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes and more polysaccharides and lipid degrading bacteria were enriched in the system which was beneficial to the waste oil fermentation process with propionic acid as the production target at the family level fig 4b veillonellaceae under firmicutes played a leading role in the two groups of reactions compared with a1 the most obvious change in a2 was that the abundance of veillonellaceae increased by 11 9 as facultative anaerobic aerobic bacteria veillonellaceae were easy to be enriched in aerobic state which could hydrolyze organic components and convert them into volatile fatty acids dominated by propionic acid therefore it had a high abundance of community in the reactor related to propionic acid production 10 in addition the relative abundance of lactobacillaceae also increased slightly it had a good ability to decompose lipids and polysaccharides but its ability to degrade proteins was very low 41 from the principle of the formation of fermentation end products protein was always butyric acid fermentation so the increase of lactobacillus was of positive significance to propionic acid fermentation clostridiaceae played a crucial role in the acetic acid formation stage because they were involved in the degradation of lcfa to acetic acid 42 from the fig 4b clostridiaceae decreased from 6 13 in a1 to 3 47 in a2 which further confirmed that the reaction was more conducive to the production of propionic acid rather than acetic acid in the presence of fe3o4 not only clostridiaceae but also burkholderiaceae decreased the abundance of community in a2 according to the research of luo et al burkholderiaceae was closely related to the production of acetic acid 11 the increase of veillonellaceae and lactobacillaceae and the decrease of clostridiaceae and burkholderiaceae explained the potential reason for the increase of fe3o4 to produce more propionic acid although the composition similarity of microbial communities under different fermentation operating conditions was high the relative abundance of dominant species still depended on the substrate type to a large extent the optimization of fe3o4 mainly promotes the formation and transformation of relevant microbial communities more suitable for propionic acid production 4 conclusion in wco and as fermentation system adding an appropriate amount of fe3o4 can enhance the efficiency of hydrolysis and acidification and promote the accumulation of vfas however when the dose is too high the concentration of acid production would be reduced and the water liberation would be slow when the dosage of fe3o4 is 5 g l the overall efficiency is the best under this condition the peak concentration of vfas is 7142 84 201 48 mg cod l propionic acid is the main vfas product and the peak concentration is 4990 92 124 76 mg cod l in addition microbiological analysis showed that 5 g l of fe3o4 could make the formation of microbial community develop in the direction conducive to the production of propionic acid declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that can inappropriately influence our work there is no professional or other personal interest of any nature or kind in any product service and or company that could be construed as influencing the position

12848,in this study fe3o4 was added to the anaerobic fermentation process of waste cooking oil wco and aerobic sludge as and its effects on the production of volatile fatty acids vfas were explored from the perspectives of propionic acid concentration fe2 concentration and microorganisms the results showed that when the dosage of fe3o4 was 5 g l it was conducive to the hydrolysis and acidification of wco and it had a significant effect on the concentration of vfas and propionic acid the maximum concentration of vfas was 7142 84 201 48 mg cod l and the maximum concentration of propionic acid was 4990 92 124 76 mg cod l which increased by 20 65 and 27 65 respectively compared with the blank group meanwhile microbial community analysis showed that firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are the main phylum for the production of vfa in the anaerobic fermentation of wco and as veillonellaceae under firmicutes was the main microorganism to produce propionic acid it provides microbial support for the hydrolysis of wco and the subsequent production of propionic acid this study provides a new idea for fe3o4 to promote the hydrolysis of wco and produce propionic acid and brings potential economic benefits to wco treatment keywords waste cooking oil wco propionic acid volatile fatty acids vfas anaerobic fermentation 1 introduction with the development of the global economy and the improvement of people s living standards kitchen waste is also growing in large quantities as one of kitchen waste annual waste cooking oil wco discharge amounts to over 5 million tons in china 1 wco can be divided into three categories including the oil extracted from floating fatty in sewers or leftovers the oil extracted from low quality pork or pig offal as well as the oil that fried foods that exceed the required time and reused 2 the concentration of organic matter in wco is high which is easy to produce a malodorous smell and easy to be sour if it is discharged or stacked directly without treatment it will seriously pollute the environment and restrict ecological development in addition if the untreated waste grease is discharged into the urban drainage system at will it will react with the wastewater and then deposit in the sewer or adhere to the pipe wall which will greatly reduce the service life of the pipe and even lead to pipe blockage and sanitary overflow 3 therefore it is urgent to find a reasonable disposal method to scientifically manage and utilize the wco recently the recovery of volatile fatty acids vfas from organic wastes via anaerobic fermentation has been a hotspot 4 in particular as a kind of vfas propionic acid has attracted much attention more and more studies have shown that propionic acid has an important impact on downstream applications for example propionic acid can be used as food medicine feed etc 5 in addition many scholars have also proved that vfas rich in propionic acid can significantly improve the efficiency of biological nutrient removal bnr 6 at the same time some researchers have found that wco tends to produce propionic acid during anaerobic fermentation 7 8 in previous studies it was found that aerobic sludge as was the best sludge inoculation source for wco anaerobic fermentation to produce odd carbon volatile fatty acids ocfa 9 according to the research of luo et al veillonellaceae would be enriched in anaerobic fermentation of as and wco and such bacteria are facultative anaerobic aerobic bacteria which have been proved to be the main bacteria for propionic acid production 10 therefore inoculating as in wco is more likely to produce propionic acid fermentation and vfas would also be conducive to the production of propionic acid however in the anaerobic fermentation process of wco there is an imbalance between rapid hydrolysis and acidification 11 12 the ability to convert the hydrolysate of wco into vfas needs to be further improved fe3o4 has good conductivity which is one of many oxides formed by iron in nature different from other common iron oxides such as feo fe2o3 etc fe3o4 contains both fe3 and fe2 valence iron ions which belong to mixed valence magnetite many microorganisms related to acid production can obtain iron in the form of nutrients or electron acceptors donors and can use iron oxide as the terminal electron acceptor donor of microbial extracellular respiration to promote the metabolism of microorganisms themselves yin 13 added fe3o4 into an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr to investigate its effect on the anaerobic treatment process and he found that fe3o4 can increase the conductivity and extracellular electron transport capacity of anaerobic sludge in a methanogenic stage zhang 14 invested fe3o4 nanoparticles in a semi continuous anaerobic fermentation experiment and the results showed that fe3o4 nanoparticles can effectively promote the hydrolysis and acidification process and improve the methane production capacity of the system however there are few studies on fe3o4 in wco anaerobic fermentation and the effect on hydrolysis and acid production has not been reported therefore based on the previous production of vfas by anaerobic fermentation of wco and as this study investigates the hydrolysis of wco the accumulation of vfas the content of propionic acid the change of fe2 concentration and the change of microbial population in the system in different concentrations of fe3o4 the optimum concentration of fe3o4 is found out which provides some ideas for the production of propionic acid by anaerobic fermentation of wco and as 2 material and methods 2 1 raw materials the as used in the test was withdrawn from the aerobic tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china

vegetable residue rice grains etc were removed the frying oil and floating fatty stood for 2 h and were taken to the upper oil slick for standby meanwhile the sorted waste fat meat was soaked in tap water for 0 5 h and boiled for 3 min to eliminate the influence of food additives and other residual impurities then it was taken out and removed the residual oil on the surface put in the crusher

with the purity of 97 is pure black powder with a relative molecular weight of 231 53 2 2 experimental procedures the batch experiments were divided into three 600 ml glass bottles which were recorded

ml of as ts 1 in each glass bottle the main properties of wco fermentation broth are total suspended solids tss 115 2 2 1 g l volatile suspended solids vss 109 2 1 3 g l lipids and oil 11 7 1 1 g l

statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe3o4 on the hydrolysis of wco in the process of anaerobic fermentation of organic matter the change of scod represents the hydrolysis and solubilization of organic components in the anaerobic system which can directly reflect the performance of fermentation as shown in fig 1a the scod concentration of each group shows a steady upward trend in the start up stage when the fermentation reached the 5th day the scod concentration of each group reached 6789 mg l 6857 mg l and 7264 mg l respectively after adding fe3o4 scod decreased significantly in all groups this may be because the added fresh fermentation substrate has not yet begun to hydrolyze during repeated fermentation at this time the microorganism was still in the growth delay period and needs to adapt to the newly added fermentation substrate and fe3o4 after gradual adaptation the concentration of scod in each group increased rapidly among them the increase of scod concentration of r2 was the most obvious from the 6th day to the 8th day the concentration of scod increased by 2 41 times from 3600 mg l to 8680 mg l and then the scod remained above 8000 mg l for 4 days until it gradually decreased on the 13th day and finally stabilized to 6139 mg l according to the comparison of experimental results the peak concentration of scod of r2 was up to 8800 mg l which exceeded 21 11 and 16 40 of the maximum concentration of scod of r1 and r3 respectively it is not difficult to see that the dose of 5 g l has the best effect on optimizing the production of vfas from wco the concentration of scod in the blank group r1 was always lower than that in other groups the existence of fe3o4 enhanced the hydrolysis of wco because fe3o4 promoted the hydrolysis and acidification processes were proposed to be via dissimilatory iron reduction it was reported that fe oxides enriched the fe iii reducing microorganisms that are capable of utilizing a variety of substrates and participating in the decomposition of complex organics via the dissimilatory iron reduction 17 but when fe3o4 continued to increase scod would decrease slightly if fe3o4 was excessive it may inhibit the reproduction of anaerobic bacteria and affect the process of hydrolysis 18 moreover the inhibition of high concentration fe3o4 may be due to its magnetism which would enhance the agglomeration of microorganisms and the iron oxide particle layer surrounding microorganisms hinders the metabolism between mutually operating bacteria resulting in adverse effects 19 and another review indicated that high concentration of iron ion had toxicity effect on the bacteria which consequently decreased vfas production 20 therefore controlling the fe3o4 concentration to an appropriate amount has a positive impact on the improvement of the hydrolysis capacity of wco in addition as iron oxide fe3o4 has two valence states of fe2 and fe3 according to m ai 21 the catalysis of iron oxides coexisting in two valence states can significantly enhance the activity of pyruvate and provide basic favorable conditions for its conversion to vfas at this time the proteins lipids and polysaccharides in as and wco were continuously hydrolyzed into smaller molecules after adding fe3o4 to prepare for the next acid production 22 the acid production process of wco and as is shown in fig 2 in addition the bioavailability of water soluble ions released by fe3o4 has been proved to be higher than that of other forms fe is a common metal trace element which is of positive significance to the growth and development of hydrolytic bacteria in the fermentation process it has high bioavailability and can enhance the activity of related enzymes in hydrolytic acid production 23 25 it is worth noting that the scod concentration in r2 increases and then decreases indicating that fe3o4 may have a potential impact on the subsequent methanogenic activity while promoting the hydrolysis and acid production of wco fe3o4 can accelerate the hydrolysis of wco and shorten the fermentation cycle 26 it can be seen from fig 3a that fe3o4 can increase the yield of vfas but with the extension of fermentation time and the advancement of the methanogenic stage scod would be gradually consumed consistent with the research of other researchers fe3o4 can promote the hydrolysis and acid production of organic waste improve enzyme activity and enrich functional microorganisms so as to enhance the degradation and energy recovery of wco 26 it can be seen that although the hydrolysis of waste oil benefits from the addition of fe3o4 it is necessary to strictly control the fermentation time while considering the dosage 27 3 2 effect of fe3o4 on the accumulation of vfas and propionic acid after adding fe3o4 the change of vfas concentration in each reactor is shown in fig 3a the initial vfas concentrations of each group were 213 48 mg cod l 95 21 mg cod l and 171 35 mg cod l respectively the vfas concentration in the start up stage showed a steady upward trend as a whole by the 5th day the vfas concentration in each group reached 6583 94 mg cod l 6534 94 mg cod l and 6317 99 mg cod l respectively with an average value of 6478 95 mg cod l then entering the reaction stage different concentrations of fe3o4 were added to each reactor it can be seen that under any concentration the addition of fe3o4 can improve the vfas yield of the fermentation system r1 r2 and r3 reached the peak value of vfas on the 8th 10th and 8th day of fermentation with the concentrations of 5920 04 mg cod l 7142 84 mg cod l and 6501 25 mg cod l respectively r1 in the blank group decreased after reaching the peak value of acid production on the 8th day and then the concentration was lower than r1 and r2 from the average level of vfas concentration the average vfas concentrations of the three groups in the reaction stage were 4714 50 mg cod l 5622 40 mg cod l and 5035 47 mg cod l respectively compared with r1 the maximum yield of r2 and r3 increased by 20 66 and 9 82 respectively and the average concentration increased by 19 26 and 6 8 in addition compared with the start up stage r1 blank group can t adapt well to the repeated fermentation mode its vfas only rebounded briefly and began to decline gradually after reaching the peak and the acid production was always lower than that in the start up stage this phenomenon indirectly shows that the system has insufficient ability to deal with impact load and the addition of fe3o4 is more conducive to the stability of the fermentation system it can be seen from table 3 that in terms of vfas production r2 has a significant difference compared with r1 and there is no significant difference with r3 there was a significant difference in vfas yield between r2 and r3 the results showed that when the dosage of fe3o4 is 5 g l the promotion effect on the production of vfas from wco was at a significant level which was statistically significant however when fe3o4 was excessive its promoting effect on the acid production of wco was not obvious and the difference between different dosages was significant it shows that in the process of using fe3o4 to optimize the production of vfas from wco we need to pay attention to the control of dosage to achieve better efficiency of acid production the single acid distribution in vfas changes due to the different dosages of fe3o4 added among them the concentration of propionic acid is the highest followed by valeric acid and the fermentation system is propionic acid fermentation the concentration of single acid in each group of reactors is shown as fig 3b the propionic acid contents of r1 r2 and r3 are 3433 05 mg cod l 3980 07 mg cod l and 3410 56 mg cod l it can be seen from the above data that propionic acid production in r2 was higher than that in r1 and r3 5 g l of fe3o4 accelerated the appearance of various vfas during the fermentation of wco and had a certain inhibitory effect on the degradation of propionic acid therefore propionic acid has been accumulated to a certain extent this phenomenon corresponded to the maintenance of scod concentration at a high level propionic acid in vfas had a toxic effect on methane production it had the lowest conversion rate and the largest energy consumption in vfas once accumulated it would imbalance the anaerobic digestion process to inhibit the broken methanogenic pathway of acetyl at the same time the increase of h2 in the fermentation process would inevitably lead to the reduction of propionic acid degradation efficiency thus contributing to further propionic acid accumulation 28 the research showed that the strong inhibition of fe oxide on the degradation of vfas always occurred in the early stage of fermentation 29 at this stage vfas could be maintained at a high level not degraded and could accelerate acid production therefore shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt and making the reaction stay in the acid accumulation stage repeatedly would make it possible to remove almost all vfas except propionic acid and accelerate the generation of high concentration propionic acid 30 although the pathway of propionic acid utilization in methanogenic bacteria was not clear it can be speculated that this is likely to be achieved through the pathway of benzoyl coenzyme a and acetate 5 g l fe3o4 may promote this process because the key enzyme benzoyl coa reductase was found to contain fe 31 3 3 effect of fe2 concentration change in each group as one of the essential metal elements for microbial growth fe participates in many metabolic processes of anaerobic digestion and its positive impact on fermentation performance has been widely reported as a growth cofactor of important fermentation key enzymes fe is of great significance in the regulation of acidogenic and methanogenic stages 32 in the acidic environment of the anaerobic system fe3o4 will precipitate dissolved fe2 and fe3 which is prone to electron transfer between two valence ions to better understand the change and influence of fe3o4 after adding the wco to an anaerobic system the concentration of fe2 in each reactor during fermentation was recorded in this study and the results were shown in fig 1b on the whole the concentration of fe2 in the three groups of reactors increased from the 6th to the 7th day and r1 and r3 reached the peak value in the reaction stage on the 7th day which was 34 53 mg l and 17 89 mg l respectively at this time the concentration of fe2 in r2 was almost the same as that in r3 which was 18 60 mg l this may be caused by a new round of hydrolysis of the original relevant microbial community in the system after adding fresh fermentation broth in these two days the concentration of fe2 in the blank group was higher than r2 and r3 which may be explained by the dominant fe3 in fe3o4 and the oxidation of fe2 subsequently the concentration of fe2 in r1 and r3 began to decrease gradually the difference was that the concentration of fe2 in r2 increased gradually after the 7th day overall the concentration of fe2 in r2 was the highest 40 91 mg l followed by r1 34 53 mg l and r3 17 89 mg l based on the analysis of vfas concentration the acid production efficiency in r2 was the best among the three groups of reactors it showed that when the dosage of fe3o4 was 5 g l the fe2 level in the system was more suitable for the acid production of wco under the stimulation of an appropriate amount of fe2 the activity of relevant hydrolases may be significantly enhanced 33 studies have pointed out that a high fe2 level has a certain toxic effect on the functional groups and protein molecular structure of vfas acid producing microorganisms and may also destroy the structure of extracellular polymer substances eps in sludge 34 eps is of great significance in maintaining the stability of the system and protecting the fermentation system from metal ions based on this it can be speculated that when fe3o4 was added in excess in the reactor r3 fe3o4 may precipitate too high a concentration of fe2 in a short time but it may have a certain toxic effect on relevant microorganisms in the system although more fe3o4 was put into r3 the dissolution of fe2 was inhibited and the electron transfer between fe2 and fe3 became weak therefore fe2 in r3 would continue to decline combined with the difference analysis table 3 it can be seen that the concentration of fe2 between the three groups of reactors showed significant or extremely significant differences indicating that different amounts of fe3o4 would indeed have a significant impact on the concentration of fe2 in the system the results of correlation analysis clearly showed table 4 that when the addition amount of fe3o4 was 5 g l or 10 g l there was a close relationship between the concentration of fe2 vfas production and related acid producing functional microorganisms in the fermentation system and the correlation was more significant when the dosage of 5 g l it is worth noting that the concentration of fe2 of r3 was significantly negatively correlated with the acid concentration indicating that the increase of fe3o4 dosage would inhibit the dissolution of fe2 but it still had a certain promoting effect on the acid production process of wco the reason can be attributed to the complexity of anaerobic fermentation a single influencing factor was not enough to completely affect the whole acid production result some other factors such as the increase of enzyme activity and the interaction of feedback coordination mechanisms between microorganisms may affect the fermentation system 3 4 microbial community analysis to further understand the effect of fe3o4 on the microbial community in the process of anaerobic fermentation and acid production of wco the samples finally selected for microbial detection in this test are the reaction end microbial samples of blank groups r1 and r2 5g l for sampling and analysis and the analysis data correspond to a1 and a2 microbial community analysis shows fig 4a that the top three categories of abundance in a1 and a2 are the same followed by firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidetes these three phyla have been proved to be the dominant phyla in the production of vfas by anaerobic fermentation and have been reported in various organic fermentation 35 36 the results of community composition showed that firmicutes with the highest abundance reached 64 48 and 79 57 in a1 and a2 the relative abundance of a2 became higher with the addition of fe3o4 increased by 15 09 at the same time the relative abundance of proteobacteria in a2 decreased from 16 44 of a1 to 9 54 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes decreased from 11 02 to 6 44 and the relative abundance of the two gates decreased by 6 9 and 4 58 respectively in addition chloroflexi and actinobacteria reached in a1 but decreased slightly in a2 it can be seen that fe3o4 made the bacteria in the wco fermentation system evolve towards firmicutes while the relative abundance of other types decreased slightly firmicutes are a common type of fermentation gate the microorganisms under the gate performed well in the hydrolysis and acidification stage of the fermentation process they can hydrolyze macromolecular organic matter and promote the acidification process metabolize lipids proteins polysaccharides and other organic substrates 37 in particular although proteobacteria was also common fermentation bacteria it was more prone to the degradation of polysaccharides and proteins in terms of substrate specificity because proteobacteria belonged to protein like bacteria it was more conducive to the production of butyric acid and acetic acid at high abundance 38 bacteroidetes as the third dominant was reported to be conducive to the production of acetic acid the decrease of its proportion also confirmed that the reaction was not conductive to acetic acid 39 bacteroidetes was also related to the production of long chain fatty acids lcfa which also showed that it was closely related to the hydrolysis and fermentation of wco 40 corresponding to the increase of propionic acid concentration fe3o4 brought the increase of firmicutes and the decrease of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes and more polysaccharides and lipid degrading bacteria were enriched in the system which was beneficial to the waste oil fermentation process with propionic acid as the production target at the family level fig 4b veillonellaceae under firmicutes played a leading role in the two groups of reactions compared with a1 the most obvious change in a2 was that the abundance of veillonellaceae increased by 11 9 as facultative anaerobic aerobic bacteria veillonellaceae were easy to be enriched in aerobic state which could hydrolyze organic components and convert them into volatile fatty acids dominated by propionic acid therefore it had a high abundance of community in the reactor related to propionic acid production 10 in addition the relative abundance of lactobacillaceae also increased slightly it had a good ability to decompose lipids and polysaccharides but its ability to degrade proteins was very low 41 from the principle of the formation of fermentation end products protein was always butyric acid fermentation so the increase of lactobacillus was of positive significance to propionic acid fermentation clostridiaceae played a crucial role in the acetic acid formation stage because they were involved in the degradation of lcfa to acetic acid 42 from the fig 4b clostridiaceae decreased from 6 13 in a1 to 3 47 in a2 which further confirmed that the reaction was more conducive to the production of propionic acid rather than acetic acid in the presence of fe3o4 not only clostridiaceae but also burkholderiaceae decreased the abundance of community in a2 according to the research of luo et al burkholderiaceae was closely related to the production of acetic acid 11 the increase of veillonellaceae and lactobacillaceae and the decrease of clostridiaceae and burkholderiaceae explained the potential reason for the increase of fe3o4 to produce more propionic acid although the composition similarity of microbial communities under different fermentation operating conditions was high the relative abundance of dominant species still depended on the substrate type to a large extent the optimization of fe3o4 mainly promotes the formation and transformation of relevant microbial communities more suitable for propionic acid production 4 conclusion in wco and as fermentation system adding an appropriate amount of fe3o4 can enhance the efficiency of hydrolysis and acidification and promote the accumulation of vfas however when the dose is too high the concentration of acid production would be reduced and the water liberation would be slow when the dosage of fe3o4 is 5 g l the overall efficiency is the best under this condition the peak concentration of vfas is 7142 84 201 48 mg cod l propionic acid is the main vfas product and the peak concentration is 4990 92 124 76 mg cod l in addition microbiological analysis showed that 5 g l of fe3o4 could make the formation of microbial community develop in the

12849,potentially toxic heavy metals commonly exist in industrial wastewaters presenting a critical global health threat to human health and environment therefore making their treatment is more challenging in this study an attractive polymer composite cs edta adsorbent was developed by immobilization of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta onto chitosan cs through cross linking for the adsorptive removal of multiple heavy metals from industrial wastewater the adsorption of heavy metals i e pb ii cd ii and cu ii onto the developed composite was investigated by performing batch experiments with varying contact time and metal ion concentration in the mono component system the adsorption data fitted to the monolayer langmuir isotherm the maximum adsorption capacities were calculated as 370 37 14 26 243 90 12 47 and 227 27 15 33 mg g 1 for pb ii cd ii and cu ii respectively the kinetics of the adsorption followed the pseudo second order pso models and obtained the rate constant values of 0 009 0 0004 0 001 0 0001 and 0 0007 0 0001 g mg 1 min 1 for pb ii cd ii and cu ii respectively the adsorption of the heavy metals was attributed to the electrostatic interactions between the metals and different functional groups oh nh2 and cooh of the adsorbent and complexation with edta which was confirmed by the elemental mapping eds and ft ir techniques the reusability of the polymer composite was also tested and obtained 92 efficiency even after five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles which clearly demonstrating the high stability of the adsorbent lastly the developed polymer composite was applied for real industrial wastewater excellent removal efficiencies 84 were obtained which makes it a potential candidate for the removal of heavy metals from real industrial wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polymer composite multiple heavy metals isotherm modeling reusability industrial wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recently most serious environmental issues have been raised due to fast industrialization and urbanization among them toxic heavy metals in the water body may have serious hazardous impact on the human and environmental health different heavy metals originated from the mining operations fertilizers and paper industries metal plating facilities tanneries and batteries have attracted great attention from policy makers and scientists due to their presence at a higher level in the water environment 1 among different heavy metals pb ii cd ii and cu ii are the ones of special concern from the public health point of view since they can cause serious health diseases such as brain cancer kidney and damage of dna 2 3 there are various techniques which are designed to remove heavy metals from water body such as coagulation 4 flocculation 5 ion exchange 6 electrochemical treatment 7 and adsorption 8 etc each technique has its own advantages yet it also has disadvantages which makes it less technically appealing in wastewater treatment nonetheless adsorption is considered as most popular facile and efficient alternative technique to remove heavy metals from water because many ecofriendly easily applicable reusable low cost and efficient adsorbents are widely available especially nowadays 9 in designing an adsorption process selection of an adsorbent is the essential step especially for a large scale application several factors should be carefully considered including selectivity adsorption capacity and reusability of adsorbents different adsorbents have been investigated such as β cyclodextrin composite 10 activated carbon 11 silica 12 graphene oxide 13 cs 14 and cellulose 15 etc to achieve a higher treatment efficiency with a faster adsorption rate however it is still difficult to attain higher removal efficiencies fast adsorption rates and selectivity for metal ions using a commercially available adsorbent chitosan is a deacetylated product of chitin and attracts interest due to its easy availability economic feasibility ecofriendly non toxicity and biodegradability 16 it can form strong interaction with heavy metals using its highly reactive amine groups and stable chelation property 17 to increase its adsorption capacity for metal ions and to prevent acidic dissolution chitosan has been chemically modified by different ligands such as nitrotriacetic acid nta ethylene glycol bis 2 aminoethylether n n n n tetraacetic acid egta etc 18 19 previously repo et al 2010 reported the functioning of cs using edta and dtpa for the removal of co ii and ni ii and found the significant adsorption capacities as 63 and 71 mg g 1 with cs edta and 49 1 and 53 1 mg g 1 with dtpa cs respectively 20 recently different cs hydrogels and its combination with gelatin were applied for the removal of multiple heavy metal ions from aqueous solution 21 the removal efficiencies for the pb ii cd ii hg ii and cr iii ions were in the range of 73 94 in a multiple metal ion solution ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta is a well known chelating ligand for the formation of complex with metal ions 22 this property of edta has been used to remove heavy metal ions from water it has been used to functionalize polymeric materials to enhance the adsorption capacity of the materials recently few research groups have reported the functionalization of cs and other materials by edta and their enhanced adsorption capacity 23 25 more recently our research group has reported the functioning of cs with graphene oxide and β cyclodextrin via edta for the simultaneous removal of heavy metal ions and different organic pollutants from wastewater 26 27 in these trifunctional adsorbent edta was not work only as a crosslinking agent but also acted as a chelating agent for the selective removal of heavy metal ions while other part participates in the removal of other pollutants herein the objective of the study is to synthesize edta cs polymeric adsorbent via functionalization of cs with edta through one step for the adsorptive removal of multiple heavy metal ions i e pb ii cd ii and cu ii from wastewater different adsorption parameters such as contact time initial concentration of the target metal ions and reusability of the synthesized material were investigated in aqueous solution adsorption mechanism was also investigated using elemental mapping eds and ft ir techniques lastly the prepared adsorbent was applied to the real industrial wastewater for the purpose of evaluating its applicability in real practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were used of analytical grade without any additional purification deacetylated cs flakes 85 were supplied by sigma aldrich seoul south korea the molecular weight and viscosity of the polymer were 190 000 375 000 g mol 1 and 200 2000 mpa respectively ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 99 was also obtained from sigma aldrich cadmium chloride hydrate cdcl2 xh2o 98 and other metal ion salts were purchased from samchun daejeon south korea and used without further purification deionized water was used in all experiments 2 2 synthesis of cs crosslinked edta cs edta to improve the adsorption capacity of cs its functionalization was carried out with edta as previously reported 20 briefly 5 0 g cs was dissolved in 100 ml of 10 acetic acid v v solution at 50 c and then diluted five times with methanol thereafter 30 0 g edta dianhydride which was synthesized by the previously reported method 28 was suspended in methanol and added slowly into the cs solution then the solution was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 24 h after that the solution was filtered to harvest synthesized precipitates which were mixed with ethanol and stirred for another 16 h then the precipitates were again filtered and washed with naoh solution ph 11 0 to remove the unreacted edta the final synthesized cs edta was washed five times with di water and 0 1 m hcl the precipitates were washed again with water followed by ethanol the final product was dried in a vacuum oven at 45 c then ground with mortar and pestle and stored in a desiccator for further experiments scheme 1 represented the crosslinking between amino groups of cs with edta dianhydride 2 3 characterization of synthesized cs

radiation kα 1 541 å with scan speed 2 min 1 step size 0 02 in the range of 5 80 the surface functional groups of the synthesized adsorbent were examined using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir nexus 670 thermo electron corporation united states in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 the surface morphology and structure information were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem su 8010 hitachi japan at working voltage 1 0 kv voltage thermo scientific ultra dry sdd attached with fesem was used to analyze the elemental compositions n2 adsorption desorption isotherm were performed on belsorpx mini microtracbel corp japan company instrument to examine the specific surface area pore size and pore volume of the prepared polymer composite adsorbent at 77 35 k in 0 0 1 0 range of relative pressures brunauer emmett teller bet and barret joner halenda bjh methods were used for surface area and pore size distribution calculation respectively thermogravimetric analysis tga and derivative thermogravimetric dtg analysis were performed on exstar 6300 japan with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 from 40 to 700 c under nitrogen environment 2 4 batch adsorption experiment the stock solutions of pb ii cd ii and cu ii were prepared and used in all batch adsorption experiments the kinetics experiments were performed by using 50 ml volume of 150 mg l 1 initial concentration with 50 mg adsorbent at fixed interval 5 10 20 30 50 80 120 180 and 300 min the isotherm experiments were performed within concentration range of 10 700 mg l 1 using fix amount of adsorbent 50 mg with 50 ml solution for 3 h equilibrium time the reusability experiments were performed up to five continuous cycles with initial 50 mg l 1 concentration for adsorption the solution mixture was shaken vigorously at 25 c in a controlled incubator shaker with 150 rpm shaker speed and then the samples were separated using 0 45 μm syringe filter the initial and final concentrations of the metals were analyzed by using icpe 9000 shimadzu kyoto japan the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity qe were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 removal efficiency c 0 c e 100 c 0 2

respectively v ml is the volume of the solution and w g is the weight of adsorbent ph 5 0 were used for all the experiments 2 5 wastewater characteristics wastewater was collected from drink manufacturer industry anseong si gyeonggi do south korea the different physicochemical properties such as ph tp cod tss ts vss vs tkn and tan of the wastewater were determined by the standard methods apha 1998 in our research and development center seoul south korea the concentration of heavy metals in the wastewater samples was measured by plasma atomic emission spectrometer icpe 9000 shimadzu kyoto japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the ft ir spectra of raw materials and synthesized cs edta polymer composite are shown in fig 1 a the peaks situated at 1633 and 1543 cm 1 are corresponding to the co stretching vibrations conh and nh deformation of amide groups respectively 29 data shows the characteristic peaks situated at 1734 cm 1 was corresponding to the stretching vibrations of co bond of carboxylic groups these peaks confirm the cross linking of cs by edta dianhydride through amide bond formation the peaks situated at 3446 cm 1 and 1034 cm 1 represent the oh and co stretching vibrations of the cs edta polymer composite adsorbent fig 1 b shows the pxrd patterns of cs edta and the cs edta polymer composite edta shows many characteristics peaks and cs shows two characteristic broad peaks situated at 10 16 and 20 04 which indicates the crystalline nature of edta and polymer nature of cs respectively in the case of the cs edta polymer composite all the individual peaks of edta and cs were disappeared and only one hump occurred between 10 and 30 again confirming the reaction between cs and edta to form amorphous polymer composite fesem images of the cs edta polymer adsorbent at lower and higher magnification are presented in fig 1 c and d respectively at lower magnification the image shows polymeric sheets with higher porous structure this higher porous structure was clearly observed at higher magnification which confirms the loss of sheet nature of the cs functionalized by edta this higher porosity would be useful for the diffusion and adsorption of metal ions the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of the cs edta adsorbent is presented in fig 1s a data represent the h3 type hysteresis loop probably caused by the mesoporous and capillary condensation nature of the composite the bet surface area total pore volume and average pore diameter were found to be 5 141 m2 g 1 0 0155 cm3 g 1 and 12 091 nm respectively along with the surface area functional groups available on the adsorbent are the major contribution in the adsorption of heavy metal ions tga and dta graphs were given in fig 2s the tga curve indicates three different weight loss steps i e approximately 22 28 and 40 weight losses in the range of 41 170 c 230 365 c and 410 597 c these weight losses were due to the removal of moisture and the decomposition of edta and cs respectively 3 2 effect of contact time and kinetics first important factor is contact time for the equilibrium analysis between the adsorbate and adsorbent fig 2 a indicates the effect of contact time on the removal of pb ii cu ii and cd ii metal ions from aqueous solution data indicate the faster adsorption in the initial 5 10 min with the removal efficiency of 91 1 47 4 and then an equilibrium was reached after 60 min with the removal efficiency of 97 therefore an excessive contact time of 180 min was chosen as the equilibrium contact time for further experiments also pb ii showed higher adsorption efficiency compared to other metal ions probably due to having a smaller hydration number than others 25 the pseudo first order pfo 30 and the pseudo second order pso 31 models were used to simulate the adsorption kinetics of pb ii cu ii and cd ii onto the cs edta polymeric adsorbent and are represented below by eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k1 min 1 and k2 mg g 1 min 1 are the rate constants for pfo and pso models respectively qe and qt are the amounts of metal ions adsorbed mg g 1 to the surface of the synthesized adsorbent at equilibrium and at given time t min respectively the linear plots of ln qe qt v s t and t qt v s t are presented in fig 2 b and c respectively and their corresponding calculated parameters values are listed in table 1 the coefficients of determination r2 for the pso models were superior r2 0 99 over those for pfo for all metal ions which clearly demonstrates that the adsorption process is mainly influenced by the chemisorption process also closer the qcal with qexp again support to the pso kinetics model compared to pfo kinetics model moreover the higher rate constant k for pb ii confirms that its adsorption to the adsorbent is faster compared to other metal ions and was attributed to the smaller hydration number of pb ii 3 3 effect of initial concentration and adsorption isotherm the effect of initial concentration of the target metal ions on the adsorption efficiency of cs edta was studied in the range of 10 700 mg l 1 and the data are plotted in fig 3 a which clearly shows that as the concentration increased from 10 to 700 mg l 1 the removal efficiencies decreased from 95 to 64 3 42 52 38 74 for pd ii cd ii and cu ii respectively while the adsorption capacities were enhanced from 7 9 mg g 1 to 360 08 238 11 216 96 mg g 1 for pb ii cd ii and cu ii respectively the higher adsorption capacity at a higher concentration of an adsorbate might be due to the availability of the large number of adsorption sites on the cs edta adsorbent surface three famous isotherm models i e langmuir 32 33 freundlich 34 35 and temkin 31 were used to investigate the adsorption phenomena that occurred on the surface of the polymeric adsorbent the langmuir isotherm describes the monolayered homogeneous adsorption to the surface of an adsorbent the linearized form can be expressed as follows eq 5 5 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m freundlich isotherm model describes a non uniform distribution of adsorbates on the heterogeneous sites of an adsorbent the linearized equation can be written as eq 6 6 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e the temkin isotherm model includes the heat of adsorption reduction in various adsorbent layers probably caused by the interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates 36 the linear form of the temkin isotherm is represented by eq 7 7 q e b t lnk t b t lnc e where ce mg l 1 is the concentration of metal ions at equilibrium and kl l mg 1 is the langmuir adsorption constant qe and qm mg g 1 are the amounts of metal ions mg g 1 adsorbed on adsorbent at equilibrium and the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent respectively kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 and n are the freundlich adsorption equilibrium constant and heterogeneity factor respectively the value of 1 n shows different types of isotherms 1 n 0 means the adsorption is irreversible 0 1 n 1 means adsorption favored and 1 n 1 means the contrary 37 kt is the temkin isotherm constant l g 1 corresponding to maximum binding energy b rt bt in which b is the temkin constant related to the heat of adsorption j mol 1 r and t are the gas constant 8 314 j k mol 1 and absolute temperature k respectively the linear fits for the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models are shown in fig 3 b d and their corresponding calculated parameters are listed in table 2 the experimental data fitted well to the langmuir isotherm model than the freundlich and temkin ones with better coefficients of determination r2 of 0 983 for all three metal ions also the calculated qm cal values were much closer to experimental qm exp values for the langmuir model than the freundlich and temkin ones which clearly shows that the langmuir isotherm is better in describing the adsorption of the metals ions to the synthesized composite than the freundlich and temkin isotherms this result clearly demonstrates that the adsorption of all pb ii cd ii and cu ii ions to cs edta occupied on the monolayered homogeneous surface of the adsorbent the maximum adsorption capacities calculated from the langmuir isotherm model were found to be 370 37 14 26 243 90 12 47 and 227 27 15 33 mg g 1 for pb ii cd ii and cu ii ions respectively 3 4 reusability of adsorbent reusability is another important factor of any adsorbent for the practical application purpose once the adsorbent was used to adsorb target ions its desorption was carried out by using 1 0 m hno3 then the adsorbent was dried in vacuum oven at 50 c for the next use the adsorption desorption was repeated for five consecutive cycles and results are presented in fig 4 a as shown in the figure no sufficient loss in the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent was observed after the initial two cycles even after the fifth cycle the efficiency decreased up to 7 only this small loss in the efficiency after continuous adsorption desorption cycles demonstrate the excellent reusability of cs edta and the feasibility of it to be applied for real industrial wastewater treatment 3 5 treatment of real wastewater cs edta was applied for adsorbing heavy metal ions in real industrial wastewater various parameters such as tp cod tss ts vss vs tkn and tan of wastewater were measured and presented in table 1s this wastewater consists of different metal ions such as al iii na i ca ii cd ii ni ii zn ii and mn ii in addition to them two other metal ions cu ii and pb ii were mixed with the wastewater sample to make the concentration up to 1 mg l 1 then the adsorption experiment was performed by adding 10 mg cs edta to the sample the removal efficiency and selectivity of the metal ions were shown in fig 4 b data indicate that reasonably good adsorption performance of the synthesized material was observed for not only the three heavy metal ions but also for ni ii al iii and mn ii overall the result indicates that the synthesized adsorbent can be applied for the adsorption of heavy metals in real wastewater 3 6 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism of cs edta for the target metal ions was identified using eds elemental mapping and ft ir techniques elemental mapping and eds spectrum after the adsorption of the metal ions individually and mixed were shown in figs 3s 6s elemental mapping data clearly indicated the uniform distribution of pb ii cd ii and cu ii in the form of dots confirming the uniform distribution of available active sites for the adsorption also elemental compositions attached to fig 3s 6s proved the presence of metal ions after adsorption ft ir spectra obtained after the adsorption of metal ions consist of all the key features with the changing of intensity shifting in peaks as shown in fig 5 the peaks situated 1633 and 1221 cm 1 show the intensity reduction and bathochromically shifting after metal bindings as a result of weakening of cn and co bonds of nhco group confirming the complexation by the donation of lone pair of electrons from nitrogen of amine and oxygen of carboxy groups 19 also the bands situated at 1734 and 1561 cm 1 depressed disappeared after the complex formation which might happen due to the chelation and electrostatic interaction of metal ions with the cooh and nh cn of the amide groups in the cs edta adsorbent 19 apart from it the reduced peak intensity at 3446 cm 1 and peak broadening confirm the strong electrostatic interaction of metal ions with the remaining oh groups of the adsorbent 38 4 conclusions in summary the edta crosslinked cs polymeric adsorbent was successfully synthesized via one pot process for the adsorptive removal of multiple heavy metal ions from industrial wastewater the adsorption followed the langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated as 370 37 14 26 243 90 12 47 and 227 27 15 33 mg g 1 for pb ii cd ii and cu ii respectively the reusability showed only 7 loss even after five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles the adsorption mechanism confirmed the formation of chelation with edta and amide bond as well as electrostatic interactions between the function groups of the adsorbent like oh nh2 and etc and metal ions finally when applied for industrial wastewater the cs edta adsorbent showed a good removal efficiency with selectivity towards multiple metal ions including pb ii cu ii and cu ii overall the prepared edta cs polymer showed

12849,potentially toxic heavy metals commonly exist in industrial wastewaters presenting a critical global health threat to human health and environment therefore making their treatment is more challenging in this study an attractive polymer composite cs edta adsorbent was developed by immobilization of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta onto chitosan cs through cross linking for the adsorptive removal of multiple heavy metals from industrial wastewater the adsorption of heavy metals i e pb ii cd ii and cu ii onto the developed composite was investigated by performing batch experiments with varying contact time and metal ion concentration in the mono component system the adsorption data fitted to the monolayer langmuir isotherm the maximum adsorption capacities were calculated as 370 37 14 26 243 90 12 47 and 227 27 15 33 mg g 1 for pb ii cd ii and cu ii respectively the kinetics of the adsorption followed the pseudo second order pso models and obtained the rate constant values of 0 009 0 0004 0 001 0 0001 and 0 0007 0 0001 g mg 1 min 1 for pb ii cd ii and cu ii respectively the adsorption of the heavy metals was attributed to the electrostatic interactions between the metals and different functional groups oh nh2 and cooh of the adsorbent and complexation with edta which was confirmed by the elemental mapping eds and ft ir techniques the reusability of the polymer composite was also tested and obtained 92 efficiency even after five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles which clearly demonstrating the high stability of the adsorbent lastly the developed polymer composite was applied for real industrial wastewater excellent removal efficiencies 84 were obtained which makes it a potential candidate for the removal of heavy metals from real industrial wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polymer composite multiple heavy metals isotherm modeling reusability industrial wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recently most serious environmental issues have been raised due to fast industrialization and urbanization among them toxic heavy metals in the water body may have serious hazardous impact on the human and environmental health different heavy metals originated from the mining operations fertilizers and paper industries metal plating facilities tanneries and batteries have attracted great attention from policy makers and scientists due to their presence at a higher level in the water environment 1 among different heavy metals pb ii cd ii and cu ii are the ones of special concern from the public health point of view since they can cause serious health diseases such as brain cancer kidney and damage of dna 2 3 there are various techniques which are designed to remove heavy metals from water body such as coagulation 4 flocculation 5 ion exchange 6 electrochemical treatment 7 and adsorption 8 etc each technique has its own advantages yet it also has disadvantages which makes it less technically appealing in wastewater treatment nonetheless adsorption is considered as most popular facile and efficient alternative technique to remove heavy metals from water because many ecofriendly easily applicable reusable low cost and efficient adsorbents are widely available especially nowadays 9 in designing an adsorption process selection of an adsorbent is the essential step especially for a large scale application several factors should be carefully considered including selectivity adsorption capacity and reusability of adsorbents different adsorbents have been investigated such as β cyclodextrin composite 10 activated carbon 11 silica 12 graphene oxide 13 cs 14 and cellulose 15 etc to achieve a higher treatment efficiency with a faster adsorption rate however it is still difficult to attain higher removal efficiencies fast adsorption rates and selectivity for metal ions using a commercially available adsorbent chitosan is a deacetylated product of chitin and attracts interest due to its easy availability economic feasibility ecofriendly non toxicity and biodegradability 16 it can form strong interaction with heavy metals using its highly reactive amine groups and stable chelation property 17 to increase its adsorption capacity for metal ions and to prevent acidic dissolution chitosan has been chemically modified by different ligands such as nitrotriacetic acid nta ethylene glycol bis 2 aminoethylether n n n n tetraacetic acid egta etc 18 19 previously repo et al 2010 reported the functioning of cs using edta and dtpa for the removal of co ii and ni ii and found the significant adsorption capacities as 63 and 71 mg g 1 with cs edta and 49 1 and 53 1 mg g 1 with dtpa cs respectively 20 recently different cs hydrogels and its combination with gelatin were applied for the removal of multiple heavy metal ions from aqueous solution 21 the removal efficiencies for the pb ii cd ii hg ii and cr iii ions were in the range of 73 94 in a multiple metal ion solution ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta is a well known chelating ligand for the formation of complex with metal ions 22 this property of edta has been used to remove heavy metal ions from water it has been used to functionalize polymeric materials to enhance the adsorption capacity of the materials recently few research groups have reported the functionalization of cs and other materials by edta and their enhanced adsorption capacity 23 25 more recently our research group has reported the functioning of cs with graphene oxide and β cyclodextrin via edta for the simultaneous removal of heavy metal ions and different organic pollutants from wastewater 26 27 in these trifunctional adsorbent edta was not work only as a crosslinking agent but also acted as a chelating agent for the selective removal of heavy metal ions while other part participates in the removal of other pollutants herein the objective of the study is to synthesize edta cs polymeric adsorbent via functionalization of cs with edta through one step for the adsorptive removal of multiple heavy metal ions i e pb ii cd ii and cu ii from wastewater different adsorption parameters such as contact time initial concentration of the target metal ions and reusability of the synthesized material were investigated in aqueous solution adsorption mechanism was also investigated using elemental mapping eds and ft ir techniques lastly the prepared adsorbent was applied to the real industrial wastewater for the purpose of evaluating its applicability in real practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were used of analytical grade without any additional purification deacetylated cs flakes 85 were supplied by sigma aldrich seoul south korea the molecular weight and viscosity of the polymer were 190 000 375 000 g mol 1 and 200 2000 mpa respectively ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 99 was also obtained from sigma aldrich cadmium chloride hydrate cdcl2 xh2o 98 and other metal ion salts were purchased from samchun daejeon south korea and used without further purification deionized water was used in all experiments 2 2 synthesis of cs crosslinked edta cs edta to improve the adsorption capacity of cs its functionalization was carried out with edta as previously reported 20 briefly 5 0 g cs was dissolved in 100 ml of 10 acetic acid v v solution at 50 c and then diluted five times with methanol thereafter 30 0 g edta dianhydride which was synthesized by the previously reported method 28 was suspended in methanol and added slowly into the cs solution then the solution was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 24 h after that the solution was filtered to harvest synthesized precipitates which were mixed with ethanol and stirred for another 16 h then the precipitates were again filtered and washed with naoh solution ph 11 0 to remove the unreacted edta the final synthesized cs edta was washed five times with di water and 0 1 m hcl the precipitates were washed again with water followed by ethanol the final product was dried in a vacuum oven at 45 c then ground with mortar and pestle and stored in a desiccator for further experiments scheme 1 represented the crosslinking between amino groups of cs with edta dianhydride 2 3 characterization of synthesized cs edta the crystalline phase structure and purity of the synthesized cs edta edta cs were analyzed on high resolution powder x ray diffraction pxrd rigaku smartlab japan using monochromatic cu kα radiation kα 1 541 å with scan speed 2 min 1 step size 0 02 in the range of 5 80 the surface functional groups of the synthesized adsorbent were examined using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir nexus 670 thermo electron corporation united states in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 the surface morphology and structure information were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem su 8010 hitachi japan at working voltage 1 0 kv voltage thermo scientific ultra dry sdd attached with fesem was used to analyze the elemental compositions n2 adsorption desorption isotherm were performed on belsorpx mini microtracbel corp japan company instrument to examine the specific surface area pore size and pore volume of the prepared polymer composite adsorbent at 77 35 k in 0 0 1 0 range of relative pressures brunauer emmett teller bet and barret joner halenda bjh methods were used for surface area and pore size distribution calculation respectively thermogravimetric analysis tga and derivative thermogravimetric dtg analysis were performed on exstar 6300 japan with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 from 40 to 700 c under nitrogen environment 2 4 batch adsorption experiment the stock solutions of pb ii cd ii and cu ii were prepared and used in all batch adsorption experiments the kinetics experiments were performed by using 50 ml volume of 150 mg l 1 initial concentration with 50 mg adsorbent at fixed interval 5 10 20 30 50 80 120 180 and 300 min the isotherm experiments were performed within concentration range of 10 700 mg l 1 using fix amount of adsorbent 50 mg with 50 ml solution for 3 h equilibrium time the reusability experiments were performed up to five continuous cycles with initial 50 mg l 1 concentration for adsorption the solution mixture was shaken vigorously at 25 c in a controlled incubator shaker with 150 rpm shaker speed and then the samples were separated using 0 45 μm syringe filter the initial and final concentrations of the metals were analyzed by using icpe 9000 shimadzu kyoto japan the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity qe were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 removal efficiency c 0 c e 100 c 0 2 adsorption capacity q e c 0 c e v w where qe mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent at equilibrium c0 and ce mg l 1 are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of heavy metals respectively v ml is the volume of the solution and w g is the weight of adsorbent ph 5 0 were used for all the experiments 2 5 wastewater characteristics wastewater was collected from drink manufacturer industry anseong si gyeonggi do south korea the different physicochemical properties such as ph tp cod tss ts vss vs tkn and tan of the wastewater were determined by the standard methods apha 1998 in our research and development center seoul south korea the concentration of heavy metals in the wastewater samples was measured by plasma atomic emission spectrometer icpe 9000 shimadzu kyoto japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the ft ir spectra of raw materials and synthesized cs edta polymer composite are shown in fig 1 a the peaks situated at 1633 and 1543 cm 1 are corresponding to the co stretching vibrations conh and nh deformation of amide groups respectively 29 data shows the characteristic peaks situated at 1734 cm 1 was corresponding to the stretching vibrations of co bond of carboxylic groups these peaks confirm the cross linking of cs by edta dianhydride through amide bond formation the peaks situated at 3446 cm 1 and 1034 cm 1 represent the oh and co stretching vibrations of the cs edta polymer composite adsorbent fig 1 b shows the pxrd patterns of cs edta and the cs edta polymer composite edta shows many characteristics peaks and cs shows two characteristic broad peaks situated at 10 16 and 20 04 which indicates the crystalline nature of edta and polymer nature of cs respectively in the case of the cs edta polymer composite all the individual peaks of edta and cs were disappeared and only one hump occurred between 10 and 30 again confirming the reaction between cs and edta to form amorphous polymer composite fesem images of the cs edta polymer adsorbent at lower and higher magnification are presented in fig 1 c and d respectively at lower magnification the image shows polymeric sheets with higher porous structure this higher porous structure was clearly observed at higher magnification which confirms the loss of sheet nature of the cs functionalized by edta this higher porosity would be useful for the diffusion and adsorption of metal ions the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of the cs edta adsorbent is presented in fig 1s a data represent the h3 type hysteresis loop probably caused by the mesoporous and capillary condensation nature of the composite the bet surface area total pore volume and average pore diameter were found to be 5 141 m2 g 1 0 0155 cm3 g 1 and 12 091 nm respectively along with the surface area functional groups available on the adsorbent are the major contribution in the adsorption of heavy metal ions tga and dta graphs were given in fig 2s the tga curve indicates three different weight loss steps i e approximately 22 28 and 40 weight losses in the range of 41 170 c 230 365 c and 410 597 c these weight losses were due to the removal of moisture and the decomposition of edta and cs respectively 3 2 effect of contact time and kinetics first important factor is contact time for the equilibrium analysis between the adsorbate and adsorbent fig 2 a indicates the effect of contact time on the removal of pb ii cu ii and cd ii metal ions from aqueous solution data indicate the faster adsorption in the initial 5 10 min with the removal efficiency of 91 1 47 4 and then an equilibrium was reached after 60 min with the removal efficiency of 97 therefore an excessive contact time of 180 min was chosen as the equilibrium contact time for further experiments also pb ii showed higher adsorption efficiency compared to other metal ions probably due to having a smaller hydration number than others 25 the pseudo first order pfo 30 and the pseudo second order pso 31 models were used to simulate the adsorption kinetics of pb ii cu ii and cd ii onto the cs edta polymeric adsorbent and are represented below by eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k1 min 1 and k2 mg g 1 min 1 are the rate constants for pfo and pso models respectively qe and qt are the amounts of metal ions adsorbed mg g 1 to the surface of the synthesized adsorbent at equilibrium and at given time t min respectively the linear plots of ln qe qt v s t and t qt v s t are presented in fig 2 b and c respectively and their corresponding calculated parameters values are listed in table 1 the coefficients of determination r2 for the pso models were superior r2 0 99 over those for pfo for all metal ions which clearly demonstrates that the adsorption process is mainly influenced by the chemisorption process also closer the qcal with qexp again support to the pso kinetics model compared to pfo kinetics model moreover the higher rate constant k for pb ii confirms that its adsorption to the adsorbent is faster compared to other metal ions and was attributed to the smaller hydration number of pb ii 3 3 effect of initial concentration and adsorption isotherm the effect of initial concentration of the target metal ions on the adsorption efficiency of cs edta was studied in the range of 10 700 mg l 1 and the data are plotted in fig 3 a which clearly shows that as the concentration increased from 10 to 700 mg l 1 the removal efficiencies decreased from 95 to 64 3 42 52 38 74 for pd ii cd ii and cu ii respectively while the adsorption capacities were enhanced from 7 9 mg g 1 to 360 08 238 11 216 96 mg g 1 for pb ii cd ii and cu ii respectively the higher adsorption capacity at a higher concentration of an adsorbate might be due to the availability of the large number of adsorption sites on the cs edta adsorbent surface three famous isotherm models i e langmuir 32 33 freundlich 34 35 and temkin 31 were used to investigate the adsorption phenomena that occurred on the surface of the polymeric adsorbent the langmuir isotherm describes the monolayered homogeneous adsorption to the surface of an adsorbent the linearized form can be expressed as follows eq 5 5 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m freundlich isotherm model describes a non uniform distribution of adsorbates on the heterogeneous sites of an adsorbent the linearized equation can be written as eq 6 6 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e the temkin isotherm model includes the heat of adsorption reduction in various adsorbent layers probably caused by the interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates 36 the linear form of the temkin isotherm is represented by eq 7 7 q e b t lnk t b t lnc e where ce mg l 1 is the concentration of metal ions at equilibrium and kl l mg 1 is the langmuir adsorption constant qe and qm mg g 1 are the amounts of metal ions mg g 1 adsorbed on adsorbent at equilibrium and the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent respectively kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 and n are the freundlich adsorption equilibrium constant and heterogeneity factor respectively the value of 1 n shows different types of isotherms 1 n 0 means the adsorption is irreversible 0 1 n 1 means adsorption favored and 1 n 1 means the contrary 37 kt is the temkin isotherm constant l g 1 corresponding to maximum binding energy b rt bt in which b is the temkin constant related to the heat of adsorption j mol 1 r and t are the gas constant 8 314 j k mol 1 and absolute temperature k respectively the linear fits for the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models are shown in fig 3 b d and their corresponding calculated parameters are listed in table 2 the experimental data fitted well to the langmuir isotherm model than the freundlich and temkin ones with better coefficients of determination r2 of 0 983 for all three metal ions also the calculated qm cal values were much closer to experimental qm exp values for the langmuir model than the freundlich and temkin ones which clearly shows that the langmuir isotherm is better in describing the adsorption of the metals ions to the synthesized composite than the freundlich and temkin isotherms this result clearly demonstrates that the adsorption of all pb ii cd ii and cu ii ions to cs edta occupied on the monolayered homogeneous surface of the adsorbent the maximum adsorption capacities calculated from the langmuir isotherm model were found to be 370 37 14 26 243 90 12 47 and 227 27 15 33 mg g 1 for pb ii cd ii and cu ii ions respectively 3 4 reusability of adsorbent reusability is another important factor of any adsorbent for the practical application purpose once the adsorbent was used to adsorb target ions its desorption was carried out by using 1 0 m hno3 then the adsorbent was dried in vacuum oven at 50 c for the next use the adsorption desorption was repeated for five consecutive cycles and results are presented in fig 4 a as shown in the figure no sufficient loss in the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent was observed after the initial two cycles even after the fifth cycle the efficiency decreased up to 7 only this small loss in the efficiency after continuous adsorption desorption cycles demonstrate the excellent reusability of cs edta and the feasibility of it to be applied for real industrial wastewater treatment 3 5 treatment of real wastewater cs edta was applied for adsorbing heavy metal ions in real industrial wastewater various parameters such as tp cod tss ts vss vs tkn and tan of wastewater were measured and presented in table 1s this wastewater consists of different metal ions such as al iii na i ca ii cd ii ni ii zn ii and mn ii in addition to them two other metal ions cu ii and pb ii were mixed with the wastewater sample to make the concentration up to 1 mg l 1 then the adsorption experiment was performed by adding 10 mg cs edta to the sample the removal efficiency and selectivity of the metal ions were shown in fig 4 b data indicate that reasonably good adsorption performance of the synthesized material was observed for not only the three heavy metal ions but also for ni ii al iii and mn ii overall the result indicates that the synthesized adsorbent can be applied for the adsorption of heavy metals in real wastewater 3 6 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism of cs edta for the target metal ions was identified using eds elemental mapping and ft ir techniques elemental mapping and eds spectrum after the adsorption of the metal ions individually and mixed were shown in figs 3s 6s elemental mapping data clearly indicated the uniform distribution of pb ii cd ii and cu ii in the form of dots confirming the uniform
