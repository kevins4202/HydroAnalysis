11770,the paper studies the impact of socioeconomic factors on households willingness to pay wtp for drinking water in bihar india the data were collected from 420 households through a primary survey from two arsenic affected districts a linear regression model was used to examine the causal relationship among various socioeconomic factors and their influence on household decision to pay for water services around 84 of the surveyed respondents were willing to pay for better quality water sources households value the good water quality which resulted in good health and therefore influenced the household decision to pay and opt for the services average as concentration level were found to be 130 4 μg l and 115 2 μg l in 2013 and 2019 respectively the results found that socioeconomic factors that influence overall wtp are households income age education awareness arsenic concentration levels and visit to the doctor education of the household s head and awareness are interlinked and more education causes a shift in water sources from poor quality to safer one wtp for better quality drinking water were estimated through contingent valuation method cvm the annual wtp for the individual households and for the study area were estimated at inr 240 4 13 and inr 17 1 0 29 million respectively the inference of the results may be used in implementing of new policies for providing arsenic

2013 saha et al 2011 saha and shukla 2013 saha and sahu 2015 thakur and gupta 2016 assessed that around 14 million people resides in bihar are vulnerable due to as concentration above 10 μg l and around 7 million population are at the higher risk of vulnerability due to the as concentration above 50 μg l in their drinking water however ghosh et al 2012 detected that 18 districts had as higher than 50 μg l nearly 24 of the people directly used drinking water with as concentration above 10 μg l ghosh et al 2012 as of 2021 22 districts out of 38 districts from bihar have excess of as in

socioeconomic factors influence the household s decision to pay for better quality drinking water the paper s novelty lies in two aspects first the linkage between various socioeconomic factors and its influence on the household s willingness to pay for the safe water source in general and drinking water in particular the second novelty is to estimate how households and society are willing to pay for better quality drinking water through the household survey the paper s objectives are a to study the underlying relationship between socioeconomic factors and their impacts on wtp and b to evaluate the gross wtp for the households in the study area for getting better quality water given the background the rest of the paper is organised as follows the second section provides the critical literature review on socioeconomic factors and its impact on wtp of households for improved quality of drinking water the methodology which includes the study area data the survey administration and the models are discussed in the third section preliminary findings on the demographic characteristics of surveyed households and results and discussions are presented in the fourth section the paper ends with the conclusion and policy suggestions 2 literature review the earlier research studies the impact of as on human health due to excess as in drinking water argos et al 2011 chakraborti et al

north 24 parganas of west bengal india due to excess as in water was inr 229 4 3 million an average households in bangladesh expend around us 18 annually due to as induced health problems khan et al 2014 barnwal et al 2017 suggested some of the measures which help to protect human health are behavioural response demand for information and the preventive actions which has low cost to the society in a recent study in assam india mahanta et al 2016 estimated annual welfare gain due to as removal from drinking water at us 2 49 million and if is reduced to 50 μg l the total annual welfare gain to each household is us 14 roy 2008 found that an as affected person works only 2 73 h per day as 8 h for a healthy person low income individuals could be the primary beneficiaries of the better quality drinking water the recent study in the study area of bihar estimated the monthly health costs for outpatient inpatient and the total health costs of the households were us 12 6 us 58 4 and us 33 8 respectively thakur and gupta 2016 while the annual social cost to the society in two districts from bihar was 5 million thakur and gupta 2019 poor and households with low incomes have been impacted severely due to water quality issues as their percentage of the population is among the highest roy 2008 khan 2007 used the household production function to estimate the health cost from a survey conducted on 900 tube wells and 878 households in bangladesh and found that annually 7 to 12 million working days are lost due to as exposure the annual expenditure for medical help was between the us 3 5 to 6 25 million and the total annual welfare loss from as was found to be the us 9 to the us 17 million the present study is an attempt to examine how socioeconomic factors play an essential role in influencing the household s decision to pay for as free water singh et al 2022 predicted the individual social resilience towards the arsenic affected patients through using machine learning algorithms economists use several behavioural methods to assess water pollution cost with either observed or hypothetical way contingent valuation method cvm is the most used hypothetical behavioural method to estimate water pollution s economic and health costs through people s preferences and their influence on willingness to pay to reduce the health impacts due to as induced drinking water the annual wtp as a health cost in bangladesh is assessed at the us 2 7 billion maddison et al 2005 ahmad et al 2002 estimated monthly wtp for community water stand post and domestic connections in bangladesh is bdt 51 and bdt 87 with additional capital costs of bdt 960 and bdt 1787 respectively while for a domestic connections for poor households the monthly wtp are bdt 68 with one time capital expenditure of bdt 1401 ahmad et al 2002 education awareness social capital occupation sanitation behaviours and the housing status are the socioeconomic factors which leads to social resilience among the arsenicosis patients singh et al 2022 chakraborty and mukherjee 2020 estimate the economic loss among the as affected household through propensity score matching and suggested social discrimination is a key factor and leads to income loss due to underestimation socioeconomic feedbacks workforce participation promotion and multi stakeholders perspective could be helpful to reduce the water scarcity langarudi et al 2020 thakur et al 2020 household s monthly income years of education marital status age and gender are socioeconomic factors which influences households wtp eridadi et al 2021 rural population in bangladesh place a low value to the as free drinking water ahmad et al 2005 but income mitigation measures awareness arsenicosis patient and risk zone are influencing wtp and rural households are spending around 5 of their income for as free drinking water khan et al 2014 income arsenic awareness landholdings social capital sanitation practices and socioeconomic priority were strong factor of perceived economic risk among the as affected population singh and taylor 2019 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area the state of bihar is situated at a latitude of 240 20 10 270 31 15 n and longitude of 830 19 50 880 17 40 e the survey area i e maner and danapur from the district of patna is positioned in the 25 650 n 84 880 e and 25 582 n 85 043 e and shahpur from bhojpur district of bihar is located 25 60 n 84 40 e these blocks are severely affected due to excess as in their drinking water chakraborti et al 2016 suman et al 2020 thakur and gupta 2020 thakur et al 2021 the maps of the study area are detailed in fig 1 3 2 data the study intended to use both the primary and secondary sources of data the researcher primarily collected the secondary data from government sources the ministry of water resources mowr department of drinking water and sanitation ddws government of india and public health engineering department phed government of bihar phed and ddws provided the water quality data the researcher collected socioeconomic data mainly from census 2011 the primary survey is conducted of 388 affected and 32 control households between february and june 2013 to capture the preference and economic valuation of as in drinking water thakur and gupta 2016 2019 2020 the water samples were collected from 40 household s tube wells in 2013 and 2019 and tested for as concentration levels through the field test kits range from 0 to 500 μg l in order to check the variation the water samples were also tested in the laboratory 3 3 survey instruments the study used a semi structured questionnaire to collect the household information through the primary survey questionnaire was distributed into four different sections first section of the questionnaire covers the details of demographic information assets income saving and expenditure of the household second section delivers information on as in water water quality and as related information the third section of the questionnaire were information on doctor visit due to arsenicosis patient and cost of illness related information the last portion of the questionnaire captured on social problems due to as concentration in the drinking water the water samples were collected and tested during the survey through the field test kit ftk water samples tested in two time period i e 2013 and 2019 to see the variations in the households water quality fig 2 few of the water were tested through the laboratory using atomic spectroscopy methods to know the exact concentration level of as in the households drinking water as suggested by earlier study jakariya et al 2007 hossain et al 2014 thakur et al 2021 3 4 model previous studies found that income of the households have positive impact on their wtp birol et al 2008 eridadi et al 2021 gunatilake and tachiiri 2012 langarudi et al 2020 the paper is addressing three questions to answer socioeconomic impacts household s awareness towards better quality water and migration and its associated impacts on household s decision on their wtp all these factors are taken as explanatory variables in the households wtp function the wtp is a regressors and used to find the household s payments towards water quality improvement the simple linear function for wtp is 1 wtp f age education income awareness as contamination land doctor s visit migration the simple linear form of the ordinary least square is projected through multiple regressions greene 2000 the multiple regression model is presented as 2 wtp κ α1 age α2 education α3 income α4 awareness α5 as contamination α6 land α7 doctor s visit α8 migration ξ to found the causal impact of socioeconomic factors on households wtp the study used simple linear regression equation 2 is the extended econometric form of equation 1 where κ is constant and α s are the variables coefficient and ξ is the random error the predictor variables age education income awareness as contamination land and doctor s visit are estimated to impact wtp positively the variables and their expected signs are presented in table 1 in contrast the variable migration is negatively related with the households wtp 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics the summary statistics of the results are presented in table 2 the households are mainly drawing drinking water from hand pump which is mainly on the depth range of 13 8 45 7 m number of years of schooling of majority of the head of the households are only 2 1 years nearly 10 of household s drinking water have 300 μg l in 2013 while it has been reduced to 7 5 in 2019 fig 3 4 2 households in the study area the surveyed households include 54 8 male and 45 2 female the literacy rate among low income households are lower 43 than the entire surveyed population the census 2011 literacy rate of both the surveyed districts patna and bhojpur 70 7 are similar to the surveyed literacy rate 69 almost 82 22 of households have poor water quality in terms of either iron or arsenic or both nearly 28 5 of the surveyed respondents were aware about water quality issues and related socioeconomic and health issues around 31 5 of the surveyed are illiterate nearly 84 of the respondents are willing to pay for better water quality around 81 working population migrated due to work 10 of the surveyed households for other reasons and 9 migrated due to water quality issues households headed by services jobs government pensioners and self employed as their occupation are willing to pay for better water quality the occupation of majority of the households head are farmers while others are pensioners self employed and private jobs the range of the maximum monthly wtp varied amid inr 0 and inr 400 and a mean of inr 27 38 and root mean square deviation of inr 35 84 the mean annual value of wtp is inr 328 57 and with a root mean square deviation of inr 430 11 nearly 59 of the surveyed household s maximum annual wtp are in the range of inr 1 400 fig 2 presents the proportion of household s and their range of wtp around 16 of the surveyed households seriously felt its state responsibility to provide safe drinking water and those households do not willing to pay for better water quality 4 3 household s water quality in the study areas excess presence of as in drinking water leads to various health and other socioeconomic issues we collected and tested the households water samples randomly in 2013 and 2019 through the field test kits ftk from 40 different households the average concentration levels of as through ftk were found to be 130 4 μg l and 115 2 μg l in 2013 and 2019 respectively the lab test results showed the average concentration levels of 110 μg l forty percent of the surveyed household s drinking water is under the ambit of the who level of safe concentration levels while only 2 5 of the surveyed households have more than 500 μg l of as in drinking water sources the household s drinking water sources where concentration levels are between 301 and 500 μg l are in the range of 7 5 12 5 while for majority of the households as concentration is in the range of 10 100 μg l and are in similar with the results of the earlier study conducted in the region thakur et al 2021 thakur and gupta 2019 chakraborti et al 2016 however the mitigation options for the provisions of safe drinking water through the participatory and community planning like the bangladesh will help to achieve the sustainable framework to solve the problem to the as affected households jakariya and bhattacharya 2007 the main source of drinking water is through tube well and screening and evaluating the tube well through field and validate the ftk with the laboratory test results will be helpful to prevalence the as concentration in household water sources jakariya et al 2007 thakur et al 2021 fig 3 details the household water samples as concentration levels during 2013 2019 and lab tests 4 4 preliminary discussion on wtp the household s wtp is linked with the utility of the specific product and measure the consumer surplus this projected value helps the policymaker to estimate the maximum amount households are willing to pay for better water quality wtp study supports to measure the supposed value of the good here better water quality in monetary terms socioeconomic factors that influence wtp include household s income age of household s head doctor s visit schooling in years awareness and as concentration in drinking water the education of the head of the household is positively correlated with their wtp household s income and doctor s visit are the most important factor which influence their decision to wtp as concentration in drinking water positively govern the changes in household s wtp the occupation of the head of the household with assured income in a government department and pensioner positively influence household s wtp there is a positive correlation between households income and their wtp and therefore higher wtp among the rich households gunatilake and tachiiri 2012 the wtp among lower income households are lesser compared to higher income households higher the household s decision makers education the larger the precautionary measures to a safe drinking water source and so is their wtp although households education levels and awareness are related but the household s awareness does not influence their wtp the households ability to spend more are willing to pay additional for better water quality although their percentage are lower to the surveyed population nearly 50 of the surveyed household is not conscious of as threat in drinking water since there is a lack of alternative available sources of drinking water the information on available technology as and socioeconomic and health issues and extensive information on water quality helps to households decision on wtp due to lack of information on water quality as and health menace among rural people publicising information influence households to explore different choices and available options for better water quality government promotion on awareness plans to inform people on as and its concern on health and other well beings will help to deal with as calamities at the local level 4 5 socioeconomic factors and wtp the expected signs of the variables are presented in table 1 the households wtp is a regressand whereas the predictor variables are age income awareness income doctor s visit land holding of the household education and migration the results of the regression is given in table 3 some of the independent variables such as household s willingness to pay wtp doctor s visit landholding size and as concentration level in drinking water have higher standard deviations standard beta coefficient is checked to see the significance of the variables which define the maximum wtp we tested all the independent variables and used breusch pagan cook weisberg test to see whether there is a problem of heteroscedasticity breusch pagan cook weisberg test helped to accept the chi square value and did not reject the null hypothesis the regression results established that the independent variables like age of the household s head income of the households years of education household s water concentration level doctor s visit and migration are statistically significant with their predicted signs higher income households are more inclined to pay higher wtp for better water quality these results are in line with the earlier studies in bangladesh where household income awareness for safe sources water consumption were affected due to as contaminated water and the households have taken any mitigation measures due to contaminated drinking water khan et al 2014 although land hold size and migration are negatively associated but other predictor variables are positively associated with households wtp household s water quality is an important factor which have impact on wtp in other words if household water quality is having excess of as concentration it leads household to think about their willingness to pay for better quality drinking water interestingly income of the households and doctor s visit are among the most important factors which impact on perception and household behaviour to their wtp interestingly some of the earlier studies suggested information is the key to switch the safe source of drinking water thakur and gupta 2019 barnwal et al 2017 higher educational attainment and awareness influence head of the household to willingness to pay for better quality water although land has a negative sign but migration is negatively associated with the households wtp some of our results are similar with khan et al 2014 and ahmad et al 2005 which states wtp is substantial and positively related with the households living with as free water 5 conclusion groundwater is the most important available resources for drinking water in the rural area the paper largely based on rural respondents to know their perception and associated benefits of better quality drinking water the majority of the households around 84 are willing to pay for better quality drinking water and the average monthly amount paid by them is inr 20 us 0 4 however this shows households preference for safe drinking water to avoid health and other water borne diseases the paper analyses various aspects of households perception of improved water supply and their influences on households decisions for their wtp through a cvm framework the households value better quality water to ensure good health and avoid as exposure and the people are ready to wtp if there is an improvement in water quality household income age education awareness as concentration level and doctor s visit impact households decision on their wtp doctor s visit and the income of the households are main factors that define the changes in wtp migration is an important factor although negatively related to households wtp the as concentration level in drinking water is an important factor which determine the households wtp the total wtp is estimated to be inr 17 1 us 0 29 million the study used the open ended value elicitation question and these include a lack of incentive compatibility potential problems with symbolic and protest responses and other concerns and it could be a shortcoming of the study for policy a survey of the insight of different stakeholders such as urban households medical practitioners geologists geochemists and government agencies to work together for providing the better quality drinking water in the region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

et al 2013 gadgil et al 2014 litter et al 2019b and mitigation aspects khan and yang 2014 mowr 2010 nachman et al 2017 singh and taylor 2019 however there is a paucity of studies that explore how socioeconomic factors influence the household s decision to pay for better quality drinking water the paper s novelty lies in two aspects first the linkage between various socioeconomic factors and its influence on the household s willingness to pay for the safe water source in general and drinking water in particular the second novelty is to estimate how households and society are willing to pay for better quality drinking water through the household survey the paper s objectives are a to study the underlying relationship between socioeconomic factors and their impacts on wtp and b to evaluate the gross wtp for the households in the study area for getting better quality water given the background the rest of the paper is organised as follows the second section provides the critical literature review on socioeconomic factors and its impact on wtp of households for improved quality of drinking water the methodology which includes the study area data the survey administration and the models are discussed in the third section preliminary findings on the demographic characteristics of surveyed households and results and discussions are presented in the fourth section the paper ends with the conclusion and policy suggestions 2 literature review the earlier research studies the impact of as on human health due to excess as in drinking water argos et al 2011 chakraborti et al

north 24 parganas of west bengal india due to excess as in water was inr 229 4 3 million an average households in bangladesh expend around us 18 annually due to as induced health problems khan et al 2014 barnwal et al 2017 suggested some of the measures which help to protect human health are behavioural response demand for information and the preventive actions which has low cost to the society in a recent study in assam india mahanta et al 2016 estimated annual welfare gain due to as removal from drinking water at us 2 49 million and if is reduced to 50 μg l the total annual welfare gain to each household is us 14 roy 2008 found that an as affected person works only 2 73 h per day as 8 h for a healthy person low income individuals could be the primary beneficiaries of the better quality drinking water the recent study in the study area of bihar estimated the monthly health costs for outpatient inpatient and the total health costs of the households were us 12 6 us 58 4 and us 33 8 respectively thakur and gupta 2016 while the annual social cost to the society in two districts from bihar was 5 million thakur and gupta 2019 poor and households with low incomes have been impacted severely due to water quality issues as their percentage of the population is among the highest roy 2008 khan 2007 used the household production function to estimate the health cost from a survey conducted on 900 tube wells and 878 households in bangladesh and found that annually 7 to 12 million working days are lost due to as exposure the annual expenditure for medical help was between the us 3 5 to 6 25 million and the total annual welfare loss from as was found to be the us 9 to the us 17 million the present study is an attempt to examine how socioeconomic factors play an essential role in influencing the household s decision to pay for as free water singh et al 2022 predicted the individual social resilience towards the arsenic affected patients through using machine learning algorithms economists use several behavioural methods to assess water pollution cost with either observed or hypothetical way contingent valuation method cvm is the most used hypothetical behavioural method to estimate water pollution s economic and health costs through people s preferences and their influence on willingness to pay to reduce the health impacts due to as induced drinking water the annual wtp as a health cost in bangladesh is assessed at the us 2 7 billion maddison et al 2005 ahmad et al 2002 estimated monthly wtp for community water stand post and domestic connections in bangladesh is bdt 51 and bdt 87 with additional capital costs of bdt 960 and bdt 1787 respectively while for a domestic connections for poor households the monthly wtp are bdt 68 with one time capital expenditure of bdt 1401 ahmad et al 2002 education awareness social capital occupation sanitation behaviours and the housing status are the socioeconomic factors which leads to social resilience among the arsenicosis patients singh et al 2022 chakraborty and mukherjee 2020 estimate the economic loss among the as affected household through propensity score matching and suggested social discrimination is a key factor and leads to income loss due to underestimation socioeconomic feedbacks workforce participation promotion and multi stakeholders perspective could be helpful to reduce the water scarcity langarudi et al 2020 thakur et al 2020 household s monthly income years of education marital status age and gender are socioeconomic factors which influences households wtp eridadi et al 2021 rural population in bangladesh place a low value to the as free drinking water ahmad et al 2005 but income mitigation measures awareness arsenicosis patient and risk zone are influencing wtp and rural households are spending around 5 of their income for as free drinking water khan et al 2014 income arsenic awareness landholdings social capital sanitation practices and socioeconomic priority were strong factor of perceived economic risk among the as affected population singh and taylor 2019 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area the state of bihar is situated at a latitude of 240 20 10 270 31 15 n and longitude of 830 19 50 880 17 40 e the survey area i e maner and danapur from the district of patna is positioned in the 25 650 n 84 880 e and 25 582 n 85 043 e and shahpur from bhojpur district of bihar is located 25 60 n 84 40 e these blocks are severely affected due to excess as in their drinking water chakraborti et al 2016 suman et al 2020 thakur and gupta 2020 thakur et al 2021 the maps of the study area are detailed in fig 1 3 2 data the study intended to use both the primary and secondary sources of data the researcher primarily collected the secondary data from government sources the ministry of water resources mowr department of drinking water and sanitation ddws government of india and public health engineering department phed government of bihar phed and ddws provided the water quality data the researcher collected socioeconomic data mainly from census 2011 the primary survey is conducted of 388 affected and 32 control households between february and june 2013 to capture the preference and economic valuation of as in drinking water thakur and gupta 2016 2019 2020 the water samples were collected from 40 household s tube wells in 2013 and 2019 and tested for as concentration levels through the field test kits range from 0 to 500 μg l in order to check the variation the water samples were also tested in the laboratory 3 3 survey instruments the study used a semi structured questionnaire to collect the household information through the primary survey questionnaire was distributed into four different sections first section of the questionnaire covers the details of demographic information assets income saving and expenditure of the household second section delivers information on as in water water quality and as related information the third section of the questionnaire were information on doctor visit due to arsenicosis patient and cost of illness related information the last portion of the questionnaire captured on social problems due to as concentration in the drinking water the water samples were collected and tested during the survey through the field test kit ftk water samples tested in two time period i e 2013 and 2019 to see the variations in the households water quality fig 2 few of the water were tested through the laboratory using atomic spectroscopy methods to know the exact concentration level of as in the households drinking water as suggested by earlier study jakariya et al 2007 hossain et al 2014 thakur et al 2021 3 4 model previous studies found that income of the households have positive impact on their wtp birol et al 2008 eridadi et al 2021 gunatilake and tachiiri 2012 langarudi et al 2020 the paper is addressing three questions to answer socioeconomic impacts household s awareness towards better quality water and migration and its associated impacts on household s decision on their wtp all these factors are taken as explanatory variables in the households wtp function the wtp is a regressors and used to find the household s payments towards water quality improvement the simple linear function for wtp is 1 wtp f age education income awareness as contamination land doctor s visit migration the simple linear form of the ordinary least square is projected through multiple regressions greene 2000 the multiple regression model is presented as 2 wtp κ α1 age α2 education α3 income α4 awareness α5 as contamination α6 land α7 doctor s visit α8 migration ξ to found the causal impact of socioeconomic factors on households wtp the study used simple linear regression equation 2 is the extended econometric form of equation 1 where κ is constant and α s are the variables coefficient and ξ is the random error the predictor variables age education income awareness as contamination land and doctor s visit are estimated to impact wtp positively the variables and their expected signs are presented in table 1 in contrast the variable migration is negatively related with the households wtp 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics the summary statistics of the results are presented in table 2 the households are mainly drawing drinking water from hand pump which is mainly on the depth range of 13 8 45 7 m number of years of schooling of majority of the head of the households are only 2 1 years nearly 10 of household s drinking water have 300 μg l in 2013 while it has been reduced to 7 5 in 2019 fig 3 4 2 households in the study area the surveyed households include 54 8 male and 45 2 female the literacy rate among low income households are lower 43 than the entire surveyed population the census 2011 literacy rate of both the surveyed districts patna and bhojpur 70 7 are similar to the surveyed literacy rate 69 almost 82 22 of households have poor water quality in terms of either iron or arsenic or both nearly 28 5 of the surveyed respondents were aware about water quality issues and related socioeconomic and health issues around 31 5 of the surveyed are illiterate nearly 84 of the respondents are willing to pay for better water quality around 81 working population migrated due to work 10 of the surveyed households for other reasons and 9 migrated due to water quality issues households headed by services jobs government pensioners and self employed as their occupation are willing to pay for better water quality the occupation of majority of the households head are farmers while others are pensioners self employed and private jobs the range of the maximum monthly wtp varied amid inr 0 and inr 400 and a mean of inr 27 38 and root mean square deviation of inr 35 84 the mean annual value of wtp is inr 328 57 and with a root mean square deviation of inr 430 11 nearly 59 of the surveyed household s maximum annual wtp are in the range of inr 1 400 fig 2 presents the proportion of household s and their range of wtp around 16 of the surveyed households seriously felt its state responsibility to provide safe drinking water and those households do not willing to pay for better water quality 4 3 household s water quality in the study areas excess presence of as in drinking water leads to various health and other socioeconomic issues we collected and tested the households water samples randomly in 2013 and 2019 through the field test kits ftk from 40 different households the average concentration levels of as through ftk were found to be 130 4 μg l and 115 2 μg l in 2013 and 2019 respectively the lab test results showed the average concentration levels of 110 μg l forty percent of the surveyed household s drinking water is under the ambit of the who level of safe concentration levels while only 2 5 of the surveyed households have more than 500 μg l of as in drinking water sources the household s drinking water sources where concentration levels are between 301 and 500 μg l are in the range of 7 5 12 5 while for majority of the households as concentration is in the range of 10 100 μg l and are in similar with the results of the earlier study conducted in the region thakur et al 2021 thakur and gupta 2019 chakraborti et al 2016 however the mitigation options for the provisions of safe drinking water through the participatory and community planning like the bangladesh will help to achieve the sustainable framework to solve the problem to the as affected households jakariya and bhattacharya 2007 the main source of drinking water is through tube well and screening and evaluating the tube well through field and validate the ftk with the laboratory test results will be helpful to prevalence the as concentration in household water sources jakariya et al 2007 thakur et al 2021 fig 3 details the household water samples as concentration levels during 2013 2019 and lab tests 4 4 preliminary discussion on wtp the household s wtp is linked with the utility of the specific product and measure the consumer surplus this projected value helps the policymaker to estimate the maximum amount households are willing to pay for better water quality wtp study supports to measure the supposed value of the good here better water quality in monetary terms socioeconomic factors that influence wtp include household s income age of household s head doctor s visit schooling in years awareness and as concentration in drinking water the education of the head of the household is positively correlated with their wtp household s income and doctor s visit are the most important factor which influence their decision to wtp as concentration in drinking water positively govern the changes in household s wtp the occupation of the head of the household with assured income in a government department and pensioner positively influence household s wtp there is a positive correlation between households income and their wtp and therefore higher wtp among the rich households gunatilake and tachiiri 2012 the wtp among lower income households are lesser compared to higher income households higher the household s decision makers education the larger the precautionary measures to a safe drinking water source and so is their wtp although households education levels and awareness are related but the household s awareness does not influence their wtp the households ability to spend more are willing to pay additional for better water quality although their percentage are lower to the surveyed population nearly 50 of the surveyed household is not conscious of as threat in drinking water since there is a lack of alternative available sources of drinking water the information on available technology as and socioeconomic and health issues and extensive information on water quality helps to households decision on wtp due to lack of information on water quality as and health menace among rural people publicising information influence households to explore different choices and available options for better water quality government promotion on awareness plans to inform people on as and its concern on health and other well beings will help to deal with as calamities at the local level 4 5 socioeconomic factors and wtp the expected signs of the variables are presented in table 1 the households wtp is a regressand whereas the predictor variables are age income awareness income doctor s visit land holding of the household education and migration the results of the regression is given in table 3 some of the independent variables such as household s willingness to pay wtp doctor s visit landholding size and as concentration level in drinking water have higher standard deviations standard beta coefficient is checked to see the significance of the variables which define the maximum wtp we tested all the independent variables and used breusch pagan cook weisberg test to see whether there is a problem of heteroscedasticity breusch pagan cook weisberg test helped to accept the chi square value and did not reject the null hypothesis the regression results established that the independent variables like age of the household s head income of the households years of education household s water concentration level doctor s visit and migration are statistically significant with their predicted signs higher income households are more inclined to pay higher wtp for better water quality these results are in line with the earlier studies in bangladesh where household income awareness for safe sources water consumption were affected due to as contaminated water and the households have taken any mitigation measures due to contaminated drinking water khan et al 2014 although land hold size and migration are negatively associated but other predictor variables are positively associated with households wtp household s water quality is an important factor which have impact on wtp in other words if household water quality is having excess of as concentration it leads household to think about their willingness to pay for better quality drinking water interestingly income of the households and doctor s visit are among the most important factors which impact on perception and household behaviour to their wtp interestingly some of the earlier studies suggested information is the key to switch the safe source of drinking water thakur and gupta 2019 barnwal et al 2017 higher educational attainment and awareness influence head of the household to willingness to pay for better quality water although land has a negative sign but migration is negatively associated with the households wtp some of our results are similar with khan et al 2014 and ahmad et al 2005 which states wtp is substantial and positively related with the households living with as free water 5 conclusion groundwater is the most important available resources for drinking water in the rural area the paper largely based on rural respondents to know their perception and associated benefits of better quality drinking water the majority of the households around 84 are willing to pay for better quality drinking water and the average monthly amount paid by them is inr 20 us 0 4 however this shows households preference for safe drinking water to avoid health and other water borne diseases the paper analyses various aspects of households perception of improved water supply and their influences on households decisions for their wtp through a cvm framework the households value better quality water to ensure good health and avoid as exposure and the people are ready to wtp if there is an improvement in water quality household income age education awareness as concentration level and doctor s visit impact households decision on their wtp doctor s visit and the income of the households are main factors that define the changes in wtp migration is an important factor although negatively related to households wtp the as concentration level in drinking water is an important factor which determine the households wtp the total wtp is estimated to be inr 17 1 us 0 29 million the study used the open ended value elicitation question and these include a lack of incentive compatibility potential problems with symbolic and protest responses and other concerns and it could be a shortcoming of the study for policy a survey of the insight of different stakeholders such as urban households medical practitioners geologists geochemists and government agencies to work together for providing the better quality drinking water in the region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

11771,the health implications of exposure to chemicals like cadmium and lead through the consumption of polluted groundwater have made monitoring groundwater sources imperative this study evaluated the suitability of groundwater sources over the cretaceous abeokuta formation ogun state nigeria and mapped the distribution to identify the major pollution source abeokuta formation was sectionalized into three regions western central and eastern to sample one hundred and seven groundwater sources in situ and detailed laboratory testing for physicochemical anion cation metals and e coli were carried out following the apha standard procedure laboratory results were subjected to water quality index wqi carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks of metals spatial analysis using kriging interpolation of arcgis and several plots findings showed that the percentage of samples with a problematic ph concentration chloride bicarbonate iron lead cadmium and coliform increased from western to central and recorded the highest percentage in the eastern region hydrogeochemical charts inferred that carbonate and silicate weathering were responsible for the enrichment of anions in the aquifer wqi result indicates that all samples are within the acceptable range 100 although cancer risks for all samples were insignificant 26 7 23 4 and 56 7 of samples have significant non carcinogenic risks hi 1 in western central and eastern regions respectively spatial analysis showed that the low elevation areas in the central and eastern regions have high non cancer risks the contribution of parameters to non cancer risks were cd cu pb zn fe no3 cr ni in central and cu cd pb zn fe no3 cr ni in eastern regions this study therefore established that geogenic processes have severely polluted the groundwater aquifer in the eastern region and groundwater in the area is unsuitable for consumption and poses a severe public health concern graphical abstract graphical abstract image 1 keywords abeokuta formation groundwater suitability human health risks spatial analysis water supply 1 introduction globally studies on groundwater pollution and its related health implications have received major attention in recent years due to the identification of chemicals that have significant health consequences in concentrations that are above acceptable thresholds in groundwater sources across the globe adimalla 2018 adimalla and li 2019 nafyad and shankar 2018 owamah 2020 oyeyemi 2017 shankar and nafyad 2019 shukla and saxena 2020 taiwo et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 xin et al 2020 yadav et al 2019 the natural presence of chemicals such as metals cadmium nickel etc in groundwater can be of health significance they may be elevated in water sources because of leaching from geologic components who 2022 for instance cadmium is one of the most toxic metals mostly found in groundwater sources kubier et al 2020 and bioaccumulates in different organs of humans causing severe damage such as cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases and cancer genchi et al 2020 hajeb et al 2014 the primary transport process of cadmium in groundwater is through rock minerals sediment flow and volcanic eruptions birke et al 2017 besides the anthropogenic sources attributable to the extensive application of fertilizers and industrial activities kubier et al 2019 these severe health impacts made the european commission 2014 emphasize that cadmium is a hazardous trace metal that requires mandated regulatory plans aside from metals ingesting chemicals like nitrate in high concentrations through groundwater could cause severe health implications including cancer rezaei et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2022 chronic exposure to nitrate causes central nervous system abnormalities digestive system cancer and intrauterine retardation in pregnant women badeenezhad et al 2019 qasemi et al 2022 ward et al 2018 these harmful chemicals have been reported in groundwater with high concentrations in different parts of the world including nigeria gao et al 2020 kamarehie et al 2019 ojekunle et al 2022 generally some of these pollutants in groundwater are attributed to anthropogenic activities such as poor waste management intensive fertilizer application mining activities and indiscriminate disposal of industrial effluents kamarehie et al 2019 qasemi et al 2022 therefore their pathways and interactions within the aquifers require strict monitoring besides anthropogenic sources geogenic processes cause groundwater quality deterioration and alter the suitability for drinking through multifaceted geological mechanisms karunanidhi et al 2021 sajil kumar et al 2020 sunkari et al 2022 these could cause an enrichment of ions in the groundwater aquifer or an elevated concentration of harmful pollutants the process includes rock water interactions rock weathering such as carbonate and silicate mineralization of salts groundwater residence time and ion exchange processes kadam et al 2022 paul et al 2019 wagh et al 2019 the complexity of these interactions and associated health risks have been explored through the application of hydrochemical hydrogeochemical and statistical tools gibbs plot has been found effective in identifying the mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry of deep and shallow aquifers weathering evaporation sea intrusion etc and the interaction of aquifer s lithology with groundwater ismail et al 2020 wagh et al 2019 various indices have been applied in groundwater quality studies paul et al 2019 swain et al 2022b notably the water quality index wqi adimalla et al 2018a gaikwad et al 2020 radfard et al 2019 shankar and nafyad 2019 swain et al 2022a zhang et al 2020 and human health risks index hhr ojekunle et al 2022 qasemi et al 2022 rezaei et al 2019 taiwo et al 2020 to demystify complex water quality results into a relatable single scale identify potential risks of exposure to chemicals and enhance implementation of sustainable groundwater management policies the health risks index which focuses on metals and carcinogens has been used as a complement to extend the parameter coverage of wqi physicochemical and nutrients in establishing groundwater suitability in some studies das et al 2020 kadam et al 2022 zakir et al 2020 in recent years mapping of spatial distribution variation of groundwater quality and suitability through spatial analysis have been explored by researchers ijumulana et al 2021 kale et al 2020 paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 sahoo et al 2021 shankar and nafyad 2019 swain et al 2022a wagh et al 2018 spatial analysis guides in locating areas with consequential groundwater quality and helps decision makers implement policy quino lima et al 2020 shankar and nafyad 2019 therefore the spatial analysis could provide insight into groundwater suitability across geologic units abeokuta formation is the oldest sedimentary formation among nigeria s geological units of the eastern dahomey basin abeokuta formation is characterized by coarsely grained sandstone with interbedded mudstone and siltstone adebanija 2013 abeokuta formation extend through the entire width of ogun state nigeria covering eleven 11 out of the twenty 20 local government areas of the state which embody the prominent urban centers in the state including part of the capital city the grossly inadequate access to public water supply in nigeria particularly ogun state due to the dysfunctional status of the water corporation has made groundwater exploitation the only alternative to meet daily water demands odjegba et al 2020 by implication the aquifer of abeokuta formation supports livelihood for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes including brewing and dairy industries the proximity of sagamu the central part of abeokuta formation to the most populated city in africa lagos suggests that the aquifers of abeokuta formation may experience increased groundwater exploitation and anthropogenic pollution through the ingress of people and subsequent population explosion the ingress of people could cause an increase in water demand and an overburden of the groundwater aquifer which if not properly managed may hinder the realization of the sustainable development goal target 6 in ogun state swain et al 2022b emphasized that groundwater aquifers monitoring is essential to mitigate stressors such as urbanization sporadic increase in population and climate change swain et al 2022c geologically abeokuta formation has received attention in aspects such as lithostratigraphy boboye 2018 shitta 2009 stratigraphy and deposition process adeigbe and oyekola 2019 okosun 1990 ola buraimo et al 2014 oli et al 2019 omatsola and adegoke 1981 and biostratigraphy adekeye et al 2019 meanwhile studies on the water quality of the aquifers within the abeokuta formation have only been carried out in some parts including the outcrop of abeokuta formation in the capital city of ogun state emenike et al 2018 odjegba et al 2021 orebiyi et al 2008 sagamu kareem et al 2016 and the extension of abeokuta formation in uzeba edo state adewumi et al 2016 as a result information on the suitability of groundwater sources in abeokuta formation associable health risks particularly cancer risk and the extent of pollution are lacking also simplified information such as a health risk map that could guide the people living in different parts of abeokuta formation in locating suitable areas for groundwater exploitation and promoting sustainable groundwater management policies in ogun state is lacking furthermore the current statistics of cancer incidence in nigeria 124 815 cases as of the year 2021 by the international agency for research on cancer 2022 and the probable increase in cases suggest that it is imperative to evaluate the potential cancer risks from groundwater sources in ogun state particularly abeokuta formation mainly to provide information on the potential risks and support the fight against the increasing cancer cases in nigeria therefore the objectives of this study were to a assess the groundwater quality of wells over the entire stretch of abeokuta formation in ogun state nigeria and compare results with a globally recognized standard b evaluate the suitability of the water sources and probable carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks using water quality index and human health risks index c map the spatial distribution of the groundwater suitability to identify the extent of pollution within the aquifer of abeokuta formation in ogun state d to identify the major groundwater pollution source s within the abeokuta formation using gibb s plot and the ph metals interaction in the study area 2 methodology 2 1 study area abeokuta formation is within latitudes 6 45 7 30 n and longitudes 2 30 40 00 e and covers about 180 km land mass abeokuta formation spread across the entire width of ogun state southwestern nigeria extending to parts of ondo state and edo state part of abeokuta formation within ogun state spread across 11 local government areas lga consisting of over 120 localities fig 1 abeokuta formation extend through major urban centers in ogun state including ijebu owode ikenne odogbolu part of abeokuta metropolis the capital city and sagamu where several industrial and agricultural activities take place and accommodate several villages and towns ogun state has an estimated population of 5 2 million boarding the most populated city in africa lagos oyo state and edo state the study area has a tropical wet and dry climate characterized by a mean annual rainfall between 1 200 mm and 1 500 mm and a mean annual temperature between 23 c and 32 c the part of abeokuta formation in ogun state is bounded at the north by basement complex rock granitic rock and at the south by ewekoro formation mainly consisting of limestone the recent alluvium formation that separated abeokuta formation into three parts referred to as regions in this study is visibly covered by canals on the land surface abeokuta formation is the oldest and thickest sedimentary geological unit in the eastern dahomey basin of west african abeokuta formation is made of sandstone grits loose sands kaolinitic clay shale and a minor proportion of limestone akintola et al 2012 the formation is termed ferruginous due to the high presence of sandstone as the dominant rock mineral in the aquifer abeokuta formation was previously referred to as abeokuta group by omatsola adegoke 1981 and classified into three ise afowo and araromi formations based on the age and lithology d almeida 2016 after the first nomenclature and lithostratigraphic classification by jones hockey 1964 ise formation is neocomian albian in age and consists of conglomerate and grit that unconformably overlies the basement complex at the base and is further overlain by coarse to medium grain sandstone and kaolinitic clay afowo is classified into two based on the age of the minerals namely turonian lower portion and maastrichtian upper portion afowo formation is made of coarse to medium sandstone with an interbed of organic rich shale siltstone and claystone the shale of afowo is highly fossiliferous as the araromi formation maastrichtian in age which consists mainly fine to medium sandstone overlain by shale siltstone and interbed of limestone and sand abeokuta group was discontinued and replaced with the abeokuta formation based on the similarity and homogeneity of lithofacies identified by okosun 1990 oli et al 2019 detailed the controversy about the nomenclature of the abeokuta formation groundwater occurrence in abeokuta formation is confined in nature the major means of groundwater exploitation in the three regions of the abeokuta formation are drilled wells boreholes aladejana and talabi 2013 although deep hand dug wells exist in a few places as this study discovered some hand dug wells are not productive during the dry season the drainage of abeokuta formation is dendritic and consists of rainforest vegetation a sample of the lithostratigraphy and hydrogeologic sections in part of the abeokuta formation is presented in fig 2 this study includes areas of the outcrop of abeokuta formation in ogun state covering about eleven local government areas of the state 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis sampling was carried out during the wet season in july 2019 in total 107 groundwater samples were collected from existing wells 3 hand dug wells and 104 boreholes samples across the three regions of the abeokuta formation multistage sampling techniques were applied to streamline sampling points and ensure representativeness the map of abeokuta formation was segmented into three regions western central and eastern regions using the existing geological boundaries fig 1 afterward sample points wells were randomly selected over the three regions the total distribution of selected wells was 30 wells in the western 47 wells in the central and 30 wells in the eastern region of the abeokuta formation all sample points were geo referenced using a geographical positioning system to ensure that sampled wells are within the coverage of the abeokuta formation in situ analyses were carried out to determine the ph and electrical conductivity of water samples using a ph meter model pcr 500 the ph meter was calibrated with ph buffer 7 0 and thoroughly rinsed with deionized water before and after sampling samples were collected in 2 5 l polypropylene bottles for detailed laboratory analysis at the institute of agricultural research training ibadan nigeria following apha 2017 procedures the samples were tested for sodium potassium chloride calcium magnesium nitrate phosphate sulfate bicarbonate total alkalinity and the trace metals iron fe2 zinc zn2 lead pb2 copper cu2 cadmium cd2 chromium cr6 and nickel ni2 at 23 c 2 c chloride bicarbonate calcium and magnesium were analyzed using the titrimetric method following standard procedure e g 1 ml of kcr2o4 were added to 50 ml of sample and titrated against 0 1m agno3 for

introduced for quality assurance and quality control during the analysis 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis for this study includes the descriptive statistics for data representation mean and standard deviation and computation of mathematical equations to determine the water quality index and human health risks using ms excel and spss version 20 2 3 1 water quality index wqi water quality index wqi analysis provides insight into the suitability of water sources for consumption by using the concentration of water quality parameters to provide a summary rating studies have established that wqi is important and enhance decision making for water experts and policymakers adimalla and taloor 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 swain et al 2022a to compute the wqi for the groundwater sampled in the study area 12 water quality parameters ph ec tds cl hno3 ca2 mg2 no3 na k po3 and so4 were used in this study n 12 with the weight assigned for each parameter see table 1 the relative weight of the ith parameter is computed using eqn 1 nafyad and shankar 2018 the relative weight assigned to individual parameters was under parameters significance in drinking water srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 nafyad and shankar 2018 the assigned weight ranged from scale 1 to 5 depending on the importance of the parameters to drinking water quality values of assigned weight for all parameters are presented in table 1 the mathematical expression of relative weight and wqi 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the relative weight of water quality parameters wi is the individual assigned weight of ith parameter assessed n is the total number of parameters used in the computation of the wqi afterward the quality rating of ith parameter qi is obtained from eqn 2 adopted from the study of swain et al 2022a 2 q i c i v i d s i v i d 100 where qi is the quality rating of water ci is the concentration of water quality parameters in mg l except ec in μs cm from the laboratory result vid is the ideal value of the water quality parameter i e in pure water the value for all drinking water parameters in an ideal state ph at 7 is zero 0 the drinking water quality standard si were computed using the acceptable limits of the world health organization water quality standard 2011 and 2017 since the water quality standard for ph is in range the upper class limit 8 5 was used for the computation of si for samples with ph above 7 while 6 5 was used for ph values below 7 the final water quality index wqi is computed using eqn 3 below 3 w q i i 1 n w i q i a detailed study on the application of wqi in groundwater quality studies has been documented in previous studies bahita et al 2021 iqbal et al 2020 khatri et al 2020 swain et al 2022a the overall water quality index rating is presented in table 2 2 3 2 human health risk assessment 2 3 2 1 non carcinogenic risks the human health risk assessment hhra of water quality were evaluated using the united states environmental protection agency u s epa 2002 guideline for human health risks for drinking water several studies have adopted the guidelines to assess carcinogenic and non carcinogenic chronic health risks adimalla 2018 adimalla et al 2018a taiwo et al 2020 tomašek et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 in this study we evaluated both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks the non carcinogenic health risk was evaluated for ingestion of no3 fe2 zn2 cu2 pb2 cd2 cr6 and ni2 while the carcinogenic risks were evaluated for pb2 cd2 cr6 and ni2 to compute the non carcinogenic risk the chronic daily intake cdi was computed using eqn 4 shown

identification of hotspots vulnerable areas across the globe ijumulana et al 2020 2022 paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 singh and verma 2019 venkatramanan et al 2019 the relief elevation map of the study area was generated from the gis environment arcgis 10 1 the elevation data was downloaded from the united states geological survey s earth explorer website the elevation data was downloaded in a tile form a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem collected by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm a total of six 6 tiles were downloaded and mosaicked to generate the dem for the entire stretch of abeokuta formation in ogun state nigeria ordinary kriging interpolation methods were used to predict the spatial distribution of groundwater quality index and human health risk within the study area the ordinary kriging method assumes the overall distance and the degree of variation between sampled points and the overall area extent this is a major advantage against the inverse distance weighing method of geostatistical interpolation used by other studies lima et al 2019 nafyad and shankar 2018 shankar and nafyad 2019 zhang et al 2020 karami et al 2018 also affirmed that the kriging interpolation model is more accurate than other geostatistical methods based on their findings during cross validation of prediction errors of various geostatistical approaches kriging method uses a variation of output data layer surfaces such as prediction and prediction standard errors probability and quartile an empirical semi variogram is generated using the error mean model in eqn 8 8 ζ s o i 1 n λ i ζ s i where z so is the observed value of the water quality parameter at the sampled location λ is the unknown weight for a measured value at the sampled location s is the prediction location n is the number of measured values the human health risks assessment and water quality index results were prepared in a spreadsheet with the gps coordinate of the sampling points and imported into the arcgis environment the data were used for the kriging interpolation method to generate a spatial distribution of the health risks and water quality index the generated map serves as an indicator and guide in selecting suitable low risks sites and locations requiring remediation 2 4 1 gibbs plot and ficklin caboi diagram gibbs diagram depicts the features of groundwater sources and identifies significant water quality determinants geogenic activities or surface water intrusion the water quality testing results for sodium calcium chloride tds and bicarbonate for all sampling points were used to plot the gibbs plot the graph of na na ca was plotted against tds to determine the factors influencing the cation and the value of cl cl hco3 was plotted against tds for the anion mobilization of metals in the human body is influenced by ph at an acidic level zakir et al 2020 used the ficklin caboi diagram to classify groundwater quality and the level of metal loading in samples the classification of ph metal interaction promotes public health by emphasizing the importance of water treatment where necessary the concentrations of all the tested metals fe2 zn2 cu2 pb2 cd2 cr6 and ni2 were summed up and plotted against the ph of the water samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of water quality result the comparison of groundwater quality results against acceptable limits of a recognizable standard is the primary means of identifying water suitability for consumption the descriptive statistics and summary of water quality results for the three regions of the abeokuta formation is presented in tables 4 and 5 below generally water samples ph across the abeokuta formation regions ranges from slightly acidic to acceptable the percentage of samples with ph values below the lower boundary limit 6 5 established by who 2017 increases from 60 in the western region with a mean value of 6 49 table 4 below to 73 in the central region with a mean value of 6 26 it further reduced to 70 and 6 10 mean value in the eastern region the ph of groundwater indicates the ability to react with acidic or alkaline material and its mobility to react with metals in the water bodrud doza et al 2020 the acidic ph of the water sources corroborates the findings of adewumi et al 2016 on the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in uzebba area which falls within part of abeokuta formation in edo state nigeria ec across the three regions is very low with mean values 140 23 μs cm western 129 59 μs cm central and 120 12 μs cm eastern respectively ec of water reflects the dissolution of salts and organic pollution load in water wagh et al 2020 therefore low values of ec may be attributed to the low concentrations of dissolved ions in the water given that calcium magnesium sodium potassium sulfate and phosphate have extremely low concentrations across the three regions as shown in table 4 below high alkalinity content with mean values 105 98 mg l 165 43 mg l and 171 69 mg l were recorded in the western central and eastern regions respectively table 4 sixty 60 percent of sampled wells in the western region were above the 100 mg l limits these increased to 85 20 percent and 83 40 percent of sampled points in the central and eastern regions of the formation table 5 the alkalinity of water is the capacity of water to neutralize acid natural sources of alkalinity are the dissolution of co2 with rain water or groundwater in groundwater carbonate minerals dissolution process influences alkalinity content in water this is evident with the strong correlation western r2 0 84 central r2 0 95 eastern r2 0 52 that exists between bicarbonate and total alkalinity in the sampled water as shown in fig 3 a below high alkalinity groundwater was linked to the dissolution of calcite mineral combined with the ion exchange process by adithya et al 2016 the mean chloride content of water sources in western central and eastern regions are 164 02 mg l 153 94 mg l and 184 19 mg l respectively the eastern region of the formation has a significant rise in chloride content with 83 3 percent of sample locations having concentrations above the acceptable limit of 250 mg l by who western and central regions also have 10 percent and 8 60 percent of sample locations with chloride content above the acceptable limit hw indicate hand dug wells although ikhane et al 2012 and akintola et al 2012 asserted that rock minerals of the abeokuta formation are formed in a shallow near marine environment during the deposition process fig 3b above shows that na and cl in the three regions have no relationship this implies that elevated chloride in the water may be from urban runoffs road salt and anthropogenic activities alfaifi et al 2021 gaikwad et al 2022 instead of probable intrusion from the neighboring recent alluvium and coastal aquifer runoffs could be the probable source of the elevated chloride in the water since the sampling was conducted during the wet season with high rainfall frequency bicarbonate concentration in the water samples has mean values 201 14 mg l 325 61 mg l and 344 45 mg l in the western central and eastern regions respectively table 4 the percentage of sample locations with bicarbonate concentrations above the limit 200 mg l increased from the western 56 7 percent to the eastern regions of the formation 83 40 percent and the central region had the highest percentage 89 40 percent as shown in table 5 naturally elevated bicarbonate concentrations can be introduced in groundwater mainly through the dissolution of minerals with carbonate content or through the reaction of co2 with rainwater ismail et al 2020 sandstones the major aquifer in the study area are sediments bounded or cemented by either combination of silica calcium carbonate or iron oxide hence the dissolution process of carbonate minerals in the aquifer such as calcite could cause high bicarbonate concentration in the groundwater sources also abundant rainfall during the sampling period wet season could enhance the dissolution process in combination with the elevation difference the major deposition mechanism logarithmic bivariate plots of hco3 na vs ca na and mg na vs ca na have been used in recent studies to establish the hydrogeochemical activities weathering in aquifers gaikwad et al 2022 raychowdhury et al 2014 wagh et al 2018 2020 the bivariate plot of hco3 na vs ca na fig 3c and mg na vs ca na in fig 3d shows that carbonate weathering is predominant in sampled wells in the western region the central region has evaporite weathering combined with carbonate and silicate weathering in some water sources the eastern region of the formation has mainly silicate weathering and carbonate weathering in the sampled wells generally carbonate weathering and silicate weathering control the hydrochemistry in the aquifer which is enhanced by evaporite weathering through the interaction of carbonic acid and co2 generally the ion exchange process the presence of kaolinitic clay in the formation could infer that the kaolinization of silicate minerals could cause an enrichment of sio2 in the groundwater and thus the dominance of silicate weathering in parts of the formation as indicated in fig 3d also the process could further result in hco3 concentration through the composition of primary silicate adithya et al 2016 garrels 1967 the combination of natural bicarbonate in water and bicarbonate from silicate and calcite minerals may result in an enrichment of bicarbonate in groundwater adithya et al 2016 although this study did not analyze silicate among the parameters tested in the water sample geochemical analysis of the rock samples of abeokuta formation using x ray fluorescence by akintola et al 2012 found a high concentration of sio2 and an abundance of fe2co3 in the rock samples mean value of iron concentration in the water sample increased from the western 0 2433 mg l to the central region 1 1064 mg l and the highest mean was recorded in the eastern region 1 1176 mg l as shown in table 4 sample points with high iron content increased from the western region 37 percent to the central 56 70 percent in contrast all sample points in the eastern region recorded values above the limit of 0 03 mg l the observed iron concentration is considered normal as previous studies established that sandstone materials in the formation have high iron oxide and are named ferruginous akintola et al 2012 also iron oxide acts as the cementing material for the sediments during the process of deposition thus increasing towards the thinner low elevation part of the formation ikhane et al 2012 similarly lead and cadmium recorded a similar increase in concentration from western 23 percent and 20 percent to central 42 60 percent and 53 20 percent and the highest concentration in the eastern 63 40 percent and 60 percent region of the formation table 5 these trends are considered the influence of the geological mineral deposit across the entire abeokuta formation a significant fraction of lead in groundwater is undissolved and occurs as precipitates pbco3 pb2o and pbso4 or as suspended organic matter even at trace concentrations lead is a non essential element for humans and carcinogenic high amounts of lead can cause health problems such as kidney neurological and cardiovascular diseases alam et al 2020 high cadmium exposure from drinking water or inhalation induces cadmium deposition in the kidney resulting in kidney and renal damage chronic anemia the growth of mutagenic and malignant cells endocrine disruption and interference with calcium homeostasis are serious health consequences of cadmium exposure ali et al 2013 monika mahajan et al 2022 attributed high cadmium concentration in groundwater sources in punjab india to intensive industrialization extensive agricultural activities and landfill leachates in the global review anthropogenic pathways such as indiscriminate disposal of sewage sludge agricultural runoff combustion emission and leachates from landfill were emphasized as the major pathway of cadmium to groundwater troudi et al 2020 aside from the geogenic processes such as weathering of rocks and thermal vents studies have established that all rocks including sandstones have substantial cadmium content shale bearing geological units were reported with the highest cd content with an example in black shale pyrite perkins and mason 2015 tamoto et al 2015 linked the significant presence of cd in a sedimentary environment to the geologic unit authors further stated that sedimentary formations are naturally rich in metals therefore it can be inferred that the significant level of cd in the abeokuta formation is from a combination of geogenic and anthropogenic sources the elevated concentration of zinc in sampled water of both central and eastern regions were 19 4 percent and 6 7 percent as shown in table 5 zinc is essential to human health and its major source is drinking water and food sources of zinc in groundwater aside from geogenic processes weathering include waste incineration fossil fuels combustion of coals and runoff of worn rubber tyres chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 the elevated zinc in the central and eastern regions could be attributed to anthropogenic sources such as waste incineration and rubber tire wear runoff because the region comprises busy urban centers particularly areas like ijebu ode sagamu ikenne etc there is a high coliform load in water samples and the proportion of polluted well water increases from the western to the central and eastern regions of the abeokuta formation table 5 these might be due to bacterial contamination of runoff water that seeps into the groundwater table and wells during the rainy season elisante and muzuka 2016 attributed runoff seepage through conditions such as low well heads inadequate well casing and leaching during the rainy season to the coliform loading in the borehole and shallow wells in mount meru s slope in tanzania 3 2 water quality index the water quality index classifies water quality data to identify water s suitability for drinking the water quality in the three regions falls within three of the four classifications as shown in table 6 the percentage of water samples within the excellent category 25 decreased from the western region 23 3 percent to the central 8 5 percent and recorded the lowest in the eastern region 6 6 percent similarly the percentage of samples within the good water category 26 50 decreased from the western region 70 percent to the central 61 7 percent and had the lowest percentage in the eastern region 56 7 percent the percentage of acceptable water categories in the three regions was in reverse pattern compared to excellent and good water categories the western region had the lowest percentage 6 7 percent which increased to 29 8 percent in the central region while the eastern region had the highest percentage 36 7 percent western region has a mean wqi score of 34 while the central and eastern regions scored 44 as shown in table s1 in the supplementary document the modal wqi score for the three regions are 62 76 and 84 in the western central and eastern regions respectively based on the wqi result it could be inferred that all water sources sampled are fit for drinking purposes although the fitness slightly decreases towards the eastern part of the formation excellent good and acceptable water status are advised for drinking while unsuitable water quality status is generally fit for aesthetic purposes swain et al 2022a adopted the wqi to establish that 36 percent of groundwater sources in faridabad and gurgaon district of the indian national capital region have an unsuitable water quality with a maximum wqi score of 212 10 the wqi computation uses the results of physicochemical and nutrient analysis anion and cation adimalla et al 2020 ismail et al 2020 which is not exhaustive and should be combined with additional analysis such as metals health risks for a better understanding of the characteristics and safety status of the water sources 3 3 human health risks 3 3 1 non carcinogenic risks human health risk assessment is the best mathematical model for the assessment of non carcinogenic risks of water quality adimalla 2018 the health risks result is presented in table 7 the western region s minimum and maximum risks hi range from 0 22 to 2 40 respectively with a mean hi of 0 73 the minimum risk is recorded at ilara iii aiyetoro and ileniku wells and the maximum risk was recorded at imala ii twenty seven 27 percent of sample points in the western region recorded significant risks the central region has the least hi value of 0 01 recorded at owode egba ii and maximum risks value of 2 81 at odogbolu well with an average health risk of 0 69 twenty four percent of sample points in the central region recorded significant risks hi 1 the highest hi value of 8 14 is recorded in the eastern region at powerline well with a mean and minimum hi value of 1 75 and 0 06 respectively among all trace metals evaluated copper has the highest daily dosage risks based on median value and ranking per region the observed order of risk in the western cu zn pb fe no3 cd cr ni central regions have the order cd cu pb zn fe no3 cr ni the eastern region has an increasing order of cu cd pb zn fe no3 cr ni as shown in table s2 in supplementary document the variation observed in toxicity order of the parameters across the regions is traceable to the variations in the concentration of the parameters for instance the concentration of zinc in the western region may be lower than the established limits still they could be significantly higher than other parameters based on toxicity health risks also the general variation in the number of samples with elevated concentrations across the regions as shown in table 5 above could probably have an indirect link copper toxicity causes damage to the brain and kidneys as well as liver cirrhosis and intestinal inflammation in southwestern nigeria taiwo et al 2020 observed that bottled water had four times the copper toxicity of soft drinks alcoholic beverages malarial herbal mixtures and anti pile remedies this finding suggests that people who drink water from wells with significant risks within abeokuta formation untreated especially in the eastern region might experience a variety of ailments such as acute to chronic anaemia and neurotoxicity from excessive cadmium ingestion stomach pains nausea and vomiting from high zinc levels nyambura et al 2020 evaluated groundwater sources cancer and non carcinogenic risks in kilimambogo kenya the authors established that water sources in the region are heavily polluted and recorded a mean hazard index hi of 84 7 for metals cd ni and pb das et al 2020 studied the health risks of nitrate and metals in groundwater sources from the nadia district of west bengal and found four of the water sources with significant nitrate risks hi 1 similarly adimalla li 2019 recorded significant risks of fluoride and nitrate in groundwater sources in telangana state india 3 3 2 potential cancer risks analysis the cancer risks of groundwater sources in the abeokuta formation are presented in table 8 generally all sampled groundwater sources recorded no significant cancer risks hi 1 across the three regions of the abeokuta formation western central and eastern regions the possible contribution of the metals lead cadmium chromium and nickel to future cancer risks in regions of the abeokuta formation is presented in fig 4 lead was recorded as the highest in the western part of the formation with a score value of 7 88e 04 followed by cadmium 3 58e 04 chromium has the highest risk value 2 77e 03 in the central part of the abeokuta formation followed by lead 1 77e 03 also in the eastern region lead pb is the metal with the highest risk score 2 68e 03 followed by chromium 1 71e 03 this suggest that anthropogenic sources of lead cadmium and chromium such as mining smelting indiscriminate sewage and solid waste disposal waste incineration and intensive agricultural activities should be properly monitored to avoid future occurrences of cancer in groundwater users in the study area 3 4 spatial analysis this section presents the spatial analysis results of the elevation wqi and hi distribution in figs 5 7 the digital elevation model dem generated on the arcgis environment as described in section 2 3 3 is shown in fig 5 elevation across the regions of the abeokuta formation decreases from the western to the central and records the lowest level in the eastern region fig 5 these support the description of adebanija 2013 that the abeokuta formation thickens to the west and shows that the deposition process affects the geological unit s physical and chemical characteristics the spatial distribution of wqi fig 6 shows that the entire western region has good water quality including parts of the central region the interpolation model has a standardized root mean square rmss of 0 94 mean value of 0 67 and a standardized mean value of 0 04 which shows a slight minor overfitting in the model still rmss value proves that the prediction accuracy was high and acceptable twelve 12 sampled wells are within the acceptable water quality area 51 100 in the central region while ten 10 sampled wells are within the range in the eastern region of the formation the spatial distribution of wqi in fig 6 conforms with the wqi result the water quality reduces slightly in the eastern direction these further suggest that the elevation pattern affects the wqi outcomes in the study area the spatial analysis result of non carcinogenic risks hazard index hi of groundwater sources in the abeokuta formation is presented in fig 7 the map showing the spatial distribution of hi fig 7 classified hi into very low 0 5 low 0 5 0 75 moderate 0 75 1 and high risks hi 1 to observe the distribution of non carcinogenic risk within the study area the interpolation model has an acceptable accuracy with rmss of 0 92 the mean value of 0 04 and the standardized mean value of 0 03 the central region has the highest number of sampled wells within a very low non carcinogenic risks area 18 followed by the western region 5 in contrast the eastern region has no predicted very low risks areas the numbers of sampled well within low risks areas in the western central and eastern regions were 14 13 and 4 respectively also the number of wells within moderate risks area were 8 5 and 3 in western central and eastern regions respectively the western region has the least number of wells within high non carcinogenic risk areas 3 which increased to 10 wells in the central region the eastern region has the highest number of sampled wells within high risks areas which is evident from the result in table 7 generally high non carcinogenic risk coverage spread increases from western to central and eastern regions significant areas with high non carcinogenic risks in the western region are imala olorunda and ayetoro the results imply that groundwater within the area is unsuitable for consumption without appropriate remediation the most suitable areas for groundwater exploitation with relatively no health consequences are obada afon idi emi alagbede imeko and ileniku in the western region adedero debore ooba laloko kobape akogun ofada and part of ajura in the central region all wells within the low risk to moderate risks areas are considered suitable for drinking purposes including imodi imosan ososa new market and new garage in the eastern region the eastern region of the formation has the highest non carcinogenic risks which can be attributed to the combination of geogenic deposition process and anthropogenic activities the high risk observed in the western region imala aiyetoro and olorunda may be traced to the high cu content of the sample as shown in table s2 in the supplementary document likewise the very low risk observed in the central region ooba and laloko could be attributed to variation in the mineral deposition within the aquiferous unit 3 5 identification of major pollution sources in abeokuta formation the result of major pollution drivers within abeokuta formation using the gibbs plot is presented in fig 8 the result of the gibbs graph indicates that all sample points fall within the rock dominance region of the graph for both na na ca2 against total dissolved solids and cl cl hco3 against total dissolved solids although the sample points tend a little to the precipitation dominance direction rather than the seawater direction indicating that seasonal precipitation changes could influence the water quality status the water quality testing result ionic classification spatial analysis results and the health risks analysis including map substantiate the result of the gibbs plot analysis the results further confirm that the groundwater quality of all water sources sampled is mainly controlled by the mineralogical characteristics of the rock material adewumi et al 2016 affirmed that the mineralogical characteristics of rock minerals primarily controlled the groundwater quality of the uzebba part of the abeokuta formation the dissolution of metals in groundwater is partly controlled by the ph this made the classification of water by ficklin caboi diagram essential for a better understanding of water chemistry the chemistry of groundwater sources in the abeokuta formation is dominated by four metal loading groups according to the ficklin caboi diagram fig 9 the acid low metal group had the lowest percentage 19 percent followed by acid high metal 22 percent while both near neutral low metal and low neutral high metal had 24 percent and 35 percent respectively the variation in percentage was expected due to the spatial variation in the concentration of parameters still it could be inferred that most wells within the study area have high metal loading demonstrating their strong mobility in the aqueous state and supporting the result of non carcinogenic hazards zakir et al 2020 reported groundwater sources with low to high metal loading and near neutral ph in bangladesh indicating their low mobility in an aqueous condition 3 6 geogenic groundwater pollution implications for water security and sdg 6 several countries including nigeria are struggling to meet the sustainable development goals sdg target 6 of providing safe water to citizens suggesting that achieving a water secure world requires concerted effort in nigeria lack of access to safe drinking water via public water supply system stems from the poor infrastructural provision of state and national governments this has led to the reliance on groundwater systems as the primary means for meeting drinking domestic and agricultural water demands oluwasanya et al 2022 used the national water security index to analyze the water security status in africa and observed that more than half of african countries remain water insecure and have made little improvement in the last five years the report also highlighted the paucity of data on water sanitation and hygiene from most countries including nigeria although groundwater is not officially addressed in the sdg objectives guppy et al 2018 argued that sustainable groundwater management must achieve the goals notably target 6 united nations 2022 report on world water development explicitly attribute sustainable groundwater management to poverty eradication promotion of a resilient climate and socio economic development the overuse of groundwater resources has resulted in aquifer overburdening and the decline of worldwide aquifer water levels u s geological survey 2017 groundwater scarcity might become the next major water security issue particularly in areas where public water supplies are unavailable or in limited supply therefore it would be more difficult to achieve the sdg goals without adequate attention including institutional frameworks to ensure proper management of the global groundwater system united nations 2022 while water availability is essential to water security water quality is more critical especially since water borne diseases account for 80 of all human diseases das and nag 2015 the importance of water security is not limited to access to drinking water free from pathogens that might cause immediate health complications but access to a water source free from pollutants with probable short term or long term health consequences cases of groundwater pollution from both geogenic and anthropogenic sources vary globally for instance this study inferred that the inhabitants of parts of abeokuta formation with significant non cancer risks particularly eastern region are liable to encounter diverse health challenges due to the poor water quality in the area and lack of access to alternative water sources furthermore the establishment of geogenic process as the major driver of pollution in the aquifer suggests that immediate remediation measures are essential particularly to facilitate the realization of sdg target 6 and fulfilment of the leave no one behind agenda in addition das et al 2020 stated that 33 of all groundwater sources of the worlds largest groundwater user india is not fit for drinking the study also observed that the water quality of 66 percent of west bengal s water sources is unsuitable an assessment of over 800 wells in northern germany conducted by riedel et al 2022 found high concentrations of metals such as manganese in over half of all wells and uranium concentrations exceeding the german standard in over 10 of the studied wells riedel and kübeck 2018 also investigated 8000 chemicals from 2000 groundwater sources in germany and discovered that ph e c and alkalinity predominantly govern groundwater redox reactions and metal concentration owing to weathering of rock minerals which varies based on geological units the challenge however is where the line should be drawn between geogenic and anthropogenic contributions of pollutants especially metals studies have reported the contributions of naturally occurring metals in rocks to the quality of groundwater amadi et al 2015 chandrasekar et al 2021 dedzo et al 2017 smedley and kinniburgh 2017 vetrimurugan et al 2017 the questions begging for answers are when when does the pollution start how much number of pollutants and what to do what could be done to stem occurrence for the question of when no specific date could be tied to the commencement of metal pollution of groundwater the pollution probably starts immediately rocks meet groundwater a process that could be constant unless a seasonal variation in climate influence groundwater flow regarding how much heavy metal contribution to pollution directly from rocks is difficult to determine assessment of groundwater quality probably gives a combined contribution mostly where anthropogenic contributions are easily delineated such as waste dump sites typically the establishment of contributions of rocks to metal pollution of groundwater and the addition from anthropogenic sources paints a clear picture that groundwater pollution would continue though some of these metals are needed in the human body in limited amounts consumptions at toxic thresholds are detrimental so what then can be done continuous periodic monitoring remains the only path to redeeming groundwater quality even though groundwater quality monitoring may be achieved only at government institutional levels because of the monetary implications the range of groundwater pathogens is in exhaustive but metals remain one of the most critical pollutants due to their severe health implications the emergence of micropollutants with broad categories of pathogens and diverse severe health implications including cancers and endocrine disruption have gained the attention of researchers k oreje et al 2016 pico et al 2019 wee and aris 2019 however their concentration in the environment is lesser than metals which has similar severe health implications organs disruption development of malignant cells etc higher bioavailability and higher chances of uptake through diverse sources including groundwater therefore sustainable groundwater management is essential for public health protection and promotes sustainable development goal 6 4 conclusion this study assessed the water quality evaluated the suitability and mapped the distribution to identify the major pollution source of groundwater samples in the cretaceous abeokuta formation ogun state nigeria the formation stretch within ogun state was divided into three regions and 107 well samples were collected for detailed analysis and suitability evaluation the water quality testing results show that the percentage of sample points with high ph chloride bicarbonate lead iron cadmium and e coli increased from the western to the central and recorded the highest percentage in the eastern region of the formation the dominant hydrogeochemical process in the aquifer responsible for the enrichment of anions was the combination of carbonate weathering silicate weathering and ion exchange processes during aquifer recharge wqi result showed that all water samples are within the acceptable drinking water range with a slight decrease in total percentage towards the eastern region of the formation meanwhile the non carcinogenic risk result showed that significant risks hi 1 of sample points increase from the western to central and eastern regions suggesting probable acute to severe health impact if consumed long term without proper treatment the contribution of parameters to non cancer risks varies as followed cu zn pb fe no3 cd cr ni in western cd cu pb zn fe no3 cr ni in central and cu cd pb zn fe no3 cr ni in eastern regions although all sample points have no significant cancer risks metals like lead cadmium and chromium are flagged for monitoring in wells with significant non cancer risks across the formation the spatial pattern analysis showed that the dem map wqi and the shape of the formation increased from western to eastern region suggesting a contribution from the geological deposition process spatial maps of non carcinogenic risks showed that the core central and upper western regions have the lowest risks most wells in the eastern region and the low elevation part of the central region have high risks gibbs and ficklin caboi plots showed that the groundwater quality status is dominated by rock weathering activities and has high metal loading the findings in this study established that the mineral composition of the aquifer in abeokuta formation primarily influenced the status of groundwater sources and poses significant health risks to the water users in parts of the formation therefore groundwater sources in the central and most parts of the western region are recommended to be suitable for drinking given the coverage of the eastern region drastic measures must be taken to remediate the pollution level to avoid future or and near future consequences furthermore this study has proven that the realization of the sdg 6 target in the eastern region of the study area will require an immediate drastic measures finally low cost water treatment techniques such as activated carbon biochar bio coagulants such as kenaf hibiscus and metal remediation technologies are recommended

11771,the health implications of exposure to chemicals like cadmium and lead through the consumption of polluted groundwater have made monitoring groundwater sources imperative this study evaluated the suitability of groundwater sources over the cretaceous abeokuta formation ogun state nigeria and mapped the distribution to identify the major pollution source abeokuta formation was sectionalized into three regions western central and eastern to sample one hundred and seven groundwater sources in situ and detailed laboratory testing for physicochemical anion cation metals and e coli were carried out following the apha standard procedure laboratory results were subjected to water quality index wqi carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks of metals spatial analysis using kriging interpolation of arcgis and several plots findings showed that the percentage of samples with a problematic ph concentration chloride bicarbonate iron lead cadmium and coliform increased from western to central and recorded the highest percentage in the eastern region hydrogeochemical charts inferred that carbonate and silicate weathering were responsible for the enrichment of anions in the aquifer wqi result indicates that all samples are within the acceptable range 100 although cancer risks for all samples were insignificant 26 7 23 4 and 56 7 of samples have significant non carcinogenic risks hi 1 in western central and eastern regions respectively spatial analysis showed that the low elevation areas in the central and eastern regions have high non cancer risks the contribution of parameters to non cancer risks were cd cu pb zn fe no3 cr ni in central and cu cd pb zn fe no3 cr ni in eastern regions this study therefore established that geogenic processes have severely polluted the groundwater aquifer in the eastern region and groundwater in the area is unsuitable for consumption and poses a severe public health concern graphical abstract graphical abstract

implications have received major attention in recent years due to the identification of chemicals that have significant health consequences in concentrations that are above acceptable thresholds in groundwater sources across the globe adimalla 2018 adimalla and li 2019 nafyad and shankar 2018 owamah 2020 oyeyemi 2017 shankar and nafyad 2019 shukla and saxena 2020 taiwo et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 xin et al 2020 yadav et al 2019 the natural presence of chemicals such as metals cadmium nickel etc in groundwater can be of health significance they may be elevated in water sources because of leaching from geologic components who 2022 for instance cadmium is one of the most toxic metals mostly found in groundwater sources kubier et al 2020 and bioaccumulates in different organs of humans causing severe damage such as cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases and cancer genchi et al 2020 hajeb et al 2014 the primary transport process of cadmium in groundwater is through rock minerals sediment flow and volcanic eruptions birke et al 2017 besides the anthropogenic sources attributable to the extensive application of fertilizers and industrial activities kubier et al 2019 these severe health impacts made the european commission 2014 emphasize that cadmium is a hazardous trace metal that requires mandated regulatory plans aside from metals ingesting chemicals like nitrate in high concentrations through groundwater could cause severe health implications including cancer rezaei et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2022 chronic exposure to nitrate causes central nervous system abnormalities digestive system cancer and intrauterine retardation in pregnant women badeenezhad et al 2019 qasemi et al 2022 ward et al 2018 these harmful chemicals have been reported in groundwater with high concentrations in different parts of the world including nigeria gao et al 2020 kamarehie et al 2019 ojekunle et al 2022 generally some of these pollutants in groundwater are attributed to anthropogenic activities such as poor waste management intensive fertilizer application mining activities and indiscriminate disposal of industrial effluents kamarehie et al 2019 qasemi et al 2022 therefore their pathways and interactions within the aquifers require strict monitoring besides anthropogenic sources geogenic processes cause groundwater quality deterioration and alter the suitability for drinking through multifaceted geological mechanisms karunanidhi et al 2021 sajil kumar et al 2020 sunkari et al 2022 these could cause an enrichment of ions in the groundwater aquifer or an elevated concentration of harmful pollutants the process includes rock water interactions rock weathering such as carbonate and silicate mineralization of salts groundwater residence time and ion exchange processes kadam et al 2022 paul et al 2019 wagh et al 2019 the complexity of these interactions and associated health risks have been explored through the application of hydrochemical hydrogeochemical and statistical tools gibbs plot has been found effective in identifying the mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry of deep and shallow aquifers weathering evaporation sea intrusion etc and the interaction of aquifer s lithology with groundwater ismail et al 2020 wagh et al 2019 various indices have been applied in groundwater quality studies paul et al 2019 swain et al 2022b notably the water quality index wqi adimalla et al 2018a gaikwad et al 2020 radfard et al 2019 shankar and nafyad 2019 swain et al 2022a zhang et al 2020 and human health risks index hhr ojekunle et al 2022 qasemi et al 2022 rezaei et al 2019 taiwo et al 2020 to demystify complex water quality results into a relatable single scale identify potential risks of exposure to chemicals and enhance implementation of sustainable groundwater management policies the health risks index which focuses on metals and carcinogens has been used as a complement to extend the parameter coverage of wqi physicochemical and nutrients in establishing groundwater suitability in some studies das et al 2020 kadam et al 2022 zakir et al 2020 in recent years mapping of spatial distribution variation of groundwater quality and suitability through spatial analysis have been explored by researchers ijumulana et al 2021 kale et al 2020 paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 sahoo et al 2021 shankar and nafyad 2019 swain et al 2022a wagh et al 2018 spatial analysis guides in locating areas with consequential groundwater quality and helps decision makers implement policy quino lima et al 2020 shankar and nafyad 2019 therefore the spatial analysis could provide insight into groundwater suitability across geologic units abeokuta formation is the oldest sedimentary formation among nigeria s geological units of the eastern dahomey basin abeokuta formation is characterized by coarsely grained sandstone with interbedded mudstone and siltstone adebanija 2013 abeokuta formation extend through the entire width of ogun state nigeria covering eleven 11 out of the twenty 20 local government areas of the state which embody the prominent urban centers in the state including part of the capital city the grossly inadequate access to public water supply in nigeria particularly ogun state due to the dysfunctional status of the water corporation has made groundwater exploitation the only alternative to meet daily water demands odjegba et al 2020 by implication the aquifer of abeokuta formation supports livelihood for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes including brewing and dairy industries the proximity of sagamu the central part of abeokuta formation to the most populated city in africa lagos suggests that the aquifers of abeokuta formation may experience increased groundwater exploitation and anthropogenic pollution through the ingress of people and subsequent population explosion the ingress of people could cause an increase in water demand and an overburden of the groundwater aquifer which if not properly managed may hinder the realization of the sustainable development goal target 6 in ogun state swain et al 2022b emphasized that groundwater aquifers monitoring is essential to mitigate stressors such as urbanization sporadic increase in population and climate change swain et al 2022c geologically abeokuta formation has received attention in aspects such as lithostratigraphy boboye 2018 shitta 2009 stratigraphy and deposition process adeigbe and oyekola 2019 okosun 1990 ola buraimo et al 2014 oli et al 2019 omatsola and adegoke 1981 and biostratigraphy adekeye et al 2019 meanwhile studies on the water quality of the aquifers within the abeokuta formation have only been carried out in some parts including the outcrop of abeokuta formation in the capital city of ogun state emenike et al 2018 odjegba et al 2021 orebiyi et al 2008 sagamu kareem et al 2016 and the extension of abeokuta formation in uzeba edo state adewumi et al 2016 as a result information on the suitability of groundwater sources in abeokuta formation associable health risks particularly cancer risk and the extent of pollution are lacking also simplified information such as a health risk map that could guide the people living in different parts of abeokuta formation in locating suitable areas for groundwater exploitation and promoting sustainable groundwater management policies in ogun state is lacking furthermore the current statistics of cancer incidence in nigeria 124 815 cases as of the year 2021 by the international agency for research on cancer 2022 and the probable increase in cases suggest that it is imperative to evaluate the potential cancer risks from groundwater sources in ogun state particularly abeokuta formation mainly to provide information on the potential risks and support the fight against the increasing cancer cases in nigeria therefore the objectives of this study were to a assess the groundwater quality of wells over the entire stretch of abeokuta formation in ogun state nigeria and compare results with a globally recognized standard b evaluate the suitability of the water sources and probable carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks using water quality index and human health risks index c map the spatial distribution of the groundwater suitability to identify the extent of pollution within the aquifer of abeokuta formation in ogun state d to identify the major groundwater pollution source s within the abeokuta formation using gibb s plot and the ph metals interaction in the study area 2 methodology 2 1 study area abeokuta formation is within latitudes 6 45 7 30 n and longitudes 2 30 40 00 e and covers about 180 km land mass abeokuta formation spread across the entire width of ogun state southwestern nigeria extending to parts of ondo state and edo state part of abeokuta formation within ogun state spread across 11 local government areas lga consisting of over 120 localities fig 1 abeokuta formation extend through major urban centers in ogun state including ijebu owode ikenne odogbolu part of abeokuta metropolis the capital city and sagamu where several industrial and agricultural activities take place and accommodate several villages and towns ogun state has an estimated population of 5 2 million boarding the most populated city in africa lagos oyo state and edo state the study area has a tropical wet and dry climate characterized by a mean annual rainfall between 1 200 mm and 1 500 mm and a mean annual temperature between 23 c and 32 c the part of abeokuta formation in ogun state is bounded at the north by basement complex rock granitic rock and at the south by ewekoro formation mainly consisting of limestone the recent alluvium formation that separated abeokuta formation into three parts referred to as regions in this study is visibly covered by canals on the land surface abeokuta formation is the oldest and thickest sedimentary geological unit in the eastern dahomey basin of west african abeokuta formation is made of sandstone grits loose sands kaolinitic clay shale and a minor proportion of limestone akintola et al 2012 the formation is termed ferruginous due to the high presence of sandstone as the dominant rock mineral in the aquifer abeokuta formation was previously referred to as abeokuta group by omatsola adegoke 1981 and classified into three ise afowo and araromi formations based on the age and lithology d almeida 2016 after the first nomenclature and lithostratigraphic classification by jones hockey 1964 ise formation is neocomian albian in age and consists of conglomerate and grit that unconformably overlies the basement complex at the base and is further overlain by coarse to medium grain sandstone and kaolinitic clay afowo is classified into two based on the age of the minerals namely turonian lower portion and maastrichtian upper portion afowo formation is made of coarse to medium sandstone with an interbed of organic rich shale siltstone and claystone the shale of afowo is highly fossiliferous as the araromi formation maastrichtian in age which consists mainly fine to medium sandstone overlain by shale siltstone and interbed of limestone and sand abeokuta group was discontinued and replaced with the abeokuta formation based on the similarity and homogeneity of lithofacies identified by okosun 1990 oli et al 2019 detailed the controversy about the nomenclature of the abeokuta formation groundwater occurrence in abeokuta formation is confined in nature the major means of groundwater exploitation in the three regions of the abeokuta formation are drilled wells boreholes aladejana and talabi 2013 although deep hand dug wells exist in a few places as this study discovered some hand dug wells are not productive during the dry season the drainage of abeokuta formation is dendritic and consists of rainforest vegetation a sample of the lithostratigraphy and hydrogeologic sections in part of the abeokuta formation is presented in fig 2 this study includes areas of the outcrop of abeokuta formation in ogun state covering about eleven local government areas of the state 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis sampling was carried out during the wet season in july 2019 in total 107 groundwater samples were collected from existing wells 3 hand dug wells and 104 boreholes samples across the three regions of the abeokuta formation multistage sampling techniques were applied to streamline sampling points and ensure representativeness the map of abeokuta formation was segmented into three regions western central and eastern regions using the existing geological boundaries fig 1 afterward sample points wells were randomly selected over the three regions the total distribution of selected wells was 30 wells in the western 47 wells in the central and 30 wells in the eastern region of the abeokuta formation all sample points were geo referenced using a geographical positioning system to ensure that sampled wells are within the coverage of the abeokuta formation in situ analyses were carried out to determine the ph and electrical conductivity of water samples using a ph meter model pcr 500 the ph meter was calibrated with ph buffer 7 0 and thoroughly rinsed with deionized water before and after sampling samples were collected in 2 5 l polypropylene bottles for detailed laboratory analysis at the institute of agricultural research training ibadan nigeria following apha 2017 procedures the samples were tested for sodium potassium chloride calcium magnesium nitrate phosphate sulfate bicarbonate total alkalinity and the trace metals iron fe2 zinc zn2 lead pb2 copper cu2 cadmium cd2 chromium cr6 and nickel ni2 at 23 c 2 c chloride bicarbonate calcium and magnesium were analyzed using the titrimetric method following standard procedure e g 1 ml of kcr2o4 were added to 50 ml of sample and titrated against 0 1m agno3 for determination of chloride sodium and potassium were analyzed using a flame photometer sherwood flame photometer 410 nitrate phosphate and sulfate were analyzed using a uv visible spectrophotometer

prepared from the test metals stock solution 100 mg l coliform count e coli was analyzed using emb agar himedia m317 500g all analyses were carried out in triplicate and blank deionized water were introduced for quality assurance and quality control during the analysis 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis for this study includes the descriptive statistics for data representation mean and standard deviation and computation of mathematical equations to determine the water quality index and human health risks using ms excel and spss version 20 2 3 1 water quality index wqi water quality index wqi analysis provides insight into the suitability of water sources for consumption by using the concentration of water quality parameters to provide a summary rating studies have established that wqi is important and enhance decision making for water experts and policymakers adimalla and taloor 2020 gaikwad et al 2020 swain et al 2022a to compute the wqi for the groundwater sampled in the study area 12 water quality parameters ph ec tds cl hno3 ca2 mg2 no3 na k po3 and so4 were used in this study n 12 with the weight assigned for each parameter see table 1 the relative weight of the ith parameter is computed using eqn 1 nafyad and shankar 2018 the relative weight assigned to individual parameters was under parameters significance in drinking water srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 nafyad and shankar 2018 the assigned weight ranged from scale 1 to 5 depending on the importance of the parameters to drinking water quality values of assigned weight for all parameters are presented in table 1 the mathematical expression of relative weight and wqi 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the relative weight of water quality parameters wi is the individual assigned weight of ith parameter assessed n is the total number of parameters used in the computation of the wqi afterward the quality rating of ith parameter qi is obtained from eqn 2 adopted from the study of swain et al 2022a 2 q i c i v i d s i v i d 100 where qi is the quality rating of water ci is the concentration of water quality parameters in mg l except ec in μs cm from the laboratory result vid is the ideal value of the water quality parameter i e in pure water the value for all drinking water parameters in an ideal state ph at 7 is zero 0 the drinking water quality standard si were computed using the acceptable limits of the world health organization water quality standard 2011 and 2017 since the water quality standard for ph is in range the upper class limit 8 5 was used for the computation of si for samples with ph above 7 while 6 5 was used for ph values below 7 the final water quality index wqi is computed using eqn 3 below 3 w q i i 1 n w i q i a detailed study on the application of wqi in groundwater quality studies has been documented in previous studies bahita et al 2021 iqbal et al 2020 khatri et al 2020 swain et al 2022a the overall water quality index rating is presented in table 2 2 3 2 human health risk assessment 2 3 2 1 non carcinogenic risks the human health risk assessment hhra of water quality were evaluated using the united states environmental protection agency u s epa 2002 guideline for human health risks for drinking water several studies have adopted the guidelines to assess carcinogenic and non carcinogenic chronic health risks adimalla 2018 adimalla et al 2018a taiwo et al 2020 tomašek et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 in this study we evaluated both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks the non carcinogenic health risk was evaluated for ingestion of no3 fe2 zn2 cu2 pb2 cd2 cr6 and ni2 while the carcinogenic risks were evaluated for pb2 cd2 cr6 and ni2 to compute the non carcinogenic risk the chronic daily intake cdi was computed using eqn 4 shown

identification of hotspots vulnerable areas across the globe ijumulana et al 2020 2022 paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 singh and verma 2019 venkatramanan et al 2019 the relief elevation map of the study area was generated from the gis environment arcgis 10 1 the elevation data was downloaded from the united states geological survey s earth explorer website the elevation data was downloaded in a tile form a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem collected by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm a total of six 6 tiles were downloaded and mosaicked to generate the dem for the entire stretch of abeokuta formation in ogun state nigeria ordinary kriging interpolation methods were used to predict the spatial distribution of groundwater quality index and human health risk within the study area the ordinary kriging method assumes the overall distance and the degree of variation between sampled points and the overall area extent this is a major advantage against the inverse distance weighing method of geostatistical interpolation used by other studies lima et al 2019 nafyad and shankar 2018 shankar and nafyad 2019 zhang et al 2020 karami et al 2018 also affirmed that the kriging interpolation model is more accurate than other geostatistical methods based on their findings during cross validation of prediction errors of various geostatistical approaches kriging method uses a variation of output data layer surfaces such as prediction and prediction standard errors probability and quartile an empirical semi variogram is generated using the error mean model in eqn 8 8 ζ s o i 1 n λ i ζ s i where z so is the observed value of the water quality parameter at the sampled location λ is the unknown weight for a measured value at the sampled location s is the prediction location n is the number of measured values the human health risks assessment and water quality index results were prepared in a spreadsheet with the gps coordinate of the sampling points and imported into the arcgis environment the data were used for the kriging interpolation method to generate a spatial distribution of the health risks and water quality index the generated map serves as an indicator and guide in selecting suitable low risks sites and locations requiring remediation 2 4 1 gibbs plot and ficklin caboi diagram gibbs diagram depicts the features of groundwater sources and identifies significant water quality determinants geogenic activities or surface water intrusion the water quality testing results for sodium calcium chloride tds and bicarbonate for all sampling points were used to plot the gibbs plot the graph of na na ca was plotted against tds to determine the factors influencing the cation and the value of cl cl hco3 was plotted against tds for the anion mobilization of metals in the human body is influenced by ph at an acidic level zakir et al 2020 used the ficklin caboi diagram to classify groundwater quality and the level of metal loading in samples the classification of ph metal interaction promotes public health by emphasizing the importance of water treatment where necessary the concentrations of all the tested metals fe2 zn2 cu2 pb2 cd2 cr6 and ni2 were summed up and plotted against the ph of the water samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of water quality result the comparison of groundwater quality results against acceptable limits of a recognizable standard is the primary means of identifying water suitability for consumption the descriptive statistics and summary of water quality results for the three regions of the abeokuta formation is presented in tables 4 and 5 below generally water samples ph across the abeokuta formation regions ranges from slightly acidic to acceptable the percentage of samples with ph values below the lower boundary limit 6 5 established by who 2017 increases from 60 in the western region with a mean value of 6 49 table 4 below to 73 in the central region with a mean value of 6 26 it further reduced to 70 and 6 10 mean value in the eastern region the ph of groundwater indicates the ability to react with acidic or alkaline material and its mobility to react with metals in the water bodrud doza et al 2020 the acidic ph of the water sources corroborates the findings of adewumi et al 2016 on the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in uzebba area which falls within part of abeokuta formation in edo state nigeria ec across the three regions is very low with mean values 140 23 μs cm western 129 59 μs cm central and 120 12 μs cm eastern respectively ec of water reflects the dissolution of salts and organic pollution load in water wagh et al 2020 therefore low values of ec may be attributed to the low concentrations of dissolved ions in the water given that calcium magnesium sodium potassium sulfate and phosphate have extremely low concentrations across the three regions as shown in table 4 below high alkalinity content with mean values 105 98 mg l 165 43 mg l and 171 69 mg l were recorded in the western central and eastern regions respectively table 4 sixty 60 percent of sampled wells in the western region were above the 100 mg l limits these increased to 85 20 percent and 83 40 percent of sampled points in the central and eastern regions of the formation table 5 the alkalinity of water is the capacity of water to neutralize acid natural sources of alkalinity are the dissolution of co2 with rain water or groundwater in groundwater carbonate minerals dissolution process influences alkalinity content in water this is evident with the strong correlation western r2 0 84 central r2 0 95 eastern r2 0 52 that exists between bicarbonate and total alkalinity in the sampled water as shown in fig 3 a below high alkalinity groundwater was linked to the dissolution of calcite mineral combined with the ion exchange process by adithya et al 2016 the mean chloride content of water sources in western central and eastern regions are 164 02 mg l 153 94 mg l and 184 19 mg l respectively the eastern region of the formation has a significant rise in chloride content with 83 3 percent of sample locations having concentrations above the acceptable limit of 250 mg l by who western and central regions also have 10 percent and 8 60 percent of sample locations with chloride content above the acceptable limit hw indicate hand dug wells although ikhane et al 2012 and akintola et al 2012 asserted that rock minerals of the abeokuta formation are formed in a shallow near marine environment during the deposition process fig 3b above shows that na and cl in the three regions have no relationship this implies that elevated chloride in the water may be from urban runoffs road salt and anthropogenic activities alfaifi et al 2021 gaikwad et al 2022 instead of probable intrusion from the neighboring recent alluvium and coastal aquifer runoffs could be the probable source of the elevated chloride in the water since the sampling was conducted during the wet season with high rainfall frequency bicarbonate concentration in the water samples has mean values 201 14 mg l 325 61 mg l and 344 45 mg l in the western central and eastern regions respectively table 4 the percentage of sample locations with bicarbonate concentrations above the limit 200 mg l increased from the western 56 7 percent to the eastern regions of the formation 83 40 percent and the central region had the highest percentage 89 40 percent as shown in table 5 naturally elevated bicarbonate concentrations can be introduced in groundwater mainly through the dissolution of minerals with carbonate content or through the reaction of co2 with rainwater ismail et al 2020 sandstones the major aquifer in the study area are sediments bounded or cemented by either combination of silica calcium carbonate or iron oxide hence the dissolution process of carbonate minerals in the aquifer such as calcite could cause high bicarbonate concentration in the groundwater sources also abundant rainfall during the sampling period wet season could enhance the dissolution process in combination with the elevation difference the major deposition mechanism logarithmic bivariate plots of hco3 na vs ca na and mg na vs ca na have been used in recent studies to establish the hydrogeochemical activities weathering in aquifers gaikwad et al 2022 raychowdhury et al 2014 wagh et al 2018 2020 the bivariate plot of hco3 na vs ca na fig 3c and mg na vs ca na in fig 3d shows that carbonate weathering is predominant in sampled wells in the western region the central region has evaporite weathering combined with carbonate and silicate weathering in some water sources the eastern region of the formation has mainly silicate weathering and carbonate weathering in the sampled wells generally carbonate weathering and silicate weathering control the hydrochemistry in the aquifer which is enhanced by evaporite weathering through the interaction of carbonic acid and co2 generally the ion exchange process the presence of kaolinitic clay in the formation could infer that the kaolinization of silicate minerals could cause an enrichment of sio2 in the groundwater and thus the dominance of silicate weathering in parts of the formation as indicated in fig 3d also the process could further result in hco3 concentration through the composition of primary silicate adithya et al 2016 garrels 1967 the combination of natural bicarbonate in water and bicarbonate from silicate and calcite minerals may result in an enrichment of bicarbonate in groundwater adithya et al 2016 although this study did not analyze silicate among the parameters tested in the water sample geochemical analysis of the rock samples of abeokuta formation using x ray fluorescence by akintola et al 2012 found a high concentration of sio2 and an abundance of fe2co3 in the rock samples mean value of iron concentration in the water sample increased from the western 0 2433 mg l to the central region 1 1064 mg l and the highest mean was recorded in the eastern region 1 1176 mg l as shown in table 4 sample points with high iron content increased from the western region 37 percent to the central 56 70 percent in contrast all sample points in the eastern region recorded values above the limit of 0 03 mg l the observed iron concentration is considered normal as previous studies established that sandstone materials in the formation have high iron oxide and are named ferruginous akintola et al 2012 also iron oxide acts as the cementing material for the sediments during the process of deposition thus increasing towards the thinner low elevation part of the formation ikhane et al 2012 similarly lead and cadmium recorded a similar increase in concentration from western 23 percent and 20 percent to central 42 60 percent and 53 20 percent and the highest concentration in the eastern 63 40 percent and 60 percent region of the formation table 5 these trends are considered the influence of the geological mineral deposit across the entire abeokuta formation a significant fraction of lead in groundwater is undissolved and occurs as precipitates pbco3 pb2o and pbso4 or as suspended organic matter even at trace concentrations lead is a non essential element for humans and carcinogenic high amounts of lead can cause health problems such as kidney neurological and cardiovascular diseases alam et al 2020 high cadmium exposure from drinking water or inhalation induces cadmium deposition in the kidney resulting in kidney and renal damage chronic anemia the growth of mutagenic and malignant cells endocrine disruption and interference with calcium homeostasis are serious health consequences of cadmium exposure ali et al 2013 monika mahajan et al 2022 attributed high cadmium concentration in groundwater sources in punjab india to intensive industrialization extensive agricultural activities and landfill leachates in the global review anthropogenic pathways such as indiscriminate disposal of sewage sludge agricultural runoff combustion emission and leachates from landfill were emphasized as the major pathway of cadmium to groundwater troudi et al 2020 aside from the geogenic processes such as weathering of rocks and thermal vents studies have established that all rocks including sandstones have substantial cadmium content shale bearing geological units were reported with the highest cd content with an example in black shale pyrite perkins and mason 2015 tamoto et al 2015 linked the significant presence of cd in a sedimentary environment to the geologic unit authors further stated that sedimentary formations are naturally rich in metals therefore it can be inferred that the significant level of cd in the abeokuta formation is from a combination of geogenic and anthropogenic sources the elevated concentration of zinc in sampled water of both central and eastern regions were 19 4 percent and 6 7 percent as shown in table 5 zinc is essential to human health and its major source is drinking water and food sources of zinc in groundwater aside from geogenic processes weathering include waste incineration fossil fuels combustion of coals and runoff of worn rubber tyres chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 the elevated zinc in the central and eastern regions could be attributed to anthropogenic sources such as waste incineration and rubber tire wear runoff because the region comprises busy urban centers particularly areas like ijebu ode sagamu ikenne etc there is a high coliform load in water samples and the proportion of polluted well water increases from the western to the central and eastern regions of the abeokuta formation table 5 these might be due to bacterial contamination of runoff water that seeps into the groundwater table and wells during the rainy season elisante and muzuka 2016 attributed runoff seepage through conditions such as low well heads inadequate well casing and leaching during the rainy season to the coliform loading in the borehole and shallow wells in mount meru s slope in tanzania 3 2 water quality index the water quality index classifies water quality data to identify water s suitability for drinking the water quality in the three regions falls within three of the four classifications as shown in table 6 the percentage of water samples within the excellent category 25 decreased from the western region 23 3 percent to the central 8 5 percent and recorded the lowest in the eastern region 6 6 percent similarly the percentage of samples within the good water category 26 50 decreased from the western region 70 percent to the central 61 7 percent and had the lowest percentage in the eastern region 56 7 percent the percentage of acceptable water categories in the three regions was in reverse pattern compared to excellent and good water categories the western region had the lowest percentage 6 7 percent which increased to 29 8 percent in the central region while the eastern region had the highest percentage 36 7 percent western region has a mean wqi score of 34 while the central and eastern regions scored 44 as shown in table s1 in the supplementary document the modal wqi score for the three regions are 62 76 and 84 in the western central and eastern regions respectively based on the wqi result it could be inferred that all water sources sampled are fit for drinking purposes although the fitness slightly decreases towards the eastern part of the formation excellent good and acceptable water status are advised for drinking while unsuitable water quality status is generally fit for aesthetic purposes swain et al 2022a adopted the wqi to establish that 36 percent of groundwater sources in faridabad and gurgaon district of the indian national capital region have an unsuitable water quality with a maximum wqi score of 212 10 the wqi computation uses the results of physicochemical and nutrient analysis anion and cation adimalla et al 2020 ismail et al 2020 which is not exhaustive and should be combined with additional analysis such as metals health risks for a better understanding of the characteristics and safety status of the water sources 3 3 human health risks 3 3 1 non carcinogenic risks human health risk assessment is the best mathematical model for the assessment of non carcinogenic risks of water quality adimalla 2018 the health risks result is presented in table 7 the western region s minimum and maximum risks hi range from 0 22 to 2 40 respectively with a mean hi of 0 73 the minimum risk is recorded at ilara iii aiyetoro and ileniku wells and the maximum risk was recorded at imala ii twenty seven 27 percent of sample points in the western region recorded significant risks the central region has the least hi value of 0 01 recorded at owode egba ii and maximum risks value of 2 81 at odogbolu well with an average health risk of 0 69 twenty four percent of sample points in the central region recorded significant risks hi 1 the highest hi value of 8 14 is recorded in the eastern region at powerline well with a mean and minimum hi value of 1 75 and 0 06 respectively among all trace metals evaluated copper has the highest daily dosage risks based on median value and ranking per region the observed order of risk in the western cu zn pb fe no3 cd cr ni central regions have the order cd cu pb zn fe no3 cr ni the eastern region has an increasing order of cu cd pb zn fe no3 cr ni as shown in table s2 in supplementary document the variation observed in toxicity order of the parameters across the regions is traceable to the variations in the concentration of the parameters for instance the concentration of zinc in the western region may be lower than the established limits still they could be significantly higher than other parameters based on toxicity health risks also the general variation in the number of samples with elevated concentrations across the regions as shown in table 5 above could probably have an indirect link copper toxicity causes damage to the brain and kidneys as well as liver cirrhosis and intestinal inflammation in southwestern nigeria taiwo et al 2020 observed that bottled water had four times the copper toxicity of soft drinks alcoholic beverages malarial herbal mixtures and anti pile remedies this finding suggests that people who drink water from wells with significant risks within abeokuta formation untreated especially in the eastern region might experience a variety of ailments such as acute to chronic anaemia and neurotoxicity from excessive cadmium ingestion stomach pains nausea and vomiting from high zinc levels nyambura et al 2020 evaluated groundwater sources cancer and non carcinogenic risks in kilimambogo kenya the authors established that water sources in the region are heavily polluted and recorded a mean hazard index hi of 84 7 for metals cd ni and pb das et al 2020 studied the health risks of nitrate and metals in groundwater sources from the nadia district of west bengal and found four of the water sources with significant nitrate risks hi 1 similarly adimalla li 2019 recorded significant risks of fluoride and nitrate in groundwater sources in telangana state india 3 3 2 potential cancer risks analysis the cancer risks of groundwater sources in the abeokuta formation are presented in table 8 generally all sampled groundwater sources recorded no significant cancer risks hi 1 across the three regions of the abeokuta formation western central and eastern regions the possible contribution of the metals lead cadmium chromium and nickel to future cancer risks in regions of the abeokuta formation is presented in fig 4 lead was recorded as the highest in the western part of the formation with a score value of 7 88e 04 followed by cadmium 3 58e 04 chromium has the highest risk value 2 77e 03 in the central part of the abeokuta formation followed by lead 1 77e 03 also in the eastern region lead pb is the metal with the highest risk score 2 68e 03 followed by chromium 1 71e 03 this suggest that anthropogenic sources of lead cadmium and chromium such as mining smelting indiscriminate sewage and solid waste disposal waste incineration and intensive agricultural activities should be properly monitored to avoid future occurrences of cancer in groundwater users in the study area 3 4 spatial analysis this section presents the spatial analysis results of the elevation wqi and hi distribution in figs 5 7 the digital elevation model dem generated on the arcgis environment as described in section 2 3 3 is shown in fig 5 elevation across the regions of the abeokuta formation decreases from the western to the central and records the lowest level in the eastern region fig 5 these support the description of adebanija 2013 that the abeokuta formation thickens to the west and shows that the deposition process affects the geological unit s physical and chemical characteristics the spatial distribution of wqi fig 6 shows that the entire western region has good water quality including parts of the central region the interpolation model has a standardized root mean square rmss of 0 94 mean value of 0 67 and a standardized mean value of 0 04 which shows a slight minor overfitting in the model still rmss value proves that the prediction accuracy was high and acceptable twelve 12 sampled wells are within the acceptable water quality area 51 100 in the central region while ten 10 sampled wells are within the range in the eastern region of the formation the spatial distribution of wqi in fig 6 conforms with the wqi result the water quality reduces slightly in the eastern direction these further suggest that the elevation pattern affects the wqi outcomes in the study area the spatial analysis result of non carcinogenic risks hazard index hi of groundwater sources in the abeokuta formation is presented in fig 7 the map showing the spatial distribution of hi fig 7 classified hi into very low 0 5 low 0 5 0 75 moderate 0 75 1 and high risks hi 1 to observe the distribution of non carcinogenic risk within the study area the interpolation model has an acceptable accuracy with rmss of 0 92 the mean value of 0 04 and the standardized mean value of 0 03 the central region has the highest number of sampled wells within a very low non carcinogenic risks area 18 followed by the western region 5 in contrast the eastern region has no predicted very low risks areas the numbers of sampled well within low risks areas in the western central and eastern regions were 14 13 and 4 respectively also the number of wells within moderate risks area were 8 5 and 3 in western central and eastern regions respectively the western region has the least number of wells within high non carcinogenic risk areas 3 which increased to 10 wells in the central region the eastern region has the highest number of sampled wells within high risks areas which is evident from the result in table 7 generally high non carcinogenic risk coverage spread increases from western to central and eastern regions significant areas with high non carcinogenic risks in the western region are imala olorunda and ayetoro the results imply that groundwater within the area is unsuitable for consumption without appropriate remediation the most suitable areas for groundwater exploitation with relatively no health consequences are obada afon idi emi alagbede imeko and ileniku in the western region adedero debore ooba laloko kobape akogun ofada and part of ajura in the central region all wells within the low risk to moderate risks areas are considered suitable for drinking purposes including imodi imosan ososa new market and new garage in the eastern region the eastern region of the formation has the highest non carcinogenic risks which can be attributed to the combination of geogenic deposition process and anthropogenic activities the high risk observed in the western region imala aiyetoro and olorunda may be traced to the high cu content of the sample as shown in table s2 in the supplementary document likewise the very low risk observed in the central region ooba and laloko could be attributed to variation in the mineral deposition within the aquiferous unit 3 5 identification of major pollution sources in abeokuta formation the result of major pollution drivers within abeokuta formation using the gibbs plot is presented in fig 8 the result of the gibbs graph indicates that all sample points fall within the rock dominance region of the graph for both na na ca2 against total dissolved solids and cl cl hco3 against total dissolved solids although the sample points tend a little to the precipitation dominance direction rather than the seawater direction indicating that seasonal precipitation changes could influence the water quality status the water quality testing result ionic classification spatial analysis results and the health risks analysis including map substantiate the result of the gibbs plot analysis the results further confirm that the groundwater quality of all water sources sampled is mainly controlled by the mineralogical characteristics of the rock material adewumi et al 2016 affirmed that the mineralogical characteristics of rock minerals primarily controlled the groundwater quality of the uzebba part of the abeokuta formation the dissolution of metals in groundwater is partly controlled by the ph this made the classification of water by ficklin caboi diagram essential for a better understanding of water chemistry the chemistry of groundwater sources in the abeokuta formation is dominated by four metal loading groups according to the ficklin caboi diagram fig 9 the acid low metal group had the lowest percentage 19 percent followed by acid high metal 22 percent while both near neutral low metal and low neutral high metal had 24 percent and 35 percent respectively the variation in percentage was expected due to the spatial variation in the concentration of parameters still it could be inferred that most wells within the study area have high metal loading demonstrating their strong mobility in the aqueous state and supporting the result of non carcinogenic hazards zakir et al 2020 reported groundwater sources with low to high metal loading and near neutral ph in bangladesh indicating their low mobility in an aqueous condition 3 6 geogenic groundwater pollution implications for water security and sdg 6 several countries including nigeria are struggling to meet the sustainable development goals sdg target 6 of providing safe water to citizens suggesting that achieving a water secure world requires concerted effort in nigeria lack of access to safe drinking water via public water supply system stems from the poor infrastructural provision of state and national governments this has led to the reliance on groundwater systems as the primary means for meeting drinking domestic and agricultural water demands oluwasanya et al 2022 used the national water security index to analyze the water security status in africa and observed that more than half of african countries remain water insecure and have made little improvement in the last five years the report also highlighted the paucity of data on water sanitation and hygiene from most countries including nigeria although groundwater is not officially addressed in the sdg objectives guppy et al 2018 argued that sustainable groundwater management must achieve the goals notably target 6 united nations 2022 report on world water development explicitly attribute sustainable groundwater management to poverty eradication promotion of a resilient climate and socio economic development the overuse of groundwater resources has resulted in aquifer overburdening and the decline of worldwide aquifer water levels u s geological survey 2017 groundwater scarcity might become the next major water security issue particularly in areas where public water supplies are unavailable or in limited supply therefore it would be more difficult to achieve the sdg goals without adequate attention including institutional frameworks to ensure proper management of the global groundwater system united nations 2022 while water availability is essential to water security water quality is more critical especially since water borne diseases account for 80 of all human diseases das and nag 2015 the importance of water security is not limited to access to drinking water free from pathogens that might cause immediate health complications but access to a water source free from pollutants with probable short term or long term health consequences cases of groundwater pollution from both geogenic and anthropogenic sources vary globally for instance this study inferred that the inhabitants of parts of abeokuta formation with significant non cancer risks particularly eastern region are liable to encounter diverse health challenges due to the poor water quality in the area and lack of access to alternative water sources furthermore the establishment of geogenic process as the major driver of pollution in the aquifer suggests that immediate remediation measures are essential particularly to facilitate the realization of sdg target 6 and fulfilment of the leave no one behind agenda in addition das et al 2020 stated that 33 of all groundwater sources of the worlds largest groundwater user india is not fit for drinking the study also observed that the water quality of 66 percent of west bengal s water sources is unsuitable an assessment of over 800 wells in northern germany conducted by riedel et al 2022 found high concentrations of metals such as manganese in over half of all wells and uranium concentrations exceeding the german standard in over 10 of the studied wells riedel and kübeck 2018 also investigated 8000 chemicals from 2000 groundwater sources in germany and discovered that ph e c and alkalinity predominantly govern groundwater redox reactions and metal concentration owing to weathering of rock minerals which varies based on geological units the challenge however is where the line should be drawn between geogenic and anthropogenic contributions of pollutants especially metals studies have reported the contributions of naturally occurring metals in rocks to the quality of groundwater amadi et al 2015 chandrasekar et al 2021 dedzo et al 2017 smedley and kinniburgh 2017 vetrimurugan et al 2017 the questions begging for answers are when when does the pollution start how much number of pollutants and what to do what could be done to stem occurrence for the question of when no specific date could be tied to the commencement of metal pollution of groundwater the pollution probably starts immediately rocks meet groundwater a process that could be constant unless a seasonal variation in climate influence groundwater flow regarding how much heavy metal contribution to pollution directly from rocks is difficult to determine assessment of groundwater quality probably gives a combined contribution mostly where anthropogenic contributions are easily delineated such as waste dump sites typically the establishment of contributions of rocks to metal pollution of groundwater and the addition from anthropogenic sources paints a clear picture that groundwater pollution would continue though some of these metals are needed in the human body in limited amounts consumptions at toxic thresholds are detrimental so what then can be done continuous periodic monitoring remains the only path to redeeming groundwater quality even though groundwater quality monitoring may be achieved only at government institutional levels because of the monetary implications the range of groundwater pathogens is in exhaustive but metals remain one of the most critical pollutants due to their severe health implications the emergence of micropollutants with broad categories of pathogens and diverse severe health implications including cancers and endocrine disruption have gained the attention of researchers k oreje et al 2016 pico et al 2019 wee and aris 2019 however their concentration in the environment is lesser than metals which has similar severe health implications organs disruption development of malignant cells etc higher bioavailability and higher chances of uptake through diverse sources including groundwater therefore sustainable groundwater management is essential for public health protection and promotes sustainable development goal 6 4 conclusion this study assessed the water quality evaluated the suitability and mapped the distribution to identify the major pollution source of groundwater samples in the cretaceous abeokuta formation ogun state nigeria the formation stretch within ogun state was divided into three regions and 107 well samples were collected for detailed analysis and suitability evaluation the water quality testing results show that the percentage of sample points with high ph chloride bicarbonate lead iron cadmium and e coli increased from the western to the central and recorded the highest percentage in the eastern region of the formation the dominant hydrogeochemical process in the aquifer responsible for the enrichment of anions was the combination of carbonate weathering silicate weathering and ion exchange processes during aquifer recharge wqi result showed that all water samples are within the acceptable drinking water range with a slight decrease in total percentage towards the eastern region of the formation meanwhile the non carcinogenic risk result showed that significant risks hi 1 of sample points increase from the western to central and eastern regions suggesting probable acute to severe health impact if consumed long term without proper treatment the contribution of parameters to non cancer risks varies as followed cu zn pb fe no3 cd cr ni in western cd cu pb zn fe no3 cr ni in central and cu cd pb zn fe no3 cr ni in eastern regions although all sample points have no significant cancer risks metals like lead cadmium and chromium are flagged for monitoring in wells with significant non cancer risks across the formation the spatial pattern analysis showed that the dem map wqi and the shape of the formation increased from western to eastern region suggesting a contribution from the geological deposition process spatial maps of non carcinogenic risks showed that the core central and upper western regions have the lowest risks most wells in the eastern region and the low elevation part of the central region have high risks gibbs and ficklin caboi plots showed that the groundwater quality status is dominated by rock weathering activities and has high metal loading the findings in this study established that the mineral composition of the aquifer in abeokuta formation primarily influenced the status of groundwater sources and poses significant health risks to the water users in parts of the formation therefore groundwater sources in the central and most parts of the western region are recommended to be suitable for drinking given the coverage of the eastern region drastic measures must be taken to remediate the pollution level to avoid future or and near future consequences furthermore this study has proven that the realization of the sdg 6 target in the eastern region of the study area will require an immediate drastic measures finally low cost water treatment techniques such as activated carbon biochar bio coagulants such as kenaf hibiscus and metal remediation technologies are recommended

11772,aquifers providing groundwater for agriculture are in many cases unsustainably managed resulting in environmental degradation and socioeconomic impacts in this context strategies that contribute to recovering groundwater reserves and satisfactorily maintaining irrigation are essential los arenales aquifer spain experienced a dramatic decline in groundwater level in the last quarter of the 20th century due to intensive agricultural abstractions we assess whether this aquifer has recovered in recent years and the potential contribution of managed aquifer recharge mar we evaluate the significance of groundwater level trends and their magnitude through the regional mann kendall test and the theil sen estimator we also calculate the average groundwater level and explore factors that could influence the observed trends such as mar land use agricultural water demand and water management measures we also contrast two groundwater management regions located within los arenales aquifer namely los arenales la which has implemented mar and medina del campo mc to obtain further insight into groundwater development the hydro statistical analyses reveal a continuous drop in groundwater levels of about 1 3 m year in la between 1985 and 2001 followed by a consistent recovery in mc groundwater levels decrease in two out of three analysis periods we show that mar is spatially and temporally correlated with increasing groundwater level trends land use agricultural water demand and water management measures have remained similar throughout the analysis period or have a limited impact on groundwater use furthermore the only significant water management measure mc differs from la is mar these pieces of evidence point to mar as the primary mechanism for replenishing los arenales aquifer showing the potential of this tool to recover stressed aquifers and sustain irrigation in the area and beyond graphical abstract image 1 keywords managed aquifer recharge mar hydrogeology trend analysis field significance irrigation 1 introduction groundwater is vital globally it meets the water needs of around two billion people gleeson et al 2012 and contributes to irrigating more than 43 of the global irrigated land a percentage that is expected to increase in the future hanjra and qureshi 2010 however groundwater s low visibility has resulted in large overdrafts in many regions leading to unsustainable groundwater development and hence aquifer overexploitation alley 2002 custodio 2002 famiglietti 2014 gleeson et al 2012 konikow and kendy 2005 this problem is particularly tangible in some aquifers that sustain large scale agriculture such as the upper ganges india pakistan the north arabian saudi arabia the central valley usa and the canning basin australia famiglietti 2014 gleeson et al 2012 in spain groundwater irrigation represents 27 of the 33 000 km2 of total irrigated land and offers a much higher socioeconomic efficiency in terms of m3 and jobs m3 than supply based surface water irrigation aldaya et al 2010 garrido et al 2006 many aquifers in spain are considered overexploited or highly stressed due to unsustainable irrigation llamas et al 2015 rupérez moreno et al 2017 van loon and van lanen 2013 one significant example of these aquifers is los arenales located on the spanish side of the douro river basin throughout the second half of the xx century this region witnessed a rapid increase in groundwater based irrigation state supports such as low interest loans tax exemptions and technological innovations that made it possible to extract water from greater depths attracted agricultural entrepreneurs llamas et al 2015 baraja rodríguez 2012 this socioeconomic context resulted in extensive unregulated groundwater exploitation which was reflected in widespread drawdowns throughout los arenales where groundwater levels dropped by up to 27 m between 1972 and 2002 fernández escalante et al 2016 this evident crisis and the imminent implementation of the water framework directive wfd european parliament and council of the european union 2000 forced the local water management authorities and farmers to change their view on water resources toward sustainability baraja rodríguez 2012 llamas and garrido 2007 soto garcía et al 2013 consequently farmers in los arenales promoted the construction of managed aquifer recharge mar systems to maintain groundwater irrigation resulting in el carracillo santiuste and pedrajas alcazarén mar sites in 2002 2003 and 2012 fernández escalante et al 2016 mapa 1998 mar is a technique to recharge and store water in aquifers intentionally the additional water stored can be used for various purposes dillon 2009a 2019 and can contribute to tackling a variety of water related issues such as saltwater intrusion werner and simmons 2009 some of the effects of climate change fernández escalante et al 2019b and groundwater contamination scanlon et al 2005 among others some studies have evaluated the regional effect of mar systems on aquifers stressed by agriculture most of these studies show that mar is significant to a local extent with a net depletion of storage at the regional level furthermore they highlight that mar is not a panacea and requires additional strategies e g surface and groundwater conjunctive use and demand control to improve the quantity of groundwater in overexploited aquifers effectively dillon et al 2009b thomas and famiglietti 2015 scanlon et al 2016 wendt et al 2020 however some authors report a net positive effect of implementing mar jadhav et al 2021 bachtouli and comte 2019 several studies have explored the effect of the mar sites on los arenales aquifer these studies have focused on hydrogeological conama 2019 socioeconomic fernández escalante et al 2016 governance fernández escalante and lópez gunn 2021 climate change fernández escalante et al 2019b henao casas et al 2022 and technical fernández escalante and prieto leache 2013 fernández escalante and san sebastian sauto 2019a marsol 2015 aspects however none of them has analysed the evolution of groundwater levels and water use dynamics on a regional scale the main goal of the present study is to determine whether los arenales aquifer has recovered in recent years and if so to elucidate the contribution of mar our approach involves collecting evidence using different statistical methods and evaluating socioeconomic dynamics that might affect groundwater development we analyse local and regional groundwater level trends and average groundwater levels we also conduct analyses of agricultural water demand land use and cropping patterns and water management measures additionally we contrast two groundwater management regions that are part of los arenales aquifer and underwent a similar storage depletion in the second half of the xx century still they seem to have evolved significantly differently in the last decade this study is one of the few to evaluate the effect of large scale operational mar systems furthermore to the best of our knowledge a comprehensive evaluation involving long term groundwater data monitoring and mar in the agricultural context has only been carried out in the central valley aquifer wendt et al 2020 and the coastal korba aquifer tunisia bachtouli and comte 2019 therefore this study constitutes the first assessment in europe it also presents a comprehensive approach to assessing the impact of water management measures in areas with hydrogeological and socioeconomic complexity in this case heterogeneity and compartmentalisation of the aquifer systems and the lack of long term agricultural and groundwater abstraction data that represent large uncertainties for numerical models precluding their use 2 methodology 2 1 case study background the study area is located in the autonomous community of castile and leon 94 224 km2 central spain it extends over a flat area on the central plateau of the douro river basin fig 1 the region s climate is continental mediterranean and is characterised by long cold winters average temperature about 3 6 c and short mild summers average temperature about 19 22 c segovia cardozo et al 2019 average precipitation and evapotranspiration are respectively 395 mm and 1129 most of the precipitation occurs between october and may agriculture in the region is the primary land use and occupies 70 of the land irrigation represents about 25 of total agricultural land and consumes 98 of total groundwater abstraction cereals are the main crops covering about 55 of the total agricultural land and representing nearly 30 of the irrigated land rivas tabares et al 2019 wheat and barley predominate in the region other representative crops are sugar beets and sunflowers in hydrogeological terms los arenales aquifer entails two main systems the first system comprises phreatic aquifers in shallow thickness quaternary deposits 10 m the second system involves lenticular and elongated bodies of sand and gravel embedded in an impermeable to semipermeable matrix of silt clay and to a minor extent gypsum antón et al 2012 fernández escalante et al 2016 navarro alvargonzález et al 1993 this system is part of the paleogene neogene fill of the douro river basin and reaches maximum depths 1000 m towards the basin s centre igme 2009 the connection among permeable units and between both aquifer systems is complex in some locations it has been observed that adjacent high porosity bodies separated by a few tens of meters are hydraulically disconnected recharge in the shallow system is due to precipitation and in a lower proportion to the surface drainage network and irrigation returns the deep aquifer system replenishes from the phreatic aquifers through deep percolation and poorly constructed wells that connect both systems fernández escalante 2004 the groundwater flow in los arenales aquifer is directed to the douro river and has a predominant north northeast direction in 2005 los arenales aquifer was subdivided into several groundwater bodies following the wfd requirements these groundwater bodies are groundwater management regions that facilitate assessing and managing groundwater resources their borders can obey factors beyond hydrogeology chd 2007 we focus on los arenales la 2398 km2 and medina del campo mc 3707 km2 groundwater bodies which are part of los arenales aquifer 7700 km2 fig 1 and extend predominantly over the avila segovia and valladolid provinces the differentiation of la and mc as two separate groundwater bodies is mostly administrative in fact no authors have pointed out significant hydrogeological differences between them there are three large scale mar sites in la namely santiuste el carracillo and pedrajas alcazarén fig 1 they extend over large areas through channels infiltration basins and artificial wetlands that recharge the shallow aquifer system marsol 2015 some tests have been conducted to implement mar in mc douglas et al 2019 however the mar system is not operative and is therefore not considered in the present study the main objective of mar in la is to reverse groundwater depletion and ensure local irrigation needs santiuste and el carracillo recharge river water surpluses during winter while alcazarén pedrajas recharges reclaimed water and rooftop runoff throughout the year fernández escalante et al 2016 the average annual volume of mar in la is 5 mm3 more details of the mar systems are available in the report by fernández escalante et al 2016 2 2 theoretical background 2 2 1 mann kendall test the mann kendall mk test kendall 1970 mann 1945 is a rank based nonparametric test that assesses the significance of a time series trend helsel and hirsch 2002 the mk test has the advantage that it is not restricted to any data distribution is less sensitive to outliers hamed 2008 and is invariant when using power transformations e g logarithms and squares helsel and frans 2006 when conducting a mk test typically the null hypothesis h 0 is that the data sample is independent and identically distributed the alternative hypothesis h 1 is that the data sample has a monotonic trend yue et al 2002 the s statistic of the mk test also known as kendall s s is provided in expression 1 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where n is the sample size sgn is the signal function 2 and x i and x j are the data samples i and j respectively 2 sgn θ 1 i f θ 0 0 i f θ 0 1 i f θ 0 mann 1945 and kendall 1970 have shown that when n 8 the kendall s s have an approximately normal distribution with mean and variance given in 3 and 4 respectively 3 e s 0 4 v s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 n t i i i 1 2 i 5 18 where e s is the expected value of s v s is the variance of s and t i is the number of ties of extent i a standardised test statistic z can be calculated as follows 5 5 z s 1 v s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v s s 0 the standardised mk z statistic fits a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one yue et al 2002 2 2 2 serial autocorrelation and pre whitening one crucial aspect of the mk test is that it works best on autocorrelation free time series helsel and hirsch 2002 von storch 1999 and yue et al 2002 have shown that when testing a linear trend on a series with positive autocorrelation there is a higher probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true type i error on the other hand negative autocorrelated time series can result in fewer rejections of the null hypothesis when it is false type ii error the probability of these errors is reduced through pre whitening which implies diminishing the serial autocorrelation before performing the mk test hamed 2008 a relevant example of pre whitening is the trend free pre whitening procedure tfpw by yue et al 2002 which involves removing the ar 1 component from the original time series to reduce the absolute value of the autocorrelation 2 2 3 theil sen estimator the theil sen estimator sen 1968 theil 1992 is a slope estimator commonly employed in hydrological trend analysis it consists of the median of the slope through all pairs of points in the data sample 6 6 b median y j y i x j x i j i x and y are independent variables e g time and dependent variables e g groundwater level respectively 2 2 4 field significance field significance refers to the significance of regional behaviour and can be derived from local statistical tests douglas et al 2000 renard et al 2008 thomas and famiglietti 2015 regional trends in groundwater levels can be estimated using field significance methods one of such methods is the regional kendall test helsel and frans 2006 which is adequate to use when local groundwater level time series are not spatially cross correlated in this test the values of local kendall s s are added resulting in a regional kendall s s 7 7 s r i 1 m s i s r is the regional kendall s s m is the number of observation sites e g wells and si is the kendall s s of the ith observation site the variance of the regional kendall s s is computed utilising expression 8 8 v s r i 1 m n i 18 n i 1 2 n i 5 the distribution of s r can also be approximated quite well by a normal curve when m 25 helsel and frans 2006 and the z statistic can be estimated using equation 5 where s and v s are substituted for s r and v s r when cross correlation is present in the groundwater level time series the local hypotheses are not independent and the regional kendall test is invalid an alternative in these cases is the empirical approach by douglas et al 2000 which uses the bootstrapping method efron 1979 to obtain kendall s s samples with replacement the size of each sample equals the size of the original dataset i e n and the sampled s values correspond to those computed at each location subsequently an average kendall s s is calculated following expression 9 9 s a i 1 n s i n where s a is the average kendall s s and s i is kendall s s at the ith location this procedure is repeated n times and the empirical distribution of the probability of non exceedance of s a is found by ranking the obtained values of s a through a weibull function 10 10 p s a s r n 1 where p is the probability of non exceedance and r is the rank 2 3 approach we analysed groundwater level trends on local and regional scales and average regional groundwater levels to explore whether groundwater storage in los arenales aquifer has recovered over time these analyses also allowed us to assess spatially and temporally the potential contribution of the mar systems to the observed groundwater behaviour we also evaluated changes in land use agricultural water demand as a function of crop groups the contribution of different irrigation methods and water management measures to assess their effect on aquifer groundwater storage 2 3 1 local groundwater level trends we performed the mk test for linear trend analysis in la and mc with a significance level of 0 05 z 1 96 considering that the test is two tailed first we pre whitened the observations utilising the tfpw method subsequently we applied the original mk test to the resulting time series however in cases in which groundwater monitoring sites had a considerable number of observations 50 and the slope magnitude was large enough 0 0005 we applied the mk test without performing any pre whitening yue and wang 2002 we considered only groundwater monitoring sites with at least five years of continuous groundwater level records given the substantial interannual climatic variability in the region gonzález hidalgo et al 2010 this filtering criterion reduced the number of appropriate groundwater monitoring sites to 35 in la and 58 in mc 57 and 60 of the original number of groundwater monitoring sites respectively minor gaps 2 records in the time series were filled using linear interpolation wendt et al 2020 in some groundwater level time series linear interpolation was also used to resample groundwater levels to have a consistent time interval between contiguous observations the slope magnitudes were computed on pre whitened time series through the theil sen estimator we obtained groundwater level observations from the public database of the duero hydrographic confederation chd which currently has 61 groundwater monitoring sites in la and 97 in mc fig 1 the available groundwater level observations span from 1985 to 2020 with a measurement frequency that changes over time based on that frequency we subdivided the data and the trend analysis into three periods that coincide with significant changes concerning the mar sites i period 1985 2001 which has a biannual measuring frequency and represents the situation before the implementation of mar ii period 2002 2011 which features monthly groundwater level observations and entails the official inauguration of santiuste 2002 and el carracillo 2003 mar sites iii period 2012 2020 which has a bimonthly measuring rate and involves the start of mar in the pedrajas alcazarén mar site 2012 visual examples of some of the groundwater level time series from la and mc and their corresponding trends are provided by henao casas et al 2022 considering a single period between 2002 and 2020 was tempting to assess trends after mar however we split this interval into two since the mk test requires a consistent sampling frequency preliminary tests showed a change in the sign of some trends between the second and third periods considered i e 2002 2011 and 2012 2020 and there are data gaps of up to a year in many groundwater monitoring sites between 2011 and 2013 2 3 2 regional groundwater level trends the groundwater observation sites in the study area have a minor degree of cross correlation as a result of the high heterogeneity of the aquifer however cross correlation cannot be conclusively ruled out therefore we assessed regional groundwater level trends through the field significance methods of the regional kendall test and the empirical approach by douglas et al 2000 we applied the two procedures to local trends in la mc and both groundwater bodies la mc considering a significance level of 0 05 z 1 96 since the test is two tailed in the approach by douglas et al 2000 we computed the empirical distribution of the probability of non exceedance by repeating the bootstrap method 10 000 times n 10 000 2 3 3 average regional groundwater level we estimate the annual average groundwater levels for la and mc using available groundwater level observations we considered only groundwater monitoring sites with continuous observations between 1985 and 2001 and between 2002 and 2022 to avoid artificial values in the constructed average groundwater levels caused by the introduction of new data in between intervals the average groundwater levels obtained were graphically compared with annual precipitation and mar volumes we obtained precipitation data from two main sources between 1985 and 2002 the main source of daily rainfall records was the spanish meteorological agency aemet stations with data spanning in some cases nearly 100 years between 2002 and 2020 we used daily precipitation data from the aemet and inforiego stations at the site fig 1 we summed daily precipitation values to obtain annual precipitation for each of the three analysis periods we constructed thiessen polygons thiessen 1911 with the available data in the area comprised of la and mc and constructed a single time series of annual precipitation we added mar volumes from the mar sites to get a single time series mar volumes from santiuste el carracillo and pedrajas alcazarén were provided by the santiuste irrigation community el carracillo irrigation community and the pedrajas wastewater treatment plant we recalculated volumes from hydrological years to calendar years based on precipitation percentages there are uncertainties in the exact mar volumes of two years in 2002 there was some mar as part of the system testing however the exact infiltrated volume is unknown in 2005 the water metering device in the santiuste water conveyance pipe broke and the reported infiltrated volume 1 3 mm3 was lower than the actual one 2 3 4 land use and irrigation methods land use was analysed at general and detailed levels at the general level we checked changes in major land use categories namely artificial surfaces agriculture forest and semi natural areas wetlands and water bodies at the detailed level we evaluated changes in irrigated agricultural land land use changes between 2005 and 2014 were evaluated through the spanish land occupation information system siose inventory available in 2005 2009 2011 and 2014 siose 2022 changes between 1990 and 2006 were explored through corine land cover which in the above period has data for 1990 2000 and 2006 corine land cover is a land cover inventory based on satellite images clc 2022 we analysed irrigated land in terms of irrigation methods in castile and leon and the provinces of avila segovia and valladolid between 2002 and 2018 using data from the crop area and yield survey esyrce of the ministry of agriculture fishery and food mapa 2021 we explored three primary irrigation methods namely gravity aspersion including fixed and moving sprinklers and localised irrigation including dripping irrigation 2 3 5 agricultural water demand we estimated the annual agricultural water demand for each groundwater body the objective was to explore the possible impacts of different crop groups on water use we calculated the total irrigated land for each crop group in la by adding the contribution of municipalities located within this groundwater body we obtained the required data from the agricultural statistics of the castile and leon board junta de castilla y león 2022 including information for more than 70 crops comprehended in six crop groups namely cereals industrial crops fodder crops legumes vegetables and tubers data were available between 2010 and 2020 we performed the same procedure for mc subsequently we estimated the average irrigation volumes applied to each crop group using data on the water use per hectare for 17 crops in the adaja river irrigation district and el carracillo we obtained this water use information from the inforiego crop monitoring program inforiego 2020 available between 2011 and 2018 we multiplied the total land surface of each crop group by its corresponding average irrigation volumes finally crop group irrigation volumes were added to estimate annual agricultural water demand we compared our estimate of annual agricultural water demand with the chd assessment which is available in the 2015 2022 douro river basin management plan and its revision reports chd 2021 2020 2019 2018b 2017 2015 3 results 3 1 local groundwater level trends the application of the tfpw method effectively reduced the autocorrelation of the groundwater level time series by around 30 on average most groundwater level trends 100 in the period 1985 2001 were significantly negative fig 2 a and b attesting to a rapid decrease in groundwater storage in los arenales aquifer this decrease occurred at average rates of 1 5 m year in la and 0 6 m year in mc fig 3 in the following period 2002 2011 significant trends decreased in terms of the number of groundwater monitoring sites tested 75 in la and 60 in mc the resulting significant trends are evenly distributed between increasing and decreasing fig 2 c and d and the slope magnitudes are nearly 0 m year on average fig 3 positive trends in la are in the vicinity of the santiuste and pedrajas alcazarén mar sites the positive trends with small slopes found in mc fig 2 c are possibly the result of changing crop types since the main water source for irrigation remained groundwater and no significant changes in land use were detected the final period 2012 2020 is characterised by a lower proportion of significant trends around 50 of all groundwater monitoring sites tested and a contrasting behaviour between la and mc in la roughly three quarters of the detected trends are positive while the opposite is true in mc fig 2 c the magnitude of negative trends is more prominent in mc with an average value of 0 5 m y fig 4 such trends cluster to the west fig 3 c where large volumes of groundwater are abstracted for irrigation in la positive trends can be observed in the vicinity of pedrajas alcazarén and santiuste mar sites fig 3 c in both cases the trends are probably the result of mar and some irrigation returns derived from the cega river trends in the surroundings of the adaja river irrigation district changed from significantly negative in 2002 2011 to significantly positive in 2012 2020 this transformation is the result of shifting groundwater to surface water through el castro de las cogotas dam as the main irrigation water source in 2010 borowiecka et al 2019 naroua et al 2014 3 2 regional groundwater level trends no field significance was detected in any studied regions by the empirical method of douglas et al 2000 table 1 presumably due to the disparity in trend signs and the lower proportion of significant local trends regarding the number of analysed groundwater monitoring sites the regional kendall test was not computed for the periods 1985 2001 and 2002 2011 since the number of available time series was below the minimum required by the method i e 26 in the period 2012 2020 the regional kendall test results in a positive regional groundwater level trend in la and a negative regional trend in mc table 1 supporting a regional recovery of groundwater levels in the former groundwater body and further deterioration of subsurface water resources in the latter in the same period no field significance was detected for the region that comprises la and mc likely as a consequence of opposing trends at monitoring sites 3 3 average regional groundwater level average groundwater levels attest to the storage decline perceived in the region between 1985 and 2001 the decline is more pronounced in la 1 1 m year than in mc 0 8 m year where groundwater levels seem to stabilise between 1995 and 2001 since rainfall in these years is above average fig 4 in la groundwater levels start to increase at some point between 2001 and 2004 and remain in a recovery trend of 0 4 m year in mc there is also a recovery in groundwater levels between 2004 and 2013 followed by a steep fall and a decreasing trend fig 4 however in mc it seems possible that a decreasing trend started as early as 2008 and that the level computed for 2013 is out of the trend and due to high precipitation and low agricultural water demand fig 7 c the slope of the average groundwater level in mc between 2004 and 2020 is 0 6 m year in both groundwater bodies there seems to be a significant correlation between groundwater levels and precipitation fig 4 in years with considerably low precipitation such as 2017 groundwater levels also show a decline reflecting the high dependence of los arenales aquifer on precipitation despite the high anthropisation in the region intentional recharge volumes correlate positively with precipitation fig 4 the implementation of mar corresponds to the start of the increasing trend in la 3 4 land use agricultural land remained constant in la 53 or 1250 km2 and mc 86 or 3150 km2 between 1990 and 2014 fig 5 there are differences in absolute 100 km2 and percentage 5 7 in terms of total agricultural land use and up to 128 percentage difference in irrigated land in mc values between corine land cover and siose due to the different approaches these programs utilise to categorise land use irrigation increased at varying rates in both groundwater bodies between 1990 and 2014 in the period 1990 2000 there was a notable increase of 128 of irrigated land in mc and a more discrete increase of 14 in la fig 5 from 2000 on irrigated land increased by minor percentages 1 4 except between 2011 and 2014 when it expanded by 29 in la relative to 2005 fig 5 between 2002 and 2018 sprinklers remained the most common irrigation method in avila segovia and valladolid i e the provinces that comprise the majority of la and mc employed in 88 of the irrigated land 1115 km2 in this region the adoption of localised irrigation which is the most water efficient method was discrete in terms of the total irrigated area in avila segovia and valladolid passing from 2 24 km2 in 2002 to 14 199 km2 in 2018 fig 6 a in castile and leon irrigation modernisation had a greater impact between 2002 and 2018 the adoption of gravity methods decreased 47 1104 km2 in favour of sprinkler 47 974 km2 and localised irrigation 368 253 km2 fig 6 b 3 5 agricultural water demand in 2018 the most extended crop group in la and mc was cereals present in more than 50 of the land fig 7 a the crops in this group such as wheat and barley consume the lowest water volumes fig 7 a in the same year vegetables and tubers which consume the most water on average had an important extension in la i e 20 and 11 respectively fig 5 a the extension of some crop groups shows high interannual variation and in some cases trends between 2010 and 2018 the extension of vegetable crops in la which require substantial amounts of water has encroached on the contrary less water intensive crops such as cereals were progressively more adopted in mc the trend is the opposite the land extension under fodder and vegetable crops which require more water than cereals increased between 2010 and 2018 at the same time agricultural land with cereal crops decreased however the increased adoption of industrial crops and legumes in la and the decrease in the extension of legumes in mc compensate for the above effect and result in nearly constant agricultural water demand for irrigation on average 86 mm3 year in la and 225 mm3 year in mc between 2010 and 2020 fig 7 b at least between 2009 and 2015 the chd calculated agricultural groundwater demands based on the irrigation groundwater rights allocated on the alberca system which is probably why our estimations differ on an annual time scale the difference in the average between both estimates is exceedingly small for mc 2 and large for la 30 the cause of the significant difference in the latter groundwater body is likely that we include in our calculation land that is being irrigated with surface water in the adaja river irrigation district the same error occurs in mc but the adaja river irrigation district has a smaller share of the land in this groundwater body fig 8 is a qualitative assessment of the results of the analysis conducted the qualitative assessment is made for each analysis period and groundwater body and consists of assigning a category out of four possible indicating the actual or likely impact on groundwater storage increasing decreasing neutral and not assessed we considered designating the increasing category for the analyses involving groundwater levels when the results indicate an increase in this variable in the case of land use we assumed that increasing the area under irrigation we selected 5 as a threshold can result in higher abstractions and thus a decrease in storage decreasing category concerning the irrigation method wider adoption of technologies that save water sprinkler and drip irrigation would likely decrease abstractions and thus indicate an increase increasing category in groundwater storage the opposite categories are assigned when groundwater water levels decline irrigated land decreases or the use of the less water efficient technologies increases fig 8 shows that the main difference between la and occurs in the last period 2012 2020 when positive slopes and increasing trends at the regional and local levels imply an increase in groundwater storage in la and a decrease in mc this qualitative analysis also shows that in our case the agricultural water demand has to the depth of our analysis a limited impact on water resources and very likely on groundwater storage 4 discussion in this section first we integrate and discuss the results for each analysis period subsequently we elaborate on the effect of mar on the study area and provide a brief outlook 4 1 period 1985 2000 the analyses conducted reflect the dramatic decrease in groundwater storage in the area in the last quarter of the xx century significant groundwater level trends and the slope of those trends were significantly negative in both groundwater bodies fig 2a and b and fig 3 furthermore the average groundwater level also reflected the decrease in storage this observed deterioration of groundwater resources in los arenales aquifer was probably the result of three main factors i the lack of regulation of water use the spanish 29 1985 water act of 1985 proclaimed groundwater a public good resulting in the need to formalise a considerable number of previous private rights and granting new concessions these tasks overflowed the institutional capacity of local authorities which could not manage requests in time giving a sense of impunity to illegal drilling martínez santos et al 2008 furthermore under the 29 1985 water act developed in the regulation of the public hydraulic domain royal decree 849 1986 permits were not required to drill wells with small abstraction volumes 7000 m3 year llamas and garrido 2007 the groundwater register and catalogue update program aryca 1995 2001 which aimed to improve water use tracking and control felt short in its objectives and did not provide a significant solution to illegal and unregistered groundwater abstractions llamas et al 2015 ii the incentivisation of highly water consumptive crops e g sugar beet and maise via the european common agricultural policy cap subsidies between 1986 and 1992 baraja rodríguez 2012 martínez santos et al 2008 although no crop distribution information is available for this period exploration of corina land cover reveals an increase in irrigated land which was particularly high in mc 136 between 1990 and 2000 fig 5 a and probably boosted by the incentives above and iii the occurrence of three major droughts in the douro river basin i e 1989 1990 1991 1996 and 2001 2002 chd 2018a del pozo garrido et al 2006 which reflect in below average precipitation in fig 4 and resulted in water scarcity in the region 4 2 period 2000 2011 during this period average groundwater levels in la and mc show a moderate increase fig 4 at the same time groundwater level trends at monitoring sites are evenly distributed between increasing and decreasing fig 2 c and d resulting in average trend slopes of approximately 0 m year fig 3 we believe that the observed patterns are predominantly a consequence of a rebound effect on groundwater levels caused by the progressive increase in precipitation between 2004 and 2008 and restrictions on water use particularly during the 2004 2005 drought as reported by the chd 2018a additional recharge due to mar see the location of increasing trends in la fig 2 c more control on water resources due to the creation of irrigation communities and stabilisation in the extension of irrigated land fig 4a and b the information explored also reflects a relatively small impact of irrigation modernisation in the provinces comprising la and mc i e avila segovia and valladolid in comparison to the autonomous community of castile and leon fig 7 which witnessed a greater adoption of sprinkler and localised irrigation two methods that imply a lower water loss to evaporation than gravity irrigation corominas masip and cuevas navas 2017 some of the programs that promoted changes in irrigation methods include the national irrigation plan horizon 2008 enacted in 2002 the irrigation modernisation shock plan 2006 2008 and the strategy for the sustainable modernisation of irrigation 2010 2015 gómez espín 2019 lopez gunn et al 2012 the alberca project a successor to aryca has also been unable to track groundwater use comprehensively and effectively llamas et al 2015 a recent study by bea martínez et al 2021 has shown that illegal groundwater abstractions in los arenales represent at least 30 of legally allocated rights droughts in 2004 2005 and 2011 2013 that occurred in the douro river basin affected both groundwater bodies however groundwater levels recovered quickly in the following years fig 4 4 3 period 2012 2020 in la groundwater levels continue to recover fig 4 most trends increase fig 2 f and g and have a positive average slope fig 3 furthermore there is positive field significance table 1 in mc conditions deteriorate more than a fourth of the trends are decreasing fig 2 f and g and field significance and the average slope are negative fig 3 and table 1 the primary cause of the observed deterioration of mc is low precipitation which resulted in droughts in 2011 2013 and 2016 2018 chd 2018a del pozo garrido et al 2006 the improved groundwater storage observed in la is probably a result of mar this conclusion is supported by the spatial correlation of positive trends fig 2 f and g and the fact that this is the only water management measure in which la and mc differ the contribution of other water management measurements including the implementation of new irrigation modernisation programmes at the national level i e the national irrigation plan 2014 2020 and 2018 2025 has a limited impact on the provinces that comprise la and mc fig 6 a compared to castile and leon however this measure could have a net positive and significant impact on los arenales aquifer the contrary is also possible in some parts of spain farmers use the water saved through irrigation modernisation to expand irrigated land or change to more water intensive crops berbel et al 2019 lecina et al 2010 lopez gunn et al 2012 the impact of irrigation modernisation requires further analyses that involve detailed information on agricultural practices and water use 4 4 managed aquifer recharge and outlook we consider mar to be the water management measure responsible for improving groundwater quantity in la there is a spatial and temporal correlation between mar and increasing groundwater level trends in la our results align with the analysis by henao casas et al 2022 showing the adequacy of this technology to cope with drought which is especially visible in the groundwater level analyses of the last period 2012 2020 water management measures implemented on a national and regional scale including plans for the modernisation of irrigation and programs to quantify groundwater abstractions e g alberca have had a limited impact on the study area at least to the depth of our analysis irrigated land has expanded at different rates since 1985 and there is no systematic change in crop types that could result in tangible groundwater savings mc probably represents how the situation would be in la if mar was not implemented about 32 of the irrigated land in la is located in areas that benefit from mar the average annual recharge from mar 5 mm3 is about 25 of the irrigation demands in the areas with mar and 8 of the average agricultural groundwater demand in la 61 mm3 the effect of additional water resources is greatly enhanced by establishing irrigation communities which gather farmers who exploit the resources from mar these communities which have been formed in santiuste and el carracillo have contributed to more effective control of water demand they have become a platform to connect farmers and the chd contributing to negotiating water rights installing water metering devices in abstraction wells and transferring knowledge to face dry years and use water efficiently among other benefits fernández escalante and lópez gunn et al 2021 giordano et al 2021 lopez gunn 2003 evidence of cooperation between the chd and irrigation communities has been found beyond stakeholder workshops conducted in the past fernández escalante et al 2016 for example the chd has requested farmers in irrigation communities irrigate only 50 of their plots and obtain one harvest per year fnca 2020 according to siose in 2014 approximately 35 of the irrigated land in la was not being irrigated contrasting with only 15 in mc despite the tangible improvement in groundwater storage there are still challenges in la and especially mc that warrant further governance and infrastructure efforts both groundwater bodies are still considered in a bad quality and quantity status as per the wfd and in bad quantitative condition according to the groundwater exploitation index groundwater usage over available resources which in 2018 was 0 92 and 1 57 for la and mc respectively chd 2019 a good quantitative status is considered when the groundwater exploitation index is below 0 8 ministerio de medio ambiente y medio rural y marino 2008 in addition climate change in the douro river basin is likely to have a detrimental impact on natural recharge through less rainfall lower streamflow and higher temperatures amblar francés et al 2017 cruz garcía et al 2016 guerreiro et al 2017 guerreiro et al 2016 climate change could further affect los arenales aquifer due to the reliability and flexibility of groundwater when dealing with water scarcity famiglietti 2014 hanjra and qureshi 2010 5 conclusions this study has shown that managed aquifer recharge mar has contributed to reversing the consequences of intensive groundwater use and sustaining irrigation in los arenales groundwater body la groundwater level trends show a significant decrease in la and medina del campo groundwater bodies mc between 1985 and 2001 with slope magnitudes of around 1 5 m year and 0 6 m year respectively and negative trends at almost 100 of groundwater monitoring sites the subsequent period 2002 2011 is characterised by positive and negative trends in equal proportions in la and mc and slopes averaging 0 m year the final period shows a better situation in la where trends are predominantly positive 75 and spatially related to mar the average slope is slightly above zero i e 0 2 m year on the other hand mc has predominantly negative trends 75 and a negative mean slope of approximately 0 5 m year no field significance was found through the empirical method by douglas et al 2000 a significant regional positive trend was found through the regional kendall test in la and a negative trend in mc between 2012 and 2020 agricultural land use remained stable between 1985 and 2020 in the same period irrigated land has increased throughout the region the distribution of the major crop groups has changed over time but agricultural water demand has remained virtually constant since at least 2010 the effect of water management measures and programs such as a comprehensive database to track groundwater use and modernisation of irrigation is limited on the study area average groundwater levels show that la has entered a recovery trend between 2001 and 2004 coinciding with the start of mar the difference in groundwater level trends observed in la and mc is due to the implementation of mar in the former groundwater body author contributions jose david henao casas conceptualisation

11772,aquifers providing groundwater for agriculture are in many cases unsustainably managed resulting in environmental degradation and socioeconomic impacts in this context strategies that contribute to recovering groundwater reserves and satisfactorily maintaining irrigation are essential los arenales aquifer spain experienced a dramatic decline in groundwater level in the last quarter of the 20th century due to intensive agricultural abstractions we assess whether this aquifer has recovered in recent years and the potential contribution of managed aquifer recharge mar we evaluate the significance of groundwater level trends and their magnitude through the regional mann kendall test and the theil sen estimator we also calculate the average groundwater level and explore factors that could influence the observed trends such as mar land use agricultural water demand and water management measures we also contrast two groundwater management regions located within los arenales aquifer namely los arenales la which has implemented mar and medina del campo mc to obtain further insight into groundwater development the hydro statistical analyses reveal a continuous drop in groundwater levels of about 1 3 m year in la between 1985 and 2001 followed by a consistent recovery in mc groundwater levels decrease in two out of three analysis periods we show that mar is spatially and temporally correlated with increasing groundwater level trends land use agricultural water demand and water management measures have remained similar throughout the analysis period or have a limited impact on groundwater use furthermore the only significant water management measure mc differs from la is mar these pieces of evidence point to mar as the primary mechanism for replenishing los

hydrogeology trend analysis field significance irrigation 1 introduction groundwater is vital globally it meets the water needs of around two billion people gleeson et al 2012 and contributes to irrigating more than 43 of the global irrigated land a percentage that is expected to increase in the future hanjra and qureshi 2010 however groundwater s low visibility has resulted in large overdrafts in many regions leading to unsustainable groundwater development and hence aquifer overexploitation alley 2002 custodio 2002 famiglietti 2014 gleeson et al 2012 konikow and kendy 2005 this problem is particularly tangible in some aquifers that sustain large scale agriculture such as the upper ganges india pakistan the north arabian saudi arabia the central valley usa and the canning basin australia famiglietti 2014 gleeson et al 2012 in spain groundwater irrigation represents 27 of the 33 000 km2 of total irrigated land and offers a much higher socioeconomic efficiency in terms of m3 and jobs m3 than supply based surface water irrigation aldaya et al 2010 garrido et al 2006 many aquifers in spain are considered overexploited or highly stressed due to unsustainable irrigation llamas et al 2015 rupérez moreno et al 2017 van loon and van lanen 2013 one significant example of these aquifers is los arenales located on the spanish side of the douro river basin throughout the second half of the xx century this region witnessed a rapid increase in groundwater based irrigation state supports such as low interest loans tax exemptions and technological innovations that made it possible to extract water from greater depths attracted agricultural entrepreneurs llamas et al 2015 baraja rodríguez 2012 this socioeconomic context resulted in extensive unregulated groundwater exploitation which was reflected in widespread drawdowns throughout los arenales where groundwater levels dropped by up to 27 m between 1972 and 2002 fernández escalante et al 2016 this evident crisis and the imminent implementation of the water framework directive wfd european parliament and council of the european union 2000 forced the local water management authorities and farmers to change their view on water resources toward sustainability baraja rodríguez 2012 llamas and garrido 2007 soto garcía et al 2013 consequently farmers in los arenales promoted the construction of managed aquifer recharge mar systems to maintain groundwater irrigation resulting in el carracillo santiuste and pedrajas alcazarén mar sites in 2002 2003 and 2012 fernández escalante et al 2016 mapa 1998 mar

some studies have evaluated the regional effect of mar systems on aquifers stressed by agriculture most of these studies show that mar is significant to a local extent with a net depletion of storage

groundwater in overexploited aquifers effectively dillon et al 2009b thomas and famiglietti 2015 scanlon et al 2016 wendt et al 2020 however some authors report a net positive effect of implementing mar jadhav et al 2021 bachtouli and comte 2019 several studies have explored the effect of the mar sites on los arenales aquifer these studies have focused on hydrogeological conama 2019 socioeconomic fernández escalante et al 2016 governance fernández escalante and lópez gunn 2021 climate change fernández escalante et al 2019b henao casas et al 2022 and technical fernández escalante and prieto leache 2013 fernández escalante and san sebastian sauto 2019a marsol 2015 aspects however none of them has analysed the evolution of groundwater levels and water use dynamics on a regional scale the main goal of the present study is to determine whether los arenales aquifer has recovered in recent years and if so to elucidate the contribution of mar our approach involves collecting evidence using different statistical methods and evaluating socioeconomic dynamics that might affect groundwater development we analyse local and regional groundwater level trends and average groundwater levels we also conduct analyses of agricultural water demand land use and cropping patterns and water management measures additionally we contrast two groundwater management regions that are part of los arenales aquifer and underwent a similar storage depletion in the second half of the xx century still they seem to have evolved significantly differently in the last decade this study is one of the few to evaluate the effect of large scale operational mar systems furthermore to the best of our knowledge a comprehensive evaluation involving long term groundwater data monitoring and mar in the agricultural context has only been carried out in the central valley aquifer wendt et al 2020 and the coastal korba aquifer tunisia bachtouli and comte 2019 therefore this study constitutes the first assessment in europe it also presents a comprehensive approach to assessing the impact of water management measures in areas with hydrogeological and socioeconomic complexity in this case heterogeneity and compartmentalisation of the aquifer systems and the lack of long term agricultural and groundwater abstraction data that represent large uncertainties for numerical models precluding their use 2 methodology 2 1 case study background the study area is located in the autonomous community of castile and leon 94 224 km2 central spain it extends over a flat area on the central plateau of the douro river basin fig 1 the region s climate is continental mediterranean and is characterised by long cold winters average temperature about 3 6 c and short mild summers average temperature about 19 22 c segovia cardozo et al 2019 average precipitation and evapotranspiration are respectively 395 mm and 1129 most of the precipitation occurs between october and may agriculture in the region is the primary land use and occupies 70 of the land irrigation represents about 25 of total agricultural land and consumes 98 of total groundwater abstraction cereals are the main crops covering about 55 of the total agricultural land and representing nearly 30 of the irrigated land rivas tabares et al 2019 wheat and barley predominate in the region other representative crops are sugar beets and sunflowers in hydrogeological terms los arenales aquifer entails two main systems the first system comprises phreatic aquifers in shallow thickness quaternary deposits 10 m the second system involves lenticular and elongated bodies of sand and gravel embedded in an impermeable to semipermeable matrix of silt clay and to a minor extent gypsum antón et al 2012 fernández escalante et al 2016 navarro alvargonzález et al 1993 this system is part of the paleogene neogene fill of the douro river basin and reaches maximum depths 1000 m towards the basin s centre igme 2009 the connection among permeable units and between both aquifer systems is complex in some locations it has been observed that adjacent high porosity bodies separated by a few tens of meters are hydraulically disconnected recharge in the shallow system is due to precipitation and in a lower proportion to the surface drainage network and irrigation returns the deep aquifer system replenishes from the phreatic aquifers through deep percolation and poorly constructed wells that connect both systems fernández escalante 2004 the groundwater flow in los arenales aquifer is directed to the douro river and has a predominant north northeast direction in 2005 los arenales aquifer was subdivided into several groundwater bodies following the wfd requirements these groundwater bodies are groundwater management regions that facilitate assessing and managing groundwater resources their borders can obey factors beyond hydrogeology chd 2007 we focus on los arenales la 2398 km2 and medina del campo mc 3707 km2 groundwater bodies which are part of los arenales aquifer 7700 km2 fig 1 and extend predominantly over the avila segovia and valladolid provinces the differentiation of la and mc as two separate groundwater bodies is mostly administrative in fact no authors have pointed out significant hydrogeological differences between them there are three large scale mar sites in la namely santiuste el carracillo and pedrajas alcazarén fig 1 they extend over large areas through channels infiltration basins and artificial wetlands that recharge the shallow aquifer system marsol 2015 some tests have been conducted to implement mar in mc douglas et al 2019 however the mar system is not operative and is therefore not considered in the present study the main objective of mar in la is to reverse groundwater depletion and ensure local irrigation needs santiuste and el carracillo recharge river water surpluses during winter while alcazarén pedrajas recharges reclaimed water and rooftop runoff throughout the year fernández escalante et al 2016 the average annual volume of mar in la is 5 mm3 more details of the mar systems are available in the report by fernández escalante et al 2016 2 2 theoretical background 2 2 1 mann kendall test the mann kendall mk test kendall 1970 mann 1945 is a rank based nonparametric test that assesses the significance of a time series trend helsel and hirsch 2002 the mk test has the advantage that it is not restricted to any data distribution is less sensitive to outliers hamed 2008 and is invariant when using power transformations e g logarithms and squares helsel and frans 2006 when conducting a mk test typically the null hypothesis h 0 is that the data sample is independent and identically distributed the alternative hypothesis h 1 is that the data sample has a monotonic trend yue et al 2002 the s statistic of the mk test also known as kendall s s is provided in expression 1 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where n is the sample size sgn is the signal function 2 and x i and x j are the data samples i and j respectively 2 sgn θ 1 i f θ 0 0 i f θ 0 1 i f θ 0 mann 1945 and kendall 1970 have shown that when n 8 the kendall s s have an approximately normal distribution with mean and variance given in 3 and 4 respectively 3 e s 0 4 v s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 n t i i i 1 2 i 5 18 where e s is the expected value of s v s is the variance of s and t i is the number of ties of extent i a standardised test statistic z can be calculated as follows 5 5 z s 1 v s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v s s 0 the standardised mk z statistic fits a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one yue et al 2002 2 2 2 serial autocorrelation and pre whitening one crucial aspect of the mk test is that it works best on autocorrelation free time series helsel and hirsch 2002 von storch 1999 and yue et al 2002 have shown that when testing a linear trend on a series with positive autocorrelation there is a higher probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true type i error on the other hand negative autocorrelated time series can result in fewer rejections of the null hypothesis when it is false type ii error the probability of these errors is reduced through pre whitening which implies diminishing the serial autocorrelation before performing the mk test hamed 2008 a relevant example of pre whitening is the trend free pre whitening procedure tfpw by yue et al 2002 which involves removing the ar 1 component from the original time series to reduce the absolute value of the autocorrelation 2 2 3 theil sen estimator the theil sen estimator sen 1968 theil 1992 is a slope estimator commonly employed in hydrological trend analysis it consists of the median of the slope through all pairs of points in the data sample 6 6 b median y j y i x j x i j i x and y are independent variables e g time and dependent variables e g groundwater level respectively 2 2 4 field significance field significance refers to the significance of regional behaviour and can be derived from local statistical tests douglas et al 2000 renard et al 2008 thomas and famiglietti 2015 regional trends in groundwater levels can be estimated using field significance methods one of such methods is the regional kendall test helsel and frans 2006 which is adequate to use when local groundwater level time series are not spatially cross correlated in this test the values of local kendall s s are added resulting in a regional kendall s s 7 7 s r i 1 m s i s r is the regional kendall s s m is the number of observation sites e g wells and si is the kendall s s of the ith observation site the variance of the regional kendall s s is computed utilising expression 8 8 v s r i 1 m n i 18 n i 1 2 n i 5 the distribution of s r can also be approximated quite well by a normal curve when m 25 helsel and frans 2006 and the z statistic can be estimated using equation 5 where s and v s are substituted for s r and v s r when cross correlation is present in the groundwater level time series the local hypotheses are not independent and the regional kendall test is invalid an alternative in these cases is the empirical approach by douglas et al 2000 which uses the bootstrapping method efron 1979 to obtain kendall s s samples with replacement the size of each sample equals the size of the original dataset i e n and the sampled s values correspond to those computed at each location subsequently an average kendall s s is calculated following expression 9 9 s a i 1 n s i n where s a is the average kendall s s and s i is kendall s s at the ith location this procedure is repeated n times and the empirical distribution of the probability of non exceedance of s a is found by ranking the obtained values of s a through a weibull function 10 10 p s a s r n 1 where p is the probability of non exceedance and r is the rank 2 3 approach we analysed groundwater level trends on local and regional scales and average regional groundwater levels to explore whether groundwater storage in los arenales aquifer has recovered over time these analyses also allowed us to assess spatially and temporally the potential contribution of the mar systems to the observed groundwater behaviour we also evaluated changes in land use agricultural water demand as a function of crop groups the contribution of different irrigation methods and water management measures to assess their effect on aquifer groundwater storage 2 3 1 local groundwater level trends we performed the mk test for linear trend analysis in la and mc with a significance level of 0 05 z 1 96 considering that the test is two tailed first we pre whitened the observations utilising the tfpw method subsequently we applied the original mk test to the resulting time series however in cases in which groundwater monitoring sites had a considerable number of observations 50 and the slope magnitude was large enough 0 0005 we applied the mk test without performing any pre whitening yue and wang 2002 we considered only groundwater monitoring sites with at least five years of continuous groundwater level records given the substantial interannual climatic variability in the region gonzález hidalgo et al 2010 this filtering criterion reduced the number of appropriate groundwater monitoring sites to 35 in la and 58 in mc 57 and 60 of the original number of groundwater monitoring sites respectively minor gaps 2 records in the time series were filled using linear interpolation wendt et al 2020 in some groundwater level time series linear interpolation was also used to resample groundwater levels to have a consistent time interval between contiguous observations the slope magnitudes were computed on pre whitened time series through the theil sen estimator we obtained groundwater level observations from the public database of the duero hydrographic confederation chd which currently has 61 groundwater monitoring sites in la and 97 in mc fig 1 the available groundwater level observations span from 1985 to 2020 with a measurement frequency that changes over time based on that frequency we subdivided the data and the trend analysis into three periods that coincide with significant changes concerning the mar sites i period 1985 2001 which has a biannual measuring frequency and represents the situation before the implementation of mar ii period 2002 2011 which features monthly groundwater level observations and entails the official inauguration of santiuste 2002 and el carracillo 2003 mar sites iii period 2012 2020 which has a bimonthly measuring rate and involves the start of mar in the pedrajas alcazarén mar site 2012 visual examples of some of the groundwater level time series from la and mc and their corresponding trends are provided by henao casas et al 2022 considering a single period between 2002 and 2020 was tempting to assess trends after mar however we split this interval into two since the mk test requires a consistent sampling frequency preliminary tests showed a change in the sign of some trends between the second and third periods considered i e 2002 2011 and 2012 2020 and there are data gaps of up to a year in many groundwater monitoring sites between 2011 and 2013 2 3 2 regional groundwater level trends the groundwater observation sites in the study area have a minor degree of cross correlation as a result of the high heterogeneity of the aquifer however cross correlation cannot be conclusively ruled out therefore we assessed regional groundwater level trends through the field significance methods of the regional kendall test and the empirical approach by douglas et al 2000 we applied the two procedures to local trends in la mc and both groundwater bodies la mc considering a significance level of 0 05 z 1 96 since the test is two tailed in the approach by douglas et al 2000 we computed the empirical distribution of the probability of non exceedance by repeating the bootstrap method 10 000 times n 10 000 2 3 3 average regional groundwater level we estimate the annual average groundwater levels for la and mc using available groundwater level observations we considered only groundwater monitoring sites with continuous observations between 1985 and 2001 and between 2002 and 2022 to avoid artificial values in the constructed average groundwater levels caused by the introduction of new data in between intervals the average groundwater levels obtained were graphically compared with annual precipitation and mar volumes we obtained precipitation data from two main sources between 1985 and 2002 the main source of daily rainfall records was the spanish meteorological agency aemet stations with data spanning in some cases nearly 100 years between 2002 and 2020 we used daily precipitation data from the aemet and inforiego stations at the site fig 1 we summed daily precipitation values to obtain annual precipitation for each of the three analysis periods we constructed thiessen polygons thiessen 1911 with the available data in the area comprised of la and mc and constructed a single time series of annual precipitation we added mar volumes from the mar sites to get a single time series mar volumes from santiuste el carracillo and pedrajas alcazarén were provided by the santiuste irrigation community el carracillo irrigation community and the pedrajas wastewater treatment plant we recalculated volumes from hydrological years to calendar years based on precipitation percentages there are uncertainties in the exact mar volumes of two years in 2002 there was some mar as part of the system testing however the exact infiltrated volume is unknown in 2005 the water metering device in the santiuste water conveyance pipe broke and the reported infiltrated volume 1 3 mm3 was lower than the actual one 2 3 4 land use and irrigation methods land use was analysed at general and detailed levels at the general level we checked changes in major land use categories namely artificial surfaces agriculture forest and semi natural areas wetlands and water bodies at the detailed level we evaluated changes in irrigated agricultural land land use changes between 2005 and 2014 were evaluated through the spanish land occupation information system siose inventory available in 2005 2009 2011 and 2014 siose 2022 changes between 1990 and 2006 were explored through corine land cover which in the above period has data for 1990 2000 and 2006 corine land cover is a land cover inventory based on satellite images clc 2022 we analysed irrigated land in terms of irrigation methods in castile and leon and the provinces of avila segovia and valladolid between 2002 and 2018 using data from the crop area and yield survey esyrce of the ministry of agriculture fishery and food mapa 2021 we explored three primary irrigation methods namely gravity aspersion including fixed and moving sprinklers and localised irrigation including dripping irrigation 2 3 5 agricultural water demand we estimated the annual agricultural water demand for each groundwater body the objective was to explore the possible impacts of different crop groups on water use we calculated the total irrigated land for each crop group in la by adding the contribution of municipalities located within this groundwater body we obtained the required data from the agricultural statistics of the castile and leon board junta de castilla y león 2022 including information for more than 70 crops comprehended in six crop groups namely cereals industrial crops fodder crops legumes vegetables and tubers data were available between 2010 and 2020 we performed the same procedure for mc subsequently we estimated the average irrigation volumes applied to each crop group using data on the water use per hectare for 17 crops in the adaja river irrigation district and el carracillo we obtained this water use information from the inforiego crop monitoring program inforiego 2020 available between 2011 and 2018 we multiplied the total land surface of each crop group by its corresponding average irrigation volumes finally crop group irrigation volumes were added to estimate annual agricultural water demand we compared our estimate of annual agricultural water demand with the chd assessment which is available in the 2015 2022 douro river basin management plan and its revision reports chd 2021 2020 2019 2018b 2017 2015 3 results 3 1 local groundwater level trends the application of the tfpw method effectively reduced the autocorrelation of the groundwater level time series by around 30 on average most groundwater level trends 100 in the period 1985 2001 were significantly negative fig 2 a and b attesting to a rapid decrease in groundwater storage in los arenales aquifer this decrease occurred at average rates of 1 5 m year in la and 0 6 m year in mc fig 3 in the following period 2002 2011 significant trends decreased in terms of the number of groundwater monitoring sites tested 75 in la and 60 in mc the resulting significant trends are evenly distributed between increasing and decreasing fig 2 c and d and the slope magnitudes are nearly 0 m year on average fig 3 positive trends in la are in the vicinity of the santiuste and pedrajas alcazarén mar sites the positive trends with small slopes found in mc fig 2 c are possibly the result of changing crop types since the main water source for irrigation remained groundwater and no significant changes in land use were detected the final period 2012 2020 is characterised by a lower proportion of significant trends around 50 of all groundwater monitoring sites tested and a contrasting behaviour between la and mc in la roughly three quarters of the detected trends are positive while the opposite is true in mc fig 2 c the magnitude of negative trends is more prominent in mc with an average value of 0 5 m y fig 4 such trends cluster to the west fig 3 c where large volumes of groundwater are abstracted for irrigation in la positive trends can be observed in the vicinity of pedrajas alcazarén and santiuste mar sites fig 3 c in both cases the trends are probably the result of mar and some irrigation returns derived from the cega river trends in the surroundings of the adaja river irrigation district changed from significantly negative in 2002 2011 to significantly positive in 2012 2020 this transformation is the result of shifting groundwater to surface water through el castro de las cogotas dam as the main irrigation water source in 2010 borowiecka et al 2019 naroua et al 2014 3 2 regional groundwater level trends no field significance was detected in any studied regions by the empirical method of douglas et al 2000 table 1 presumably due to the disparity in trend signs and the lower proportion of significant local trends regarding the number of analysed groundwater monitoring sites the regional kendall test was not computed for the periods 1985 2001 and 2002 2011 since the number of available time series was below the minimum required by the method i e 26 in the period 2012 2020 the regional kendall test results in a positive regional groundwater level trend in la and a negative regional trend in mc table 1 supporting a regional recovery of groundwater levels in the former groundwater body and further deterioration of subsurface water resources in the latter in the same period no field significance was detected for the region that comprises la and mc likely as a consequence of opposing trends at monitoring sites 3 3 average regional groundwater level average groundwater levels attest to the storage decline perceived in the region between 1985 and 2001 the decline is more pronounced in la 1 1 m year than in mc 0 8 m year where groundwater levels seem to stabilise between 1995 and 2001 since rainfall in these years is above average fig 4 in la groundwater levels start to increase at some point between 2001 and 2004 and remain in a recovery trend of 0 4 m year in mc there is also a recovery in groundwater levels between 2004 and 2013 followed by a steep fall and a decreasing trend fig 4 however in mc it seems possible that a decreasing trend started as early as 2008 and that the level computed for 2013 is out of the trend and due to high precipitation and low agricultural water demand fig 7 c the slope of the average groundwater level in mc between 2004 and 2020 is 0 6 m year in both groundwater bodies there seems to be a significant correlation between groundwater levels and precipitation fig 4 in years with considerably low precipitation such as 2017 groundwater levels also show a decline reflecting the high dependence of los arenales aquifer on precipitation despite the high anthropisation in the region intentional recharge volumes correlate positively with precipitation fig 4 the implementation of mar corresponds to the start of the increasing trend in la 3 4 land use agricultural land remained constant in la 53 or 1250 km2 and mc 86 or 3150 km2 between 1990 and 2014 fig 5 there are differences in absolute 100 km2 and percentage 5 7 in terms of total agricultural land use and up to 128 percentage difference in irrigated land in mc values between corine land cover and siose due to the different approaches these programs utilise to categorise land use irrigation increased at varying rates in both groundwater bodies between 1990 and 2014 in the period 1990 2000 there was a notable increase of 128 of irrigated land in mc and a more discrete increase of 14 in la fig 5 from 2000 on irrigated land increased by minor percentages 1 4 except between 2011 and 2014 when it expanded by 29 in la relative to 2005 fig 5 between 2002 and 2018 sprinklers remained the most common irrigation method in avila segovia and valladolid i e the provinces that comprise the majority of la and mc employed in 88 of the irrigated land 1115 km2 in this region the adoption of localised irrigation which is the most water efficient method was discrete in terms of the total irrigated area in avila segovia and valladolid passing from 2 24 km2 in 2002 to 14 199 km2 in 2018 fig 6 a in castile and leon irrigation modernisation had a greater impact between 2002 and 2018 the adoption of gravity methods decreased 47 1104 km2 in favour of sprinkler 47 974 km2 and localised irrigation 368 253 km2 fig 6 b 3 5 agricultural water demand in 2018 the most extended crop group in la and mc was cereals present in more than 50 of the land fig 7 a the crops in this group such as wheat and barley consume the lowest water volumes fig 7 a in the same year vegetables and tubers which consume the most water on average had an important extension in la i e 20 and 11 respectively fig 5 a the extension of some crop groups shows high interannual variation and in some cases trends between 2010 and 2018 the extension of vegetable crops in la which require substantial amounts of water has encroached on the contrary less water intensive crops such as cereals were progressively more adopted in mc the trend is the opposite the land extension under fodder and vegetable crops which require more water than cereals increased between 2010 and 2018 at the same time agricultural land with cereal crops decreased however the increased adoption of industrial crops and legumes in la and the decrease in the extension of legumes in mc compensate for the above effect and result in nearly constant agricultural water demand for irrigation on average 86 mm3 year in la and 225 mm3 year in mc between 2010 and 2020 fig 7 b at least between 2009 and 2015 the chd calculated agricultural groundwater demands based on the irrigation groundwater rights allocated on the alberca system which is probably why our estimations differ on an annual time scale the difference in the average between both estimates is exceedingly small for mc 2 and large for la 30 the cause of the significant difference in the latter groundwater body is likely that we include in our calculation land that is being irrigated with surface water in the adaja river irrigation district the same error occurs in mc but the adaja river irrigation district has a smaller share of the land in this groundwater body fig 8 is a qualitative assessment of the results of the analysis conducted the qualitative assessment is made for each analysis period and groundwater body and consists of assigning a category out of four possible indicating the actual or likely impact on groundwater storage increasing decreasing neutral and not assessed we considered designating the increasing category for the analyses involving groundwater levels when the results indicate an increase in this variable in the case of land use we assumed that increasing the area under irrigation we selected 5 as a threshold can result in higher abstractions and thus a decrease in storage decreasing category concerning the irrigation method wider adoption of technologies that save water sprinkler and drip irrigation would likely decrease abstractions and thus indicate an increase increasing category in groundwater storage the opposite categories are assigned when groundwater water levels decline irrigated land decreases or the use of the less water efficient technologies increases fig 8 shows that the main difference between la and occurs in the last period 2012 2020 when positive slopes and increasing trends at the regional and local levels imply an increase in groundwater storage in la and a decrease in mc this qualitative analysis also shows that in our case the agricultural water demand has to the depth of our analysis a limited impact on water resources and very likely on groundwater storage 4 discussion in this section first we integrate and discuss the results for each analysis period subsequently we elaborate on the effect of mar on the study area and provide a brief outlook 4 1 period 1985 2000 the analyses conducted reflect the dramatic decrease in groundwater storage in the area in the last quarter of the xx century significant groundwater level trends and the slope of those trends were significantly negative in both groundwater bodies fig 2a and b and fig 3 furthermore the average groundwater level also reflected the decrease in storage this observed deterioration of groundwater resources in los arenales aquifer was probably the result of three main factors i the lack of regulation of water use the spanish 29 1985 water act of 1985 proclaimed groundwater a public good resulting in the need to formalise a considerable number of previous private rights and granting new concessions these tasks overflowed the institutional capacity of local authorities which could not manage requests in time giving a sense of impunity to illegal drilling martínez santos et al 2008 furthermore under the 29 1985 water act developed in the regulation of the public hydraulic domain royal decree 849 1986 permits were not required to drill wells with small abstraction volumes 7000 m3 year llamas and garrido 2007 the groundwater register and catalogue update program aryca 1995 2001 which aimed to improve water use tracking and control felt short in its objectives and did not provide a significant solution to illegal and unregistered groundwater abstractions llamas et al 2015 ii the incentivisation of highly water consumptive crops e g sugar beet and maise via the european common agricultural policy cap subsidies between 1986 and 1992 baraja rodríguez 2012 martínez santos et al 2008 although no crop distribution information is available for this period exploration of corina land cover reveals an increase in irrigated land which was particularly high in mc 136 between 1990 and 2000 fig 5 a and probably boosted by the incentives above and iii the occurrence of three major droughts in the douro river basin i e 1989 1990 1991 1996 and 2001 2002 chd 2018a del pozo garrido et al 2006 which reflect in below average precipitation in fig 4 and resulted in water scarcity in the region 4 2 period 2000 2011 during this period average groundwater levels in la and mc show a moderate increase fig 4 at the same time groundwater level trends at monitoring sites are evenly distributed between increasing and decreasing fig 2 c and d resulting in average trend slopes of approximately 0 m year fig 3 we believe that the observed patterns are predominantly a consequence of a rebound effect on groundwater levels caused by the progressive increase in precipitation between 2004 and 2008 and restrictions on water use particularly during the 2004 2005 drought as reported by the chd 2018a additional recharge due to mar see the location of increasing trends in la fig 2 c more control on water resources due to the creation of irrigation communities and stabilisation in the extension of irrigated land fig 4a and b the information explored also reflects a relatively small impact of irrigation modernisation in the provinces comprising la and mc i e avila segovia and valladolid in comparison to the autonomous community of castile and leon fig 7 which witnessed a greater adoption of sprinkler and localised irrigation two methods that imply a lower water loss to evaporation than gravity irrigation corominas masip and cuevas navas 2017 some of the programs that promoted changes in irrigation methods include the national irrigation plan horizon 2008 enacted in 2002 the irrigation modernisation shock plan 2006 2008 and the strategy for the sustainable modernisation of irrigation 2010 2015 gómez espín 2019 lopez gunn et al 2012 the alberca project a successor to aryca has also been unable to track groundwater use comprehensively and effectively llamas et al 2015 a recent study by bea martínez et al 2021 has shown that illegal groundwater abstractions in los arenales represent at least 30 of legally allocated rights droughts in 2004 2005 and 2011 2013 that occurred in the douro river basin affected both groundwater bodies however groundwater levels recovered quickly in the following years fig 4 4 3 period 2012 2020 in la groundwater levels continue to recover fig 4 most trends increase fig 2 f and g and have a positive average slope fig 3 furthermore there is positive field significance table 1 in mc conditions deteriorate more than a fourth of the trends are decreasing fig 2 f and g and field significance and the average slope are negative fig 3 and table 1 the primary cause of the observed deterioration of mc is low precipitation which resulted in droughts in 2011 2013 and 2016 2018 chd 2018a del pozo garrido et al 2006 the improved groundwater storage observed in la is probably a result of mar this conclusion is supported by the spatial correlation of positive trends fig 2 f and g and the fact that this is the only water management measure in which la and mc differ the contribution of other water management measurements including the implementation of new irrigation modernisation programmes at the national level i e the national irrigation plan 2014 2020 and 2018 2025 has a limited impact on the provinces that comprise la and mc fig 6 a compared to castile and leon however this measure could have a net positive and significant impact on los arenales aquifer the contrary is also possible in some parts of spain farmers use the water saved through irrigation modernisation to expand irrigated land or change to more water intensive crops berbel et al 2019 lecina et al 2010 lopez gunn et al 2012 the impact of irrigation modernisation requires further analyses that involve detailed information on agricultural practices and water use 4 4 managed aquifer recharge and outlook we consider mar to be the water management measure responsible for improving groundwater quantity in la there is a spatial and temporal correlation between mar and increasing groundwater level trends in la our results align with the analysis by henao casas et al 2022 showing the adequacy of this technology to cope with drought which is especially visible in the groundwater level analyses of the last period 2012 2020 water management measures implemented on a national and regional scale including plans for the modernisation of irrigation and programs to quantify groundwater abstractions e g alberca have had a limited impact on the study area at least to the depth of our analysis irrigated land has expanded at different rates since 1985 and there is no systematic change in crop types that could result in tangible groundwater savings mc probably represents how the situation would be in la if mar was not implemented about 32 of the irrigated land in la is located in areas that benefit from mar the average annual recharge from mar 5 mm3 is about 25 of the irrigation demands in the areas with mar and 8 of the average agricultural groundwater demand in la 61 mm3 the effect of additional water resources is greatly enhanced by establishing irrigation communities which gather farmers who exploit the resources from mar these communities which have been formed in santiuste and el carracillo have contributed to more effective control of water demand they have become a platform to connect farmers and the chd contributing to negotiating water rights installing water metering devices in abstraction wells and transferring knowledge to face dry years and use water efficiently among other benefits fernández escalante and lópez gunn et al 2021 giordano et al 2021 lopez gunn 2003 evidence of cooperation between the chd and irrigation communities has been found beyond stakeholder workshops conducted in the past fernández escalante et al 2016 for example the chd has requested farmers in irrigation communities irrigate only 50 of their plots and obtain one harvest per year fnca 2020 according to siose in 2014 approximately 35 of the irrigated land in la was not being irrigated contrasting with only 15 in mc despite the tangible improvement in groundwater storage there are still challenges in la and especially mc that warrant further governance and infrastructure efforts both groundwater bodies are still considered in a bad quality and quantity status as per the wfd and in bad quantitative condition according to the groundwater exploitation index groundwater usage over available resources which in 2018 was 0 92 and 1 57 for la and mc respectively chd 2019 a good quantitative status is considered when the groundwater exploitation index is below 0 8 ministerio de medio ambiente y medio rural y marino 2008 in addition climate change in the douro river basin is likely to have a detrimental impact on natural recharge through less rainfall lower streamflow and higher temperatures amblar francés et al 2017 cruz garcía et al 2016 guerreiro et al 2017 guerreiro et al 2016 climate change could further affect los arenales aquifer due to the reliability and flexibility of groundwater when dealing with water scarcity famiglietti 2014 hanjra and qureshi 2010 5 conclusions this study has shown that managed aquifer recharge mar has contributed to reversing the consequences of intensive groundwater use and sustaining irrigation in los arenales groundwater body la groundwater level trends show a significant decrease in la and medina del campo groundwater bodies mc between 1985 and 2001 with slope magnitudes of around 1 5 m year and 0 6 m year respectively and negative trends at almost 100 of groundwater monitoring sites the subsequent period 2002 2011 is characterised by positive and negative trends in equal proportions in la and mc and slopes averaging 0 m year the final period shows a better situation in la where trends are predominantly positive 75 and spatially related to mar the average slope is slightly above zero i e 0 2 m year on the other hand mc has predominantly negative trends 75 and a negative mean slope of approximately 0 5 m year no field significance was found through the empirical method by douglas et al 2000 a significant regional positive trend was found through the regional kendall test in la and a negative trend in mc between 2012 and 2020 agricultural land use remained stable between 1985 and 2020 in the same period irrigated land has increased throughout the region the distribution of the major crop groups has changed over time but agricultural water demand has remained virtually constant since at least 2010 the effect of water management measures and programs such as a comprehensive database to track groundwater use and modernisation of irrigation is limited on the study area average groundwater levels show that la has entered a recovery trend between 2001 and 2004 coinciding with the start of mar the difference in groundwater level trends observed in la and mc is due to the implementation of mar in the former groundwater body author contributions jose david henao casas conceptualisation

11773,water born pathogen and diseases represent a major concern with respect to water quality in recent years high interests have been focused on controlling water born pathogen especially fecal and total coliform in water resources the disadvantage of water treatment by chlorine is related to the disinfection by products dbps therefore the study presented here is devoted to explore and testify the suitability and validity of microwave heating system as a promising disinfection and treatment process to remove total and fecal coliform as well as bod cod and ammonia from raw drinking water raw water samples were collected from two different inlet locations khandak el sharqi damanhour canal and mahmoudia fisha canal el beheira governorate egypt and subjected to treatment by microwave heating for a period from 10 to 150 s the collected results confirmed that total coliform and fecal coliform were efficiently removed 100 upon microwave heating for 150 s similarly the bod values in raw water samples were 92 94 removed inhibition of cod parameter 48 49 of the initial cod values in raw water samples were confirmed by the influence of also 150 s microwave heating finally the effectiveness of microwave heating for ammonia from water was also established on the basis of excellent percentage removal 100 of low concentration ammonia levels and 98 of high concentration levels of ammonia nitrogen at adjusted raw water samples to ph 10 11 the proposed water treatment method may be regarded as a promising approach for removal of these pollutants from various water sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords microwave heating water disinfection total fecal coliform bod cod ammonia 1 introduction water quality is heavily referred and dependent on the number and type of contaminants that are related to humans animals activities however more than 3 4 million deaths were recorded worldwide by the influence of induced pathogens either by direct or indirect contaminated water with these species who 2020 coliform bacteria have been recently identified as one of the most serious pollutant in water effluents in addition fecal coliform bacteria are generally employed as indicators to refer to the existence of such type of bacteria scott et al 2022 therefore contamination of different types of water with pathogenic bacteria must be minimized and limited to avoid possible health hazards gomes et al 2018 chemical treatments of pathogen have been reported by a number of techniques using silver modified clinoptilolite heulandite rich tuff kumar et al 2020 iron and aluminum based coagulants akgul et al 2017 electro fenton oxidation olvera vargas et al 2019 tio2 nanoparticle based acacia saturated eggshell biocomposite yadav et al 2018 ag mgo nanoparticle

been also implemented to minimize the environmental risk of total coliform and fecal coliform in water examples of these are mainly focused on the processes of ozonation fenton photo fenton electro fenton coagulation flocculation and electro coagulation cheng and fallowfield 2022 dimapilis et al 2018 removal of coliform from water was investigated before and after treatment by the action of electro fenton process and the outlined results referred to 100 removal of coliform using low and high initial coliform contents sreeja and shetty 2017 a multi soil layering msl system based on two stage vertical flow was studied to compare the removal efficiency of coliforms and pathogens under the effects of different water quality including season and arid climate conditions kumar et al 2017 the possible utilization of zn phosphide nanowire to advance water purification under visible light condition as a successful alternative methodology for water disinfection via removal of escherichia coli was previously reported vance et al 2018 the disinfection of fecal streptococci fecal coliform and escherichia coli in wastewater treatment process was studied using a continuous flow us uv

sunlight sharma et al 2018 advanced treatment processes of raw drinking water ground water and other resources from various chemical pollutants are generally accomplished by different methods and techniques irunde et al 2022 ijumulana et al 2022 sarkar 2022 ligate et al 2021 titchou et al 2021 kimambo et al 2019 moreover microbial and biological pollution is generally known to contaminate raw drinking water and ground water therefore purification of drinking water encompasses many approaches based on various techniques including chlorination by the action of some selected chlorinating chemicals liang et al 2022 smith et al 2021 cahoon 2019 however the use of chlorine as a disinfectant was documented to create additional problems with respect to the health and ecological related issues owing to the formation of trihalomethanes disinfection by products dbps these by products were found more toxic and therefore it was forced to restrict the use of chlorination for disinfecting water pandian et al 2022 accordingly alternative materials and technologies are often needed with economical option for water treatment especially in developing countries in addition attention has been directed to discover eco sustainable systems to reduce some pollutants such as human pathogens with less or without the addition of disinfection chemicals as explored via constructed wetlands cws corzo and sanabria 2019 nom and or other inorganic species such as bromide react with disinfection agents as chloramines chlorine and ozone to form dbps in potable water within the disinfection steps jeong et al 2015 haloacetic acids haas a dbps in chlorinated drinking waters were first detected nine years after the thms discovery nissinen al 2002 treatment of surface water can largely be divided into thermal and membrane processes each has its own method of pretreatment and post treatment options one of the most important methods of using thermal system in water treatment is related to the elimination of scaling and corrosion of water bhojwani et al 2019 microwave mw heating system has been recently experienced especially in the last two decades with high interests due to some related advantages to the dielectric heating effects these advantages are mainly relaying on the substantially rapid and efficient heating with high rates in short time and therefore mw technique has been recently used to remove a number of organic and inorganic pollutants from water and wastewater mahmoud et al 2022 mahmoud and abouelanwar 2021 mahmoud al 2021a mahmoud et al 2021b mahmoud et al 2020a mahmoud et al 2020b mahmoud et al 2019 mahmoud et al 2018 mahmoud et al 2017 mahmoud et al 2016a mahmoud et al 2016b in a microwave oven the generated waves are converted into different frequencies and this energy is then absorbed by the polar components in the form of heat vialkova et al 2021 based on these advantages the microwave heating systems have been applied in a number of fields such as waste management water remediation synthetic approaches and others ambrose et al 2020 additionally microwave pretreatment process was employed as an alternative methodology to potentially used thermal pretreatment processes for treating waste materials the application of thermal heating process in water treatment of pathogenic bacteria was directly focused on rupturing the cell membrane of the bacteria to improve the degradability of pretreated waters jiang et al 2021 therefore the application of some energy sources such as microwave have been widely targeted in a number of research papers for water treatment for example degradation of 2 4 dibromophenol 0 1 g l by fenton s reagent was studied assessing the contribution of energy sources of mw and us 300 khz and found that the reaction was carried out under us or mw were more faster and highly efficient cravotto et al 2007 fenton like reactions by microwave were enhanced and reported for the treatment of pharmaceuticals polluted wastewater with high cod loading and poor biodegradability wang et al 2022 removing ammonia from wastewater using microwave mw radiation alone in a pilot scale treatment system was investigated and achieved 80 removal in addition the continuous microwave system was experienced by high and effective potential for ammonia i e nitrogen removal from wastewater of coke plant lin et al 2009 the photocatalytic and photolytic treatments of soft drink wastewater with microwave were strongly accepted in terms of removal rate of chemical oxygen demand cod and oxidation of nh3 to nitrite and nitrate remya and swain 2019 microwave heating technique was successfully adjustable and promoted the implementation of treatment enhancement of polluted organic wastewater mumtaz et al 2022 to the best of our knowledge few research works were found to focus on the treatment of raw drinking water without addition of chemicals or reagents to the investigated samples therefore the present study is designed and aimed to explore the use of a microwave heating system as a green sustainable and promising approach for fast and efficient removal of various biological and chemical pollutants from raw drinking water including total coliform fecal coliform cod bod and ammonia to accomplish this target raw water samples were collected from two different inlet locations khandak el sharqi damanhour canal and mahmoudia fisha canal el beheira governorate egypt to investigate their potential treatments by only microwave heating for a short time period from 10 to 150 s and without addition of other chemicals in an attempt to figure out the performance efficiency rapidness and impact of the microwave heating technique 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and solutions chemicals used in this study for

important for removal of excess turbidity to protect the column the elution conditions were 9 mm na2co3 with flow rate 1 ml min and 1 28 ml methane sulfonic acid in deionized water and then dilute to 1 l with flow rate 1 ml min 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of total coliform and fecal coliform from raw water by microwave heating process coliforms bacteria are commonly found in different places of environments however potable water is not a natural environment for coliforms bacteria and existence of these bacteria in drinking water must at least be considered as an indicative parameter of microbiological water quality depravation rice et al 2017 presence of positive total coliform samples in treated water refers to the inefficiency of treatment loss of disinfectant or the drainage systems are broken indicator organisms are usually used to estimate the presence levels of pathogens in different water resources i e water borne pathogen act as footprints of water resources investigation of the levels of indicator organisms including fecal coliforms and total coliform is a typical way for quantification of the potential pathogen loads in ambient water bodies hautman and munch 1997 the coliform group has been widely applied as a signal of water quality and has historically induced the concept of the protection of human health actually the need for more advantages like fast precise and concrete tests is important and necessary in the industrial water and potable water services the detection sensitivity for presence of coliforms bacteria has been enhanced by depending on certain enzymatic activity from theses enzymes α d galactosidase and β d glucuronidase are widely used in detecting and counting of coliforms bacteria especially total and fecal coliform fecal contamination obtained from humans or animals is a probable cause of enteric bacteria to decrease the health risks water is disinfected to get rid of fecal derived pathogens existing after treating drinking water or wastewater enteric bacteria is also known as fecal coliform bacteria in the intestines of warm blooded animal this bacterium naturally exists both human and animal find such bacterium in human sources includes failure in septic tanks and leakage in sewer lines and sewer overflow although animal source of these bacteria contains manure expansion from livestock on ground in runoff or streams and inappropriate disposition of farm wastes of animals unuabonah et al 2018 in this section the potential application and usage of microwave heating system as an efficient technique to decrease or remove the amount of total coliform already present in the raw water samples has been explored investigated monitored and optimized two different raw water samples 500 ml from each from damanhour and fisha el beheira governorate egypt were collected the two raw water samples were exposed to heating by a microwave oven where the samples were heated at different time periods 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s the effect of microwave heating on the total coliform was investigated and the collected results of this study are listed in table 1 and fig 2 in addition the total coliform bacteria of raw water samples were also identified without using the microwave heating in order to use it as a control sample the inhibition efficiency of total coliform by microwave heating was calculated from eq 3 3 ɳ n 1 n 2 n 1 x 100 where n1 and n2 represent the number of colonies on the plates before and after inhibition respectively it is obvious from the data listed in table 1 and fig 2 that in the first 10 s the percentage removal values of total coliform were found to correspond to 64 and 60 for fisha and damanhour raw water samples respectively then the percentage values in all samples were found to increase as the microwave exposure heating time increased from 25 to 120 s the percentage removals were characterized in the range 82 0 99 2 in fisha and 78 4 98 2 in damanhour water samples finally the removal values of total coliform reached to 100 upon increasing the exposure period of microwave heating to 150 s for both water samples the compiled data in table 2 and fig 3 represent the microwave heating treatment process of the investigated damanhour and fisha raw water samples upon exposure in the microwave for periods of 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s and fecal coliform in each sample was finally measured and identified using the method of membrane filtered the metallic sheen colony was counted as an indication of the presence of fecal coliform bacteria the percentage removal values of fecal coliform bacteria were inhibited in the first 10 s by 52 and 40 for fisha and damanhour respectively accordingly by increasing the microwave heating time from 25 to 120 s the removal percentage values were increased from 80 0 to 98 8 in fisha and from 67 0 to 96 6 in damanhour raw water samples while the removal of the fecal coliform bacteria reaches up to 100 at 150 s for both fisha and damanhour samples thus the implementation of microwave technique for water treatment of total coliform and fecal coliform refers to a highly efficient and rapid process for fully bacterial killing in 150 s heating it has been stated in a number of reports that the mechanism and nature of microwave heating impact on water living organisms as total coliform and fecal coliform are still unknown and not fully understood however other studies revealed that the effect of microwave heating on bacterial killing destruction and removal from water is mainly related to the thermal effect via energy transfer from microwave exposure therefore bacterial killing may be referred to the effect of polarization over the cell wall this polarization is expected to exert acute and excessive potential to cause rupture of the cell membrane woo et al 2000 3 2 removal of biochemical oxygen demand bod from raw water by microwave heating process the direct pollutants emission into streams may exhibit devastating effect on river water quality by spreading diseases and creating a high oxygen demand microorganism present in the raw water stream will oxidize the contact waste slowly via consumption of the available stream oxygen under these conditions the oxygen level cannot be replaced by re aeration at quick enough rate for larger organisms such as fish and macro invertebrates to survive biochemical oxygen demand bod parameter is used as an identification of required oxygen quality for oxidation of biodegradable organic matter already present in the raw water sample by aerobic condition rice et al 2017 the bod test is mainly based on determining and measuring the dissolved oxygen do before and after a 5 day period of incubation for the sample at 20 c to determine the amount of oxygen used biochemically therefore the biochemical oxygen demand under this condition is sometimes referred as bod the oxidation reaction for biochemical oxidation could be suggested according to eq 4 in addition the consumption of oxygen by reduction of chemicals such as sulfides and nitrites is generally accomplished according to eqs 5 and 6 since bacteria and nutrients are present in all natural waterways therefore any introduced waste compound into such waterways will start biochemical reactions such biochemical reactions cause what is known as the biochemical oxygen demand bod 4 oxidizable material nutrient bacteria o2 h2o co2 oxidized inorganics such as so4 2 no3 5 s2 2o2 so4 2 6 no2 ½ o2 no3 to study the effect of water treatment on the bod values in raw water of damanhur and fisha by using microwave heating raw water samples were exposed to different heating times inside the microwave oven the bod values were measured before and after microwave heating treatment at 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s and the results of the study presented here are compiled in table 3 and shown in fig 4 based on the listed data and collected results one can conclude that the values of bod were found to inhibit by 8 0 and 5 6 upon 10 s microwave heating and treatment of the fisha and damanhur raw water samples respectively however excellent improvement in the removal of bod values up to 92 0 and 94 1 of the initial bod values of fisha and damanhur raw water samples respectively were achieved at 150 s microwave heating time in order to figure out the influence of ph conditions on the removal of bod from the fisha and damanhur raw water samples at different exposed microwave heating times another study was performed by adjusting the water samples to different ph values in the range between 2 0 and 6 0 the selected range of ph was established by using h2so4 and all water samples were adjusted to the required ph prior to treatment with microwave heating and the results of the study presented here are represented in table 4 it is obvious that as the ph value increases the percentage removal of bod for the two treated raw water samples also increases at the same time of microwave 3 3 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod from raw water by microwave heating process the increase in pollution by discharging large amount of various chemicals leads to an increase of oxidizable organic substances of different matters which enter in the aquatic system the bod value only does not give an obvious picture of the organic matter contents in water sample furthermore the existence of different toxicants in the wastewater sample may strongly influence the validity of bod test in both bod and cod tests the concentration of organic material is calculated from the consumption of oxidant needed for oxidation of organic material the main differences are the oxidant that is used and the operating conditions used during the tests therefore chemical oxygen demand cod test is the best estimation for organic matter rice et al 2017 however cod is representing the oxygen consumed but it does not differ from the stable organic matters form and the unstable form therefore the cod value could not directly be compared to that of bod the cod value is important in treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater the cod test is more accurate and faster requires only 2 h than bod requires 5 days and therefore cod test is generally applied for direct and rapid evaluation washington 1980 to study the effect of water treatment based on the cod values in raw water of damanhur and fisha by using microwave heating process the samples were exposed to different heating times the cod values were measured before and after microwave heating treatment at 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s and the results of the study presented here are compiled in table 5 the results show a good possibility of using microwave heating for treatment of raw drinking water based on the listed data one can conclude that the values of cod were found to decrease by 2 0 and 4 0 upon heating and treatment of the fisha and damanhur raw water samples respectively for 10 s using microwave heating however excellent improvement in the removal of cod values to 49 and 48 of the initial cod values of fisha and damanhur raw water samples respectively were established upon using 150 s microwave heating time this behavior can be illustrated that the increase in soluble cod at lower temperatures was as a result of the solubility of the organics while at higher temperatures the solubilized organics were transformed by oxidation process into co2 and water chan et al 2007 moreover such decomposition process may be correlated to the thermal effect of microwave treatment for efficient removal of volatile and semi volatile pollutants this behavior is mainly due to the overheated spots which are known as hot spots as these were confirmed to influence and promote the degradation of some dissolved organic matters in water due to high thermal effect as previously reported microwave heating alone was found highly efficient and characterized with excellent performance in thermal decomposition of dissolved volatile semivolatile matters in water based on the molecular level heating via several combined processes of homogeneous and quick thermal reaction decomposition and volatilization zhang et al 2018 wang and wang 2016 in order to evaluate the influence of ph conditions on the removal of cod from fisha and damanhur raw water samples using different exposed microwave times another study was performed by adjusting the water samples to the required ph values in the range between 2 0 and 6 0 the selected range of ph was established by using h2so4 and all water samples were adjusted to the required ph prior to treatment with microwave heating and the results of the study presented here are compiled in table 6 it is obvious that as the ph value decreases the cod percentage removal values of the two treated raw water samples were found slightly unchanged under the same time of microwave heating this confirms that the microwave heating treatment process of raw water may be applied for all water samples in the ph range from 2 0 to 8 2 3 4 removal of ammonia from raw water by microwave heating process another study was performed to investigate monitor and optimize water treatment of ammonia by the aid of microwave heating in an attempt to minimize the presence of ammonia in collected raw water samples from fisha and damanhour two different raw water samples 500 ml each were collected and the initial ph values were initially identified as ph 8 20 and 8 35 for fisha and damanhour respectively and the samples were used under these conditions all samples were left in contact with microwave heating for different times in the range from 10 to 150 s to allow reaction with materials to be decomposed the effect of microwave heating time on ammonia contents was investigated and the results of the study presented here are listed in table 7 and fig 5 in addition the ammonia value of raw water sample was also identified in absence of microwave heating in order to use it as a control sample the calculated average value of ammonia for raw water samples without treatment with microwave heating was found to correspond to 6 71 and 0 50 mg l 1 in fisha and damanhour respectively based on triplicate determination the average ammonia values upon microwave heating and treatment for 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s of fisha raw water were characterized as 6 43 5 81 5 73 4 98 4 57 3 21 and 2 98 mg l 1 respectively and the average ammonia values upon treatment for 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s of damanhour raw water in microwave treatment were characterized as 0 5 0 48 0 46 0 38 0 26 0 14 and 0 0 mg l 1 respectively the results of this study confirm the efficiency of microwave heating process in removing of ammonia from fisha raw water sample by decreasing the value from 6 71 to 2 98 mg l 1 this refers also to deceasing of ammonia value by 55 5 upon microwave heating for 150 s per 500 ml of fisha raw water sample the results of this study emphasize also the efficiency of microwave heating and removal of ammonia from damanhour raw water sample by inhibiting the value from 0 5 mg l 1 to 0 0 mg l 1 this refers also to deceasing of ammonia value by 100 upon using 150 s microwaves heating per 500 ml of damanhour raw water sample finally the optimum condition for microwave heating in raw water treatment of low ammonia concentration levels could be listed as 150s under initial ph 8 2 8 35 the results of this study confirm that the microwave heating and treatment process exhibited good capability of almost complete removal of ammonia from raw waters especially in low concentration therefore microwave technique can be regarded to afford excellent capacity and efficiency for raw water treatment of ammonia heating by microwave radiation is mainly dependent on the factors of ionic conductivity and dipole relaxation time the microwave nonionized radiation was absorbed and manifested to force change in the molecular vibrational energy a large amount of molecular h2o and nh3 exist in ammonia nitrogen of raw water the n h o and o h n intermolecular hydrogen bonding found in the raw water microwave radiation can polarize molecular h2o and nh3 to rotate the dipoles and line up speedily 2450 million times s thus the frequent pendulum vibration of molecular h2o and nh3 causing the weakening and fracture of this intermolecular hydrogen bonding between nh3 and h2o that is useful for the escape of molecular ammonia to the gas phase instead of liquid phase so in conclusion thermal effect played a major and key role in removing ammonia by microwave radiation and the non thermal influence improved the removal to less extent lin et al 2009 another study was performed to test the effect of microwave heating treatment in presence of different adjusted ph values of water samples the selected ph range was at ph 8 13 and all samples were adjusted to the required ph prior to treatment by microwave heating the time used in microwave heating was 180 s the results of this study are listed in table 8 for fisha raw water only because of high ammonia concentration compared to damanhour samples the contribution of ph condition of water samples is evident from the listed data the optimum ph 11 resulted in 98 removal of ammonia to refer to an acceptable agreement with the proportion of molecular solution ammonia it is evident that all the volatile molecular ammonia was removed from raw water by microwave heating finally the ph of solution was decreased from 11 to 10 as a result of the escape of nh3 however insignificant improvement in ammonia removal was detected upon further increasing of the solution ph thus when the temperature of solution was increased near the boiling point the molecular ammonia removed from the solution due to intensity weakening of molecular bond zhang et al 2007 4 conclusion the suitability and validity of using microwave heating technique for water treatments and disinfection of pollutants with major concern as total coliform fecal coliform bod cod and ammonia have been confirmed in this study the established microwave water treatment process was only based on the optimization of thermal heating of raw water samples for short periods of time 10 150 s without using any added chemicals or reagents to the investigated water samples this approach could be employed to afford a sustainable and greener water treatment process the collected results from this study confirm that the investigated raw water samples were only exposed to heating in a microwave oven for 150 s to establish 100 removal and disinfection of the total coliform and fecal coliform 92 94 inhibition of the bod value 48 49 minimization of the initial cod values and 98 100 removal values of ammonia nitrogen therefore the outcome of this study may suggest adaption of this technique in water treatment plants via replacement of the excessive number of operating treatment processes which are mainly characterized by high cost high labor and by products generation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11773,water born pathogen and diseases represent a major concern with respect to water quality in recent years high interests have been focused on controlling water born pathogen especially fecal and total coliform in water resources the disadvantage of water treatment by chlorine is related to the disinfection by products dbps therefore the study presented here is devoted to explore and testify the suitability and validity of microwave heating system as a promising disinfection and treatment process to remove total and fecal coliform as well as bod cod and ammonia from raw drinking water raw water samples were collected from two different inlet locations khandak el sharqi damanhour canal and mahmoudia fisha canal el beheira governorate egypt and subjected to treatment by microwave heating for a period from 10 to 150 s the collected results confirmed that total coliform and fecal coliform were efficiently removed 100 upon microwave heating for 150 s similarly the bod values in raw water samples were 92 94 removed inhibition of cod parameter 48 49 of the initial cod values in raw water samples were confirmed by the influence of also 150 s microwave heating finally the effectiveness of microwave heating for ammonia from water was also established on the basis of excellent percentage removal 100 of low concentration ammonia levels and 98 of high concentration levels of ammonia nitrogen at adjusted raw water samples to ph 10 11 the proposed water treatment method may be regarded as a promising approach for removal of these pollutants from various water sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords microwave heating water disinfection total fecal coliform bod cod ammonia 1 introduction water quality is heavily referred and dependent on the number and type of contaminants that are related to humans animals activities however more than 3 4 million deaths were recorded worldwide by the influence of induced pathogens either by direct or indirect contaminated water with these species who 2020 coliform bacteria have been recently identified as one of the most serious pollutant in water effluents in addition fecal coliform bacteria are generally employed as indicators to refer to the existence of such type of bacteria scott et al 2022 therefore contamination of different types of water with pathogenic bacteria must be minimized and limited to avoid possible health hazards gomes et al 2018 chemical treatments of pathogen have been reported by a number of techniques using silver modified clinoptilolite heulandite rich tuff kumar et al 2020 iron

been also implemented to minimize the environmental risk of total coliform and fecal coliform in water examples of these are mainly focused on the processes of ozonation fenton photo fenton electro fenton coagulation flocculation and electro coagulation cheng and fallowfield 2022 dimapilis et al 2018 removal of coliform from water was investigated before and after treatment by the action of electro fenton process and the outlined results referred to 100 removal of coliform using low and high initial coliform contents sreeja and shetty 2017 a multi soil layering msl system based on two stage vertical flow was studied to compare the removal efficiency of coliforms and pathogens under the effects of different water quality including season and arid climate conditions kumar et al 2017 the possible utilization of zn phosphide nanowire to advance water purification under visible light condition as a successful alternative methodology for water disinfection via removal of escherichia

techniques irunde et al 2022 ijumulana et al 2022 sarkar 2022 ligate et al 2021 titchou et al 2021 kimambo et al 2019 moreover microbial and biological pollution is generally known to contaminate raw drinking water and ground water therefore purification of drinking water encompasses many approaches based on various techniques including chlorination by the action of some selected chlorinating chemicals liang et al 2022 smith et al 2021 cahoon 2019 however the use of chlorine as a disinfectant was documented to create additional problems with respect to the health and ecological related issues owing to the formation of trihalomethanes disinfection by products dbps these by products were found more toxic and therefore it was forced to restrict the use of chlorination for disinfecting water pandian et al 2022 accordingly alternative materials and technologies are often needed with economical option for water treatment especially in developing countries in addition attention has been directed to discover eco sustainable systems to reduce some pollutants such as human pathogens with less or without the addition of disinfection chemicals as explored via constructed wetlands cws corzo and sanabria 2019 nom and or other inorganic species such as bromide react with disinfection agents as chloramines chlorine and ozone to form dbps in potable water within the disinfection steps jeong et al 2015 haloacetic acids haas a dbps in chlorinated drinking waters were first detected nine years after the thms discovery nissinen al 2002 treatment of surface water can largely be divided into thermal and membrane processes each has its own method of pretreatment and post treatment options one of the most important methods of using thermal system in water treatment is related to the elimination of scaling and corrosion of water bhojwani et al 2019 microwave mw heating system has been recently experienced especially in the last two decades with high interests due to some related advantages to the dielectric heating effects these advantages are mainly relaying on the substantially rapid and efficient heating with high rates in short time and therefore mw technique has been recently used to remove a number of organic and inorganic pollutants from water and wastewater mahmoud et al 2022 mahmoud and abouelanwar 2021 mahmoud al 2021a mahmoud et al 2021b mahmoud et al 2020a mahmoud et al 2020b mahmoud et al 2019 mahmoud et al 2018 mahmoud et al 2017 mahmoud et al 2016a mahmoud et al 2016b in a microwave oven the generated waves are converted into different frequencies and this energy is then absorbed by the polar components in the form of heat vialkova et al 2021 based on these advantages the microwave heating systems have been applied in a number of fields such as waste management water remediation synthetic approaches and others ambrose et al 2020 additionally microwave pretreatment process was employed as an alternative methodology to potentially used thermal pretreatment processes for treating waste materials the application of thermal heating process in water treatment of pathogenic bacteria was directly focused on rupturing the cell membrane of the bacteria to improve the degradability of pretreated waters jiang et al 2021 therefore the application of some energy sources such as microwave have been widely targeted in a number of research papers for water treatment for example degradation of 2 4 dibromophenol 0 1 g l by fenton s reagent was studied assessing the contribution of energy sources of mw and us 300 khz and found that the reaction was carried out under us or mw were more faster and highly efficient cravotto et al 2007 fenton like reactions by microwave were enhanced and reported for the treatment of pharmaceuticals polluted wastewater with high cod loading and poor biodegradability wang et al 2022 removing ammonia from wastewater using microwave mw radiation alone in a pilot scale treatment system was investigated and achieved 80 removal in addition the continuous microwave system was experienced by high and effective potential for ammonia i e nitrogen removal from wastewater of coke plant lin et al 2009 the photocatalytic and photolytic treatments of soft drink wastewater with microwave were strongly accepted in terms of removal rate of chemical oxygen demand cod and oxidation of nh3 to nitrite and nitrate remya and swain 2019 microwave heating technique was successfully adjustable and promoted the implementation of treatment enhancement of polluted organic wastewater mumtaz et al 2022 to the best of our knowledge few research works were found to focus on the treatment of raw drinking water without addition of chemicals or reagents to the investigated samples therefore the present study is designed and aimed to explore the use of a microwave heating system as a green sustainable and promising approach for fast and efficient removal of various biological and chemical pollutants from raw drinking water including total coliform fecal coliform cod bod and ammonia to accomplish this target raw water samples were collected from two different inlet locations khandak el sharqi damanhour canal and mahmoudia fisha canal el beheira governorate egypt to investigate their potential treatments by only microwave heating for a short time period from 10 to 150 s and without addition of other chemicals in an attempt to figure out the performance efficiency rapidness and impact of the microwave heating technique 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and solutions chemicals used in this study for

important for removal of excess turbidity to protect the column the elution conditions were 9 mm na2co3 with flow rate 1 ml min and 1 28 ml methane sulfonic acid in deionized water and then dilute to 1 l with flow rate 1 ml min 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of total coliform and fecal coliform from raw water by microwave heating process coliforms bacteria are commonly found in different places of environments however potable water is not a natural environment for coliforms bacteria and existence of these bacteria in drinking water must at least be considered as an indicative parameter of microbiological water quality depravation rice et al 2017 presence of positive total coliform samples in treated water refers to the inefficiency of treatment loss of disinfectant or the drainage systems are broken indicator organisms are usually used to estimate the presence levels of pathogens in different water resources i e water borne pathogen act as footprints of water resources investigation of the levels of indicator organisms including fecal coliforms and total coliform is a typical way for quantification of the potential pathogen loads in ambient water bodies hautman and munch 1997 the coliform group has been widely applied as a signal of water quality and has historically induced the concept of the protection of human health actually the need for more advantages like fast precise and concrete tests is important and necessary in the industrial water and potable water services the detection sensitivity for presence of coliforms bacteria has been enhanced by depending on certain enzymatic activity from theses enzymes α d galactosidase and β d glucuronidase are widely used in detecting and counting of coliforms bacteria especially total and fecal coliform fecal contamination obtained from humans or animals is a probable cause of enteric bacteria to decrease the health risks water is disinfected to get rid of fecal derived pathogens existing after treating drinking water or wastewater enteric bacteria is also known as fecal coliform bacteria in the intestines of warm blooded animal this bacterium naturally exists both human and animal find such bacterium in human sources includes failure in septic tanks and leakage in sewer lines and sewer overflow although animal source of these bacteria contains manure expansion from livestock on ground in runoff or streams and inappropriate disposition of farm wastes of animals unuabonah et al 2018 in this section the potential application and usage of microwave heating system as an efficient technique to decrease or remove the amount of total coliform already present in the raw water samples has been explored investigated monitored and optimized two different raw water samples 500 ml from each from damanhour and fisha el beheira governorate egypt were collected the two raw water samples were exposed to heating by a microwave oven where the samples were heated at different time periods 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s the effect of microwave heating on the total coliform was investigated and the collected results of this study are listed in table 1 and fig 2 in addition the total coliform bacteria of raw water samples were also identified without using the microwave heating in order to use it as a control sample the inhibition efficiency of total coliform by microwave heating was calculated from eq 3 3 ɳ n 1 n 2 n 1 x 100 where n1 and n2 represent the number of colonies on the plates before and after inhibition respectively it is obvious from the data listed in table 1 and fig 2 that in the first 10 s the percentage removal values of total coliform were found to correspond to 64 and 60 for fisha and damanhour raw water samples respectively then the percentage values in all samples were found to increase as the microwave exposure heating time increased from 25 to 120 s the percentage removals were characterized in the range 82 0 99 2 in fisha and 78 4 98 2 in damanhour water samples finally the removal values of total coliform reached to 100 upon increasing the exposure period of microwave heating to 150 s for both water samples the compiled data in table 2 and fig 3 represent the microwave heating treatment process of the investigated damanhour and fisha raw water samples upon exposure in the microwave for periods of 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s and fecal coliform in each sample was finally measured and identified using the method of membrane filtered the metallic sheen colony was counted as an indication of the presence of fecal coliform bacteria the percentage removal values of fecal coliform bacteria were inhibited in the first 10 s by 52 and 40 for fisha and damanhour respectively accordingly by increasing the microwave heating time from 25 to 120 s the removal percentage values were increased from 80 0 to 98 8 in fisha and from 67 0 to 96 6 in damanhour raw water samples while the removal of the fecal coliform bacteria reaches up to 100 at 150 s for both fisha and damanhour samples thus the implementation of microwave technique for water treatment of total coliform and fecal coliform refers to a highly efficient and rapid process for fully bacterial killing in 150 s heating it has been stated in a number of reports that the mechanism and nature of microwave heating impact on water living organisms as total coliform and fecal coliform are still unknown and not fully understood however other studies revealed that the effect of microwave heating on bacterial killing destruction and removal from water is mainly related to the thermal effect via energy transfer from microwave exposure therefore bacterial killing may be referred to the effect of polarization over the cell wall this polarization is expected to exert acute and excessive potential to cause rupture of the cell membrane woo et al 2000 3 2 removal of biochemical oxygen demand bod from raw water by microwave heating process the direct pollutants emission into streams may exhibit devastating effect on river water quality by spreading diseases and creating a high oxygen demand microorganism present in the raw water stream will oxidize the contact waste slowly via consumption of the available stream oxygen under these conditions the oxygen level cannot be replaced by re aeration at quick enough rate for larger organisms such as fish and macro invertebrates to survive biochemical oxygen demand bod parameter is used as an identification of required oxygen quality for oxidation of biodegradable organic matter already present in the raw water sample by aerobic condition rice et al 2017 the bod test is mainly based on determining and measuring the dissolved oxygen do before and after a 5 day period of incubation for the sample at 20 c to determine the amount of oxygen used biochemically therefore the biochemical oxygen demand under this condition is sometimes referred as bod the oxidation reaction for biochemical oxidation could be suggested according to eq 4 in addition the consumption of oxygen by reduction of chemicals such as sulfides and nitrites is generally accomplished according to eqs 5 and 6 since bacteria and nutrients are present in all natural waterways therefore any introduced waste compound into such waterways will start biochemical reactions such biochemical reactions cause what is known as the biochemical oxygen demand bod 4 oxidizable material nutrient bacteria o2 h2o co2 oxidized inorganics such as so4 2 no3 5 s2 2o2 so4 2 6 no2 ½ o2 no3 to study the effect of water treatment on the bod values in raw water of damanhur and fisha by using microwave heating raw water samples were exposed to different heating times inside the microwave oven the bod values were measured before and after microwave heating treatment at 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s and the results of the study presented here are compiled in table 3 and shown in fig 4 based on the listed data and collected results one can conclude that the values of bod were found to inhibit by 8 0 and 5 6 upon 10 s microwave heating and treatment of the fisha and damanhur raw water samples respectively however excellent improvement in the removal of bod values up to 92 0 and 94 1 of the initial bod values of fisha and damanhur raw water samples respectively were achieved at 150 s microwave heating time in order to figure out the influence of ph conditions on the removal of bod from the fisha and damanhur raw water samples at different exposed microwave heating times another study was performed by adjusting the water samples to different ph values in the range between 2 0 and 6 0 the selected range of ph was established by using h2so4 and all water samples were adjusted to the required ph prior to treatment with microwave heating and the results of the study presented here are represented in table 4 it is obvious that as the ph value increases the percentage removal of bod for the two treated raw water samples also increases at the same time of microwave 3 3 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod from raw water by microwave heating process the increase in pollution by discharging large amount of various chemicals leads to an increase of oxidizable organic substances of different matters which enter in the aquatic system the bod value only does not give an obvious picture of the organic matter contents in water sample furthermore the existence of different toxicants in the wastewater sample may strongly influence the validity of bod test in both bod and cod tests the concentration of organic material is calculated from the consumption of oxidant needed for oxidation of organic material the main differences are the oxidant that is used and the operating conditions used during the tests therefore chemical oxygen demand cod test is the best estimation for organic matter rice et al 2017 however cod is representing the oxygen consumed but it does not differ from the stable organic matters form and the unstable form therefore the cod value could not directly be compared to that of bod the cod value is important in treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater the cod test is more accurate and faster requires only 2 h than bod requires 5 days and therefore cod test is generally applied for direct and rapid evaluation washington 1980 to study the effect of water treatment based on the cod values in raw water of damanhur and fisha by using microwave heating process the samples were exposed to different heating times the cod values were measured before and after microwave heating treatment at 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s and the results of the study presented here are compiled in table 5 the results show a good possibility of using microwave heating for treatment of raw drinking water based on the listed data one can conclude that the values of cod were found to decrease by 2 0 and 4 0 upon heating and treatment of the fisha and damanhur raw water samples respectively for 10 s using microwave heating however excellent improvement in the removal of cod values to 49 and 48 of the initial cod values of fisha and damanhur raw water samples respectively were established upon using 150 s microwave heating time this behavior can be illustrated that the increase in soluble cod at lower temperatures was as a result of the solubility of the organics while at higher temperatures the solubilized organics were transformed by oxidation process into co2 and water chan et al 2007 moreover such decomposition process may be correlated to the thermal effect of microwave treatment for efficient removal of volatile and semi volatile pollutants this behavior is mainly due to the overheated spots which are known as hot spots as these were confirmed to influence and promote the degradation of some dissolved organic matters in water due to high thermal effect as previously reported microwave heating alone was found highly efficient and characterized with excellent performance in thermal decomposition of dissolved volatile semivolatile matters in water based on the molecular level heating via several combined processes of homogeneous and quick thermal reaction decomposition and volatilization zhang et al 2018 wang and wang 2016 in order to evaluate the influence of ph conditions on the removal of cod from fisha and damanhur raw water samples using different exposed microwave times another study was performed by adjusting the water samples to the required ph values in the range between 2 0 and 6 0 the selected range of ph was established by using h2so4 and all water samples were adjusted to the required ph prior to treatment with microwave heating and the results of the study presented here are compiled in table 6 it is obvious that as the ph value decreases the cod percentage removal values of the two treated raw water samples were found slightly unchanged under the same time of microwave heating this confirms that the microwave heating treatment process of raw water may be applied for all water samples in the ph range from 2 0 to 8 2 3 4 removal of ammonia from raw water by microwave heating process another study was performed to investigate monitor and optimize water treatment of ammonia by the aid of microwave heating in an attempt to minimize the presence of ammonia in collected raw water samples from fisha and damanhour two different raw water samples 500 ml each were collected and the initial ph values were initially identified as ph 8 20 and 8 35 for fisha and damanhour respectively and the samples were used under these conditions all samples were left in contact with microwave heating for different times in the range from 10 to 150 s to allow reaction with materials to be decomposed the effect of microwave heating time on ammonia contents was investigated and the results of the study presented here are listed in table 7 and fig 5 in addition the ammonia value of raw water sample was also identified in absence of microwave heating in order to use it as a control sample the calculated average value of ammonia for raw water samples without treatment with microwave heating was found to correspond to 6 71 and 0 50 mg l 1 in fisha and damanhour respectively based on triplicate determination the average ammonia values upon microwave heating and treatment for 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s of fisha raw water were characterized as 6 43 5 81 5 73 4 98 4 57 3 21 and 2 98 mg l 1 respectively and the average ammonia values upon treatment for 10 25 50 75 100 120 and 150 s of damanhour raw water in microwave treatment were characterized as 0 5 0 48 0 46 0 38 0 26 0 14 and 0 0 mg l 1 respectively the results of this study confirm the efficiency of microwave heating process in removing of ammonia from fisha raw water sample by decreasing the value from 6 71 to 2 98 mg l 1 this refers also to deceasing of ammonia value by 55 5 upon microwave heating for 150 s per 500 ml of fisha raw water sample the results of this study emphasize also the efficiency of microwave heating and removal of ammonia from damanhour raw water sample by inhibiting the value from 0 5 mg l 1 to 0 0 mg l 1 this refers also to deceasing of ammonia value by 100 upon using 150 s microwaves heating per 500 ml of damanhour raw water sample finally the optimum condition for microwave heating in raw water treatment of low ammonia concentration levels could be listed as 150s under initial ph 8 2 8 35 the results of this study confirm that the microwave heating and treatment process exhibited good capability of almost complete removal of ammonia from raw waters especially in low concentration therefore microwave technique can be regarded to afford excellent capacity and efficiency for raw water treatment of ammonia heating by microwave radiation is mainly dependent on the factors of ionic conductivity and dipole relaxation time the microwave nonionized radiation was absorbed and manifested to force change in the molecular vibrational energy a large amount of molecular h2o and nh3 exist in ammonia nitrogen of raw water the n h o and o h n intermolecular hydrogen bonding found in the raw water microwave radiation can polarize molecular h2o and nh3 to rotate the dipoles and line up speedily 2450 million times s thus the frequent pendulum vibration of molecular h2o and nh3 causing the weakening and fracture of this intermolecular hydrogen bonding between nh3 and h2o that is useful for the escape of molecular ammonia to the gas phase instead of liquid phase so in conclusion thermal effect played a major and key role in removing ammonia by microwave radiation and the non thermal influence improved the removal to less extent lin et al 2009 another study was performed to test the effect of microwave heating treatment in presence of different adjusted ph values of water samples the selected ph range was at ph 8 13 and all samples were adjusted to the required ph prior to treatment by microwave heating the time used in microwave heating was 180 s the results of this study are listed in table 8 for fisha raw water only because of high ammonia concentration compared to damanhour samples the contribution of ph condition of water samples is evident from the listed data the optimum ph 11 resulted in 98 removal of ammonia to refer to an acceptable agreement with the proportion of molecular solution ammonia it is evident that all the volatile molecular ammonia was removed from raw water by microwave heating finally the ph of solution was decreased from 11 to 10 as a result of the escape of nh3 however insignificant improvement in ammonia removal was detected upon further increasing of the solution ph thus when the temperature of solution was increased near the boiling point the molecular ammonia removed from the solution due to intensity weakening of molecular bond zhang et al 2007 4 conclusion the suitability and validity of using microwave heating technique for water treatments and disinfection of pollutants with major concern as total coliform fecal coliform bod cod and ammonia have been confirmed in this study the established microwave water treatment process was only based on the optimization of thermal heating of raw water samples for short periods of time 10 150 s without using any added chemicals or reagents to the investigated water samples this approach could be employed to afford a sustainable and greener water treatment process the collected results from this study confirm that the investigated raw water samples were only exposed to heating in a microwave oven for 150 s to establish 100 removal and disinfection of the total coliform and fecal coliform 92 94 inhibition of the bod value 48 49 minimization of the initial cod values and 98 100 removal values of ammonia nitrogen therefore the outcome of this study may suggest adaption of this technique in water treatment plants via replacement of the excessive number of operating treatment processes which are mainly characterized by high cost high labor and by products generation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11774,in developing countries community based projects of water supply cbws are implemented rapidly as an improved solution to rural water supply systems however sustainability has been a major concern for these projects analytical hierarchy process a multi criteria decision framework is used in this study to evaluate the sustainability of four types of community based water supply schemes and compare the results to focus on the relative performance of each type analyze the drawbacks and thus bring about necessary modifications in decision making for the stakeholders 57 quantifiable sub criteria were identified and weighted to model the hierarchy structure under environmental economic and social criteria of sustainability several supply sources belonging to those 4 cbws types were inspected to be scored for the 57 sub criteria the median of the scores of the sources under each type was taken as the score of that type data were collected by household survey site survey in person interviews expert opinion and observation the study results show that supply sources that run under private ownership and operation having more than 100 users show the best sustainability score much attention is needed to sources that are owned and operated by the government solely the completeness of the study made a robust baseline that can identify strategies and suggest efficient management in similar rural community based water supply projects graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainability assessment community based projects of water supply multi criteria decision framework analytical hierarchy process developing countries data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction among the sustainable development goals sdgs adopted by the united nations to build a better world by 2030 goal 6 works to ensure sustainable water and sanitation system for all united nations 2015 as a part of that countries all over the world have come forward to ensure sufficient water for their citizens by initializing proper schemes through government authorities promoting non government initiatives and providing subsidies to local projects access to safe water is a prerequisite to a sustainable community as availability and reliability of drinking water is a measure of wealth and security dong et al 2018 the aspect of sustainability may vary in accordance with the purpose of a project that its stakeholders are looking for brown et al 1987 mitcham 1995 in general sustainability may be defined as the development that meets the demand of the present generation without compromising the ability to meet the demand of the future brundtland 1987 sustainability in water services is defined as when water continues to be available in the same quantity and of the same quality for the period a supply source is designed abrams et al 1998 in developing countries piped water supply network is available in urban areas drinking water demands of the rest of the population living in rural areas are mostly met by local groundwater supply schemes namely community based projects of water supply cbws these are one of the major improved drinking water solutions for non urban area residents where piped water supply network is not available colebatch et al 2010 schouten and moriaty 2003 these schemes are feasibly effective for meeting water requirements of small to medium groups of people bangladesh a south asian developing country has managed improved water systems for more than 97 of its population who 2015 however less than 40 of its population has access to safely managed water services hossain et al 2021 about half of the supplied water was found to be contaminated with microbes heavy metals or salt world bank 2018 mostafa et al 2017 besides these cbws projects often raise questions regarding their sustainability maryati et al 2022 the scarcity of surface water has made groundwater an essential source to meet urban industrial and irrigation water demands during the dry season michael and voss 2009 alam et al 2003 the main source of groundwater recharge is rainfall rivers or reservoirs liu and yamanaka 2012 besides in agriculture prone areas irrigation return flow is another source of groundwater recharge martínez et al 2009 séraphin et al 2016 but in the northern region due to geographical location and practice of conservation agriculture there exists a thick clay layer forcing the aquifer to act nearly as an aquitard which hinders groundwater recharge by increasing surface runoff thus with the increasing withdrawal of groundwater and less recharge groundwater table has been falling for years bangladesh local governance support project 2017 in most cases cbws projects are also affected by post construction management water quality low yields from sources or a combination thereof behailu et al 2017 people who are responsible seem not to understand the concepts of sustainability in planning decision making and maintenance of these water withdrawal sources barnes and ashbolt 2014 they have a deficit of technology or infrastructure and lack of knowledge or experience in operating resulting in the premature failure of these projects dickson et al 2016 moreover a meaningful sustainability assessment needs the determination of a proper scale of analysis köne and kara 2012 lots of research have been done on the evaluation and measurement of sustainability and most of them are done on global standards as units however many authors believe that these standards should be modified according to local circumstances when applying to local projects reed et al 2006 graymore et al 2008 zeijl rozema and martens 2010 so it is significant to determine proper units and guidelines considering multi discipline and assess the sustainability of these sources of water supply following those guidelines in bangladesh groundwater extraction is mostly done in rural areas by installing shallow tubewells hand pumps deep tubewells and submersible pumps sikder and salehin 2015 major projects have been undertaken since 2002 these projects are implemented by government departments non government organizations and mostly funded by the government of bangladesh gob and united nations capital development fund fig 2 based on ownership and operation all these projects can be categorized into four types table 1 this paper aims to assess the sustainability of these four types of community based projects of water supply cbws and compare the results to show water supply sources under which cbws type can be considered the most sustainable overall three major criteria of sustainability have been considered environmental economic and social necessary indicators or sub criteria under each criterion have been outlined based on standard recommendations from different authors and critical local issues to address the locally arisen barriers an analytical hierarchy process ahp model is created by combining all criteria and sub criteria in the form of a tree as it is efficient in integrating indicators of different units the model is applied to four alternatives to assess their sustainability score and compare 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of study area rajshahi district situated in the north western nw region of bangladesh is selected as the study area it is the fourth largest city in bangladesh and lies between 24 07 and 24 43 north latitudes and between 88 17 and 88 58 east longitudes the district has a land area of 2407 01 square kilometers and a population of 2 286 874 the department of public health engineering dphe is the state government organization to facilitate rural water supply systems in rajshahi some of the projects are undertaken by the local government engineering department lged and barind multipurpose development authority bmda in addition there are some involvements of non government organizations ngos private partners and development partners to improve water supply and sanitation systems policy support unit 2009 the aquifer transmissibility t ranges from 1019 to 6000 m2 day and storage coefficient s values range from 5 54 106 to 0 673 rahaman et al 2019 groundwater is the principal source of water for the dwellers and is used for irrigation purposes also however the only source of groundwater recharge is rainfall in this region it also has the minimum depth of rainfall annually in bangladesh in the monsoon mean annual rainfall amount is 1625 mm which is much less than the national average amount of 2550 mm current research shows that the depth of groundwater level in rajshahi is following a significant falling trend groundwater table in a lot of places always remains below the critical depth of 6 m necessary for operating suction mode pumps mojid et al 2019 thus special attention is needed to studying sustainability in rajshahi before the conditions get any worse a map of rajshahi district showing all the sub districts selected cbws sources and mean annual rainfall has been shown in fig 1 2 2 monitoring framework 2 2 1 selection of an appropriate method for multi criteria analysis multi criteria analysis mca or multi criteria decision analysis mcda is vastly used where explicit assessment is needed considering multiple objectives and criteria or attributes in decision making problems by using various methods techniques or tools it structures problems and finalizes decision making in a transparent and consistent manner different methods are available for conducting an mca analytical hierarchy process ahp technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions topsis complex proportional assessment copras and multi objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis multimoora are the most common mca methods zlaugotne et al 2020 in spite of some criticisms munier and hontoria 2021 most research works done by researchers have utilized ahp as a suitable approach for assessing the sustainability of water supply and sanitation problems as it permits to modeling of a complex problem in a hierarchical structure showing the relationships between the goal criteria objectives sub criteria and alternatives saaty 1994 anagnostopoulos and vavatsikos 2006 in addition utility of a system can be reflected through decision maker selection without the need for a full tradeoff function or special computer program codes olson 1988 so ahp is selected as the mca method for this study the basic of ahp is to create a pairwise comparison matrix to simplify the judicial process with 1 9 ratio scaling as shown in table 2 saaty 1994 if any set of n elements is assumed then a sample of n x m matrix can be produced as shown below by pair wise comparisons of each element a а 11 а 12 а 1 n а 21 а 22 а 2 n а n 1 а n 2 а n m the ratio between the elements is calculated by the formula a i j w i w j where wi and wj are corresponding importance considering the reciprocal axiom we have a i j 1 а j i the general form of the comparison matrix is as follows a w 1 w 1 w 1 w 2 w 1 w n w 2 w 1 w 2 w 2 w 2 w n w n w 1 w n w 2 w n w n the next step is to calculate the normalized matrix b b i j it is calculated as per the formula b i j 1 i 1 n a i j the value of weights or eigenvector w w i from the normalized matrix is calculated as per the formula w i j 1 n b i j n after that we must check the consistency of the result for validating the reliability of the result the consistency ratio cr is calculated from the following formula which helps us to find the discrepancy in the results c r c i r i ri is called the random index and can be found from tables 3 and 4 table 3 shows ri values for elements up to 15 table 4 shows ri values for elements over 15 ci is the consistency index which can be calculated from the following formula c i λ max n n 1 where λ max is the principal eigenvalue and n is the number of rows or columns of the square matrix if cr 0 10 then the evaluation can be considered sufficiently coherent saaty 1980 however if cr 0 10 then the assessment may require some revision to increase consistency 2 2 2 selection of criteria and sub criteria structuring the sustainability model is the basic of ahp the model consists of some criteria or attributes sub criteria or indicators and alternatives for satisfactory results addressing the proper criteria and sub criteria play a substantial role for this reason an expert panel of 3 professors 2 professionals and 2 officials from the government authority in the relevant field were asked for opinions whenever necessary in this study we define three major criteria or attributes environmental economic and social giné and pérez foguet 2008 boukhari et al 2018 daniel et al 2021 mukherjee and wijk 2002 panthi and bhattarai 2008 okeola and sule 2011 motevallian et al 2011 environmental sustainability means the ability of the environmental processes to contain ways of human lifestyle balkema et al 2002 nature runs at its own pace this viability should be retained by proper utilization of natural resources to stimulate long term sustainable development this is the criterion that maintains ecological balance and prevents natural systems from destruction sev 2009 economic sustainability implies that the overall costs should not exceed the benefits of a project it is assessed on both micro and macroeconomic aspects including construction costs to operational costs and subsidies from government authorities for investment and maintenance another thing associated with projects involving many beneficiaries is the collective effort to work together each cbws source is used by a number of users domesticated animals and irrigation purposes so these sources should be kept free from contamination to ensure health that s why a proper policy is required describing code of conduct formation of a committee to take responsibility keep records and so on besides willingness to manage time and labor pay whenever necessary solve complexities and minimization of illegal usage are some of the social facts essential for a functional process next research works done by different researchers on rural water supply or sanitation were explored to find out the standard indicators all of these were noted and followed by a screening process to ensure relevance to the study after that the local circumstances were considered to cover all possible other indicators that can affect the sustainability of cbws projects a total of 57 indicators or sub criteria were finalized with the approval of the expert panel table 5 then the sub criteria were grouped under their corresponding criteria each sub criterion was linked to quantifiable data for each alternative data collection method for each sub criterion was also finalized 2 2 3 formation of ahp tree an ahp tree was formed keeping the goal at the top the criteria at the second sub criteria at the third and the alternatives at the bottom the goal is to assess the sustainability of the rural cbws types situated at rajshahi for this assessment 3 criteria and 57 sub criteria were finalized before as the sustainability parameters field surveys were done in 9 sub districts of rajshahi to find out the available alternatives a timeline of cbws projects in rajshahi is shown in fig 2 activities of bmda 2016 the local climate adaptive living facility 2022 world bank 2017 closed project list 2022 these community based water supply schemes in rajshahi can be categorized under 4 major types based on ownership and operation they are taken as available alternatives for the hierarchy tree the assessment was done on these four alternatives to find out their individual score and thus which of them is the most sustainable the types are shown in table 1 ahp tree of the model made for this study is shown in fig 3 2 2 4 data collection when the 3 criteria and 57 sub criteria were fixed the main focus was on how to measure them for a quantifiable value 12 data collection teams of surveyors were formed who went to individual water supply sources under different data collection were applied household survey hs site survey ss in person interview pi expert opinion eo and observation o structured survey sheets were made consisting of questionnaires blanks notes and charts household surveys were done to figure out information like an estimation of the number of users nature of training received literacy female participation committee formation and so on site surveys were held for issues like hygiene waste management atmospheric emissions drainage systems the kinds of household chores done involvement of domesticated animals inspection of the condition of sources at present and probable risks that can encounter in future days and the corresponding part of the survey sheet was filled the team took interviews of the users committee members if any existed and relevant government authorities to collect all necessary information including managerial aspects technical issues environmental facts that may risk the cbws sources legal and financial aspects community involvement post construction supports operation users satisfaction etc consent was taken prior to starting any conversation during the interview people of ages ranging from 13 to 70 were covered it was to properly identify the changes in years population dynamics administrative differences people have experienced overall operation and maintenance of the system and how they solved barriers during the life span of the supply source if any issue needed further analysis to address they were depicted in front of the expert panel via photos recordings or charts for their valuable opinions at last 500 ml of water were collected through sampling from overhead tanks pipelines and intake of each source they were transported to a laboratory located at a 1 h driving distance for laboratory testing thus information about water quality parameters was observed in this way parts in the survey sheet related to each data collection mean were filled type 2 and type 3 were abundant in all 9 sub districts of rajshahi whereas type 1 was found lowest in number a breakdown of survey sources that were done is shown in table 6 2 2 5 scoring of alternatives while measurements of the sources of four alternatives were taken for each sub criteria in the data collection phase it was seen that there were basically data of two categories most of them were numerical figures whereas some others had answers based on specific conditions for example say energy consumption per day to produce one unit of water has a numerical value as an answer on the other hand inspection of any visual pollution source has an answer based on the condition of the individual water supply source so two different policies were applied to score alternatives on a scale of 0 5 sub criteria which had numerical measurements for the alternatives were compared to a corresponding standard value the alternative which measured closest to the standard value received the highest score for that sub criterion i e 5 out of 5 in this way the alternative which measured the second closest to the standard value received the second highest score i e 3 or 4 out of 5 and the one having the most distant value received the lowest score or 0 or 1 out of 5 if no standardized value was found or applicable then the best value most or least was scored the highest all the alternatives were scored as per guidance and opinions of the expert panel now sub criteria which did not return numerical answers needed to be scaled first the scaling process was done after observing the condition of each alternative meticulously there could be 5 conditions excellent very good good fair and poor scoring was done based on the type of conditions detailed scoring based on types is shown in table 7 2 2 6 application of the framework to determine sustainability scores a pairwise comparison matrix was created among the sub criteria under each criterion for doing this the relative importance of each sub criterion over another was determined and the intensity of importance was put in the matrix from table 2 from the pairwise comparison matrix the local weight of each sub criterion was determined later on the consistency ratio cr was checked for each matrix to keep it below 0 10 a 3 3 pairwise comparison matrix was developed for the criteria and similarly the weight of each of the was determined in achieving the goal while putting on the relative importance considerations of different researchers in their work local circumstances opinions of expert panel members government authorities and beneficiaries of the projects were kept in mind at last the sustainability score of each type of cbws was determined and compared to figure out the most sustainable alternative 3 results and discussions pairwise comparison was carried out separately among the criteria and sub criteria under each criterion of the hierarchy structure to establish consistency of the judgment the inputs were calibrated the geometric mean of the relative importance given by each member of the expert panel is estimated for each sub criterion and put as an element of the pairwise comparison matrix the group judgment of n decision makers can be written as karamouz et al 2003 a i j a i j 1 a i j 2 a i j 3 a i j n 1 n here n is the number of decision makers and aij is the group judgment of relative importance of sub criteria i compared to sib criteria j pairwise comparison matrix of the criteria is shown in table 8 the normalized matrix for criteria derived from the pairwise comparison matrix is shown in table 9 the weight of each criterion is determined from the normalized matrix as shown in fig 4 later on the consistency was checked for the criteria weight and was found 0 05 which is less than 0 1 hence the allocation of relative importance can be considered satisfactory after that pairwise comparison matrix of sub criteria under criterion environmental was determined and shown in table 10 the normalized matrix derived from the pairwise comparison matrix is shown in table 11 the local weights of the sub criteria under criterion environmental is determined from the normalized matrix and shown in fig 5 similarly the local weight of all other sub criteria was determined now the study needed a typical picture of the cbws types to minimize the effect of outliers and skews while scoring the median value was considered bonamente 2017 ross 2014 for example we want to score the 4 cbws types for sub criterion eco 2 maintenance cost 13 52 63 and 31 observation points were considered under cbws type 1 type 2 type 3 and type 4 respectively each observation point was scored and the median score was taken as the score of that type table 12 table 13 table 14 and table 15 show individual scores of the supply sources under type 1 type 2 type 3 and type 4 fig 6 fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 show the boxplots of the scores and their median values similarly the median score was calculated considering other 56 sub criteria for all the cbws types table 16 shows a detailed description of how the sub criteria were measured their local and global weights and the scores given to each cbws type then the score of each cbws type was multiplied by the global weight of each sub criterion to determine the sustainability score for that sub criterion thus sustainability scores for all sub criteria were determined and added to find the overall sustainability score of each cbws type fig 10 shows the overall sustainability score of the cbws types fig 10 shows that cbws type 3 has the best sustainability score of 3 48 in comparison to other types and hence can be considered the most sustainable type 3 is followed by type 2 type 4 and type 1 respectively type 1 has the least sustainability score of 3 18 which is almost 10 less than the maximum value the above results indicate an important factor though dphe is the primary government organization responsible for rural water supply system in bangladesh privately owned and operated supply schemes having more than 100 users ranked first with the highest overall score most of them are implemented by ngo s development partners and personal funds of users government owned and privately operated schemes show a close call with privately owned and operated schemes of more than 100 users type 4 secures a good sustainability score and is also implemented mostly by personal funds at a micro level the results prove that they are contributing significantly to secure water safety secondly major discrepancy is seen among the alternatives for some sub criteria for example talking about the environmental factors of cbws type 1 table 16 shows that the users are often skeptical about the type s quality control receiving a score of only 3 whereas 5 is the highest score energy consumption has been another factor for type 1 compared to the other alternatives there are some issues with the quality of drinking water the physical and chemical parameters of water are not good enough in comparison to other alternatives moreover from economic aspects scores for sub criteria eco 9 shows that type 1 is less transparent than other alternatives eco 12 says that these schemes need to increase the usage of yearly surplus funds too from social perspective scores of soc 3 and soc 4 says that a lot of unregistered people illegally use water from these sources and often people are not willing to pay in case of any emergency requirement in comparison to other alternatives overall supply sources under type 1 need special attention in low scoring sub criteria because these supply sources scored less in the most number of sub criteria than others a re evaluation of policy and modification in implementation to overcome lacking in those sub criteria factors is mandatory consistency is seen among the environmental economic and social aspects of cbws type 2 and cbws type 3 sources however lots of sub criteria scored low sub criteria env 18 implies that several supply sources under type 2 and 3 are closer to pollution sources like industrial discharge or waste dumping stations eco 3 suggests that the average cost of construction of type 2 is pretty much high eco 10 says that the transaction records are not properly kept in the record books the legal framework needs to be improved for type 3 on the other hand cbws type 4 has received a lower score of just 3 compared to the other types for non renewable energy usage and access to advanced technology as a privately owned and operated type the rate of usage of fossil fuel is comparatively high here due to a lack of awareness and regulations communal harmony has been a factor for cbws type 4 according to soc 2 people have a tendency to install privately owned supply sources within their own religious communities users of type 4 are not properly trained about the hygiene or maintenance of the sources according to soc 9 there are no regulatory guidelines either in bangladeshi communities successful technology transfer is largely dependent upon cultural values soc 11 implies that other than type 1 and 2 cbws type 3 and 4 are more susceptible to cultural values social states

participating in decision making for nearly all the cbws types particularly for types 2 3 and 4 the policy of cost recovery for types 2 3 and 4 should be revised to include low income households in

outlined in this study for a system to be sustainable there is no other alternative than to pinpoint the struggling factors and work on them 4 conclusion though there are several low scoring sub criteria due to the natural phenomena and geographical location of rajshahi some sub criteria either need a massive investment to improve scores or simply cannot be helped for example the meteorological or geo hydrological data like annual rainfall base flow evapotranspiration temperature humidity and infiltration rate are set by nature therefore scopes should be utilized where

11774,in developing countries community based projects of water supply cbws are implemented rapidly as an improved solution to rural water supply systems however sustainability has been a major concern for these projects analytical hierarchy process a multi criteria decision framework is used in this study to evaluate the sustainability of four types of community based water supply schemes and compare the results to focus on the relative performance of each type analyze the drawbacks and thus bring about necessary modifications in decision making for the stakeholders 57 quantifiable sub criteria were identified and weighted to model the hierarchy structure under environmental economic and social criteria of sustainability several supply sources belonging to those 4 cbws types were inspected to be scored for the 57 sub criteria the median of the scores of the sources under each type was taken as the score of that type data were collected by household survey site survey in person interviews expert opinion and observation the study results show that supply sources that run under private ownership and operation having more than 100 users show the best sustainability score much attention is needed to sources that are owned and operated by the government solely the completeness of the study made a robust baseline that can identify strategies and suggest efficient management

analytical hierarchy process developing countries data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction among the sustainable development goals sdgs adopted by the united nations to build a better world by 2030 goal 6 works to ensure sustainable water and sanitation system for all united nations 2015 as a part of that countries all over the world have come forward to ensure sufficient water for their citizens by initializing proper schemes through government authorities promoting non government initiatives and providing subsidies to local projects access to safe water is a prerequisite to a sustainable community as availability and reliability of drinking water is a measure of wealth and security dong et al 2018 the aspect of sustainability may vary in accordance with the purpose of a project that its stakeholders are looking for brown et al 1987 mitcham 1995 in general sustainability may be defined as the development that meets the demand of the present generation without compromising the ability to meet the demand of the future brundtland 1987 sustainability in water services is defined as when water continues to be available in the same quantity and of the same quality for the period a supply source is designed abrams et al 1998 in developing countries piped water supply network is available in urban areas drinking water demands of the rest of the population living in rural areas are mostly met by local groundwater supply schemes namely community based projects of water supply cbws these are one of the major improved drinking water solutions for non urban area residents where piped water supply network is not available colebatch et al 2010 schouten and moriaty 2003 these schemes are feasibly effective for meeting water requirements of small to medium groups of people bangladesh a south asian developing country has managed improved water systems for more than 97 of its population who 2015 however less than 40 of its population has access to safely managed water services hossain et al 2021 about half of the supplied water was found to be contaminated with microbes heavy metals or salt world bank 2018 mostafa et al 2017 besides these cbws projects often raise questions regarding their sustainability maryati et al 2022 the scarcity of surface water has made groundwater an essential source to meet urban industrial and irrigation water demands during the dry season michael and voss 2009 alam et al 2003 the main source of groundwater recharge is rainfall rivers or reservoirs liu and yamanaka 2012 besides in agriculture prone areas irrigation return flow is another source of groundwater recharge martínez et al 2009 séraphin et al 2016 but in the northern region due to geographical location and practice of conservation agriculture there exists a thick clay layer forcing the aquifer to act nearly as an aquitard which hinders groundwater recharge by increasing surface runoff thus with the increasing withdrawal of groundwater and less recharge groundwater table has been falling for years bangladesh local governance support project 2017 in most cases cbws projects are also affected by post construction management water quality low yields from sources or a combination thereof behailu et al 2017 people who are responsible seem not to understand the concepts of sustainability in planning decision making and maintenance of these water withdrawal sources barnes and ashbolt 2014 they have a deficit of technology or infrastructure and lack of knowledge or experience in operating resulting in the premature failure of these projects dickson et al 2016 moreover a meaningful sustainability assessment needs the determination of a proper scale of analysis köne and kara 2012 lots of research have been done on the evaluation and measurement of sustainability and most of them are done on global standards as units however many authors believe that these standards should be modified according to local circumstances when applying to local projects reed et al 2006 graymore et al 2008 zeijl rozema and martens 2010 so it is significant to determine proper units and guidelines considering multi discipline and assess the sustainability of these sources of water supply following those guidelines in bangladesh groundwater extraction is mostly done in rural areas by installing shallow tubewells hand pumps deep tubewells and submersible pumps sikder and salehin 2015 major projects have been undertaken since 2002 these projects are implemented by government departments non government organizations and mostly funded by the government of bangladesh gob and united nations capital development fund fig 2 based on ownership and operation all these projects can be categorized into four types table 1 this paper aims to assess the sustainability of these four types of community based projects of water supply cbws and compare the results to show water supply sources under which cbws type can be considered the most sustainable overall three major criteria of sustainability have been considered environmental economic and social necessary indicators or sub criteria under each criterion have been outlined based on standard recommendations from different authors and critical local issues to address the locally arisen barriers an analytical hierarchy process ahp model is created by combining all criteria and sub criteria in the form of a tree as it is efficient in integrating indicators of different units the model is applied to four alternatives to assess their sustainability score and compare 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of study area rajshahi district situated in the north western nw region of bangladesh is selected as the study area it is the fourth largest city in bangladesh and lies between 24 07 and 24 43 north latitudes and between 88 17 and 88 58 east longitudes the district has a land area of 2407 01 square kilometers and a population of 2 286 874 the department of public health engineering dphe is the state government organization to facilitate rural water supply systems in rajshahi some of the projects are undertaken by the local government engineering department lged and barind multipurpose development authority bmda in addition there are some involvements of non government organizations ngos private partners and development partners to improve water supply and sanitation systems policy support unit 2009 the aquifer transmissibility t ranges from 1019 to 6000 m2 day and storage coefficient s values range from 5 54 106 to 0 673 rahaman et al 2019 groundwater is the principal source of water for the dwellers and is used for irrigation purposes also however the only source of groundwater recharge is rainfall in this region it also has the minimum depth of rainfall annually in bangladesh in the monsoon mean annual rainfall amount is 1625 mm which is much less than the national average amount of 2550 mm current research shows that the depth of groundwater level in rajshahi is following a significant falling trend groundwater table in a lot of places always remains below the critical depth of 6 m necessary for operating suction mode pumps mojid et al 2019 thus special attention is needed to studying sustainability in rajshahi before the conditions get any worse a map of rajshahi district showing all the sub districts selected cbws sources and mean annual rainfall has been shown in fig 1 2 2 monitoring framework 2 2 1 selection of an appropriate method for multi criteria analysis multi criteria analysis mca or multi criteria decision analysis mcda is vastly used where explicit assessment is needed considering multiple objectives and criteria or attributes in decision making problems by using various methods techniques or tools it structures problems and finalizes decision making in a transparent and consistent manner different methods are available for conducting an mca analytical hierarchy process ahp technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions topsis complex proportional assessment copras and multi objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis multimoora are the most common mca methods zlaugotne et al 2020 in spite of some criticisms munier and hontoria 2021 most research works done by researchers have utilized ahp as a suitable approach for assessing the sustainability of water supply and sanitation problems as it permits to modeling of a complex problem in a hierarchical structure showing the relationships between the goal criteria objectives sub criteria and alternatives saaty 1994 anagnostopoulos and vavatsikos 2006 in addition utility of a system can be reflected through decision maker selection without the need for a full tradeoff function or special computer program codes olson 1988 so ahp is selected as the mca method for this study the basic of ahp is to create a pairwise comparison matrix to simplify the judicial process with 1 9 ratio scaling as shown in table 2 saaty 1994 if any set of n elements is assumed then a sample of n x m matrix can be produced as shown below by pair wise comparisons of each element a а 11 а 12 а 1 n а 21 а 22 а 2 n а n 1 а n 2 а n m the ratio between the elements is calculated by the formula a i j w i w j where wi and wj are corresponding importance considering the reciprocal axiom we have a i j 1 а j i the general form of the comparison matrix is as follows a w 1 w 1 w 1 w 2 w 1 w n w 2 w 1 w 2 w 2 w 2 w n w n w 1 w n w 2 w n w n the next step is to calculate the normalized matrix b b i j it is calculated as per the formula b i j 1 i 1 n a i j the value of weights or eigenvector w w i from the normalized matrix is calculated as per the formula w i j 1 n b i j n after that we must check the consistency of the result for validating the reliability of the result the consistency ratio cr is calculated from the following formula which helps us to find the discrepancy in the results c r c i r i ri is called the random index and can be found from tables 3 and 4 table 3 shows ri values for elements up to 15 table 4 shows ri values for elements over 15 ci is the consistency index which can be calculated from the following formula c i λ max n n 1 where λ max is the principal eigenvalue and n is the number of rows or columns of the square matrix if cr 0 10 then the evaluation can be considered sufficiently coherent saaty 1980 however if cr 0 10 then the assessment may require some revision to increase consistency 2 2 2 selection of criteria and sub criteria structuring the sustainability model is the basic of ahp the model consists of some criteria or attributes sub criteria or indicators and alternatives for satisfactory results addressing the proper criteria and sub criteria play a substantial role for this reason an expert panel of 3 professors 2 professionals and 2 officials from the government authority in the relevant field were asked for opinions whenever necessary in this study we define three major criteria or attributes environmental economic and social giné and pérez foguet 2008 boukhari et al 2018 daniel et al 2021 mukherjee and wijk 2002 panthi and bhattarai 2008 okeola and sule 2011 motevallian et al 2011 environmental sustainability means the ability of the environmental processes to contain ways of human lifestyle balkema et al 2002 nature runs at its own pace this viability should be retained by proper utilization of natural resources to stimulate long term sustainable development this is the criterion that maintains ecological balance and prevents natural systems from destruction sev 2009 economic sustainability implies that the overall costs should not exceed the benefits of a project it is assessed on both micro and macroeconomic aspects including construction costs to operational costs and subsidies from government authorities for investment and maintenance another thing associated with projects involving many beneficiaries is the collective effort to work together each cbws source is used by a number of users domesticated animals and irrigation purposes so these sources should be kept free from contamination to ensure health that s why a proper policy is required describing code of conduct formation of a committee to take responsibility keep records and so on besides willingness to manage time and labor pay whenever necessary solve complexities and minimization of illegal usage are some of the social facts essential for a functional process next research works done by different researchers on rural water supply or sanitation were explored to find out the standard indicators all of these were noted and followed by a screening process to ensure relevance to the study after that the local circumstances were considered to cover all possible other indicators that can affect the sustainability of cbws projects a total of 57 indicators or sub criteria were finalized with the approval of the expert panel table 5 then the sub criteria were grouped under their corresponding criteria each sub criterion was linked to quantifiable data for each alternative data collection method for each sub criterion was also finalized 2 2 3 formation of ahp tree an ahp tree was formed keeping the goal at the top the criteria at the second sub criteria at the third and the alternatives at the bottom the goal is to assess the sustainability of the rural cbws types situated at rajshahi for this assessment 3 criteria and 57 sub criteria were finalized before as the sustainability parameters field surveys were done in 9 sub districts of rajshahi to find out the available alternatives a timeline of cbws projects in rajshahi is shown in fig 2 activities of bmda 2016 the local climate adaptive living facility 2022 world bank 2017 closed project list 2022 these community based water supply schemes in rajshahi can be categorized under 4 major types based on ownership and operation they are taken as available alternatives for the hierarchy tree the assessment was done on these four alternatives to find out their individual score and thus which of them is the most sustainable the types are shown in table 1 ahp tree of the model made for this study is shown in fig 3 2 2 4 data collection when the 3 criteria and 57 sub criteria were fixed the main focus was on how to measure them for a quantifiable value 12 data collection teams of surveyors were formed who went to individual water supply sources under different data collection were applied household survey hs site survey ss in person interview pi expert opinion eo and observation o structured survey sheets were made consisting of questionnaires blanks notes and charts household surveys were done to figure out information like an estimation of the number of users nature of training received literacy female participation committee formation and so on site surveys were held for issues like hygiene waste management atmospheric emissions drainage systems the kinds of household chores done involvement of domesticated animals inspection of the condition of sources at present and probable risks that can encounter in future days and the corresponding part of the survey sheet was filled the team took interviews of the users committee members if any existed and relevant government authorities to collect all necessary information including managerial aspects technical issues environmental facts that may risk the cbws sources legal and financial aspects community involvement post construction supports operation users satisfaction etc consent was taken prior to starting any conversation during the interview people of ages ranging from 13 to 70 were covered it was to properly identify the changes in years population dynamics administrative differences people have experienced overall operation and maintenance of the system and how they solved barriers during the life span of the supply source if any issue needed further analysis to address they were depicted in front of the expert panel via photos recordings or charts for their valuable opinions at last 500 ml of water were collected through sampling from overhead tanks pipelines and intake of each source they were transported to a laboratory located at a 1 h driving distance for laboratory testing thus information about water quality parameters was observed in this way parts in the survey sheet related to each data collection mean were filled type 2 and type 3 were abundant in all 9 sub districts of rajshahi whereas type 1 was found lowest in number a breakdown of survey sources that were done is shown in table 6 2 2 5 scoring of alternatives while measurements of the sources of four alternatives were taken for each sub criteria in the data collection phase it was seen that there were basically data of two categories most of them were numerical figures whereas some others had answers based on specific conditions for example say energy consumption per day to produce one unit of water has a numerical value as an answer on the other hand inspection of any visual pollution source has an answer based on the condition of the individual water supply source so two different policies were applied to score alternatives on a scale of 0 5 sub criteria which had numerical measurements for the alternatives were compared to a corresponding standard value the alternative which measured closest to the standard value received the highest score for that sub criterion i e 5 out of 5 in this way the alternative which measured the second closest to the standard value received the second highest score i e 3 or 4 out of 5 and the one having the most distant value received the lowest score or 0 or 1 out of 5 if no standardized value was found or applicable then the best value most or least was scored the highest all the alternatives were scored as per guidance and opinions of the expert panel now sub criteria which did not return numerical answers needed to be scaled first the scaling process was done after observing the condition of each alternative meticulously there could be 5 conditions excellent very good good fair and poor scoring was done based on the type of conditions detailed scoring based on types is shown in table 7 2 2 6 application of the framework to determine sustainability scores a pairwise comparison matrix was created among the sub criteria under each criterion for doing this the relative importance of each sub criterion over another was determined and the intensity of importance was put in the matrix from table 2 from the pairwise comparison matrix the local weight of each sub criterion was determined later on the consistency ratio cr was checked for each matrix to keep it below 0 10 a 3 3 pairwise comparison matrix was developed for the criteria and similarly the weight of each of the was determined in achieving the goal while putting on the relative importance considerations of different researchers in their work local circumstances opinions of expert panel members government authorities and beneficiaries of the projects were kept in mind at last the sustainability score of each type of cbws was determined and compared to figure out the most sustainable alternative 3 results and discussions pairwise comparison was carried out separately among the criteria and sub criteria under each criterion of the hierarchy structure to establish consistency of the judgment the inputs were calibrated the geometric mean of the relative importance given by each member of the expert panel is estimated for each sub criterion and put as an element of the pairwise comparison matrix the group judgment of n decision makers can be written as karamouz et al 2003 a i j a i j 1 a i j 2 a i j 3 a i j n 1 n here n is the number of decision makers and aij is the group judgment of relative importance of sub criteria i compared to sib criteria j pairwise comparison matrix of the criteria is shown in table 8 the normalized matrix for criteria derived from the pairwise comparison matrix is shown in table 9 the weight of each criterion is determined from the normalized matrix as shown in fig 4 later on the consistency was checked for the criteria weight and was found 0 05 which is less than 0 1 hence the allocation of relative importance can be considered satisfactory after that pairwise comparison matrix of sub criteria under criterion environmental was determined and shown in table 10 the normalized matrix derived from the pairwise comparison matrix is shown in table 11 the local weights of the sub criteria under criterion environmental is determined from the normalized matrix and shown in fig 5 similarly the local weight of all other sub criteria was determined now the study needed a typical picture of the cbws types to minimize the effect of outliers and skews while scoring the median value was considered bonamente 2017 ross 2014 for example we want to score the 4 cbws types for sub criterion eco 2 maintenance cost 13 52 63 and 31 observation points were considered under cbws type 1 type 2 type 3 and type 4 respectively each observation point was scored and the median score was taken as the score of that type table 12 table 13 table 14 and table 15 show individual scores of the supply sources under type 1 type 2 type 3 and type 4 fig 6 fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 show the boxplots of the scores and their median values similarly the median score was calculated considering other 56 sub criteria for all the cbws types table 16 shows a detailed description of how the sub criteria were measured their local and global weights and the scores given to each cbws type then the score of each cbws type was multiplied by the global weight of each sub criterion to determine the sustainability score for that sub criterion thus sustainability scores for all sub criteria were determined and added to find the overall sustainability score of each cbws type fig 10 shows the overall sustainability score of the cbws types fig 10 shows that cbws type 3 has the best sustainability score of 3 48 in comparison to other types and hence can be considered the most sustainable type 3 is followed by type 2 type 4 and type 1 respectively type 1 has the least sustainability score of 3 18 which is almost 10 less than the maximum value the above results indicate an important factor though dphe is the primary government organization responsible for rural water supply system in bangladesh privately owned and operated supply schemes having more than 100 users ranked first with the highest overall score most of them are implemented by ngo s development partners and personal funds of users government owned and privately operated schemes show a close call with privately owned and operated schemes of more than 100 users type 4 secures a good sustainability score and is also implemented mostly by personal funds at a micro level the results prove that they are contributing significantly to secure water safety secondly major discrepancy is seen among the alternatives for some sub criteria for example talking about the environmental factors of cbws type 1 table 16 shows that the users are often skeptical about the type s quality control receiving a score of only 3 whereas 5 is the highest score energy consumption has been another factor for type 1 compared to the other alternatives there are some issues with the quality of drinking water the physical and chemical parameters of water are not good enough in comparison to other alternatives moreover from economic aspects scores for sub criteria eco 9 shows that type 1 is less transparent than other alternatives eco 12 says that these schemes need to increase the usage of yearly surplus funds too from social perspective scores of soc 3 and soc 4 says that a lot of unregistered people illegally use water from these sources and often people are not willing to pay in case of any emergency requirement in comparison to other alternatives overall supply sources under type 1 need special attention in low scoring sub criteria because these supply sources scored less in the most number of sub criteria than others a re evaluation of policy and modification in implementation to overcome lacking in those sub criteria factors is mandatory consistency is seen among the environmental economic and social aspects of cbws type 2 and cbws type 3 sources however lots of sub criteria scored low sub criteria env 18 implies that several supply sources under type 2 and 3 are closer to pollution sources like industrial discharge or waste dumping stations eco 3 suggests that the average cost of construction of type 2 is pretty much high eco 10 says that the transaction records are not properly kept in the record books the legal framework needs to be improved for type 3 on the other hand cbws type 4 has received a lower score of just 3 compared to the other types for non renewable energy usage and access to advanced technology as a privately owned and operated type the rate of usage of fossil fuel is comparatively high here due to a lack of awareness and regulations communal harmony has been a factor for cbws type 4 according to soc 2 people have a tendency to install privately owned supply sources within their own religious communities users of type 4 are not properly trained about the hygiene or maintenance of the sources according to soc 9 there are no regulatory guidelines either in bangladeshi communities successful technology transfer is largely dependent upon cultural values soc 11 implies that other than type 1 and 2 cbws type 3 and 4 are more susceptible to cultural values social states of users decide the importance of opinions in decision making less uncertainty avoidance high collectivism and short term orientation in decision making soc 15 states that a few female members are participating in decision making for nearly all the cbws types particularly for types 2 3 and 4 the policy of cost recovery for types 2 3 and 4 should be revised to include low income households in service type 3 and 4 also lag behind regarding a form of benefit for the responsible committee members and an office for planning and execution thus a clear picture of the low scoring areas has been outlined in this study for a system to be sustainable there is no other alternative than to pinpoint the struggling factors and work on them 4 conclusion though there are several low scoring sub criteria due to the natural phenomena and geographical location of rajshahi some sub criteria either need a massive investment to improve scores or simply cannot be helped for example the meteorological or geo hydrological data like annual rainfall base flow evapotranspiration temperature humidity and infiltration rate are set by nature therefore scopes should be utilized where improvement is practically possible while applying mcda most of the time should be utilized in structuring the problem meticulously due to a slight change in weighting the indicators or ignoring any

criteria are mostly worsened by the poor quality of construction inadequate supervision and poor selection of sites for installation of supply sources quality of water is greatly hampered and often the sources run out of water in the dry season making operational and maintenance costs higher functional water committees should play a pivotal role in following the code of conduct ensuring female
