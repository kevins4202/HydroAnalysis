23995,we downscaled a free ensemble of a regional parent model to a high resolution coastal child ensemble in the bay of biscay the child ensemble was forced at the open boundaries by the parent ensemble and locally by perturbing the winds by comparing ensembles generated by each of these forcing perturbations separately and combined we were able to consider the ensemble from either of two paradigms 1 characterising high resolution coastal model errors using local and non local forcing perturbations or 2 downscaling regional model errors into the coastal domain we found that most of the spread in the child ensembles was generated from the ensemble of open boundary conditions with the local wind perturbations on their own generating substantially less ensemble spread together the two sources of error increased the ensemble spread by only a small amount over the non local perturbations alone in general the spread in sea surface height was greater in the child ensembles than in the parent ensemble probably due to the more refined dynamics while the spread in sea surface temperature was lower likely due to the way the open boundary conditions were averaged deep below the surface though the child ensemble featured a large spread even where the parent model s spread was very weak this enhanced error response is a promising result for an ensemble data assimilation system as it could be exploited to correct the model deep below the surface keywords ensemble modelling downscaling model uncertainties coastal modelling bay of biscay data assimilation 1 introduction we downscale geophysical models so that we can increase the resolution in a region of interest without incurring the computational cost and the difficulty of increasing the resolution everywhere in the model domain this modest aim leads to anything but a straightforward problem to solve though for the difficulties associated with nesting models are manifold and the high resolution child model cannot simply be regarded as a more detailed version of the parent model a corollary of this is that the errors in the parent model cannot be expected to translate in a straightforward way into errors in the child model it is this problem the downscaling of model errors which we concern ourselves with here specifically in ocean circulation models the promise of higher resolution models to provide more detailed descriptions of the ocean balances against some inconvenient physics at small scales as sandery and sakov 2017 show while increased detail is possible and useful this does not necessarily mean increased accuracy with the higher complexity of the small scale flow even deteriorating the large scale flow through an inverse energy cascade there are further problems to address with the open boundary problem quite apart from the difficulty of matching solutions of different spatial and temporal scales the internal variability of the downscaled model is decoupled from that of the parent model which can lead to divergent solutions an undesirable trait when the parent model outperforms the child sometimes this divergence can be redressed as katavouta and thompson 2016 showed by applying a spectral nudging technique in the deeper regions this maintained the parent model s accuracy there while giving free reign to the child model in the coastal region where the parent model was unable to resolve many of the processes with all this in mind it would be fruitful then to explore the behaviour of errors in a downscaled model system in this study we attempt to characterise a downscaled coastal model s errors from ensembles of perturbed simulations we do this principally by examining the ensemble s statistics above all the ensemble variance or equivalently its standard deviation which is often referred to as the ensemble s spread there are many sources of error in a model due to deficiencies in the physical model the numerical scheme and discretisation and errors in the initial and boundary conditions and the forcing fields by narrowing our focus onto a subspace of the full model error space we can better understand the sensitivity of the model to a specific set of error sources for us this subset consists only of surface winds and the open boundary conditions understanding the model error subspace will guide us in future efforts in assimilating data where corrections to the model will only be possible for variables sensitive to these two sources experimenting with forcing error perturbations in ocean models is not new of course even for nested models to name but a few studies echevin et al 2000 perturbed the initial conditions while leaving all other forcing variables untouched auclair et al 2003 examined the effect on a coastal model of perturbing in turn the initial density field a prominent slope current in the domain the wind field and river discharges jordà and de mey 2010 perturbed the wind and the initial analytic velocity profile kim et al 2011 perturbed the winds the initial conditions and the open boundary conditions the last of these by calculating eofs for the boundary conditions and with random amplitudes superimposing a linear combination of eof modes onto them in fact the same basic procedure we and others have used to perturb the wind the distinguishing feature of the work we are presenting is thus the use of an ensemble of open boundary conditions by defining our open boundary perturbations from a pre existing parent model ensemble we achieve something similar to kim et al 2011 as far as the coastal model error space is concerned but we gain the ability to compare our coastal model errors with the parent model errors in particular our coastal model s error space may be thought of as representing a refinement of the parent model s error space hence the problem may be viewed from two equivalent perspectives one is that of characterising coastal model errors by generating a coastal model ensemble and the other is that of downscaling errors from a larger scale parent model ensemble though philosophically different functionally these two paradigms amount to the same thing as long as the former is approached like the latter using an ensemble of open boundary conditions drawn from the parent model ensemble since the parent ensemble was generated by perturbing solely the wind and we further perturb the local winds in the coastal ensemble it is evident that the only forcing variable directly perturbed is the wind thus the open boundary conditions provided by the parent ensemble may be considered to be a conduit through which the effects of non local wind perturbations can enter the coastal domain it may seem limiting to use only one error source to generate our coastal ensemble but the implicit assumption underlying this choice that the model is perfect and that all the errors come from the wind forcing has the advantage that it enables us to concentrate on understanding the consequences of that one source and indeed the wind turns out to be a good choice as vervatis et al in review 2019 found that perturbing the wind in a regional model the very same regional model configuration as the parent model used in this study had a much greater effect than the other physical and biogeochemical perturbations they tested being restricted to wind perturbations also allows us to compare like with like when comparing the parent and child ensembles to that end we follow in the footsteps of other studies in which only the wind was perturbed for example those by le hénaff et al 2009 and kourafalou et al 2015 there are several ways one might choose to categorise the ensemble error behaviour the most obvious being with gross quantities like calculating the mean ensemble spread over time but it is informative to look beyond bulk quantities and see where as well as by how much the spread changes to address this we subdivide the domain into deep water continental shelf and intermediate zones we also generate surface and cross section maps to see what the error pattern looks like at a given point in time and space both at the surface and below the surface different variables should be expected to behave differently too and this should also depend on the regime near the river mouth we should see strong errors in salinity and temperature but sea surface height ought to vary most in deep water where the large eddies dominate in the signal we therefore consider these variables separately and compare them between the parent and child ensembles after a brief and general description of the bay of biscay section 2 and of the regional parent and coastal child models section 3 we discuss in some detail how the wind perturbations were calculated and how we used the open boundary ensemble to generate our ensembles section 4 the bulk of the paper is given over to an exploration of these ensembles section 5 we treat the surface extensively before diving beneath showing how surface wind perturbations can lead to large errors in specific zones under the surface and how this is also model dependent because of its highly non isotropic nature the behaviour of the river plume when subjected to wind perturbations holds its own interest so we treat this separately section 5 5 before concluding with a general discussion 2 the bay of biscay we shall present only a very brief summary of the major physical processes in the bay of biscay and in particular in the small domain at the heart of this study we invite the reader to consult the cited references for more detail the bay of biscay is really a gulf situated in the eastern atlantic ocean with its land boundaries formed by spain s northern coast and france s western coast the bay of biscay and its bathymetry are shown in fig 1 which also shows the domain boundaries for the regional parent model used in our experiments and the smaller coastal domain the continental shelf is clearly visible in the figure it can be as narrow as about 20 km on spain s northern coast near bilbao but it broadens greatly as one travels north along the french coast and less so westward along the spanish coast for our small coastal domain shown in fig 2 the important submarine features are the gouf de capbreton a striking submarine canyon and the plateau des landes which is really a gentle slope descending from the shelf into the abyssal plain although the only river directly modelled in our domain is the adour which meets the sea near bayonne the gironde s plume enters from the domain s northern boundary and is a major source of fresh cool water along the coast the discharge from both rivers is significantly cooler than the water in the bay so the river plumes can be identified from the sea surface temperature maps a fact we exploit in this study even though our model domain covers only a small corner of the bay of biscay an array of different physical processes may be found therein there are the river plumes of cooler fresh water which are an important part of the dynamics over the shelf the river discharge is greatest during the winter months puillat et al 2006 an intermittent along shore current the iberian poleward current extends along the spanish coast in late autumn and winter and occasionally follows the slope as it turns northward rubio et al 2013 kersalé et al 2016 this current is also associated with mesoscale anticyclonic slope water eddies swoddies which are provoked by bathymetric features such as undersea canyons which interrupt the current s flow and send jets of slope water into deep water regions pingree and le cann 1992 of particular interest for this study the plateau des landes plays host to some intense mesoscale activity with cyclones and anti cyclones of between 50 and 80 km diameter le cann and serpette 2009 solabarrieta et al 2014 beneath the surface incursion of water masses such as the mediterranean intermediate water can lead to strong and deep sub surface gradients in temperature and salinity van aken 2000 the barotropic tidal amplitudes in the bay of biscay can be extremely large over 1 5 m in some places over the shelf dominated by the semi diurnal lunar tide m2 le cann 1990 as the tidal current crosses the shelf break quite complex baroclinic flows and internal tides can be generated some of whose energy dissipates by adding to the vertical mixing pairaud et al 2010 in our model domain because the shelf is narrower the tidal currents are not as strong as they are further north le cann 1990 toublanc et al 2018 3 the ocean circulation models and their configurations before we discuss ensemble generation we shall say a few words about the models themselves we give only brief descriptions of them here as they have been more thoroughly described elsewhere we refer to the high resolution coastal model as the child or coastal model and the regional model supplying the open boundary conditions as the parent the parent ensemble is the free ensemble produced by vervatis et al 2016 and described fully in their paper it was generated with the nemo model madec and the nemo team 2008 on a 1 36 grid on a domain encompassing the bay of biscay and the western part of the english channel this configuration named biscay36 was based on that of maraldi et al 2013 the coastal model is symphonie which is described in a series of papers by marsaleix et al 2006 2008 2009a 2011 2012 estournel et al 2005 2009 and pairaud et al 2008 over the last decade the symphonie model has been used in several different configurations to model the bay of biscay see the studies of pairaud et al 2008 2010 for the barotropic and internal tides le hénaff et al 2009 for the general circulation herbert et al 2011 on the iberian poleward current along the northern spanish coasts herbert 2012 for the surface circulation response to storm klaus in january 2009 and recently toublanc et al 2018 for the impact of tides on the open boundary conditions these studies have shown that symphonie was able to simulate the main circulation patterns in the bay of biscay from daily to seasonal time scales the domain whose limits can be seen in the bathymetry plots in fig 2 is much smaller than the parent model s it forms a box over the southeastern corner of the bay of biscay extending northward up to just beneath arcachon on france s southwest coast and westward a little before reaching santander on spain s northern coast fig 1 the resolution is set to 500 m between grid points in both horizontal directions a substantial improvement over the parent model s roughly 2 5 km resolution this enables it to better resolve mesoscale eddies perhaps even allowing the resolution of sub mesoscale eddies fronts and river plumes the model bathymetries are different too for the coastal model we used a new high resolution bathymetry lyard 2015 shown in fig 2 while the parent model defines depth with z values the coastal model uses σ layers we refer to the specific configuration of the symphonie model in this high resolution coastal domain as bobland the meteorological fields for both model configurations are the 3 hourly operational analyses from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf high resolution model and are thus identical for the parent s and child s unperturbed runs the child model is not two way nested in the parent model but rather uses an independent run of the parent model to define its open boundary conditions that is offline the method for handling the open boundaries is clearly of consequence for this study but we defer this to the discussion on downscaling in section 4 2 2 a summary of some of the features and configuration parameters for both models is given in table 1 in this paper we perform sensitivity studies so we have not sought to verify in detail the realism of the model beyond what the prior studies we have cited have done we nevertheless thought it prudent to check that our results were in line with observations unfortunately very few observations were available to us for our period of study in our domain we have used the l3s daily satellite sst fields orain 2016 but the coverage is very poor due to the frequently cloudy conditions in the bay of biscay in winter comparisons of the unperturbed runs for both the parent and child with data from those days with good coverage showed few differences of more than half a degree celsius we have also checked that our results are qualitatively consistent with the information found in the literature for instance the observations of sst and hf radar presented by solabarrieta et al 2014 show a large eddy similar to the one that persists throughout the study period while the size and location of the eddy are consistent between the coastal model and the data the parent model s eddy properties seem less realistic also we found that the sst gradient over the eastern shelf and at the edge of the adour s plume was in good agreement with solabarrieta et al s 2014 observations along the spanish shelf it was however too warm maybe because of a local recirculation not shown 4 ensemble generation one of our main assumptions is that the model errors result principally from errors in the forcing variables if we know the distribution of these errors or we can guess at it we can generate an ensemble of perturbed forcing variables which follow it if we then apply this ensemble of perturbed forcings to the model we can generate an ensemble of model realisations each member corresponding to a particular forcing perturbation this model ensemble can then provide a useful estimate of the model error covariances strictly speaking of course the estimate is only of the subspace of error covariances related to the forcing variables we perturb but if these forcing variables dominate the others then this is adequate in this study where our focus is on downscaling an ocean circulation model we only directly perturb the winds and the open boundary conditions although these latter are themselves generated from perturbations to the parent model s winds vervatis et al in review 2019 found that the wind was and by quite some way the most important source of error among those that they tested we describe in turn the procedure for perturbing the wind locally and how we utilised the ensemble of open boundary conditions 4 1 the wind perturbations we followed auclair et al 2003 and le hénaff et al s 2009 method for perturbing the wind field which is also the method used by vervatis et al 2016 our basic assumption is that the uncertainties in the ecmwf wind fields have the same spatial and temporal structure as the wind variability consequently the perturbations are built from the empirical orthogonal functions eofs of the ecmwf wind fields in the bobland domain over the period desired for this study this is december 2011 to march 2012 let u be the matrix containing both zonal and meridional wind velocities it may be decomposed into its temporal mean and an anomaly matrix 1 u u u now for a matrix u containing both zonal and meridional wind anomalies and of dimension k l where k and l are the temporal and spatial dimensions respectively we may perform a singular value decomposition giving us the expression 2 u x λ y t where x r k j and y r l j are composed of orthogonal vectors and λ r j j is diagonal whose non zero elements σ j are the singular values of u the dimension j corresponds to the number of modes of which only the first few are computed using the method described by toumazou and cretaux 2001 to decide how many to keep we can use the singular values from λ to determine what percentage p j of the total variance each mode j represents 3 p j σ j 2 tr λ 2 where tr indicates that the trace of the matrix is taken for our eofsthe first two modes explained 64 and 29 of the variance respectively and there was a steep drop to the third mode at only a little more than 2 after which the percentage for subsequent modes fell gradually fig 3 shows the temporal standard deviation of the first five modes where the dominance of the first zonal and second meridional modes is made clear as is the much weaker contribution from higher order modes we therefore decided to keep only these first two modes together explaining about 93 of the total variance the eof modes may be recombined with random numbers ϵ i j one for each ensemble member i and each spatial mode j to produce a wind perturbation which is added to the original wind field following lucas et al 2008 we choose the random numbers from a gaussian distribution in pairs of positive and negative numbers of the same absolute value the probability density function is then 4 p ϵ 1 2 π s 2 e ϵ 2 2 s 2 where s is the standard deviation the perturbation can be expressed as 5 u i j 1 2 ϵ i j x j σ j y j t and the wind field for ensemble member i is then given by 6 u i u u i if our ocean model were linear the pairs of gaussian random numbers would guarantee that the ensemble of simulations be gaussian with zero mean following vervatis et al 2016 we assume an error standard deviation of s 0 3 for eq 4 reflecting a presumed observational error of 30 for the wind it is worth mentioning that le hénaff et al 2009 assumed an error of 0 2 but chose the value of 0 3 to deliberately inflate the ensemble dispersion since there are many other sources of error we have not perturbed and noting that our ensemble runs are not especially long either we feel that the choice is reasonable for our configuration whatever the real error value to prevent the wind perturbations from being correlated between members the random numbers must be replaced by a new set generated with the same gaussian and pairing criteria and uncorrelated with previous sets all the same the rate at which we change them should not be too high otherwise coherent weather patterns would not have enough time to develop vervatis et al 2016 and le hénaff et al 2009 chose to update the random numbers every five days their choice also corresponded to the decorrelation time of the wind eofs although their eofs are on a much larger spatial scale than ours ultimately it is still an arbitrary decision so we did not seek to replicate this methodology for our reduced domain preferring instead to follow their example and use five days as well to avoid shocks when updating from one set of random numbers to the next we linearly interpolated them in time ensuring a smooth evolution from one perturbation to the next for all times 4 2 an ensemble of open boundary conditions 4 2 1 generating the parent ensemble downscaling a regional model to a high resolution coastal model implies using the regional parent model to prescribe the open boundary conditions for the coastal child model in our study we want to take this a step further we want to downscale a regional model ensemble so for each member of our coastal ensemble we use a different member of the parent ensemble to force the open boundaries from the point of view of the coastal ensemble this is equivalent to saying that its open boundaries are being perturbed other ways of perturbing them could be envisaged such as the methods tested by jordà and de mey 2010 but by using the parent ensemble we maintain the dual paradigm of ensemble downscaling and equivalently perturbation of the open boundary conditions for the case where we perturb the winds locally as well this adds extra degrees of freedom to our ensemble our parent ensemble is the regional free ensemble described by vervatis et al 2016 generated as we have said by perturbing the ecmwf winds using the same eof method we have just presented however their eofs were calculated over the whole biscay36 domain for a different period from ours and from daily averages of the wind fields as opposed to the 3 hourly fields we used the temporal standard deviations of the first five of their eof modes for the biscay36 configuration are shown in fig 4 where the view has been restricted to the bobland domain if we compare them to the eofs we calculated for the bobland configuration shown in fig 3 we see that although both eofs are dominated by the first zonal mode thereafter they are markedly dissimilar the bobland eofs were calculated only over the bobland domain so we see a slightly more complex structure and the second meridional mode is stronger relative to its neighbouring modes first meridional and second zonal than in biscay36 vervatis et al 2016 kept the first six eof modes to generate their wind perturbations but even by only keeping the first two modes in bobland we might expect stronger and more varied wind perturbations both because of the stronger first zonal and second meridional modes and because of the more structured second zonal and first meridional modes we test this hypothesis in section 5 3 3 there are two other differences between the way we and vervatis et al 2016 handled the time dependent component of the perturbations firstly they did not use every index from the eof time series like we did but instead every fifth one interpolating them the same way as the random numbers secondly when we started the ensemble runs we set the first random number to zero for all members so that the first perturbation would ramp up from zero the omission of this step created a spike in the parent ensemble s spread discussed in section 5 3 1 4 2 2 the downscaling method some thought was needed about the manner in and the extent to which the regional model should influence the coastal model the regional model s fields were provided as daily averages where the mean was taken over 25 instantaneous fields spaced an hour apart the fields used to force the open boundaries of the child model are temperature velocity and sea surface height the 25 hour averaging for the parent ensemble s fields does a fairly good job of removing the tides from the sea surface height and velocity fields but some signals are still present principally an artefact due to aliasing this artefact has a period of around 14 to 15 days with an amplitude of about a couple of centimetres in deeper water it acts as a forcing on the coastal model producing likewise a signal with a fortnightly oscillation of up to about 4 cm over the shelf or 2 cm in deep water a more thorough discussion of the problems associated with the way these open boundary conditions have been averaged was presented by toublanc et al 2018 though the context is that of a much larger scale coastal model the boundary condition in the symphonie model is of the radiative flather type for a complete description on the way symphonie handles its open boundary conditions we refer the reader to marsaleix et al 2006 2009b we use a nudging layer of 30 grid points for the main experiments corresponding to 15 km in the bobland configuration at the boundary the nudging time scales are τ 0 1 days for the barotropic velocity and τ 1 day for the baroclinic velocity marchesiello et al 2001 applied a cosine half period to reduce these values to zero which is the method symphonie uses to wit 7 τ r d τ 2 1 cos π s l d s l for d s l 0 for d s l where τ r is the reduced nudging time scale at distance d from the domain boundary for a nudging layer of width s l we also considered using a narrower nudging layer of only 10 grid points before settling on 30 comparing unperturbed model runs of both nudging layer widths with sea surface temperature data we were unable to discern much difference between the two however a wider nudging layer could serve to constrain the coastal ensemble spread for example if the nudging layer is too wide the boundary conditions will impose themselves to the detriment of any other perturbed dynamics on the other hand a wider nudging layer we reasoned should cause the open boundary conditions to have more influence further into the domain for our application this may have benefits since it means all other things being equal that the coastal model ensemble will capture more of the parent ensemble s spread this was desirable too in subsequent work where we wished to preserve the large scale circulation of the parent model while assimilating data at the same time to be presented in a future paper thus the wider nudging layer was preferred although in the sections that follow we discuss the impact of the nudging layer width on the ensemble where pertinent 5 ensemble behaviour and statistics 5 1 introducing the ensembles we generated several ensembles in the bobland configuration whose defining characteristics are summarised in table 2 each one consists of 50 perturbed members the unperturbed run being excluded from all statistics of these ensembles we concentrate on three plus the parent ensemble with the others used mostly to answer specific questions raised by the first three and to test some of our assumptions the four principal ensembles on which the bulk of our analysis is based are the parent wind obc open boundary condition and wind obc ensembles the names corresponding to the forcing being perturbed for wind obc the two types of perturbation are applied at the same time when we perturb only the wind we use the same unperturbed open boundary conditions for all members and likewise when we perturb only the open boundary conditions we use the same unperturbed winds for all members the coastal ensemble runs begin after a model spinup starting on 12th september 2011 and ending at midnight 1st december at this time all of the ensemble members are identical and have the exact same open boundary conditions and winds as the unperturbed run and they diverge from then on in what follows all ensemble statistics were computed over the 50 member ensemble of perturbed runs i e excluding the unperturbed member to better represent and compare the ensemble statistics of each ensemble proper without contamination from the parent ensemble in the nudging layer the spatial averages exclude points which would fall inside the 30 point nudging layer of the bobland domain similarly to compare our ensembles with the parent ensemble statistics for the parent were only computed over the bobland domain again excluding points which fall inside the nudging layer the statistical quantity which primarily interests us is the ensemble standard deviation which is also referred to in this paper and in the literature as the ensemble spread this tells us to what extent the perturbations have led the ensemble to diverge and may be interpreted as a measure of the error in the model resulting from an imperfectly known forcing this is of particular significance in a data assimilation context we may think of it of as indicative of how amenable the model is to correction by data assimilation since the more error there is in the model then the more weight the observations will carry in the analysis for any given observational error we follow vervatis et al 2016 in treating the first month of the ensembles i e december as an ensemble spin up period where the ensemble members have still not diverged enough to give useful statistics we hence exclude the first month of our ensembles from the temporal moments we examine later in this paper but it can still be useful to look in here one reason is that it shows how the ensemble spread grows as the model perturbations take effect but there are also some dynamics which only or mostly occurred in this period 5 2 quantifying the interaction with tides exploring the model error subspace will guide us in future choices for data assimilation experiments in particular when dealing with ssh observations such as altimetric data the question arises whether the tidal signal should be assimilated together with the residual circulation we therefore need to understand if the tidal dynamics are represented in the model error subspace indeed tides influence and are influenced by the circulation so perturbations of wind and open boundary conditions could in principle perturb tides here we seek to quantify the effect of the perturbations on the tidal elevation signals to do this we need to remove the tidal signal from the elevation for accuracy we run a harmonic analysis on the surface elevation which requires a time series with a high sampling rate the analyses are therefore done at a few representative locations where we recorded these high frequency time series with a sampling rate of 2 3 15 5 they are marked in fig 2 we can estimate the effect of the perturbations on the tides by calculating the ratio of the ensemble spread of the tidal signal to the ensemble spread of the residual circulation for elevation η this may be expressed as 8 std η η std η where the prime indicates detiding by harmonic analysis fig 5 shows this ratio for each of the ten locations marked in fig 2 the highest value is about 0 16 for a point on the shelf but most of the time the values are closer to 0 05 only breaking the 0 1 threshold on a few occasions for points over deep water the ratios are even smaller one sixth is not a completely insignificant contribution to the ensemble spread but it is an absolute maximum and other high values only occur occasionally and over the shelf consequently we consider that the perturbations effect on tidal elevations is weak enough when compared with the residual circulation that it can be neglected thus in the following sections we consider only the modification of the residual circulation using detided daily fields of ssh where the detiding is done online by subtracting the tidal forcing from the model output fields before computing the daily average 5 3 ensemble spread of surface variables since it is at the surface that our forcing perturbations are generated remembering that the parent ensemble was generated by wind perturbations too so it is that we begin our examination of the ensembles at the surface too 5 3 1 time series of the spatial mean spread figs 6 and 7 show time series for the spatial mean of the ensemble spread of sea surface height ssh and sea surface temperature sst respectively we shall focus initially on the top left plots in these figures in which the spatial means are taken across the whole of the bobland domain for the moment we discuss only the four principal ensembles the wind obc wind obc and parent ensembles all drawn in black we first address the most prominent feature of the ssh curves except for the wind ensemble there is an extremely high spike in the spread at the beginning of the time series this is related to the manner in which the parent model s wind perturbations were abruptly introduced the subsequent spikes are on the contrary not artefacts but are related to a strong synchronous sea surface height change from the parent model which is accentuated on the shelf the ssh curves for the wind ensemble show no such spikes as this was the only ensemble not to use the parent ensemble for its open boundaries because we treat this first month as a spin up the anomalous initial spike is excluded from any temporal statistical calculations we make if we examine the full time series we see that the obc and wind obc ensembles have a greater overall spread in ssh than the parent ensemble a trend which is largely inverted for the sst meanwhile the wind ensemble almost always has the least spread of all the ensembles except for sst during the ensemble spin up phase this is because so much of the sst spread is generated by the cold river plume over the shelf and during the ensemble spin up the parent ensemble s perturbations have not had the time to propagate from the open boundaries to the near coast leaving the domain s interior initially unaffected unless the coastal ensemble s winds are perturbed in a similar fashion the parent ensemble s spread is initially lower than the wind ensemble s until non local perturbations have had time to reach the shelf that the sst and ssh should respond differently to the forcing perturbations is not in itself remarkable we discuss it further below however it may seem surprising at first that the parent ensemble in which only the winds are perturbed should have a greater spread in sst than the higher resolution wind obc ensemble where the perturbations from the boundary are superposed on the wind perturbations there are several mechanisms that might contribute to this firstly the high resolution coastal model is able to produce a more complex velocity field with more coherent eddies at smaller scales even if the ssh fields are more distinct from member to member this could result in more horizontal diffusion of scalars like temperature leading the ensemble members to look more alike in those variables but there is more to it than that because it also depends on how sub grid scale diffusion is handled in each model even though the tracer diffusion scheme is the same for both models the momentum diffusion is different and the numerical diffusion resolution time step and other features which are specific to each model will influence horizontal diffusion because the differences between the models run so deep a thorough comparison is impractical a simple test would be to see the effect of increasing horizontal diffusion of tracers in the coastal model which we did by doubling it the result partly confirmed our hypothesis about diffusion and spread in that the ensemble spread decreased as horizontal diffusion increased however increasing the horizontal diffusion parameter also lead to more diffusion of the velocity field in turn reducing the ssh spread this implies that scalar diffusion cannot be the sole mechanism responsible for the inverted spread behaviour to get a better sense of the relationship between the complexity of the eddy field and horizontal diffusion we looked at time series of spatial standard deviations for scalars and ssh calculating the temporal correlation coefficients of these time series for the unperturbed member of both parent and child model configurations was inconclusive however they do turn out to be negative but they are very weak with absolute values less than 0 3 except for sst with ssh for the parent model whose value is 0 59 despite the inconclusiveness of these findings and the equivocal role that diffusion appears to play in the different behaviour of the parent and child in the following section we examine evidence that suggests that indeed the parent model diffuses tracers rather less quickly than the coastal model the second reason for the inverted response of the ssh and sst spreads in the two models has to do with the way we prescribe the open boundary conditions themselves which is as daily means these are interpolated by the coastal model for the current time step but higher frequency information is irretrievably lost the coastal ensemble is thus being constrained into a lower frequency error space than the parent ensemble by means of the lower frequency forcing at the open boundaries this latter explanation leads to a contradiction for the loss of high frequency information should lead to a reduction in spread of all variables yet it does not we refer back to the first reason to explain this discrepancy the coastal model s higher resolution and therefore greater ability to resolve eddies the more defined eddies are stronger and more localised in space so their displacement must impose a more marked difference between ensemble members than the weakly resolved eddies of the regional model this justifies the ensemble downscaling paradigm since despite the mechanism by which we may expect the ensemble spread to be reduced the loss of information at the open boundaries the spread of ssh nonetheless increases finally a big contributor to the reversed trend of ssh and sst spreads appears to be directly attributable to the adour s plume which we consider in the next section 5 3 2 subdividing the domain in a previous ensemble study at the basin scale with the symphonie model kourafalou et al 2015 emphasised the existence of distinct regimes of model error over the shelf and in deep water to find out how these regimes differed between our ensembles we divided the bobland domain into three sub domains according to depth time series of the spatial means of ensemble spread for each subdivision are shown in the remaining plots in figs 6 and 7 the subdivisions are as follows deep water which we define as more than a thousand metres depth and which encompasses the abyssal plain and much of the gently sloping landes plateau top right plots in the figures an intermediate region where depths vary between a thousand metres and 150 metres which we may associate with the continental slope bottom left plots and the continental shelf with depths up to 150 metres bottom right plots these regions are defined based on the smoothed bathymetries seen by the respective models which although not precisely the same as each other are close enough as illustrated in fig 2 the sst spread is greatest over the shallow waters of the shelf where the river plumes are still coherent and can create very big and sharp differences in sst by contrast the ssh spread is smaller here and greater in deep water where large spatially coherent eddies and steric effects from a deeper water column have more influence but there are some peaks in ssh spread over the shelf for all ensembles except for the wind ensemble these peaks are driven by wind related processes in the parent model and are discussed by vervatis et al 2016 they manifest as large synchronous increases in the ssh everywhere but especially over the shelf the ssh spread over the slope is most of the time somewhere in between the shelf s and the deep water s the sst shows something different though from mid february the spread of all the ensembles is lower here than over either the shelf or the abyssal plain meanwhile at the end of december and from mid january through to mid february the parent ensemble s spread is far greater over the slope than that of the coastal ensembles the great difference between the ensembles may be explained by looking at the surface maps in fig 8 where we see that the parent model produces a more spatially coherent river plume and during those periods of large spread in the parent ensemble it extends out some distance from the coast being entrained by the deep water eddies the coastal model diffuses the plume earlier so it does not extend as far out naturally the further out the plume remains undiffused the more it can be deviated by the circulation and the higher the overall spread will be there than if it stayed near the coast and diffused quickly from mid february the plume does not extend as far out with the cooler river water tending to hug the coast where the spread remains quite large the mesoscale eddies are the other major source of ensemble spread at the surface but as is hinted in the sst maps and becomes clear when looking at the ssh these circulate mainly in deep water and do not greatly influence what is happening over the slope the slope is in a sense situated in between two highly active regimes insofar as sst spread goes this leaves us again to consider the greater spread in sst of the parent ensemble compared with the child ensembles looking again at the surface maps for sst and ssh in fig 8 we can see that coinciding with the large eddy s centre high ssh are higher temperatures these temperatures are not only higher for the parent model but the gradient is also steeper in other words while the parent model s eddy has a less distinct signature in ssh than the coastal model it has a conversely more distinct signature in sst this distinct signature naturally leads to a higher spread in sst for the parent ensemble and once more suggests that the parent model diffuses tracers more weakly than the coastal model we also produced plots for the sea surface salinity sss but they do not add much to the argument so we do not present them the two salient points are these the pattern of the sss spread follows quite closely that of the sst including the enhanced spread in the parent model over the slope and the spread of the sss is reduced by an order of magnitude in deep water the former observation is easily explained since both tracers are controlled by fairly similar mechanisms the river plumes on the shelf and the eddies over the abyssal plain the latter is simply because changes in salinity are dominated by fresh water discharge from rivers much more so than temperature 5 3 3 experimenting with the wind perturbation the manner in which we perturbed the winds involved some choices based more on convention than on physical law to determine how much these choices influenced the results we generated a few extra ensembles described in table 2 note that for want of computer resources these experiments were only performed for part of the period under examination some not exceeding the ensemble spin up period the spatial means of sst and ssh spread for these ensembles are shown in figs 6 and 7 along with the four principal ensembles it should be expected that increasing the wind perturbations should lead to greater ensemble spread in response the ensemble s05 bears out this intuitive hypothesis it is the exact same configuration as for our wind ensemble with the same distribution of random numbers ϵ i j used to construct the wind perturbations eqs 4 and 5 except with a higher error standard deviation of s 0 5 instead of 0 3 the conclusion holds true for both the ssh and sst and all subdivisions of the domain although near the end of the ensemble spin up period the difference is sometimes very small in section 4 2 we discussed how our eofs were calculated over a smaller domain and a shorter time period than those of vervatis et al 2016 and that we kept only the first two modes the smaller domain could serve to increase the structural detail for the same number of modes by virtue of excluding contributions from outside the domain but the shorter time frame could have the opposite effect because it does not capture long term changes similarly restricting ourselves to only two modes precludes some of the small scale structure the two sets of eofs are in short not directly comparable this prompted two questions firstly what do we lose by only keeping the first two modes and secondly what if we were to use exactly the same wind perturbations as those which generated the parent ensemble for the second question one intriguing possibility is that for any particular member the open boundary conditions could set up an ocean circulation pattern in the child model which could be reinforced by matching winds a kind of resonance effect which would maintain a larger spread or looked at another way if we used different wind perturbations than those used to generate the parent ensemble those perturbations might dampen the differences generated by the ensemble of open boundary conditions to answer the first question we generated the eof10 ensemble which is the same as our wind ensemble except that we kept the first ten eof modes instead of only the first two to be consistent the random numbers associated with the first two modes were the same keeping ten modes instead of two means that the total variance explained rises from 92 73 to 98 97 the result is that while the ensemble spread is enlarged in places notably for the ssh in deep water in january most of the time it is about the same as when only two modes are kept and quite often it decreases it seems that by adding the extra complexity to the wind perturbations we are cancelling out some of the variations we might otherwise produce the higher order modes might just be adding statistical noise which does not represent the spatial pattern of the wind uncertainties eventually leading to a decrease in spread with the ensemble eof obc we tested the second question by using the same wind perturbations that vervatis et al 2016 applied to generate the parent ensemble we ensured for each member in the coastal ensemble that we matched its wind perturbations to the corresponding parent member which provided its open boundary conditions though the difference is small the spread for this configuration is actually lower than that produced by our newly generated eofs in the wind obc ensemble we generated another ensemble eofbisc to measure the strength of these perturbations this ensemble uses the same wind perturbations as eof obc but like the wind ensemble keeps the unperturbed open boundaries for all members the spread in sst is also almost always less than for the wind ensemble but the spread in ssh increases from the end of the ensemble spin up period this somewhat contradictory result demonstrates the difficulty in drawing general conclusions from these experiments clearly a different set of eofs will lead to a different set of wind perturbations which may be more or less successful at perturbing the ocean circulation model at different times as a final test we configured yet another ensemble using the wind perturbations from the parent ensemble the eof obc ensemble was configured the same as eof obc except that the wind perturbations are no longer matched with the open boundary conditions from the equivalent member from the parent ensemble instead we forced each member s wind perturbation with the open boundary conditions from the member number two beneath it effectively randomising them the spread is higher than that of eof obc for the whole period simulated though still lower than that of the wind obc ensemble if anything we must conclude that any resonance effect should it exist must be small and that further perturbations in this case generated by simply dissociating the perturbations from the open boundary conditions can be expected to generate a greater spread rather than a lower one there are an infinite number of ways of generating perturbations so we needed to make some choices we made them based on the simple physical and intuitive assumption of generating wind uncertainties with a variability comparable to that of the wind itself despite other interesting questions perhaps the most significant result for us from this series of experiments is that small variations to this method do not significantly change the pattern of model sensitivity and hence do not change our conclusions 5 3 4 experimenting with the nudging layer width a wider nudging layer should increase the influence of the parent model on the child model preserving more of its behaviour in the downscaled system applied to an ensemble it follows that with a wider nudging layer the dynamics ought to be less impacted by the local perturbations the wind here to learn something about the way the nudging layer width affects the ensemble spread we prepared three ensembles with a 10 point nudging layer instead of 30 these are wind nl10 obc nl10 and wind obc nl10 the narrower nudging layer was imposed after the ensemble spinup period so the ensemble statistics are directly comparable with the other experiments the time series of the ensemble spreads are shown in figs 6 and 7 changing the nudging layer width has several repercussions so we shall take the variables one at a time starting with the ssh ensemble spreads overall except for the first few days over the shelf and slope where the ssh is controlled mainly by non local effects the domain wide synchronous oscillations previously mentioned the narrower nudging layer leads to greater spread for all three coastal ensembles this is true even for the obc run despite there being no wind perturbations doubtless a result of the greater freedom afforded to the eddy dynamics the wind ensemble s spread sees the greatest relative increase from this modification especially over the shelf and slope where it even exceeds all the other ensembles for a few days in mid march the obc and wind obc ensembles react in a more complicated way with the former s ensemble spread exceeding the latter s in deep water for most of the 3 month period the reason for this is not clear but one possibility might be that the 5 day interval between random numbers which sets up the time correlation of the wind perturbations is insufficient leading the wind perturbations to erode rather than strengthen the eddies over the slope and shelf where local effects are more important the wind obc ensemble retains its supremacy for the sst things are again quite different the wind ensemble s spread is almost unchanged over the shelf sometimes slightly lower but in deep water it is higher everywhere with the narrower nudging layer here too the reduced influence of the parent model allows the wind perturbations freer reign to spread the ensemble but the obc and wind obc ensemble spreads are often weaker with the narrower nudging layer again why this should be the case is not entirely clear but one possibility is that while the wind ensemble is less constrained by the parent model s unperturbed run the other ensembles rely on the ensemble of open boundary conditions to generate their ensemble spread why this should have the opposite effect for ssh and sst may be explained by higher scalar diffusion in the coastal model as discussed in sections 5 3 1 and 5 3 2 with already smaller spread in sst because of the narrower nudging layer the homogenisation of the ensemble s sst fields by the eddies might be more readily achieved these nudging layer experiments reinforce our observations from sections 5 3 1 and 5 3 2 that increasing ssh spread often comes at the cost of reducing the spread in sst this is a trade off which will have consequences for data assimilation schemes 5 3 5 the spatial structure of the ensemble spread of surface variables the plots in figs 6 and 7 give us useful mean quantities but to really understand how the perturbations affect the circulation it helps to look at some surface maps shown in fig 9 are for the four principal ensembles the time means of ssh ensemble spread for the three months following the ensemble spin up phase this compacted view of the ensembles over the period summarises their behaviour and major differences which we enumerate explicitly as follows 1 in all the ensembles the greatest contributor to the spread in ssh is from the mesoscale eddies this follows from observing that the region where ssh ensemble spread is concentrated is also where the eddies are present 2 these eddies are concentrated in deep water with the continental slope represented by the 200 m isobath neatly circumscribing their range 3 the wind ensemble has the smallest spread though in a concentrated area in the middle of the domain its ensemble spread is greater than that of the parent ensemble 4 over the shelf and at the domain s edge the wind ensemble has the lowest spread for the other ensembles non local processes contribute to the spread in these areas while the wind ensemble is limited by only having one set of open boundary conditions 5 the obc and wind obc ensembles are very similar non local errors dominate 6 the ensemble spread of ssh is concentrated in the centre of the domain of the child ensembles a feature not shared by the parent ensemble one reason for this is the higher spatial coherence of the mesoscale eddies than in the parent model another possibility is that the eddies might be trapped in the coastal model s domain what this view does not show is the pronounced ensemble spread seen as peaks in the time series in fig 6 which results from the domain wide pulsations generated in the parent model it also does not show the comparable spread of the wind ensemble to the others early in the period before it falls off from mid january this is clearly visible in the downward trend of the wind ensemble s deep water ssh spread the top right graph in fig 6 it is an almost suspiciously smooth signal but it seems to be a product of a particularity of the unperturbed run of the parent model recall that all members of the wind ensemble are forced at the open boundaries by the parent s unperturbed run the large mesoscale eddy in that simulation shifts towards the northern and western boundaries of the bobland domain during the simulation period being closer to the boundary means that it is more likely to be controlled by the prescribed open boundary conditions and is more resilient to being displaced by the wind this behaviour is echoed in the ensemble means and spreads of the surface velocity fields in figs 10 and 11 respectively for the 20th of january and the 19th of february representing the beginning and end of the downward trend in ssh spread comparing the two we see that the wind ensemble s spread on the 20th of january is greater than a month later and this reduction in ensemble spread manifests as a more spatially coherent eddy signal in the ensemble mean for the wind ensemble in the february plot to lend support to this hypothesis we can compare with runs where we reduced the nudging layer from 30 points to 10 points fig 6 black and green dashed curves respectively sure enough the effect of the wind perturbations on the ssh in this ensemble is less constrained by the open boundary conditions and the overall ensemble spread is higher it still falls in february but by proportionally less and the recovery in march is stronger fig 12 shows surface maps for individual ensemble members for the 9th of march for the wind and wind nl10 ensembles where the latter is identical to the former except with the narrower 10 point nudging layer by gathering all the member plots into one figure we are able to rapidly make a qualitative comparison ignoring fine details of the two ensembles with the 30 point nudging layer the large eddy barely changes position from member to member whereas with a 10 point nudging layer the members are more distinct with the eddy s position and strength varying much more the 10 point nudging layer also allows the eddy s centre to get closer to the edge of the domain let us return briefly to the velocity ensemble means and spreads in figs 10 and 11 conspicuously absent from the spreads for the 20th of january fig 10 is a signal corresponding to the slope current clearly visible in the zonal means as this is true for the parent ensemble as well as for the coastal ensembles this is an aspect of the parent model s dynamics that the coastal ensembles faithfully reproduce although we were able to find a weak spread at certain times most of the time the slope current when present remained unmoved by the perturbations as with the ssh we also produced plots for the time mean of surface temperature spread these are shown in fig 13 the combination of different perturbation sources affects the sst s ensemble spread in similar ways to the ssh though with some particularities the salient points are 1 again the domain is divided into two zones by the continental slope but here the ensemble spread is greatest over the shelf with the spread produced by the river plumes dominating the signal 2 in deep water the wind ensemble again has the lowest spread and at the edges where the spread is controlled by the open boundary conditions the spread drops off the parent ensemble has the highest spread 3 over the shelf however the wind ensemble s spread is comparable to the other ensembles with the river plume being the dominant source of error there 4 as a consequence of this the wind obc ensemble s spread over the shelf is visibly greater than the obc ensemble s a finding reflected in the time series in fig 7 5 meanwhile it is the parent which has the largest spread over the shelf as it does overall though with a different pattern which extends further south and west from the adour s mouth and is weaker further north along the shelf 6 the ensemble spread in the parent has localised peaks in contrast to the smoother pattern in the child model s ensembles 5 4 beneath the surface in the preceding sections we have concentrated on the ensemble spread of surface variables a natural place to look considering that the wind perturbations affect the surface directly and the ocean interior only indirectly but there is a significant response to these perturbations deep beneath the surface too in some places much stronger attributing an error response of the oceanic interior to surface forcing only is interesting enough from the standpoint of model and dynamic variability but for data assimilation systems it suggests the possibility of correcting the model well away from the surface when surface data is assimilated so with that in mind in this section we explore the ensemble response in the coastal ocean interior 5 4 1 a general view of the ensembles beneath the surface we begin once again by concentrating on the four principal ensembles wind obc wind obc and the parent ensemble in all the ensembles the maxima of ensemble spread for salinity and temperature are either below the surface or over the continental shelf under the influence of the river plume s wandering tendrils of cool fresh water looking at time series of mean temperature spread near the base of the mixed layer taken to be roughly 185 m below the surface shown in fig 14 we note immediately that it is much greater than at the surface we see that the spread of the parent is sometimes slightly higher than the other ensembles but often considerably lower than all but the wind ensemble the slightly greater spread of parent relative to the coastal ensembles in the latter half of the period is mainly due to the deepening of the mixed layer which puts the highly variable base beyond the depth at which we measured the statistics a look at the vertical cross sections in fig 15 shows a very high spread at the bottom of the mixed layer which comes about as the depth of the thermocline changes in response to changes in mixing depth induced by the modified wind stress this effect was also noted by andreu burillo et al 2002 following their sensitivity experiments there are a couple of other conclusions we can draw immediately from fig 15 one is that from the surface to near the bottom of the mixed layer but before reaching the thermocline the parent ensemble s spread is greater than the coastal ensembles this is consistent with our earlier conclusion of higher diffusion in the coastal model but now it is manifested in the vertical direction the second is that at the thermocline the spread of the coastal ensembles is greater than the parent s recalling that the coastal ensembles higher spreads in ssh are reflected in their more coherent and stronger eddies these would be expected to erode the surface stratification and deepen the mixed layer rather more than in the parent this explains at least part of both observations though it must be said that differences in the way that vertical mixing is parameterised would also be pertinent this close to the surface once again the equivalent plots for salinity do not add enough new information to warrant their inclusion here suffice it to say that deep below the surface the effect of the river plumes is very small at the increased depths of 500 m and 1000 m shown in fig 16 the parent ensemble spread is still lower again than the coastal ensembles though it still overtakes the wind ensemble later in the time series this behaviour too is visible in fig 15 below the surface mixed layer the coastal ensembles feature a strong spread which coincides with a second deeper thermocline at the same depth the parent ensemble s spread almost disappears the vertical gradients of temperature and salinity are very similar in both parent and coastal models so we may once more attribute this difference to the more detailed small scale dynamics of the coastal model arguably it is here below the mixed layer that the coastal model distinguishes itself the most from the regional parent model the enhanced horizontal resolution allows it to resolve small scale eddies as small as 10 km in diameter and the sigma level vertical discretisation allows for a more detailed description of the circulation s interaction with bottom relief as a result not only are the eddies stronger and penetrate deeper but from about a thousand metres below the surface the coastal model s horizontal velocity fields become wonderfully complex almost belying any connection to the parent model s dynamics fig 17 illustrates this for the meridional velocity component for unperturbed runs of the parent and coastal models at the surface and three horizontal sections at different depths the velocity fields are stronger in the coastal model at all depths but that is not sufficient to explain the fall at depth in the parent s ensemble spread relative to the coastal model in deep water the surface velocity fields are dominated by the large anticyclonic mesoscale eddy with a smaller cyclonic one adjoining it on its south eastern edge clear in the coastal model and hinted at in the parent model at 500 m these eddies still dominate the velocity field but at 1000 m they fracture into smaller less coherent structures this change in regime is not unique to the coastal model but what differentiates it from the parent model is the high density of variation while the large structures dominate at the surface for both models at depth it is the smaller structures which only the coastal model resolves which dominate some of this complexity arises from small eddies generated by the flow around the underwater gorges on the continental slopes which shows the importance not only of the model s higher resolution but of the bathymetry s too as well as the terrain following vertical sigma coordinates 5 4 2 the reduced nudging layer s effects at depth as we did for section 5 4 1 we plotted curves for the coastal ensembles with a reduced nudging layer at depth figs 14 and 16 green curves the results below the surface are less ambiguous than for the surface if one remembers to take into account that in the latter part of the period the mixed layer deepens and the ensemble statistics start to resemble the surface more than the thermocline apart from this the reduced nudging layer leads to a greater ensemble spread consistent with the coastal model s stronger response to perturbations at depth freed somewhat from the constraints of the parent model it develops even more differences between members as we descend the water column 5 4 3 interaction of eddies with bottom near a strong gradient we noticed a particularly strong spread at a specific time and place which we thought worthy of closer examination in fig 18 we show cross sections of the wind ensemble centred on an eddy the unperturbed run s ssh is depicted in fig 18a in which an eddy dipole can be made out fig 18b shows a cross section of ensemble spread of temperature and several features stand out firstly there is a large spread at the base of the surface mixed layer as discussed in section 5 4 1 there is also a small region of larger spread at the coast a result of the wind pushing the cool fresh water plume of the adour in different directions and it being mixed through the water column but most interestingly there is a region between 1000 and 1500 m depth and 3 and 2 5 longitude with high ensemble spread it is particularly strong along the gently sloping landes plateau this feature is all the more remarkable because of the region of reduced spread between it and the surface mixed layer and at these depths the vertical mixing produced by surface stresses cannot have much influence neither in fact can the open boundary conditions since only local wind perturbations have been applied the unperturbed temperature profile in fig 18c shows the second deep thermocline mentioned in section 5 4 1 it lies beneath a region of much gentler temperature gradient which extends from the near surface thermocline to a depth of around 1200 m the zonal velocity field at this depth plotted in fig 18e shows that the eddy visible in the ssh signal in fig 18a extends down to just about reach the slope the final plot in the figure 18f shows the spread of the zonal velocity while it decreases with depth it is still significant near the second thermocline this and the anomalously high values of vertical velocity spread shown in fig 18d suggest that interactions between the bottom and the eddy are responsible for the enhanced spread in temperature the vertical velocity spread is especially high at the bottom where it coincides with the high spread in temperature there is meanwhile a very small ensemble spread in vertical velocity coinciding with the near surface thermocline this is telling the thermocline is a region of strong temperature gradient and therefore high stability where we would expect vertical movement to be suppressed we can hence differentiate the mechanism which displaces the near surface thermocline from that which produces the strong temperature spread near the bottom where strong vertical movements are present within the stable layer oey and zhang 2004 showed that warm eddies interacting with a slope could lead to big modifications to the deep circulation including cyclones and jets while in this particular case we do not see substantial alterations to the horizontal velocities the vertical velocities do appear to be affected by such an interaction at other times not shown vertical motion and consequently its spread is suppressed in the deep thermocline as well even when there is a large spread of temperature and there are doubtless other complex processes leading to enhanced spread that a more exhaustive study of the ensembles could identify we can say with certainty that the presence of the eddy slope interaction is not necessary to generate a large spread deep beneath the surface over the deep abyssal plain of the bay of biscay vervatis et al 2016 demonstrated this by assimilating ssh data which were able to correct the strong errors between 1000 and 1500 m ayoub et al in prep also observed a high spread at these depths far from the slope but the eddy slope interaction provides another mechanism by which model errors can be generated at depth and hence by which the model can be corrected at depth by data assimilation at the surface the use of the coastal model is decisive here because although we could not verify whether or not the vertical velocities were affected in the parent model there is no such corresponding enhanced spread in temperature it is possible that the eddy slope interaction is present but the result is barely if at all discernible interestingly it is the wind ensemble which shows by far the strongest spread here even the wind obc ensemble does not come close resembling more closely the obc ensemble this is not then a question of pure strength of perturbation but of a confluence of factors the right perturbation leading to the right deviations of the eddy with the right temperature gradient in the right place so that the conditions are favourable for the eddy slope interaction to generate the spread in temperature 5 5 extent and diffusion of river plumes only the adour river runoff is explicitly modelled in the coastal model but the gironde s runoff is also modelled in the parent model its plume enters the coastal model from the northern boundary forming as it does with the adour s plume a significant body of cool less saline water as we noted in section 5 3 5 the behaviour of the adour plume is quite different in the two models leading to different ensemble statistics direct comparison between the models is complicated because even though the prescribed outflow volumes of the adour are the same for most of the time period in the biscay36 and bobland configurations the way that river water is injected into the bay of biscay is different both use a single grid point as the source but this grid point is much smaller in bobland than in biscay36 the depth at the river mouth is also different with biscay36 drawing its depth from its coarse bathymetry about 10 5 m and bobland using a prescribed depth of 5 m the areas of the outward faces of the grid cells are then about 22950 m 2 and 2500 m 2 respectively so the discharge velocity is more than 9 times greater in bobland than in biscay36 a higher velocity could produce a longer plume but could also generate more local turbulence and generate more mixing dissipating the plume earlier the salinity is treated in a similar way in the two river models it is prescribed and insignificant compared to the salinity levels in the open ocean 0 psu in bobland and 0 1 psu in biscay36 temperature on the other hand is handled differently with only minimum and maximum values prescribed in bobland 10 and 22 with the seasonal temperature cycle set with a sinusoid in biscay36 the temperature is determined from a neumann boundary condition with the river discharge grid point treated as an open boundary with these differences only a gross evaluation of the river plume behaviour between the two configurations would be appropriate but between the three different bobland ensembles we can be more concrete our analysis is based on using the surface salinity as a proxy for the river plume for each member of an ensemble we calculated the area of each plume whose extents were defined by one of three thresholds taking the ensemble mean we determined a typical plume area for each model these areas are shown plotted over time in fig 19 the parent model clearly has the most expansive plume by all three of the threshold definitions with only occasional exceptions mainly at the beginning of the time series interestingly the plumes from the three coastal ensembles are very similar to the extent that they do differ from one another they do not follow the pattern of ensemble spreads of surface temperature and salinity as described in section 5 3 and fig 7 recall that the surface salinity and temperature behave almost identically these spreads are by far the greatest in the parent ensemble followed by the wind obc and obc ensembles these two are very close and then the wind ensemble with by far the least spread however although the parent ensemble s plume area is on average greater the next greatest is more often than not the obc ensemble with the wind obc ensemble usually found between it and the wind ensemble the greater spread of the parent ensemble seems to reflect its broader average plume but between the coastal ensembles things are a bit subtler a greater spread in sst or sss in one coastal ensemble than in another could mean that since the plume is displaced further it is also diffused more effectively this threshold value is hence attained closer to the source this is just one factor in a complicated process to shed more light on the plume s behaviour we examine the salinity and its spatial gradients for the parent and child models shown in fig 20 the example shown is for the first perturbed members of the wind obc and parent ensembles it appears as though we can distinguish three salinity regimes in both models 1 the inner fresh zone near the river mouth with a strong gradient as the fresh water mixes quickly with the surrounding saline water 2 an intermediate zone of mixed water distinct from the main outer circulation and 3 the saline outer circulation the inner zone of the coastal model has a very strong gradient at the river mouth representing a rapid mixing of the plume here while the parent s mixing is slower by the time we get to the edge of this zone however the parent model s plume stabilises and remains coherent for longer and the coastal model s intermediate zone is patchy and diffuse even though a direct comparison is impossible the ocean colour observations of petus et al 2014 do favour the coastal model s representation the very sharp boundary in the observations between the river plume and the surrounding water is situated very close to the river mouth closer in character to the more localised and more quickly diffused plume of the coastal model 6 discussion and conclusions we sought to downscale a regional model ensemble by forcing a coastal model ensemble by an ensemble of open boundary conditions as well as by local wind perturbations we found that overall the ensemble of open boundary conditions coupled with local wind perturbations generated the greatest spread in the coastal model but that the contribution from the open boundary ensemble was greater than the local wind perturbations and the combination of the two led to only a slightly greater spread it seems as though the non local errors advected into the model were more important in generating local errors than the local wind perturbations only during the early stages of the ensemble spinup before the non local perturbations had time to penetrate into the domain did we see the local wind perturbations generate a greater spread over the shelf another contributing factor could be that although the obc ensemble was generated without local wind perturbations the perturbed surface characteristics resulting from the non locally produced errors created a difference in each member s wind stress this might partly explain why an additional wind perturbation did not add too much to the coastal ensemble s spread there was a distinct difference between the signals over the shelf and over deep water for all the ensembles the ssh spread was usually greater over deep water where the forcing perturbations displaced the large mesoscale eddy the sst spread was greater over the shelf where the river plume dominated the signature conversely the sst spread was lower over deep water and the ssh spread was for most of the period lower over the shelf the exception being the large non locally produced synchronous events which had an outsized effect over shallow waters the behaviour was different too with the spread of both variables over the shelf varying spatially and temporally more so than over deep water we experimented with different methods of generating the wind perturbations and combining them with the ensemble of open boundary conditions interestingly the exact form of the wind perturbations did not have a huge impact on the shape of the time series the magnitude changed but periods of large spread and low spread were mostly conserved this suggests that the intrinsic variability of the model dominates over any specific perturbation scheme this may also explain the saturation in spread that appeared to occur near the end of the ensemble spinup period with the different wind perturbations of course this was not quite as true when we switched from an ensemble with only local wind perturbations to one forced by the parent ensemble at the open boundaries in this case the non local errors were related to much larger scale processes that the coastal model alone could not represent whatever the local perturbation scheme the dominance of intrinsic variability and the insensitivity to the precise form of errors in boundary and initial conditions has been noted in geophysical modelling before for example by giorgi and bi 2000 and rinke et al 2004 we must be careful not to draw too many similarities with our own experiments for one thing not all of their conclusions which include insensitivity to perturbation magnitude apply to our ensembles but it seems safe to conclude that the finer details in a wind perturbation scheme are of relative unimportance the choice of nudging layer had consequences for the ensemble spread critically so for the wind ensemble with a broad nudging layer the large mesoscale eddy was present in the same area near the edge of the domain for all members of the wind ensemble this led to a sustained drop in ensemble spread an effect which disappeared almost entirely with application of the narrower nudging layer the narrower nudging layer also led to a bigger spread in ssh for the other coastal ensembles even though their spreads in sst saw only modest and inconsistent increases one of the more intriguing results in this study was how deep subsurface errors could be generated by surface perturbations a large spread at the base of the seasonal thermocline had been anticipated having been previously described andreu burillo et al 2002 but for there to be such a strong signal at much greater depths beyond 1000 m was less expected to be sure the parent model had a measurable spread there too but while the signals at the near surface thermocline were similar for the parent and coastal ensembles the deep water spread was in places at least twice as strong in the coastal ensembles than in the parent ensemble this suggests a valuable contribution that the downscaling paradigm can make to the study of model errors it is especially appealing from a data assimilation perspective for if we can generate deep subsurface errors then we might hope to be able to correct these regions with only surface data the vertical temperature gradients for the two models unperturbed runs we noted were almost the same but the model and bathymetry resolutions were much higher in the coastal model a major consequence of this was the more detailed dynamics of course but more specifically it was the ability of the coastal model to resolve more coherent mesoscale eddies with stronger currents these reached deeper in the coastal model than in the parent model whose less coherent eddy had a much weaker effect at these depths we also saw that eddy slope interactions could be an additional mechanism for ensemble divergence something we did not see in the parent ensemble the use of sigma layer depth coordinates in the coastal model may have contributed to this behaviour the river plume s behaviour was very different between the parent and child models and this contributed to the parent model s mostly higher sst spread among the coastal ensembles the spread was usually greatest for the obc ensemble though the difference was small according to our threshold criterion the mean plume area did not appear to be directly correlated with the ensemble spread we did find that the plume s behaviour supported our hypothesis that the parent model diffuses scalars less than the higher resolution coastal model which accounted for some of the differences in spread between the parent ensemble and the child ensembles a recurring feature of the ensembles was that the wind obc ensemble did not always have a greater spread than the obc ensemble logically more sources of perturbation should lead to more spread as we can explore more regions of the error space but with a limited number of ensemble members we cannot always guarantee an increase in spread as we pile on perturbations this limitation could probably be somewhat alleviated by increasing the magnitude of the perturbations but our aim is not to simply increase the spread at any cost we are interested in the model s response to forcing errors and we would prefer the error space to be densely populated by our ensemble despite the sometimes lower spread the benefit of adding an extra forcing perturbation is that it opens the error spaces which may be left untouched or weakly affected by any one forcing perturbation we can see this in our ensembles fig 13 shows almost no spread at the edge of the continental shelf for the coastal ensembles but the spread while still weak is slightly enhanced when wind perturbations are added the next phase of this work will be to use what we have learned in a data assimilation context in which we interpret the ensemble spread as the model s uncertainty of course a successful data assimilation scheme requires that the ensemble s spread span the data vervatis et

23995,we downscaled a free ensemble of a regional parent model to a high resolution coastal child ensemble in the bay of biscay the child ensemble was forced at the open boundaries by the parent ensemble and locally by perturbing the winds by comparing ensembles generated by each of these forcing perturbations separately and combined we were able to consider the ensemble from either of two paradigms 1 characterising high resolution coastal model errors using local and non local forcing perturbations or 2 downscaling regional model errors into the coastal domain we found that most of the spread in the child ensembles was generated from the ensemble of open boundary conditions with the local wind perturbations on their own generating substantially less ensemble spread together the two sources of error increased the ensemble spread by only a small amount over the non local perturbations alone in general the spread in sea surface height was greater in the child ensembles than in the parent ensemble probably due to the more refined dynamics while the spread in sea surface temperature was lower likely due to the way the open boundary conditions were averaged deep below the surface though the child ensemble featured a large spread even where the parent model s spread was very weak this enhanced error response is a promising result for an ensemble data assimilation system as it could be exploited to correct the model deep below the surface keywords ensemble modelling downscaling model uncertainties coastal modelling bay of biscay data assimilation 1 introduction we downscale geophysical models so that we can increase the resolution in a region of interest without incurring the computational cost and the difficulty of increasing the resolution everywhere in the model domain this modest aim leads to anything but a straightforward problem to solve though for the difficulties associated with nesting models are manifold and the high resolution child model cannot simply be regarded as a more detailed version of the parent model a corollary of this is that the errors in the parent model cannot be expected to translate in a straightforward way into errors in the child model it is this problem the downscaling of model errors which we concern ourselves with here specifically in ocean circulation models the promise of higher resolution models to provide more detailed descriptions of the ocean balances against some inconvenient physics at small scales as sandery and sakov 2017 show while increased detail is possible and useful this does not necessarily mean increased accuracy with the higher complexity of the small scale flow even deteriorating the large scale flow through an inverse energy cascade there are further problems to address with the open boundary problem quite apart from the difficulty of matching solutions of different spatial and temporal scales the internal variability of the downscaled model is decoupled from that of the parent model which can lead to divergent solutions an undesirable trait when the parent model outperforms the child sometimes this divergence can be redressed as katavouta and thompson 2016 showed by applying a spectral nudging technique in the deeper regions this maintained the parent model s accuracy there while giving free reign to the child model in the coastal region where the parent model was unable to resolve many of the processes with all this in mind it would be fruitful then to explore the behaviour of errors in a downscaled model system in this study we attempt to characterise a downscaled coastal model s errors from ensembles of perturbed simulations we do this principally by examining the ensemble s statistics above all the ensemble variance or equivalently its standard deviation which is often referred to as the ensemble s spread there are many sources of error in a model due to deficiencies in the physical model the numerical scheme and discretisation and errors in the initial and boundary conditions and the forcing fields by narrowing our focus onto a subspace of the full model error space we can better understand the sensitivity of the model to a specific set of error sources for us this subset consists only of surface winds and the open boundary conditions understanding the model error subspace will guide us in future efforts in assimilating data where corrections to the model will only be possible for variables sensitive to these two sources experimenting with forcing error perturbations in ocean models is not new of course even for nested models to name but a few studies echevin et al 2000 perturbed the initial conditions while leaving all other forcing variables untouched auclair et al 2003 examined the effect on a coastal model of perturbing in turn the initial density field a prominent slope current in the domain the wind field and river discharges jordà and de mey 2010 perturbed the wind and the initial analytic velocity profile kim et al 2011 perturbed the winds the initial conditions and the open boundary conditions the last of these by calculating eofs for the boundary conditions and with random amplitudes superimposing a linear combination of eof modes onto them in fact the same basic procedure we and others have used to perturb the wind the distinguishing feature of the work we are presenting is thus the use of an ensemble of open boundary conditions by defining our open boundary perturbations from a pre existing parent model ensemble we achieve something similar to kim et al 2011 as far as the coastal model error space is concerned but we gain the ability to compare our coastal model errors with the parent model errors in particular our coastal model s error space may be thought of as representing a refinement of the parent model s error space hence the problem may be viewed from two equivalent perspectives one is that of characterising coastal model errors by generating a coastal model ensemble and the other is that of downscaling errors from a larger scale parent model ensemble though philosophically different functionally these two paradigms amount to the same thing as long as the former is approached like the latter using an ensemble of open boundary conditions drawn from the parent model ensemble since the parent ensemble was generated by perturbing solely the wind and we further perturb the local winds in the coastal ensemble it is evident that the only forcing variable directly perturbed is the wind thus the open boundary conditions provided by the parent ensemble may be considered to be a conduit through which the effects of non local wind perturbations can enter the coastal domain it may seem limiting to use only one error source to generate our coastal ensemble but the implicit assumption underlying this choice that the model is perfect and that all the errors come from the wind forcing has the advantage that it enables us to concentrate on understanding the consequences of that one source and indeed the wind turns out to be a good choice as vervatis et al in review 2019 found that perturbing the wind in a regional model the very same regional model configuration as the parent model used in this study had a much greater effect than the other physical and biogeochemical perturbations they tested being restricted to wind perturbations also allows us to compare like with like when comparing the parent and child ensembles to that end we follow in the footsteps of other studies in which only the wind was perturbed for example those by le hénaff et al 2009 and kourafalou et al 2015 there are several ways one might choose to categorise the ensemble error behaviour the most obvious being with gross quantities like calculating the mean ensemble spread over time but it is informative to look beyond bulk quantities and see where as well as by how much the spread changes to address this we subdivide the domain into deep water continental shelf and intermediate zones we also generate surface and cross section maps to see what the error pattern looks like at a given point in time and space both at the surface and below the surface different variables should be expected to behave differently too and this should also depend on the regime near the river mouth we should see strong errors in salinity and temperature but sea surface height ought to vary most in deep water where the large eddies dominate in the signal we therefore consider these variables separately and compare them between the parent and child ensembles after a brief and general description of the bay of biscay section 2 and of the regional parent and coastal child models section 3 we discuss in some detail how the wind perturbations were calculated and how we used the open boundary ensemble to generate our ensembles section 4 the bulk of the paper is given over to an exploration of these ensembles section 5 we treat the surface extensively before diving beneath showing how surface wind perturbations can lead to large errors in specific zones under the surface and how this is also model dependent because of its highly non isotropic nature the behaviour of the river plume when subjected to wind perturbations holds its own interest so we treat this separately section 5 5 before concluding with a general discussion 2 the bay of biscay we shall present only a very brief summary of the major physical processes in the bay of biscay and in particular in the small domain at the heart of this study we invite the reader to consult the cited references for more detail the bay of biscay is really a gulf situated in the eastern atlantic ocean with its land boundaries formed by spain s northern coast and france s western coast the bay of biscay and its bathymetry are shown in fig 1 which also shows the domain boundaries for the regional parent model used in our experiments and the smaller coastal domain the continental shelf is clearly visible in the figure it can be as narrow as about 20 km on spain s northern coast near bilbao but it broadens greatly as one travels north along the french coast and less so westward along the spanish coast for our small coastal domain shown in fig 2 the important submarine features are the gouf de capbreton a striking submarine canyon and the plateau des landes which is really a gentle slope descending from the shelf into the abyssal plain although the only river directly modelled in our domain is the adour which meets the sea near bayonne the gironde s plume enters from the domain s northern boundary and is a major source of fresh cool water along the coast the discharge from both rivers is significantly cooler than the water in the bay so the river plumes can be identified from the sea surface temperature maps a fact we exploit in this study even though our model domain covers only a small corner of the bay of biscay an array of different physical processes may be found therein there are the river plumes of cooler fresh water which are an important part of the dynamics over the shelf the river discharge is greatest during the winter months puillat et al 2006 an intermittent along shore current the iberian poleward current extends along the spanish coast in late autumn and winter and occasionally follows the slope as it turns northward rubio et al 2013 kersalé et al 2016 this current is also associated with mesoscale anticyclonic slope water eddies swoddies which are provoked by bathymetric features such as undersea canyons which interrupt the current s flow and send jets of slope water into deep water regions pingree and le cann 1992 of particular interest for this study the plateau des landes plays host to some intense mesoscale activity with cyclones and anti cyclones of between 50 and 80 km diameter le cann and serpette 2009 solabarrieta et al 2014 beneath the surface incursion of water masses such as the mediterranean intermediate water can lead to strong and deep sub surface gradients in temperature and salinity van aken 2000 the barotropic tidal amplitudes in the bay of biscay can be extremely large over 1 5 m in some places over the shelf dominated by the semi diurnal lunar tide m2 le cann 1990 as the tidal current crosses the shelf break quite complex baroclinic flows and internal tides can be generated some of whose energy dissipates by adding to the vertical mixing pairaud et al 2010 in our model domain because the shelf is narrower the tidal currents are not as strong as they are further north le cann 1990 toublanc et al 2018 3 the ocean circulation models and their configurations before we discuss ensemble generation we shall say a few words about the models themselves we give only brief descriptions of them here as they have been more thoroughly described elsewhere we refer to the high resolution coastal model as the child or coastal model and the regional model supplying the open boundary conditions as the parent the parent ensemble is the free ensemble produced by vervatis et al 2016 and described fully in their paper it was generated with the nemo model madec and the nemo team 2008 on a 1 36 grid on a domain encompassing the bay of biscay and the western part of the english channel this configuration named biscay36 was based on that of maraldi et al 2013 the coastal model is symphonie which is described in a series of papers by marsaleix et al 2006 2008 2009a 2011 2012 estournel et al 2005 2009 and pairaud et al 2008 over the last decade the symphonie model has been used in several different configurations to model the bay of biscay see the studies of pairaud et al 2008 2010 for the barotropic and internal tides le hénaff et al 2009 for the general circulation herbert et al 2011 on the iberian poleward current along the northern spanish coasts herbert 2012 for the surface circulation response to storm klaus in january 2009 and recently toublanc et al 2018 for the impact of tides on the open boundary conditions these studies have shown that symphonie was able to simulate the main circulation patterns in the bay of biscay from daily to seasonal time scales the domain whose limits can be seen in the bathymetry plots in fig 2 is much smaller than the parent model s it forms a box over the southeastern corner of the bay of biscay extending northward up to just beneath arcachon on france s southwest coast and westward a little before reaching santander on spain s northern coast fig 1 the resolution is set to 500 m between grid points in both horizontal directions a substantial improvement over the parent model s roughly 2 5 km resolution this enables it to better resolve mesoscale eddies perhaps even allowing the resolution of sub mesoscale eddies fronts and river plumes the model bathymetries are different too for the coastal model we used a new high resolution bathymetry lyard 2015 shown in fig 2 while the parent model defines depth with z values the coastal model uses σ layers we refer to the specific configuration of the symphonie model in this high resolution coastal domain as bobland the meteorological fields for both model configurations are the 3 hourly operational analyses from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf high resolution model and are thus identical for the parent s and child s unperturbed runs the child model is not two way nested in the parent model but rather uses an independent run of the parent model to define its open boundary conditions that is offline the method for handling the open boundaries is clearly of consequence for this study but we defer this to the discussion on downscaling in section 4 2 2 a summary of some of the features and configuration parameters for both models is given in table 1 in this paper we perform sensitivity studies so we have not sought to verify in detail the realism of the model beyond what the prior studies we have cited have done we nevertheless thought it prudent to check that our results were in line with observations unfortunately very few observations were available to us for our period of study in our domain we have used the l3s daily satellite sst fields orain 2016 but the coverage is very poor due to the frequently cloudy conditions in the bay of biscay in winter comparisons of the unperturbed runs for both the parent and child with data from those days with good coverage showed few differences of more than half a degree celsius we have also checked that our results are qualitatively consistent with the information found in the literature for instance the observations of sst and hf radar presented by solabarrieta et al 2014 show a large eddy similar to the one that persists throughout the study period while the size and location of the eddy are consistent between the coastal model and the data the parent model s eddy properties seem less realistic also we found that the sst gradient over the eastern shelf and at the edge of the adour s plume was in good agreement with solabarrieta et al s 2014 observations along the spanish shelf it was however too warm maybe because of a local recirculation not shown 4 ensemble generation one of our main assumptions is that the model errors result principally from errors in the forcing variables if we know the distribution of these errors or we can guess at it we can generate an ensemble of perturbed forcing variables which follow it if we then apply this ensemble of perturbed forcings to the model we can generate an ensemble of model realisations each member corresponding to a particular forcing perturbation this model ensemble can then provide a useful estimate of the model error covariances strictly speaking of course the estimate is only of the subspace of error covariances related to the forcing variables we perturb but if these forcing variables dominate the others then this is adequate in this study where our focus is on downscaling an ocean circulation model we only directly perturb the winds and the open boundary conditions although these latter are themselves generated from perturbations to the parent model s winds vervatis et al in review 2019 found that the wind was and by quite some way the most important source of error among those that they tested we describe in turn the procedure for perturbing the wind locally and how we utilised the ensemble of open boundary conditions 4 1 the wind perturbations we followed auclair et al 2003 and le hénaff et al s 2009 method for perturbing the wind field which is also the method used by vervatis et al 2016 our basic assumption is that the uncertainties in the ecmwf wind fields have the same spatial and temporal structure as the wind variability consequently the perturbations are built from the empirical orthogonal functions eofs of the ecmwf wind fields in the bobland domain over the period desired for this study this is december 2011 to march 2012 let u be the matrix containing both zonal and meridional wind velocities it may be decomposed into its temporal mean and an anomaly matrix 1 u u u now for a matrix u containing both zonal and meridional wind anomalies and of dimension k l where k and l are the temporal and spatial dimensions respectively we may perform a singular value decomposition giving us the expression 2 u x λ y t where x r k j and y r l j are composed of orthogonal vectors and λ r j j is diagonal whose non zero elements σ j are the singular values of u the dimension j corresponds to the number of modes of which only the first few are computed using the method described by toumazou and cretaux 2001 to decide how many to keep we can use the singular values from λ to determine what percentage p j of the total variance each mode j represents 3 p j σ j 2 tr λ 2 where tr indicates that the trace of the matrix is taken for our eofsthe first two modes explained 64 and 29 of the variance respectively and there was a steep drop to the third mode at only a little more than 2 after which the percentage for subsequent modes fell gradually fig 3 shows the temporal standard deviation of the first five modes where the dominance of the first zonal and second meridional modes is made clear as is the much weaker contribution from higher order modes we therefore decided to keep only these first two modes together explaining about 93 of the total variance the eof modes may be recombined with random numbers ϵ i j one for each ensemble member i and each spatial mode j to produce a wind perturbation which is added to the original wind field following lucas et al 2008 we choose the random numbers from a gaussian distribution in pairs of positive and negative numbers of the same absolute value the probability density function is then 4 p ϵ 1 2 π s 2 e ϵ 2 2 s 2 where s is the standard deviation the perturbation can be expressed as 5 u i j 1 2 ϵ i j x j σ j y j t and the wind field for ensemble member i is then given by 6 u i u u i if our ocean model were linear the pairs of gaussian random numbers would guarantee that the ensemble of simulations be gaussian with zero mean following vervatis et al 2016 we assume an error standard deviation of s 0 3 for eq 4 reflecting a presumed observational error of 30 for the wind it is worth mentioning that le hénaff et al 2009 assumed an error of 0 2 but chose the value of 0 3 to deliberately inflate the ensemble dispersion since there are many other sources of error we have not perturbed and noting that our ensemble runs are not especially long either we feel that the choice is reasonable for our configuration whatever the real error value to prevent the wind perturbations from being correlated between members the random numbers must be replaced by a new set generated with the same gaussian and pairing criteria and uncorrelated with previous sets all the same the rate at which we change them should not be too high otherwise coherent weather patterns would not have enough time to develop vervatis et al 2016 and le hénaff et al 2009 chose to update the random numbers every five days their choice also corresponded to the decorrelation time of the wind eofs although their eofs are on a much larger spatial scale than ours ultimately it is still an arbitrary decision so we did not seek to replicate this methodology for our reduced domain preferring instead to follow their example and use five days as well to avoid shocks when updating from one set of random numbers to the next we linearly interpolated them in time ensuring a smooth evolution from one perturbation to the next for all times 4 2 an ensemble of open boundary conditions 4 2 1 generating the parent ensemble downscaling a regional model to a high resolution coastal model implies using the regional parent model to prescribe the open boundary conditions for the coastal child model in our study we want to take this a step further we want to downscale a regional model ensemble so for each member of our coastal ensemble we use a different member of the parent ensemble to force the open boundaries from the point of view of the coastal ensemble this is equivalent to saying that its open boundaries are being perturbed other ways of perturbing them could be envisaged such as the methods tested by jordà and de mey 2010 but by using the parent ensemble we maintain the dual paradigm of ensemble downscaling and equivalently perturbation of the open boundary conditions for the case where we perturb the winds locally as well this adds extra degrees of freedom to our ensemble our parent ensemble is the regional free ensemble described by vervatis et al 2016 generated as we have said by perturbing the ecmwf winds using the same eof method we have just presented however their eofs were calculated over the whole biscay36 domain for a different period from ours and from daily averages of the wind fields as opposed to the 3 hourly fields we used the temporal standard deviations of the first five of their eof modes for the biscay36 configuration are shown in fig 4 where the view has been restricted to the bobland domain if we compare them to the eofs we calculated for the bobland configuration shown in fig 3 we see that although both eofs are dominated by the first zonal mode thereafter they are markedly dissimilar the bobland eofs were calculated only over the bobland domain so we see a slightly more complex structure and the second meridional mode is stronger relative to its neighbouring modes first meridional and second zonal than in biscay36 vervatis et al 2016 kept the first six eof modes to generate their wind perturbations but even by only keeping the first two modes in bobland we might expect stronger and more varied wind perturbations both because of the stronger first zonal and second meridional modes and because of the more structured second zonal and first meridional modes we test this hypothesis in section 5 3 3 there are two other differences between the way we and vervatis et al 2016 handled the time dependent component of the perturbations firstly they did not use every index from the eof time series like we did but instead every fifth one interpolating them the same way as the random numbers secondly when we started the ensemble runs we set the first random number to zero for all members so that the first perturbation would ramp up from zero the omission of this step created a spike in the parent ensemble s spread discussed in section 5 3 1 4 2 2 the downscaling method some thought was needed about the manner in and the extent to which the regional model should influence the coastal model the regional model s fields were provided as daily averages where the mean was taken over 25 instantaneous fields spaced an hour apart the fields used to force the open boundaries of the child model are temperature velocity and sea surface height the 25 hour averaging for the parent ensemble s fields does a fairly good job of removing the tides from the sea surface height and velocity fields but some signals are still present principally an artefact due to aliasing this artefact has a period of around 14 to 15 days with an amplitude of about a couple of centimetres in deeper water it acts as a forcing on the coastal model producing likewise a signal with a fortnightly oscillation of up to about 4 cm over the shelf or 2 cm in deep water a more thorough discussion of the problems associated with the way these open boundary conditions have been averaged was presented by toublanc et al 2018 though the context is that of a much larger scale coastal model the boundary condition in the symphonie model is of the radiative flather type for a complete description on the way symphonie handles its open boundary conditions we refer the reader to marsaleix et al 2006 2009b we use a nudging layer of 30 grid points for the main experiments corresponding to 15 km in the bobland configuration at the boundary the nudging time scales are τ 0 1 days for the barotropic velocity and τ 1 day for the baroclinic velocity marchesiello et al 2001 applied a cosine half period to reduce these values to zero which is the method symphonie uses to wit 7 τ r d τ 2 1 cos π s l d s l for d s l 0 for d s l where τ r is the reduced nudging time scale at distance d from the domain boundary for a nudging layer of width s l we also considered using a narrower nudging layer of only 10 grid points before settling on 30 comparing unperturbed model runs of both nudging layer widths with sea surface temperature data we were unable to discern much difference between the two however a wider nudging layer could serve to constrain the coastal ensemble spread for example if the nudging layer is too wide the boundary conditions will impose themselves to the detriment of any other perturbed dynamics on the other hand a wider nudging layer we reasoned should cause the open boundary conditions to have more influence further into the domain for our application this may have benefits since it means all other things being equal that the coastal model ensemble will capture more of the parent ensemble s spread this was desirable too in subsequent work where we wished to preserve the large scale circulation of the parent model while assimilating data at the same time to be presented in a future paper thus the wider nudging layer was preferred although in the sections that follow we discuss the impact of the nudging layer width on the ensemble where pertinent 5 ensemble behaviour and statistics 5 1 introducing the ensembles we generated several ensembles in the bobland configuration whose defining characteristics are summarised in table 2 each one consists of 50 perturbed members the unperturbed run being excluded from all statistics of these ensembles we concentrate on three plus the parent ensemble with the others used mostly to answer specific questions raised by the first three and to test some of our assumptions the four principal ensembles on which the bulk of our analysis is based are the parent wind obc open boundary condition and wind obc ensembles the names corresponding to the forcing being perturbed for wind obc the two types of perturbation are applied at the same time when we perturb only the wind we use the same unperturbed open boundary conditions for all members and likewise when we perturb only the open boundary conditions we use the same unperturbed winds for all members the coastal ensemble runs begin after a model spinup starting on 12th september 2011 and ending at midnight 1st december at this time all of the ensemble members are identical and have the exact same open boundary conditions and winds as the unperturbed run and they diverge from then on in what follows all ensemble statistics were computed over the 50 member ensemble of perturbed runs i e excluding the unperturbed member to better represent and compare the ensemble statistics of each ensemble proper without contamination from the parent ensemble in the nudging layer the spatial averages exclude points which would fall inside the 30 point nudging layer of the bobland domain similarly to compare our ensembles with the parent ensemble statistics for the parent were only computed over the bobland domain again excluding points which fall inside the nudging layer the statistical quantity which primarily interests us is the ensemble standard deviation which is also referred to in this paper and in the literature as the ensemble spread this tells us to what extent the perturbations have led the ensemble to diverge and may be interpreted as a measure of the error in the model resulting from an imperfectly known forcing this is of particular significance in a data assimilation context we may think of it of as indicative of how amenable the model is to correction by data assimilation since the more error there is in the model then the more weight the observations will carry in the analysis for any given observational error we follow vervatis et al 2016 in treating the first month of the ensembles i e december as an ensemble spin up period where the ensemble members have still not diverged enough to give useful statistics we hence exclude the first month of our ensembles from the temporal moments we examine later in this paper but it can still be useful to look in here one reason is that it shows how the ensemble spread grows as the model perturbations take effect but there are also some dynamics which only or mostly occurred in this period 5 2 quantifying the interaction with tides exploring the model error subspace will guide us in future choices for data assimilation experiments in particular when dealing with ssh observations such as altimetric data the question arises whether the tidal signal should be assimilated together with the residual circulation we therefore need to understand if the tidal dynamics are represented in the model error subspace indeed tides influence and are influenced by the circulation so perturbations of wind and open boundary conditions could in principle perturb tides here we seek to quantify the effect of the perturbations on the tidal elevation signals to do this we need to remove the tidal signal from the elevation for accuracy we run a harmonic analysis on the surface elevation which requires a time series with a high sampling rate the analyses are therefore done at a few representative locations where we recorded these high frequency time series with a sampling rate of 2 3 15 5 they are marked in fig 2 we can estimate the effect of the perturbations on the tides by calculating the ratio of the ensemble spread of the tidal signal to the ensemble spread of the residual circulation for elevation η this may be expressed as 8 std η η std η where the prime indicates detiding by harmonic analysis fig 5 shows this ratio for each of the ten locations marked in fig 2 the highest value is about 0 16 for a point on the shelf but most of the time the values are closer to 0 05 only breaking the 0 1 threshold on a few occasions for points over deep water the ratios are even smaller one sixth is not a completely insignificant contribution to the ensemble spread but it is an absolute maximum and other high values only occur occasionally and over the shelf consequently we consider that the perturbations effect on tidal elevations is weak enough when compared with the residual circulation that it can be neglected thus in the following sections we consider only the modification of the residual circulation using detided daily fields of ssh where the detiding is done online by subtracting the tidal forcing from the model output fields before computing the daily average 5 3 ensemble spread of surface variables since it is at the surface that our forcing perturbations are generated remembering that the parent ensemble was generated by wind perturbations too so it is that we begin our examination of the ensembles at the surface too 5 3 1 time series of the spatial mean spread figs 6 and 7 show time series for the spatial mean of the ensemble spread of sea surface height ssh and sea surface temperature sst respectively we shall focus initially on the top left plots in these figures in which the spatial means are taken across the whole of the bobland domain for the moment we discuss only the four principal ensembles the wind obc wind obc and parent ensembles all drawn in black we first address the most prominent feature of the ssh curves except for the wind ensemble there is an extremely high spike in the spread at the beginning of the time series this is related to the manner in which the parent model s wind perturbations were abruptly introduced the subsequent spikes are on the contrary not artefacts but are related to a strong synchronous sea surface height change from the parent model which is accentuated on the shelf the ssh curves for the wind ensemble show no such spikes as this was the only ensemble not to use the parent ensemble for its open boundaries because we treat this first month as a spin up the anomalous initial spike is excluded from any temporal statistical calculations we make if we examine the full time series we see that the obc and wind obc ensembles have a greater overall spread in ssh than the parent ensemble a trend which is largely inverted for the sst meanwhile the wind ensemble almost always has the least spread of all the ensembles except for sst during the ensemble spin up phase this is because so much of the sst spread is generated by the cold river plume over the shelf and during the ensemble spin up the parent ensemble s perturbations have not had the time to propagate from the open boundaries to the near coast leaving the domain s interior initially unaffected unless the coastal ensemble s winds are perturbed in a similar fashion the parent ensemble s spread is initially lower than the wind ensemble s until non local perturbations have had time to reach the shelf that the sst and ssh should respond differently to the forcing perturbations is not in itself remarkable we discuss it further below however it may seem surprising at first that the parent ensemble in which only the winds are perturbed should have a greater spread in sst than the higher resolution wind obc ensemble where the perturbations from the boundary are superposed on the wind perturbations there are several mechanisms that might contribute to this firstly the high resolution coastal model is able to produce a more complex velocity field with more coherent eddies at smaller scales even if the ssh fields are more distinct from member to member this could result in more horizontal diffusion of scalars like temperature leading the ensemble members to look more alike in those variables but there is more to it than that because it also depends on how sub grid scale diffusion is handled in each model even though the tracer diffusion scheme is the same for both models the momentum diffusion is different and the numerical diffusion resolution time step and other features which are specific to each model will influence horizontal diffusion because the differences between the models run so deep a thorough comparison is impractical a simple test would be to see the effect of increasing horizontal diffusion of tracers in the coastal model which we did by doubling it the result partly confirmed our hypothesis about diffusion and spread in that the ensemble spread decreased as horizontal diffusion increased however increasing the horizontal diffusion parameter also lead to more diffusion of the velocity field in turn reducing the ssh spread this implies that scalar diffusion cannot be the sole mechanism responsible for the inverted spread behaviour to get a better sense of the relationship between the complexity of the eddy field and horizontal diffusion we looked at time series of spatial standard deviations for scalars and ssh calculating the temporal correlation coefficients of these time series for the unperturbed member of both parent and child model configurations was inconclusive however they do turn out to be negative but they are very weak with absolute values less than 0 3 except for sst with ssh for the parent model whose value is 0 59 despite the inconclusiveness of these findings and the equivocal role that diffusion appears to play in the different behaviour of the parent and child in the following section we examine evidence that suggests that indeed the parent model diffuses tracers rather less quickly than the coastal model the second reason for the inverted response of the ssh and sst spreads in the two models has to do with the way we prescribe the open boundary conditions themselves which is as daily means these are interpolated by the coastal model for the current time step but higher frequency information is irretrievably lost the coastal ensemble is thus being constrained into a lower frequency error space than the parent ensemble by means of the lower frequency forcing at the open boundaries this latter explanation leads to a contradiction for the loss of high frequency information should lead to a reduction in spread of all variables yet it does not we refer back to the first reason to explain this discrepancy the coastal model s higher resolution and therefore greater ability to resolve eddies the more defined eddies are stronger and more localised in space so their displacement must impose a more marked difference between ensemble members than the weakly resolved eddies of the regional model this justifies the ensemble downscaling paradigm since despite the mechanism by which we may expect the ensemble spread to be reduced the loss of information at the open boundaries the spread of ssh nonetheless increases finally a big contributor to the reversed trend of ssh and sst spreads appears to be directly attributable to the adour s plume which we consider in the next section 5 3 2 subdividing the domain in a previous ensemble study at the basin scale with the symphonie model kourafalou et al 2015 emphasised the existence of distinct regimes of model error over the shelf and in deep water to find out how these regimes differed between our ensembles we divided the bobland domain into three sub domains according to depth time series of the spatial means of ensemble spread for each subdivision are shown in the remaining plots in figs 6 and 7 the subdivisions are as follows deep water which we define as more than a thousand metres depth and which encompasses the abyssal plain and much of the gently sloping landes plateau top right plots in the figures an intermediate region where depths vary between a thousand metres and 150 metres which we may associate with the continental slope bottom left plots and the continental shelf with depths up to 150 metres bottom right plots these regions are defined based on the smoothed bathymetries seen by the respective models which although not precisely the same as each other are close enough as illustrated in fig 2 the sst spread is greatest over the shallow waters of the shelf where the river plumes are still coherent and can create very big and sharp differences in sst by contrast the ssh spread is smaller here and greater in deep water where large spatially coherent eddies and steric effects from a deeper water column have more influence but there are some peaks in ssh spread over the shelf for all ensembles except for the wind ensemble these peaks are driven by wind related processes in the parent model and are discussed by vervatis et al 2016 they manifest as large synchronous increases in the ssh everywhere but especially over the shelf the ssh spread over the slope is most of the time somewhere in between the shelf s and the deep water s the sst shows something different though from mid february the spread of all the ensembles is lower here than over either the shelf or the abyssal plain meanwhile at the end of december and from mid january through to mid february the parent ensemble s spread is far greater over the slope than that of the coastal ensembles the great difference between the ensembles may be explained by looking at the surface maps in fig 8 where we see that the parent model produces a more spatially coherent river plume and during those periods of large spread in the parent ensemble it extends out some distance from the coast being entrained by the deep water eddies the coastal model diffuses the plume earlier so it does not extend as far out naturally the further out the plume remains undiffused the more it can be deviated by the circulation and the higher the overall spread will be there than if it stayed near the coast and diffused quickly from mid february the plume does not extend as far out with the cooler river water tending to hug the coast where the spread remains quite large the mesoscale eddies are the other major source of ensemble spread at the surface but as is hinted in the sst maps and becomes clear when looking at the ssh these circulate mainly in deep water and do not greatly influence what is happening over the slope the slope is in a sense situated in between two highly active regimes insofar as sst spread goes this leaves us again to consider the greater spread in sst of the parent ensemble compared with the child ensembles looking again at the surface maps for sst and ssh in fig 8 we can see that coinciding with the large eddy s centre high ssh are higher temperatures these temperatures are not only higher for the parent model but the gradient is also steeper in other words while the parent model s eddy has a less distinct signature in ssh than the coastal model it has a conversely more distinct signature in sst this distinct signature naturally leads to a higher spread in sst for the parent ensemble and once more suggests that the parent model diffuses tracers more weakly than the coastal model we also produced plots for the sea surface salinity sss but they do not add much to the argument so we do not present them the two salient points are these the pattern of the sss spread follows quite closely that of the sst including the enhanced spread in the parent model over the slope and the spread of the sss is reduced by an order of magnitude in deep water the former observation is easily explained since both tracers are controlled by fairly similar mechanisms the river plumes on the shelf and the eddies over the abyssal plain the latter is simply because changes in salinity are dominated by fresh water discharge from rivers much more so than temperature 5 3 3 experimenting with the wind perturbation the manner in which we perturbed the winds involved some choices based more on convention than on physical law to determine how much these choices influenced the results we generated a few extra ensembles described in table 2 note that for want of computer resources these experiments were only performed for part of the period under examination some not exceeding the ensemble spin up period the spatial means of sst and ssh spread for these ensembles are shown in figs 6 and 7 along with the four principal ensembles it should be expected that increasing the wind perturbations should lead to greater ensemble spread in response the ensemble s05 bears out this intuitive hypothesis it is the exact same configuration as for our wind ensemble with the same distribution of random numbers ϵ i j used to construct the wind perturbations eqs 4 and 5 except with a higher error standard deviation of s 0 5 instead of 0 3 the conclusion holds true for both the ssh and sst and all subdivisions of the domain although near the end of the ensemble spin up period the difference is sometimes very small in section 4 2 we discussed how our eofs were calculated over a smaller domain and a shorter time period than those of vervatis et al 2016 and that we kept only the first two modes the smaller domain could serve to increase the structural detail for the same number of modes by virtue of excluding contributions from outside the domain but the shorter time frame could have the opposite effect because it does not capture long term changes similarly restricting ourselves to only two modes precludes some of the small scale structure the two sets of eofs are in short not directly comparable this prompted two questions firstly what do we lose by only keeping the first two modes and secondly what if we were to use exactly the same wind perturbations as those which generated the parent ensemble for the second question one intriguing possibility is that for any particular member the open boundary conditions could set up an ocean circulation pattern in the child model which could be reinforced by matching winds a kind of resonance effect which would maintain a larger spread or looked at another way if we used different wind perturbations than those used to generate the parent ensemble those perturbations might dampen the differences generated by the ensemble of open boundary conditions to answer the first question we generated the eof10 ensemble which is the same as our wind ensemble except that we kept the first ten eof modes instead of only the first two to be consistent the random numbers associated with the first two modes were the same keeping ten modes instead of two means that the total variance explained rises from 92 73 to 98 97 the result is that while the ensemble spread is enlarged in places notably for the ssh in deep water in january most of the time it is about the same as when only two modes are kept and quite often it decreases it seems that by adding the extra complexity to the wind perturbations we are cancelling out some of the variations we might otherwise produce the higher order modes might just be adding statistical noise which does not represent the spatial pattern of the wind uncertainties eventually leading to a decrease in spread with the ensemble eof obc we tested the second question by using the same wind perturbations that vervatis et al 2016 applied to generate the parent ensemble we ensured for each member in the coastal ensemble that we matched its wind perturbations to the corresponding parent member which provided its open boundary conditions though the difference is small the spread for this configuration is actually lower than that produced by our newly generated eofs in the wind obc ensemble we generated another ensemble eofbisc to measure the strength of these perturbations this ensemble uses the same wind perturbations as eof obc but like the wind ensemble keeps the unperturbed open boundaries for all members the spread in sst is also almost always less than for the wind ensemble but the spread in ssh increases from the end of the ensemble spin up period this somewhat contradictory result demonstrates the difficulty in drawing general conclusions from these experiments clearly a different set of eofs will lead to a different set of wind perturbations which may be more or less successful at perturbing the ocean circulation model at different times as a final test we configured yet another ensemble using the wind perturbations from the parent ensemble the eof obc ensemble was configured the same as eof obc except that the wind perturbations are no longer matched with the open boundary conditions from the equivalent member from the parent ensemble instead we forced each member s wind perturbation with the open boundary conditions from the member number two beneath it effectively randomising them the spread is higher than that of eof obc for the whole period simulated though still lower than that of the wind obc ensemble if anything we must conclude that any resonance effect should it exist must be small and that further perturbations in this case generated by simply dissociating the perturbations from the open boundary conditions can be expected to generate a greater spread rather than a lower one there are an infinite number of ways of generating perturbations so we needed to make some choices we made them based on the simple physical and intuitive assumption of generating wind uncertainties with a variability comparable to that of the wind itself despite other interesting questions perhaps the most significant result for us from this series of experiments is that small variations to this method do not significantly change the pattern of model sensitivity and hence do not change our conclusions 5 3 4 experimenting with the nudging layer width a wider nudging layer should increase the influence of the parent model on the child model preserving more of its behaviour in the downscaled system applied to an ensemble it follows that with a wider nudging layer the dynamics ought to be less impacted by the local perturbations the wind here to learn something about the way the nudging layer width affects the ensemble spread we prepared three ensembles with a 10 point nudging layer instead of 30 these are wind nl10 obc nl10 and wind obc nl10 the narrower nudging layer was imposed after the ensemble spinup period so the ensemble statistics are directly comparable with the other experiments the time series of the ensemble spreads are shown in figs 6 and 7 changing the nudging layer width has several repercussions so we shall take the variables one at a time starting with the ssh ensemble spreads overall except for the first few days over the shelf and slope where the ssh is controlled mainly by non local effects the domain wide synchronous oscillations previously mentioned the narrower nudging layer leads to greater spread for all three coastal ensembles this is true even for the obc run despite there being no wind perturbations doubtless a result of the greater freedom afforded to the eddy dynamics the wind ensemble s spread sees the greatest relative increase from this modification especially over the shelf and slope where it even exceeds all the other ensembles for a few days in mid march the obc and wind obc ensembles react in a more complicated way with the former s ensemble spread exceeding the latter s in deep water for most of the 3 month period the reason for this is not clear but one possibility might be that the 5 day interval between random numbers which sets up the time correlation of the wind perturbations is insufficient leading the wind perturbations to erode rather than strengthen the eddies over the slope and shelf where local effects are more important the wind obc ensemble retains its supremacy for the sst things are again quite different the wind ensemble s spread is almost unchanged over the shelf sometimes slightly lower but in deep water it is higher everywhere with the narrower nudging layer here too the reduced influence of the parent model allows the wind perturbations freer reign to spread the ensemble but the obc and wind obc ensemble spreads are often weaker with the narrower nudging layer again why this should be the case is not entirely clear but one possibility is that while the wind ensemble is less constrained by the parent model s unperturbed run the other ensembles rely on the ensemble of open boundary conditions to generate their ensemble spread why this should have the opposite effect for ssh and sst may be explained by higher scalar diffusion in the coastal model as discussed in sections 5 3 1 and 5 3 2 with already smaller spread in sst because of the narrower nudging layer the homogenisation of the ensemble s sst fields by the eddies might be more readily achieved these nudging layer experiments reinforce our observations from sections 5 3 1 and 5 3 2 that increasing ssh spread often comes at the cost of reducing the spread in sst this is a trade off which will have consequences for data assimilation schemes 5 3 5 the spatial structure of the ensemble spread of surface variables the plots in figs 6 and 7 give us useful mean quantities but to really understand how the perturbations affect the circulation it helps to look at some surface maps shown in fig 9 are for the four principal ensembles the time means of ssh ensemble spread for the three months following the ensemble spin up phase this compacted view of the ensembles over the period summarises their behaviour and major differences which we enumerate explicitly as follows 1 in all the ensembles the greatest contributor to the spread in ssh is from the mesoscale eddies this follows from observing that the region where ssh ensemble spread is concentrated is also where the eddies are present 2 these eddies are concentrated in deep water with the continental slope represented by the 200 m isobath neatly circumscribing their range 3 the wind ensemble has the smallest spread though in a concentrated area in the middle of the domain its ensemble spread is greater than that of the parent ensemble 4 over the shelf and at the domain s edge the wind ensemble has the lowest spread for the other ensembles non local processes contribute to the spread in these areas while the wind ensemble is limited by only having one set of open boundary conditions 5 the obc and wind obc ensembles are very similar non local errors dominate 6 the ensemble spread of ssh is concentrated in the centre of the domain of the child ensembles a feature not shared by the parent ensemble one reason for this is the higher spatial coherence of the mesoscale eddies than in the parent model another possibility is that the eddies might be trapped in the coastal model s domain what this view does not show is the pronounced ensemble spread seen as peaks in the time series in fig 6 which results from the domain wide pulsations generated in the parent model it also does not show the comparable spread of the wind ensemble to the others early in the period before it falls off from mid january this is clearly visible in the downward trend of the wind ensemble s deep water ssh spread the top right graph in fig 6 it is an almost suspiciously smooth signal but it seems to be a product of a particularity of the unperturbed run of the parent model recall that all members of the wind ensemble are forced at the open boundaries by the parent s unperturbed run the large mesoscale eddy in that simulation shifts towards the northern and western boundaries of the bobland domain during the simulation period being closer to the boundary means that it is more likely to be controlled by the prescribed open boundary conditions and is more resilient to being displaced by the wind this behaviour is echoed in the ensemble means and spreads of the surface velocity fields in figs 10 and 11 respectively for the 20th of january and the 19th of february representing the beginning and end of the downward trend in ssh spread comparing the two we see that the wind ensemble s spread on the 20th of january is greater than a month later and this reduction in ensemble spread manifests as a more spatially coherent eddy signal in the ensemble mean for the wind ensemble in the february plot to lend support to this hypothesis we can compare with runs where we reduced the nudging layer from 30 points to 10 points fig 6 black and green dashed curves respectively sure enough the effect of the wind perturbations on the ssh in this ensemble is less constrained by the open boundary conditions and the overall ensemble spread is higher it still falls in february but by proportionally less and the recovery in march is stronger fig 12 shows surface maps for individual ensemble members for the 9th of march for the wind and wind nl10 ensembles where the latter is identical to the former except with the narrower 10 point nudging layer by gathering all the member plots into one figure we are able to rapidly make a qualitative comparison ignoring fine details of the two ensembles with the 30 point nudging layer the large eddy barely changes position from member to member whereas with a 10 point nudging layer the members are more distinct with the eddy s position and strength varying much more the 10 point nudging layer also allows the eddy s centre to get closer to the edge of the domain let us return briefly to the velocity ensemble means and spreads in figs 10 and 11 conspicuously absent from the spreads for the 20th of january fig 10 is a signal corresponding to the slope current clearly visible in the zonal means as this is true for the parent ensemble as well as for the coastal ensembles this is an aspect of the parent model s dynamics that the coastal ensembles faithfully reproduce although we were able to find a weak spread at certain times most of the time the slope current when present remained unmoved by the perturbations as with the ssh we also produced plots for the time mean of surface temperature spread these are shown in fig 13 the combination of different perturbation sources affects the sst s ensemble spread in similar ways to the ssh though with some particularities the salient points are 1 again the domain is divided into two zones by the continental slope but here the ensemble spread is greatest over the shelf with the spread produced by the river plumes dominating the signal 2 in deep water the wind ensemble again has the lowest spread and at the edges where the spread is controlled by the open boundary conditions the spread drops off the parent ensemble has the highest spread 3 over the shelf however the wind ensemble s spread is comparable to the other ensembles with the river plume being the dominant source of error there 4 as a consequence of this the wind obc ensemble s spread over the shelf is visibly greater than the obc ensemble s a finding reflected in the time series in fig 7 5 meanwhile it is the parent which has the largest spread over the shelf as it does overall though with a different pattern which extends further south and west from the adour s mouth and is weaker further north along the shelf 6 the ensemble spread in the parent has localised peaks in contrast to the smoother pattern in the child model s ensembles 5 4 beneath the surface in the preceding sections we have concentrated on the ensemble spread of surface variables a natural place to look considering that the wind perturbations affect the surface directly and the ocean interior only indirectly but there is a significant response to these perturbations deep beneath the surface too in some places much stronger attributing an error response of the oceanic interior to surface forcing only is interesting enough from the standpoint of model and dynamic variability but for data assimilation systems it suggests the possibility of correcting the model well away from the surface when surface data is assimilated so with that in mind in this section we explore the ensemble response in the coastal ocean interior 5 4 1 a general view of the ensembles beneath the surface we begin once again by concentrating on the four principal ensembles wind obc wind obc and the parent ensemble in all the ensembles the maxima of ensemble spread for salinity and temperature are either below the surface or over the continental shelf under the influence of the river plume s wandering tendrils of cool fresh water looking at time series of mean temperature spread near the base of the mixed layer taken to be roughly 185 m below the surface shown in fig 14 we note immediately that it is much greater than at the surface we see that the spread of the parent is sometimes slightly higher than the other ensembles but often considerably lower than all but the wind ensemble the slightly greater spread of parent relative to the coastal ensembles in the latter half of the period is mainly due to the deepening of the mixed layer which puts the highly variable base beyond the depth at which we measured the statistics a look at the vertical cross sections in fig 15 shows a very high spread at the bottom of the mixed layer which comes about as the depth of the thermocline changes in response to changes in mixing depth induced by the modified wind stress this effect was also noted by andreu burillo et al 2002 following their sensitivity experiments there are a couple of other conclusions we can draw immediately from fig 15 one is that from the surface to near the bottom of the mixed layer but before reaching the thermocline the parent ensemble s spread is greater than the coastal ensembles this is consistent with our earlier conclusion of higher diffusion in the coastal model but now it is manifested in the vertical direction the second is that at the thermocline the spread of the coastal ensembles is greater than the parent s recalling that the coastal ensembles higher spreads in ssh are reflected in their more coherent and stronger eddies these would be expected to erode the surface stratification and deepen the mixed layer rather more than in the parent this explains at least part of both observations though it must be said that differences in the way that vertical mixing is parameterised would also be pertinent this close to the surface once again the equivalent plots for salinity do not add enough new information to warrant their inclusion here suffice it to say that deep below the surface the effect of the river plumes is very small at the increased depths of 500 m and 1000 m shown in fig 16 the parent ensemble spread is still lower again than the coastal ensembles though it still overtakes the wind ensemble later in the time series this behaviour too is visible in fig 15 below the surface mixed layer the coastal ensembles feature a strong spread which coincides with a second deeper thermocline at the same depth the parent ensemble s spread almost disappears the vertical gradients of temperature and salinity are very similar in both parent and coastal models so we may once more attribute this difference to the more detailed small scale dynamics of the coastal model arguably it is here below the mixed layer that the coastal model distinguishes itself the most from the regional parent model the enhanced horizontal resolution allows it to resolve small scale eddies as small as 10 km in diameter and the sigma level vertical discretisation allows for a more detailed description of the circulation s interaction with bottom relief as a result not only are the eddies stronger and penetrate deeper but from about a thousand metres below the surface the coastal model s horizontal velocity fields become wonderfully complex almost belying any connection to the parent model s dynamics fig 17 illustrates this for the meridional velocity component for unperturbed runs of the parent and coastal models at the surface and three horizontal sections at different depths the velocity fields are stronger in the coastal model at all depths but that is not sufficient to explain the fall at depth in the parent s ensemble spread relative to the coastal model in deep water the surface velocity fields are dominated by the large anticyclonic mesoscale eddy with a smaller cyclonic one adjoining it on its south eastern edge clear in the coastal model and hinted at in the parent model at 500 m these eddies still dominate the velocity field but at 1000 m they fracture into smaller less coherent structures this change in regime is not unique to the coastal model but what differentiates it from the parent model is the high density of variation while the large structures dominate at the surface for both models at depth it is the smaller structures which only the coastal model resolves which dominate some of this complexity arises from small eddies generated by the flow around the underwater gorges on the continental slopes which shows the importance not only of the model s higher resolution but of the bathymetry s too as well as the terrain following vertical sigma coordinates 5 4 2 the reduced nudging layer s effects at depth as we did for section 5 4 1 we plotted curves for the coastal ensembles with a reduced nudging layer at depth figs 14 and 16 green curves the results below the surface are less ambiguous than for the surface if one remembers to take into account that in the latter part of the period the mixed layer deepens and the ensemble statistics start to resemble the surface more than the thermocline apart from this the reduced nudging layer leads to a greater ensemble spread consistent with the coastal model s stronger response to perturbations at depth freed somewhat from the constraints of the parent model it develops even more differences between members as we descend the water column 5 4 3 interaction of eddies with bottom near a strong gradient we noticed a particularly strong spread at a specific time and place which we thought worthy of closer examination in fig 18 we show cross sections of the wind ensemble centred on an eddy the unperturbed run s ssh is depicted in fig 18a in which an eddy dipole can be made out fig 18b shows a cross section of ensemble spread of temperature and several features stand out firstly there is a large spread at the base of the surface mixed layer as discussed in section 5 4 1 there is also a small region of larger spread at the coast a result of the wind pushing the cool fresh water plume of the adour in different directions and it being mixed through the water column but most interestingly there is a region between 1000 and 1500 m depth and 3 and 2 5 longitude with high ensemble spread it is particularly strong along the gently sloping landes plateau this feature is all the more remarkable because of the region of reduced spread between it and the surface mixed layer and at these depths the vertical mixing produced by surface stresses cannot have much influence neither in fact can the open boundary conditions since only local wind perturbations have been applied the unperturbed temperature profile in fig 18c shows the second deep thermocline mentioned in section 5 4 1 it lies beneath a region of much gentler temperature gradient which extends from the near surface thermocline to a depth of around 1200 m the zonal velocity field at this depth plotted in fig 18e shows that the eddy visible in the ssh signal in fig 18a extends down to just about reach the slope the final plot in the figure 18f shows the spread of the zonal velocity while it decreases with depth it is still significant near the second thermocline this and the anomalously high values of vertical velocity spread shown in fig 18d suggest that interactions between the bottom and the eddy are responsible for the enhanced spread in temperature the vertical velocity spread is especially high at the bottom where it coincides with the high spread in temperature there is meanwhile a very small ensemble spread in vertical velocity coinciding with the near surface thermocline this is telling the thermocline is a region of strong temperature gradient and therefore high stability where we would expect vertical movement to be suppressed we can hence differentiate the mechanism which displaces the near surface thermocline from that which produces the strong temperature spread near the bottom where strong vertical movements are present within the stable layer oey and zhang 2004 showed that warm eddies interacting with a slope could lead to big modifications to the deep circulation including cyclones and jets while in this particular case we do not see substantial alterations to the horizontal velocities the vertical velocities do appear to be affected by such an interaction at other times not shown vertical motion and consequently its spread is suppressed in the deep thermocline as well even when there is a large spread of temperature and there are doubtless other complex processes leading to enhanced spread that a more exhaustive study of the ensembles could identify we can say with certainty that the presence of the eddy slope interaction is not necessary to generate a large spread deep beneath the surface over the deep abyssal plain of the bay of biscay vervatis et al 2016 demonstrated this by assimilating ssh data which were able to correct the strong errors between 1000 and 1500 m ayoub et al in prep also observed a high spread at these depths far from the slope but the eddy slope interaction provides another mechanism by which model errors can be generated at depth and hence by which the model can be corrected at depth by data assimilation at the surface the use of the coastal model is decisive here because although we could not verify whether or not the vertical velocities were affected in the parent model there is no such corresponding enhanced spread in temperature it is possible that the eddy slope interaction is present but the result is barely if at all discernible interestingly it is the wind ensemble which shows by far the strongest spread here even the wind obc ensemble does not come close resembling more closely the obc ensemble this is not then a question of pure strength of perturbation but of a confluence of factors the right perturbation leading to the right deviations of the eddy with the right temperature gradient in the right place so that the conditions are favourable for the eddy slope interaction to generate the spread in temperature 5 5 extent and diffusion of river plumes only the adour river runoff is explicitly modelled in the coastal model but the gironde s runoff is also modelled in the parent model its plume enters the coastal model from the northern boundary forming as it does with the adour s plume a significant body of cool less saline water as we noted in section 5 3 5 the behaviour of the adour plume is quite different in the two models leading to different ensemble statistics direct comparison between the models is complicated because even though the prescribed outflow volumes of the adour are the same for most of the time period in the biscay36 and bobland configurations the way that river water is injected into the bay of biscay is different both use a single grid point as the source but this grid point is much smaller in bobland than in biscay36 the depth at the river mouth is also different with biscay36 drawing its depth from its coarse bathymetry about 10 5 m and bobland using a prescribed depth of 5 m the areas of the outward faces of the grid cells are then about 22950 m 2 and 2500 m 2 respectively so the discharge velocity is more than 9 times greater in bobland than in biscay36 a higher velocity could produce a longer plume but could also generate more local turbulence and generate more mixing dissipating the plume earlier the salinity is treated in a similar way in the two river models it is prescribed and insignificant compared to the salinity levels in the open ocean 0 psu in bobland and 0 1 psu in biscay36 temperature on the other hand is handled differently with only minimum and maximum values prescribed in bobland 10 and 22 with the seasonal temperature cycle set with a sinusoid in biscay36 the temperature is determined from a neumann boundary condition with the river discharge grid point treated as an open boundary with these differences only a gross evaluation of the river plume behaviour between the two configurations would be appropriate but between the three different bobland ensembles we can be more concrete our analysis is based on using the surface salinity as a proxy for the river plume for each member of an ensemble we calculated the area of each plume whose extents were defined by one of three thresholds taking the ensemble mean we determined a typical plume area for each model these areas are shown plotted over time in fig 19 the parent model clearly has the most expansive plume by all three of the threshold definitions with only occasional exceptions mainly at the beginning of the time series interestingly the plumes from the three coastal ensembles are very similar to the extent that they do differ from one another they do not follow the pattern of ensemble spreads of surface temperature and salinity as described in section 5 3 and fig 7 recall that the surface salinity and temperature behave almost identically these spreads are by far the greatest in the parent ensemble followed by the wind obc and obc ensembles these two are very close and then the wind ensemble with by far the least spread however although the parent ensemble s plume area is on average greater the next greatest is more often than not the obc ensemble with the wind obc ensemble usually found between it and the wind ensemble the greater spread of the parent ensemble seems to reflect its broader average plume but between the coastal ensembles things are a bit subtler a greater spread in sst or sss in one coastal ensemble than in another could mean that since the plume is displaced further it is also diffused more effectively this threshold value is hence attained closer to the source this is just one factor in a complicated process to shed more light on the plume s behaviour we examine the salinity and its spatial gradients for the parent and child models shown in fig 20 the example shown is for the first perturbed members of the wind obc and parent ensembles it appears as though we can distinguish three salinity regimes in both models 1 the inner fresh zone near the river mouth with a strong gradient as the fresh water mixes quickly with the surrounding saline water 2 an intermediate zone of mixed water distinct from the main outer circulation and 3 the saline outer circulation the inner zone of the coastal model has a very strong gradient at the river mouth representing a rapid mixing of the plume here while the parent s mixing is slower by the time we get to the edge of this zone however the parent model s plume stabilises and remains coherent for longer and the coastal model s intermediate zone is patchy and diffuse even though a direct comparison is impossible the ocean colour observations of petus et al 2014 do favour the coastal model s representation the very sharp boundary in the observations between the river plume and the surrounding water is situated very close to the river mouth closer in character to the more localised and more quickly diffused plume of the coastal model 6 discussion and conclusions we sought to downscale a regional model ensemble by forcing a coastal model ensemble by an ensemble of open boundary conditions as well as by local wind perturbations we found that overall the ensemble of open boundary conditions coupled with local wind perturbations generated the greatest spread in the coastal model but that the contribution from the open boundary ensemble was greater than the local wind perturbations and the combination of the two led to only a slightly greater spread it seems as though the non local errors advected into the model were more important in generating local errors than the local wind perturbations only during the early stages of the ensemble spinup before the non local perturbations had time to penetrate into the domain did we see the local wind perturbations generate a greater spread over the shelf another contributing factor could be that although the obc ensemble was generated without local wind perturbations the perturbed surface characteristics resulting from the non locally produced errors created a difference in each member s wind stress this might partly explain why an additional wind perturbation did not add too much to the coastal ensemble s spread there was a distinct difference between the signals over the shelf and over deep water for all the ensembles the ssh spread was usually greater over deep water where the forcing perturbations displaced the large mesoscale eddy the sst spread was greater over the shelf where the river plume dominated the signature conversely the sst spread was lower over deep water and the ssh spread was for most of the period lower over the shelf the exception being the large non locally produced synchronous events which had an outsized effect over shallow waters the behaviour was different too with the spread of both variables over the shelf varying spatially and temporally more so than over deep water we experimented with different methods of generating the wind perturbations and combining them with the ensemble of open boundary conditions interestingly the exact form of the wind perturbations did not have a huge impact on the shape of the time series the magnitude changed but periods of large spread and low spread were mostly conserved this suggests that the intrinsic variability of the model dominates over any specific perturbation scheme this may also explain the saturation in spread that appeared to occur near the end of the ensemble spinup period with the different wind perturbations of course this was not quite as true when we switched from an ensemble with only local wind perturbations to one forced by the parent ensemble at the open boundaries in this case the non local errors were related to much larger scale processes that the coastal model alone could not represent whatever the local perturbation scheme the dominance of intrinsic variability and the insensitivity to the precise form of errors in boundary and initial conditions has been noted in geophysical modelling before for example by giorgi and bi 2000 and rinke et al 2004 we must be careful not to draw too many similarities with our own experiments for one thing not all of their conclusions which include insensitivity to perturbation magnitude apply to our ensembles but it seems safe to conclude that the finer details in a wind perturbation scheme are of relative unimportance the choice of nudging layer had consequences for the ensemble spread critically so for the wind ensemble with a broad nudging layer the large mesoscale eddy was present in the same area near the edge of the domain for all members of the wind ensemble this led to a sustained drop in ensemble spread an effect which disappeared almost entirely with application of the narrower nudging layer the narrower nudging layer also led to a bigger spread in ssh for the other coastal ensembles even though their spreads in sst saw only modest and inconsistent increases one of the more intriguing results in this study was how deep subsurface errors could be generated by surface perturbations a large spread at the base of the seasonal thermocline had been anticipated having been previously described andreu burillo et al 2002 but for there to be such a strong signal at much greater depths beyond 1000 m was less expected to be sure the parent model had a measurable spread there too but while the signals at the near surface thermocline were similar for the parent and coastal ensembles the deep water spread was in places at least twice as strong in the coastal ensembles than in the parent ensemble this suggests a valuable contribution that the downscaling paradigm can make to the study of model errors it is especially appealing from a data assimilation perspective for if we can generate deep subsurface errors then we might hope to be able to correct these regions with only surface data the vertical temperature gradients for the two models unperturbed runs we noted were almost the same but the model and bathymetry resolutions were much higher in the coastal model a major consequence of this was the more detailed dynamics of course but more specifically it was the ability of the coastal model to resolve more coherent mesoscale eddies with stronger currents these reached deeper in the coastal model than in the parent model whose less coherent eddy had a much weaker effect at these depths we also saw that eddy slope interactions could be an additional mechanism for ensemble divergence something we did not see in the parent ensemble the use of sigma layer depth coordinates in the coastal model may have contributed to this behaviour the river plume s behaviour was very different between the parent and child models and this contributed to the parent model s mostly higher sst spread among the coastal ensembles the spread was usually greatest for the obc ensemble though the difference was small according to our threshold criterion the mean plume area did not appear to be directly correlated with the ensemble spread we did find that the plume s behaviour supported our hypothesis that the parent model diffuses scalars less than the higher resolution coastal model which accounted for some of the differences in spread between the parent ensemble and the child ensembles a recurring feature of the ensembles was that the wind obc ensemble did not always have a greater spread than the obc ensemble logically more sources of perturbation should lead to more spread as we can explore more regions of the error space but with a limited number of ensemble members we cannot always guarantee an increase in spread as we pile on perturbations this limitation could probably be somewhat alleviated by increasing the magnitude of the perturbations but our aim is not to simply increase the spread at any cost we are interested in the model s response to forcing errors and we would prefer the error space to be densely populated by our ensemble despite the sometimes lower spread the benefit of adding an extra forcing perturbation is that it opens the error spaces which may be left untouched or weakly affected by any one forcing perturbation we can see this in our ensembles fig 13 shows almost no spread at the edge of the continental shelf for the coastal ensembles but the spread while still weak is slightly enhanced when wind perturbations are added the next phase of this work will be to use what we have learned in a data assimilation context in which we interpret the ensemble spread as the model s uncertainty of course a successful data assimilation scheme requires that the ensemble s spread span the data vervatis et

23996,with regional ocean models generating small scale structures is important in dynamical downscaling using the nesting method numerous studies have shown that the generation of small scale features is driven by large scale flows and information supplied at the lateral boundaries by a global scale model or observations along with local forcing this work however finds that the conventional downscaling approach reproduces small scale motions too weakly even to sustain the energy of the larger scales leading to degradation of the nested simulation therefore this work investigates the reason for the underestimation related to the stimulating sources evoking small scale motions along with that an efficient method is proposed to improve the quality of simulation results even though a stimulating source does not exist in the domain of simulation in this method the addition of artificial small scale fluctuations along the boundaries greatly enhances the reproducibility of the model even if there is a large spatial resolution jump between the driving data and the driven model keywords small scale generation added small scales ocean regional circulation model big brother experiment methodology downscaling 1 introduction a global circulation model gcm simulates various physical processes in the earth s climate system at diverse scales the computational resources and the data available for feeding the model limit the degree to which finer spatial and temporal resolutions can be achieved in simulations with a gcm available resolutions are often too coarse to capture the details of atmospheric and oceanic processes in simulations of regional ocean weather and climate oddo and pinardi 2008 li et al 2012 trzaska and schnarr 2014 herbert et al 2014 therefore dickinson et al 1989 and giorgi 1990 proposed the idea of using a regional model to downscale the gcm s output in this downscaling concept large scale features from the gcm are dynamically nested as initial and lateral boundary conditions for a highly resolved regional circulation model rcm in conjunction with local conditions thus generating more realistic regional features at smaller scales in a highly resolved model giorgi and mearns 1999 trzaska and schnarr 2014 in the diverse numerical physical and technical aspects of this many types of rcm have been developed for simulating the regional climate and the ocean in particular rcms have advanced and improved their skills for downscaling over several decades in operational forecasting on regional scales in a variety of domains lim et al 2013 rowley and mask 2014 pham et al 2016 so far a large number of studies have demonstrated that small scales in climate statistics of both atmospheric and oceanic simulations can be regenerated with the right amplitudes and spatial distributions in assessing downscaling ability denis et al 2002a concluded that small scale features absent from the initial and boundary conditions can be regenerated by a one way nested rcm with a high level of accuracy later antic et al 2004 tested the downscaling ability of regional climate models in complex topography and confirmed that the rcm yields good reproducibility of small scale climate features the small scale features which appear after downscaling are stimulated by two types of stimulating sources 1 remote generators which remotely generate small scales through nonlinear interaction exhibiting the energy cascade from large to small scales 2 local generators which generate and develop small scales based on shear flow inside the nested domain for instance coastlines islands surface winds and river advection etc hydrodynamic instability due to sheared mean flows among those types of stimulating sources the first type in particular always exists during downscaling from the output of a global model to a regional model once large scale motions are introduced in the boundary conditions then by stretching and stirring at the larger scales small scale motions develop however van tuyl and errico 1989 mentioned that the self interaction of large scale motions does not sufficiently generate small scales and argued that large scales may not by themselves alone re create small scales comparable to those of the real world in other words where other stimulating sources are absent dynamical downscaling may not adequately regenerate small scale motions as observed in winterfeldt et al 2010 and feser et al 2011 denis et al 2002a also observed that small scale motions of sea level pressure fields over the ocean are lacking because few stationary small scale forcings are present in this region moreover herceg et al 2006 studied the skill of a climate model the regional spectral model in seasonal prediction and found that reproduction of small scale precipitation was especially deficient in regions far from the stimulating sources this led to degradation in quality of the prediction results denis et al 2002a also observed diminished correlation of the atmospheric regional model s results for the flat area over the ocean where stimulating sources are not present also antic et al 2004 did not get good simulation results for vorticity fields over a flat bottom region where there is a lack of stimulating morphology furthermore the development of small scale motions is quite sensitive to the spatial resolution ratio between driving data and nested model as this ratio becomes higher it becomes harder to reproduce small scale motions denis et al 2002a 2003 antic et al 2004 pham et al 2016 therefore the quality of regional model results can significantly decrease with an increase in the spatial resolution ratio over regions away from stimulating sources although many previous works have shown that small scale motions are generated by such stimulating sources those studies simply assumed implicitly a role for them in the process of developing the small scale motions van tuyl and errico 1989 jones et al 1995 winterfeldt et al 2010 and a detailed quantitative analysis was not performed furthermore in the real world one should be able to simulate domains without any stimulating sources for example the offshore ocean needs to be simulated and is very far from local generators such as shearing effects of river flows and wakes of islands small scale motions cannot develop fully in a short period of time through remote generation alone so artificial introduction of small scales for stimulation will be helpful to grow small scales in the short terms therefore a method is required to implement this taking into consideration all the aforementioned issues the present work was performed to answer several main questions 1 how are small scales generated without stimulating sources and 2 how do small scales affect the quality of an rcm s results experiment results are described and discussed in several main sections section 2 briefly describes the methodology experimental set ups and design cases section 3 presents the simulated results with discussion of small scale features which are absent in the ics initial conditions and lbcs lateral boundary conditions the present work also proposes a new approach to improve the quality of rcm results section 4 gives conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 the big brother experiment and evaluation method in order to answer the main questions a big brother experiment bbe has been adopted which is similar to the poor man big brother experiment of denis et al 2002a and the big brother experiment of pham et al 2016 fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the present bbe scheme firstly the bbe established a reference dataset by performing a simulation over a large domain using an ocean regional circulation model orcm with high spatial resolution in the horizontal and this simulation was named big brother bb the output from this highly resolved simulation is assumed to represent the real ocean then high wavenumber signals of the bb dataset were removed by a spatial low pass filter leaving only large scales in the bb dataset to be used in simulation with the nested orcm by filtering out those small scale signals the bb dataset mimicked the coarser grid global model the filtered bb dataset is then used to provide initial conditions ics and boundary conditions bcs forcing the nested orcm which is named little brother lb the lb simulation had the same resolution as that of the bb but its domain of interest was smaller and was embedded in the bb domain details of this bbe are given in denis et al 2002a and pham et al 2016 the results were chiefly evaluated using three statistical terms standard deviation sd correlation coefficient cor and center root mean squared difference crmsd a 2 d taylor diagram analysis as conducted by taylor 2001 summarized and compared two sets of results on a 2 d plot therefore a simultaneous presentation of all three statistical terms should give useful information quantifying error difference magnitudes standard deviation similarities and the levels of agreement between results for lb and bb the calculations of these three statistical terms are described in appendix a 2 2 experimental setups as a simulation tool this work employed roms agrif which is a version of the regional ocean modeling system roms combined with adaptive grid refinement in fortran agrif cambon et al 2014 roms solved the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the boussinesq approximation and hydrostatic vertical momentum balances as described in detail in many previous works e g hedström 2009 penven et al 2010 marchesiello et al 2001 the big brother simulation was over a large domain with grid resolution of 1 km 1 km extending from 103 05 e to 108 25 e longitude and 6 20 n to 10 51 n latitude equivalent to distances of 572 km and 474 km respectively in the southwest part of the east sea of vietnam a little brother simulation with the same resolution as big brother was performed over a smaller domain and embedded in the big brother domain 104 19 e to 107 19 e longitude and 7 19 n to 9 19 n latitude equivalent to lengths of 330 km and 220 km respectively fig 2 simulation in a still smaller domain named lbs was performed with the purpose of finding the sensitivity to domain size of small scale development the lbs domain extended from 105 5 e to 106 6 e longitude and 7 6 n to 8 55 n latitude equivalent to distances of 121 km and 105 km respectively the bathymetry was extracted from etopo1 which is a global ocean bathymetry with resolution of 1 arc minute amante and eakins 2009 both big and little brothers had a total of 30 layers in the vertical on an s grid most experiments were simulated over 62 days august 4th through october 4th in 2014 the lbc updating frequency was set at 10 min the same as that for little brother in order to avoid effects caused by resolution inconsistency of the lbcs denis et al 2002a pham et al 2016 the global hindcast hycom outputs which are freely available on the web site of the center for ocean atmospheric prediction studies coaps http hycom coaps fsu edu thredds catalog html were used to construct the big brother ics and bcs these global data include sea temperature salinity horizontal velocity and sea surface height the data have 1 12 1 12 9 km horizontal resolution with 33 layers 0 5 5 km in the vertical temporally updated every 24 h as described in detail in coaps and metzger et al 2008 the atmospheric data include u v components of wind at 10 m elevation atmosphere pressure relative humidity surface temperature precipitation and net short and long wave heat fluxes the weather research forecast wrf model was used to downscale from the results of the ncep final operational global analysis ncep fnl ncep fnl is a global dataset on a 1 1 grid updated every 6 h the wrf was run separately not in a coupled ocean atmosphere model with spatial resolution 1 km 1 km and domain covering the domain of the ocean models the updating frequency of atmospheric variables for the roms model was 1 h in this area during the simulation time the current flows are mainly eastward and slightly northeastward they merge with a steady current coming from the karimata strait and a current from the gulf of thailand hu et al 2000 liu et al 2008 fang et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 in addition the mekong river discharges into the east sea of vietnam with 13 000 m3 s annually botkosal 2009 but can be excluded from the little brother domain for simulations since it flows to the northeast during the simulated period fig 2 therefore there is no source which can produce shearing on the mean field scale also there is no arrival of a storm which could make a wake and stimulate small scale developments furthermore though the coastline and small islands exist in the lb domain these areas are small in comparison to the whole domain hence the type 1 mechanics can be studied without much intervention of local stimulation generators in the bbe big brother guides little brother with only large and intermediate scale information small scale features of the big brother output were filtered out with a low pass filter using the discrete cosine transform as in denis et al 2002b this filtered dataset was used to construct initial conditions as well as lateral boundary conditions for little brother as shown in table 1 the experiments first examined the different set up cases for viscosity diffusivity of the sponge layer from 0 m2 s to 120 m2 s for j1 as shown in the columns then after selecting the most suitable viscosity diffusivity it is used in consecutive experiments with different jump ratios between bb and lb resolutions varying from 3 to 9 this being the ratio of the big brother driver s spatial resolution and that of the nested little brother model as previously done in pham et al 2016 the sponge layer width is chosen to be about 10 grid points giorgi and mearns 1999 and sponge viscosity diffusivity can be up to 0 1 horizontal resolution for instance with lb resolution of 1 km the sponge layer width can be 10 km and maximum sponge viscosity diffusivity is 100 m2 s since the big brother and little brother vertical resolutions are identical the simulation could avoid errors due to inconsistencies and imbalances of vertical resolution between driving data and driven model as mentioned in caya and laprise 1999 denis et al 2002a and pham et al 2016 the spatial resolution jump ratio is defined as 1 j ℓ b b ℓ l b here ℓ b b is the big brother driver s cut off filter wavelength ℓ l b is the shortest resolvable wavelength in little brother which equals twice the little brother grid resolution therefore if a resolution jump of j 3 j3 is required and the little brother resolution is 1 km then ℓ l b is 2 km and the big brother cut off wavelength ℓ b b becomes 6 km similarly as shown in table 1 for j6 and j9 the filter cut off wavelengths in the original big brother are 12 km and 18 km respectively it is noted that small scale signals of atmospheric variables of wrf model s output were also removed over the little brother by a spatial low pass filter depend on the spatial jump ratio 3 results in downscaling the global information to a regional scale domain sizes types of boundary conditions and even the orcm model itself degrade the results of nesting warner et al 1997 denis et al 2002a pham et al 2016 therefore as a first step the ability of orcms to regenerate kinetic energies over every scale is investigated also the present work is aimed at identifying how during the nesting procedure with the ocean regional circulation model small scale motions are generated when stimulating sources are absent then we introduce a new method to improve the quality of solutions in such cases 3 1 the impact of the sponge layers on the results it is well known that open boundary conditions are based on hyperbolic equations marchesiello et al 2001 therefore the mathematical treatment of the lbc for the averaged navier stokes equation is an ill posed problem palma and matano 1998 marchesiello et al 2001 when flow is directed outward the prescribed boundary conditions lead to inconsistency between specified conditions at the boundaries with those of the interior domain this generates waves reflecting back from the lateral boundaries thus deteriorating the interior solutions palma and matano 1998 giorgi and mearns 1999 marchesiello et al 2001 in order to mitigate such errors open boundary conditions often use supplementary methodologies such as sponge nudging to absorb disturbances and suppress computational noise by horizontal viscosity near the open boundary palma and matano 1998 giorgi and mearns 1999 marchesiello et al 2001 blayo and debreu 2005 oddo and pinardi 2008 since the range of sponge viscosity diffusivity values is large up to 120 m2 s it is necessary to select a suitable value therefore this work tests a set of nested procedures with various sponge viscosities diffusivities ranging from 0 to 120 m2 s as shown in table 1 raymond and kuo radiation r k radiation with the supplementary methodology of sponge nudging is employed since that is very reliable as discussed by pham et al 2016 the time scale was set at 3 days for nudging during outward propagation and 365 days for nudging during inward propagation all cases were simulated at j1 spatial resolution which means that small scales are not filtered out in other words all scales of big brother are specified in ics and bcs for little brother first normalized kinetic energy spectra are compared at the surface layer in big and little brothers as a reference case a sponge layer was not applied in other words sponge viscosity diffusivity was 0 m2 s after 60 days of simulation fig 3 a the normalized kinetic energy spectra are calculated in the interior domain with 10 grid points further from lateral boundaries in order to remove the sponge layer normalized surface layer kinetic energy ke at a given wavelength ℓ is given by 2 k e ℓ 1 n x n y 1 n x 1 n y 1 2 u ℓ 2 v ℓ 2 k e b b ℓ where n x and n y are respectively the numbers of grid points in the longitudinal x and latitudinal y directions u ℓ and v ℓ are the velocity components in the x and y directions respectively and k e b b ℓ is surface layer kinetic energy of big brother at a given wavelength in general most energy is contained in larger scales with magnitudes gradually decreasing at smaller scales fig 3 a at larger scales j1 00 and big brother show similar amounts of spectral energy however at intermediate scales wavelengths 18 km to 60 km and small scales 2 km to 18 km little brother energy differs from that of big brother since there is no sponge layer disturbance and noise generated by discontinuities between internal and external information are not suppressed by viscosity and diffusivity in a sponge region near open boundaries errors due to discontinuities can be reflected back to the domain interiors and deteriorate the inner model solution as discussed by marchesiello et al 2001 on the other hand large scale signals can freely leave the domain disturbance and noise due to discontinuities at the open boundary are at relatively small scales and being small they do not affect the large scales but can cause differences in the neighboring intermediate scales when a sponge layer was employed with viscosity diffusivity set at 20 j1 20 not shown 40 j1 40 and 60 m2 s j1 60 not shown disturbances and noise near the sponge regions were well absorbed and the disturbances were less reflected at the boundaries marchesiello et al 2001 oddo and pinardi 2008 therefore the distortions at the smaller scales of little brother were mitigated well fig 3 a the energy spectra of those three cases were similar to each other however when the sponge viscosity diffusivity was set at 80 m2 s not shown energies of both small and even intermediate scales are weaker than those of the original bb and they are weaker still with a sponge viscosity diffusivity of 120 m2 s fig 3 b so high sponge viscosity diffusivity can damp fluctuations even at larger scales and it may also reflect the outgoing waves oddo and pinardi 2008 therefore we avoid using sponges with excessive viscosity and diffusivity finally when the spectra for the j1 20 j1 40 and j1 60 cases are compared although the three cases are very different from each other the j1 40 spectra show the best performance among them based on their statistical terms the j1 40 spectra deviated from big brother by only about 3 while deviation of j1 20 and j1 60 are 3 2 and 4 1 respectively the cor of j1 40 and j1 20 are the same at 99 8 and a little higher than j1 60 by about 0 4 moreover j1 40 has errors of 2 5 in comparison with big brother while j1 20 and j1 60 have slightly larger errors of 2 8 and 3 7 respectively thus for the present work we chose 40 m2 s for the sponge viscosity diffusivity for all experiments 3 2 small scale motions lacking stimulations the principle behind the nesting approach is this we use large scale information to supply the boundary conditions incorporating detailed local information and thus use a highly resolved orcm simulation to describe over a limited region the physical processes occurring including detailed small scale motions such small scale motions developed in higher resolution orcms are attributed to two types of stimulating sources as discussed in the previous section this section will investigate how small scale motions develop in a highly resolved orcm without the support of the stimulating sources time averaged relative vorticity fields in the surface layer are first analyzed and presented in fig 4 since relative vorticity is a fundamental quantity in fluid dynamics and a higher order variable related to velocity lam 2015 and the relative vorticity strongly highlights small scales of the flow denis et al 2002a fig 4 a b shows all scales of time averaged vorticity at the surface layer while fig 4 c d shows only the small scale 6km components the results show that j3 is able to regenerate the stationary large scale features successfully with all scale stationary correlation coefficient scor of 99 3 scor is defined by eq a 11 appendix a however since small scales are absent from the ic and bc they are newly generated and develop during the downscaling due to large scales incorporation with stimulated sources fig 4 c d and scor values show agreement of the small scale stationary component between big brother and j3 is not as good as that of the large scale stationary component the correlation of small scale stationary components is somewhat higher when they are considered only near the coast and small islands within 15 grid points from coastline and island of 95 6 while the correlation coefficient is weaker in the areas far away from the coast and small islands scor 86 4 this is not surprising since small islands and coasts are considered as local sources producing small scale motions eddies formed by wakes behind islands and irregular coastlines shear the flow generating and developing small scale turbulent motions therefore the ratio of domain averaged stationary small scale variance referring to eq a 12 appendix a near the coast and small islands is 1 01 while it is only 0 92 in the area far from the coast and small islands the energy spectra of big brother j1 j3 and j9 which are simulated in the real domain are compared in fig 5 for the big brother and j1 cases the small scales are not filtered out but for the j3 and j9 cases small scales are filtered out as discussed in the previous section fig 5 a after 30 days the energies over all scales in little brother have increased considerably but they still have not reached the same energy level as in big brother fig 5 b c in the little brother case small scale motions appear and grow by shearing but still have not grown fully enough to be at the same level as big brother due to the lack of sources stimulating and growing the small scales after 60 days energies decrease even at scales larger than 18 km fig 5 c these decreases at the larger scales may indicate that energy transfers from large to small scales occur through internal interaction processes classified as type 1 however the energy transfer is not enough to feed small scales reaching the same level as that of big brother at the higher spatial resolution jump ratio of j6 not shown or j9 fig 5 c without any external stimulating sources to activate small scale motions the absence of small scales affects the corresponding larger scales deflecting the large scale spectra with deflections which increase as the resolution jump becomes larger fig 5 c the absence of small scales during downscaling then degrades the quality of the nested solutions this agrees well with the observations reported in previous works e g antic et al 2004 denis et al 2002a herceg et al 2006 that the results of regional climate models do not perform well in regions where stimulating sources are absent for the smaller domain lbs whose linear size is less than half that of lb without any local stimuli of small scales within the domain fig 2 the spectral energies of j3 and j9 at the smaller scales after 60 simulated days are significantly deficient compared to big brother whereas the spectral energy of j1 matches well with big brother s fig 6 the under production of small scale features is due to two reasons 1 there is no source for stimulating and rapidly developing the small scales therefore the cascade of energy from larger scales to smaller scales through internal interactions is not sufficient to enable small scales to grow fully 2 since the lbs domain size is so small motions at the small scales do not have enough space to develop as pointed out by denis et al 2002a they also mentioned that the one way nested domain should have an appropriate size to leave space for small scale features to develop pham et al 2016 also observed that the larger the domain size that is set the higher the quality achieved in one way nested simulation in other words the development of finer scales is sensitive to the size of the fine domain the recommended domain sizes of the orcms are range from 1 10 to 1 2 of the ogcms domain size pham et al 2016 3 3 enhancement of downscaling ability when the small scale fluctuations are absent at ics and bcs due to the lack of any generating source their patterns and energies cannot fully recover during the nesting procedure such underestimation of small scale motions causes bias in the energies of associated larger scales compared with big brother in the j1 case little brother reproduces well features of all big brother scales figs 5 b c 6 b the lack of small scale eddies is the main difference between the big and little brothers therefore the present work proposes a new method to mitigate such discrepancies during downscaling the method is named the boundary small eddy additions bsea technique the concept of this method is the artificial addition of small scale eddies to the coarse data which have no small scale features the procedure for the artificial addition of small scale fluctuations is described as follows with resolution jump j 1 the big brother has only large scale information as follows 3 φ φ l s then when new small scales φ s s n e w are constructed based on the above large scale big brother as described in appendix b the new field for the ic and bc can be constructed for little brother as 4 φ b s e a φ l s φ s s n e w here the new total field φ b s e a includes both large and small scale eddies which can be used to drive the little brother the sizes of the small scale eddies added to the coarse data depend on the spatial jump ratio in the case of j3 the shortest resolvable little brother wavelength is 2 km 1 km grid size and the spatial jump ratio is 3 hence the scales of the eddies which need to be added are in the range from 2 km to 6 km in the j6 case eddies need to be added in the scale range from 2 km to 12 km and in the j9 case from 2 km to 18 km the procedure for adding small scales to the coarse data is schematically described in fig 7 in terms of the kinetic energy spectrum as illustrated this procedure is based on the j6 case so the velocity fluctuations are added at scales smaller than 12 km only larger scale components exist in the coarse big brother data fig 7 a the constructed small scale components fig 7 b are summed with the larger scale components of the coarse big brother data to construct a new field of velocity which includes components of all scales fig 7 c lastly the new field of velocity is used to drive little brother the procedure for adding small scale information is applied to all variables including u and v velocity components and scalar variables of oceanic and atmospheric variables the bsea approach is somewhat similar to the addition of diagnostic values for the kinetic energy k at the inlet boundary in a k ε or k ω turbulence model to activate and grow small scale turbulence artificially sullivan et al 1994 franklin et al 2005 rao and de bruyn kops 2011 however in such turbulence models kinetic energy is added at only one turbulence length scale based on the mixing length while in bsea small scales are added at each length scale as in such a turbulence model artificially adding small scale motions at the boundaries in a nested model helps finer small scales fully develop rapidly and so can reduce the spin up time needed to raise up fine scale features to their equilibrium amplitudes denis et al 2002a laprise 2008 pham et al 2016 in order to find out how the bsea technique improves the reproduction quality of big brother in little brother four experiments in the real j6 domain have been examined with the addition of small scale motions to the ic and bc as described in table 2 with a purpose of finding how important the spatial spin up of small scale development in the ic and from the bc is following this we performed three experiments with different spatial resolution jumps including j3 j6 and j9 employing the bsea technique to find out how improvement of the nested model s results occurred when employing the bsea technique fig 8 shows the crmsds of depth averaged z vorticity between little and big brothers for j6 and j6r j6r represents j6 with the addition of small scale energy by the bsea technique likewise for jnr with other values of n see table 2 for this and for descriptions of j6io and j6bo since small scale fluctuations were removed in j6 and j6r initially errors due to the discrepancies between big brother and j6 and j6r appear over the whole domain in particular around small islands and the coastline of ca mau cape at the southern tip of viet nam not shown after 30 days of simulation such errors due to inconsistencies of the ics significantly decrease nevertheless significant errors occur along the western boundary between southern boundary and 8 5 n latitude in j6 spreading latitudinally and propagating toward the eastern boundary during the first 30 days fig 8 a b the errors occur and grow from the lateral boundary during the spatial spin up time of small scale development before they reach equilibrium amplitude denis et al 2003 such errors repeatedly occur whenever updating the lateral boundaries and then they propagate following the eastward flow to the inner domain denis et al 2003 pham et al 2016 laprise 2008 therefore the errors are generated mainly along the western boundary and spread to the whole inner domain in particular where eastward flow occurs south of 8 5 n latitude compared to j6 the error magnitudes and area occupied are significantly less in j6r in particular along the western boundary fig 8 c d this improvement gives evidence that adding small scales to the boundary conditions can reduce the error from small scale generation propagating from the boundary fig 9 compares the results of each of the cases simulated in the real domain the result of case j6 in which the small scale motions in the ic and bc are filtered out is worst compared to the j6io j6bo and j6r cases the spectral energy of j6 deviates from to big brother s with the sd r e l a t i v e of 82 4 and getting 25 of error in the case of non filtering of small scales in the ic but filtering out small scales in the bc j6io the quality of j6io is almost the same as that of j6 it is clear that the inclusion of the small scale fluctuations in the ic does not much improve the quality of the nested solution this agrees well with denis et al 2002a and pham et al 2016 that the spatial spin up of small scale development from the ic after one day is not as important as that from the bc therefore small scale fluctuations should be imposed on the bc in order to assess how the quality of orcm results can be improved by employing the bsea technique an experiment with non filtered small scale motions in the bc j6bo is also performed for comparison with j6r as shown in fig 9 the performance of j6r in which small scale energies are added is significantly improved compared with j6 although the spectral energy of j6r is not as good as that of j6bo in terms of crmsd r e l a t i v e and cor it fits well with that of big brother having a correlation coefficient of up to 99 8 its sd r e l a t i v e is only 3 and error is 5 fig 10 shows the energy spectra of j3 and j9 without a and with b the addition of small scales along with the spectral energy of j1 for comparison of the simulations it is recognized that in the original j3 and j9 kinetic energies at the small scales were filtered out from the initial and boundary conditions after 60 days of simulation small scale kinetic energy recovers fig 10 a but still does not reach the same level as that of big brother the filtering effects are more significant with a higher jump ratio than with a lower jump ratio in j3 the kinetic energies at small scales recover well becoming much more similar to those of big brother than do those in j9 after adding small scales to the bcs in j3r and j9r the energy at smaller scales than the filter cut off wavelengths of both j3r and j9r returns to a level very close to the big brother amplitude after 60 days as shown in fig 10 b it is interesting that before applying bsea fig 10 a the energies which are filtered out in the range from 2 km to 6 km in the case of j3 cannot grow to the same level of bb and energies in the range from 7 km to 18 km which is larger scale than cut off wavelength 6 km do not grow to the level of the bb either during a long period in j9 as in j3 the energies in the range from 18 km to 30 km which is just larger than cut off wavelength 18 km also do not grow fast however after employing bsea fig 10 b energies in filtered scales and larger scales than cut off wavelength in all cases grow fast to the level of bb by inversely cascading from the smallest scale which is same to the grid size such inverse cascading seems to be observed in the many previous 2 dimensional turbulence researches e g kraichnan 1976 gage and nastrom 1986 danilow and gurarie 2000 therefore even the intermediate scales which are near or even larger than the cut off wavelength are also affected if small scales are insufficiently excited some statistics of surface layer energy spectra after 60 days for j1 j3 j6 j9 and also j3r j6r j9r which include additions of small scale eddies were calculated and plotted in a taylor diagram as shown in fig 11 as the jump ratios decrease from j9 to j1 the correlation coefficients increase the crmsd r e l a t i v e decreases and the sd r e l a t i v e increases therefore as expected the reproducibility by the nested procedure becomes better as the jump ratios become smaller after adding small scales all qualities of the simulations significantly improve j9r performs better than j6 while j6r performs much better than j3 and j3r is almost the same as j1 fig 11 however although the qualities of j6r and j9r are significantly improved j9r is still not as good as j6r nor is j6r as good as j3r since it takes j6r and j9r a longer time than j3r to recover fig 12 shows time series of squared relative vorticity averaged over the domain before and after adding small scales for cases j1 j3 and j9 after 60 days of simulation along with their statistical terms presented as a taylor diagram as shown j1 generally reproduces well the features of big brother with a high correlation coefficient of 99 3 the relative vorticity deviates from that of big brother by only 4 and has crmsd r e l a t i v e of 10 fig 12 a c for j 1 before employing bsea the little brother vorticity is not reproduced well and so deviates slightly from that of big brother such deviation becomes larger with an increase of the jump ratio however after adding small scale fluctuations in the j3r and j9r cases the relative vorticity is reproduced much better than without these additions fig 12 b c the performance of j3r is particularly good being the closest to the non filtered case j1 even j9r reproduces well with higher cor than j9 in addition compared with j9 j9r s sd r e l a t i v e increases from 77 to 93 and crmsd r e l a t i v e decreases from 35 to 23 taylor diagrams present the enhancement of downscaling ability obtained for temperature and salinity by employing bsea fig 13 the quality of reproduction of cases before employing bsea is inadequate and becomes worse as the jump ratios increase from 1 to 9 as expected after adding small scale fluctuations to the lateral boundaries of j3r j6r and j9r temperatures are reproduced much better than in the cases without the additions comparing j3r temperature with that of j3 the correlation coefficient increases from 98 1 to 99 7 the sd r e l a t i v e improves by 4 and crmsd r e l a t i v e decreases from 19 to 5 similar to the j3 case j6r performs better than j6 j6r is even close to j3 comparing j6r temperature with that of j6 the correlation coefficient increases from 96 4 to 97 5 sd r e l a t i v e improves by 13 and crmsd r e l a t i v e decreases from 30 to 21 also thanks to bsea temperature is much better reproduced with j9r than with j9 comparing j9r temperature with that of j9 the correlation coefficient is increased by 2 3 the sd r e l a t i v e is improved by 10 and notably crmsd r e l a t i v e drops by nearly 10 similar to temperature the quality of salinity in all cases is also improved after employing bsea fig 13 b in comparison with cases not employing bsea their salinities are in better agreement with big brother with higher correlation coefficients smaller crmsd r e l a t i v e and standard deviations almost equal to those of big brother j3r j6r and j9r reproduce salinities much better than j3 j6 and j9 respectively for the orcm with the coarser grid ocean gcm there seems to be an optimal jump ratio as pham et al 2016 pointed out and so a multiple nesting or cascading model approach is necessary as denis et al 2002a and blayo and debreu 2005 have suggested however such multiple nesting takes more time and computational cost to ensure the quality of the orcm results and even with the multiple nesting technique one still has unwanted errors at every step of nesting denis et al 2002a antic et al 2004 here by adding small scales using the bsea technique the qualities of the orcm results in cases j3r j6r and j9r are significantly improved the j9r case even shows results close to those of j3 for some diagnostic fields j3 has the optimized jump ratio suggested by denis et al 2002a and pham et al 2016 therefore addition of small scale fluctuations to large scales along the bcs helping to perform a high resolution simulation over time can in only one step reproduce big brother s results better than a multiple nesting scheme 4 summary and conclusions one way nesting with an ocean regional circulation model is an efficient way to produce highly resolved oceanic data from the coarse information of global models the orcm specifies the large scale information from a global model in the initial and boundary conditions incorporating local forcing to generate the finer scale features denis et al 2002a herbert et al 2014 pham et al 2016 since the generation and development of small scale features relies significantly on the stimulating sources denis et al 2002a feser et al 2011 without such stimulating sources the small scale features are too weak and can even lead to distortions of the larger scale kinetic energy thus contaminating nested solutions over the whole domain through a framework of big brother experiments which can help in determining the conditions and the separate stimulating sources for small scale generation we can assess the effects of small scale features on the larger scales and the nested solutions in the case without stimulating sources to energize small scale motion kinetic energies at smaller scales never grow to the big brother level based on this fact a boundary small eddy additions technique is proposed to activate small scale motions by suitably stimulating boundary conditions from our discussion in the previous sections the main results are as follows 1 the generation and development of small scale features relies strongly on the stimulating sources without such stimulating sources a nested model cannot generate small scales at the appropriate level and distorts the kinetic energy spectrum as time passes such under estimation of kinetic energy increases with increase of the spatial resolution ratio between driving information and driven model the bias of kinetic energy at small scales accumulated over a long time may also distort ensuing kinetic energy even at larger scales degrading the quality of the orcm results moreover the development of small scales is also sensitive to the size of the nested domain the one way nested domain needs to be large enough for small scales to grow 2 adding small scale motions at the boundaries in a nested model can help fluctuations at small scales develop at the right level even without stimulating sources thus avoiding underestimation of kinetic energy at small scales as a result kinetic energy at the larger scales can be kept stable and this helps to improve the quality of the nested solution moreover this method can also help to run a one way nested model with higher spatial resolution without multi downscaling strategies instead of the previous optimal resolution jump of 3 pham et al 2016 bsea permits the nested model running with spatial resolution differences up to j6 or j9 with the addition of random kinetic energy at the smaller scales the present work was based only on the framework of a specific big brother experiment configuration to address the characteristics of generation and development of small scale motions together with their impacts on the larger scales and explain how their existence causes degradation of the orcm solution as mentioned in numerous previous studies warner et al 1997 denis et al 2002a 2003 huang et al 2008 pham et al 2016 the quality of a nested regional model depends on various parameters such as the driving information from the global model local forcing geographical domain seasonality horizontal resolution jumps update frequencies of the lbcs and the numerical strategy of the nested model itself etc therefore results of a nested model may be very different depending on such aforementioned parameters however despite such limits on the present conclusions our finding on the role of stimulating sources to small scale motions and their development and the proposed method of adding kinetic energy at small scales to the boundary conditions could be applied in any nesting procedure to increase the quality of the solution and increase the spatial resolution jump ratio between the driver data and the nested model

coarse resolution model or observational data they have only larger scale low wave number information and the results are deficient in the smaller scales which play major roles in the energy budget to redress this small scale energy deficiency the present work proposes the boundary small eddy addition bsea method the bsea method first constructs a spectrum by extension of the spectrum at the larger scales to the smaller scales assuming the energy cascades monotonically from the large scale after thus constructing the spectrum realistic velocity fields are created by inverse transformation of the spectrum then the resulting finer scale signals are added to the original coarser boundary conditions b 1 1 constructing the smaller scale high wavenumber energy spectrum from the larger scale low wavenumber spectrum we present here an example of the procedure by which we generate a realistic all scales velocity field when the coarse data which have 6 km resolution hence 12 km smallest wavelength are used to drive the highly resolved regional model with a resolution of 1 km hence resolved wavelength of 2 km we want to infer data at the smaller scales with ℓ representing wavelength e l ℓ is the energy spectrum of the larger scales which is already known and e s ℓ is the unknown energy spectrum of the smaller scales e s ℓ values are trigonometrically generated based on the large scale spectral slope b 1 α 1 m m 1 m a tan log e l ℓ m log e l ℓ 1 log ℓ m log ℓ 1 b 2 e s ℓ n e l ℓ 1 ℓ n ℓ n tan α n 1 n here α is the averaged power or slope of the spectrum over the larger scales fig b1 e l ℓ m is the spectrum ℓ m the large scale wavelength at the scale of the mth segment node and m is the number of large scale segments e s ℓ n and ℓ n are the intermediate spectrum and the wavelength of small scales at the nth scale segment fig b2 and n is the number of small scale segments b 1 2 construction of the realistic velocity field methods of constructing realistic flows from a given energy spectrum have been discussed by a number of previous studies e g kraichnan 1976 bechara et al 1994 davidson 2007 saad et al 2017 the present work formulates the construction of realistic flows based on the methods of davidson 2007 and saad et al 2017 which generated inlet turbulent flows at the boundaries according to saad et al 2017 the field of an arbitrarily and spatially varying field of velocities in two dimensions u x u v in cartesian space x x y can be generated by b 3 u x 2 n 1 n q n cos k n κ n x ϕ n δ n here q n are the amplitudes obtained from the intermediate spectrum as q n 2 k n e s ℓ n k n 2 π ℓ n is the wavenumber κ n κ x n κ y n is the unit directional vector associated with the nth wavenumber ϕ n is the phase angle and δ n δ x n δ y n is a unit directional vector in eq b 3 κ n and ϕ n are chosen randomly and δ n is evaluated by forcing the divergence free constraint satisfying the continuity equation and so becomes b 4 δ n ς n κ n ς n κ n κ n κ x n κ y n 2 δ x sin 1 2 k n κ x n δ x 2 δ y sin 1 2 k n κ y n δ y where ς n is the intermediate unit vector and it can be randomly chosen from a uniform distribution b 1 3 the calculation the generation of a realistic small scale velocity field using eq b 3 is accomplished by inserting δ n from eq b 4 which is implemented in the several steps listed below 1 the wavenumber unit vectors are randomly selected on a unit circle thus κ x n cos θ n κ n κ y n sin θ n κ n where the θ n are chosen randomly over the closed range of 0 2 π 2 the phase angles ϕ n are also chosen randomly over the closed range π 2 π 2 3 the unit vector δ n is determined by eq b 4 4 finally a realistic velocity field is constructed using eq b 3 the spectrum of constructed velocity field is described as generation in fig b3 to quantitatively assess the correlation between the constructed small scale velocity field to the un filtered big brother we used the spatial correlation coefficients scor as in eq a 11 and they are 89 8 and 80 6 for the x and y directional velocity components at small scales respectively b 2 construction of realistic scalar fields at small scales based on the scalar spectrum at large scales the field of an arbitrarily and spatially varying scalar e g temperature salinity sea surface height in two dimensions can be generated by b 5 c x 2 n 1 n p n cos k n κ n x ϕ n where c x is a scalar field varying in the cartesian space p n is the amplitude obtained from the intermediate scalar spectrum c s ℓ n of the small scales at the nth scale segment c s ℓ n is calculated as shown in eq b 2 and p n 2 k n c s ℓ n the small scale temperature was well reconstructed with scor of 76 8 in comparing to the un filtered big brother see fig b4 
23996,with regional ocean models generating small scale structures is important in dynamical downscaling using the nesting method numerous studies have shown that the generation of small scale features is driven by large scale flows and information supplied at the lateral boundaries by a global scale model or observations along with local forcing this work however finds that the conventional downscaling approach reproduces small scale motions too weakly even to sustain the energy of the larger scales leading to degradation of the nested simulation therefore this work investigates the reason for the underestimation related to the stimulating sources evoking small scale motions along with that an efficient method is proposed to improve the quality of simulation results even though a stimulating source does not exist in the domain of simulation in this method the addition of artificial small scale fluctuations along the boundaries greatly enhances the reproducibility of the model even if there is a large spatial resolution jump between the driving data and the driven model keywords small scale generation added small scales ocean regional circulation model big brother experiment methodology downscaling 1 introduction a global circulation model gcm simulates various physical processes in the earth s climate system at diverse scales the computational resources and the data available for feeding the model limit the degree to which finer spatial and temporal resolutions can be achieved in simulations with a gcm available resolutions are often too coarse to capture the details of atmospheric and oceanic processes in simulations of regional ocean weather and climate oddo and pinardi 2008 li et al 2012 trzaska and schnarr 2014 herbert et al 2014 therefore dickinson et al 1989 and giorgi 1990 proposed the idea of using a regional model to downscale the gcm s output in this downscaling concept large scale features from the gcm are dynamically nested as initial and lateral boundary conditions for a highly resolved regional circulation model rcm in conjunction with local conditions thus generating more realistic regional features at smaller scales in a highly resolved model giorgi and mearns 1999 trzaska and schnarr 2014 in the diverse numerical physical and technical aspects of this many types of rcm have been developed for simulating the regional climate and the ocean in particular rcms have advanced and improved their skills for downscaling over several decades in operational forecasting on regional scales in a variety of domains lim et al 2013 rowley and mask 2014 pham et al 2016 so far a large number of studies have demonstrated that small scales in climate statistics of both atmospheric and oceanic simulations can be regenerated with the right amplitudes and spatial distributions in assessing downscaling ability denis et al 2002a concluded that small scale features absent from the initial and boundary conditions can be regenerated by a one way nested rcm with a high level of accuracy later antic et al 2004 tested the downscaling ability of regional climate models in complex topography and confirmed that the rcm yields good reproducibility of small scale climate features the small scale features which appear after downscaling are stimulated by two types of stimulating sources 1 remote generators which remotely generate small scales through nonlinear interaction exhibiting the energy cascade from large to small scales 2 local generators which generate and develop small scales based on shear flow inside the nested domain for instance coastlines islands surface winds and river advection etc hydrodynamic instability due to sheared mean flows among those types of stimulating sources the first type in particular always exists during downscaling from the output of a global model to a regional model once large scale motions are introduced in the boundary conditions then by stretching and stirring at the larger scales small scale motions develop however van tuyl and errico 1989 mentioned that the self interaction of large scale motions does not sufficiently generate small scales and argued that large scales may not by themselves alone re create small scales comparable to those of the real world in other words where other stimulating sources are absent dynamical downscaling may not adequately regenerate small scale motions as observed in winterfeldt et al 2010 and feser et al 2011 denis et al 2002a also observed that small scale motions of sea level pressure fields over the ocean are lacking because few stationary small scale forcings are present in this region moreover herceg et al 2006 studied the skill of a climate model the regional spectral model in seasonal prediction and found that reproduction of small scale precipitation was especially deficient in regions far from the stimulating sources this led to degradation in quality of the prediction results denis et al 2002a also observed diminished correlation of the atmospheric regional model s results for the flat area over the ocean where stimulating sources are not present also antic et al 2004 did not get good simulation results for vorticity fields over a flat bottom region where there is a lack of stimulating morphology furthermore the development of small scale motions is quite sensitive to the spatial resolution ratio between driving data and nested model as this ratio becomes higher it becomes harder to reproduce small scale motions denis et al 2002a 2003 antic et al 2004 pham et al 2016 therefore the quality of regional model results can significantly decrease with an increase in the spatial resolution ratio over regions away from stimulating sources although many previous works have shown that small scale motions are generated by such stimulating sources those studies simply assumed implicitly a role for them in the process of developing the small scale motions van tuyl and errico 1989 jones et al 1995 winterfeldt et al 2010 and a detailed quantitative analysis was not performed furthermore in the real world one should be able to simulate domains without any stimulating sources for example the offshore ocean needs to be simulated and is very far from local generators such as shearing effects of river flows and wakes of islands small scale motions cannot develop fully in a short period of time through remote generation alone so artificial introduction of small scales for stimulation will be helpful to grow small scales in the short terms therefore a method is required to implement this taking into consideration all the aforementioned issues the present work was performed to answer several main questions 1 how are small scales generated without stimulating sources and 2 how do small scales affect the quality of an rcm s results experiment results are described and discussed in several main sections section 2 briefly describes the methodology experimental set ups and design cases section 3 presents the simulated results with discussion of small scale features which are absent in the ics initial conditions and lbcs lateral boundary conditions the present work also proposes a new approach to improve the quality of rcm results section 4 gives conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 the big brother experiment and evaluation method in order to answer the main questions a big brother experiment bbe has been adopted which is similar to the poor man big brother experiment of denis et al 2002a and the big brother experiment of pham et al 2016 fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the present bbe scheme firstly the bbe established a reference dataset by performing a simulation over a large domain using an ocean regional circulation model orcm with high spatial resolution in the horizontal and this simulation was named big brother bb the output from this highly resolved simulation is assumed to represent the real ocean then high wavenumber signals of the bb dataset were removed by a spatial low pass filter leaving only large scales in the bb dataset to be used in simulation with the nested orcm by filtering out those small scale signals the bb dataset mimicked the coarser grid global model the filtered bb dataset is then used to provide initial conditions ics and boundary conditions bcs forcing the nested orcm which is named little brother lb the lb simulation had the same resolution as that of the bb but its domain of interest was smaller and was embedded in the bb domain details of this bbe are given in denis et al 2002a and pham et al 2016 the results were chiefly evaluated using three statistical terms standard deviation sd correlation coefficient cor and center root mean squared difference crmsd a 2 d taylor diagram analysis as conducted by taylor 2001 summarized and compared two sets of results on a 2 d plot therefore a simultaneous presentation of all three statistical terms should give useful information quantifying error difference magnitudes standard deviation similarities and the levels of agreement between results for lb and bb the calculations of these three statistical terms are described in appendix a 2 2 experimental setups as a simulation tool this work employed roms agrif which is a version of the regional ocean modeling system roms combined with adaptive grid refinement in fortran agrif cambon et al 2014 roms solved the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the boussinesq approximation and hydrostatic vertical momentum balances as described in detail in many previous works e g hedström 2009 penven et al 2010 marchesiello et al 2001 the big brother simulation was over a large domain with grid resolution of 1 km 1 km extending from 103 05 e to 108 25 e longitude and 6 20 n to 10 51 n latitude equivalent to distances of 572 km and 474 km respectively in the southwest part of the east sea of vietnam a little brother simulation with the same resolution as big brother was performed over a smaller domain and embedded in the big brother domain 104 19 e to 107 19 e longitude and 7 19 n to 9 19 n latitude equivalent to lengths of 330 km and 220 km respectively fig 2 simulation in a still smaller domain named lbs was performed with the purpose of finding the sensitivity to domain size of small scale development the lbs domain extended from 105 5 e to 106 6 e longitude and 7 6 n to 8 55 n latitude equivalent to distances of 121 km and 105 km respectively the bathymetry was extracted from etopo1 which is a global ocean bathymetry with resolution of 1 arc minute amante and eakins 2009 both big and little brothers had a total of 30 layers in the vertical on an s grid most experiments were simulated over 62 days august 4th through october 4th in 2014 the lbc updating frequency was set at 10 min the same as that for little brother in order to avoid effects caused by resolution inconsistency of the lbcs denis et al 2002a pham et al 2016 the global hindcast hycom outputs which are freely available on the web site of the center for ocean atmospheric prediction studies coaps http hycom coaps fsu edu thredds catalog html were used to construct the big brother ics and bcs these global data include sea temperature salinity horizontal velocity and sea surface height the data have 1 12 1 12 9 km horizontal resolution with 33 layers 0 5 5 km in the vertical temporally updated every 24 h as described in detail in coaps and metzger et al 2008 the atmospheric data include u v components of wind at 10 m elevation atmosphere pressure relative humidity surface temperature precipitation and net short and long wave heat fluxes the weather research forecast wrf model was used to downscale from the results of the ncep final operational global analysis ncep fnl ncep fnl is a global dataset on a 1 1 grid updated every 6 h the wrf was run separately not in a coupled ocean atmosphere model with spatial resolution 1 km 1 km and domain covering the domain of the ocean models the updating frequency of atmospheric variables for the roms model was 1 h in this area during the simulation time the current flows are mainly eastward and slightly northeastward they merge with a steady current coming from the karimata strait and a current from the gulf of thailand hu et al 2000 liu et al 2008 fang et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 in addition the mekong river discharges into the east sea of vietnam with 13 000 m3 s annually botkosal 2009 but can be excluded from the little brother domain for simulations since it flows to the northeast during the simulated period fig 2 therefore there is no source which can produce shearing on the mean field scale also there is no arrival of a storm which could make a wake and stimulate small scale developments furthermore though the coastline and small islands exist in the lb domain these areas are small in comparison to the whole domain hence the type 1 mechanics can be studied without much intervention of local stimulation generators in the bbe big brother guides little brother with only large and intermediate scale information small scale features of the big brother output were filtered out with a low pass filter using the discrete cosine transform as in denis et al 2002b this filtered dataset was used to construct initial conditions as well as lateral boundary conditions for little brother as shown in table 1 the experiments first examined the different set up cases for viscosity diffusivity of the sponge layer from 0 m2 s to 120 m2 s for j1 as shown in the columns then after selecting the most suitable viscosity diffusivity it is used in consecutive experiments with different jump ratios between bb and lb resolutions varying from 3 to 9 this being the ratio of the big brother driver s spatial resolution and that of the nested little brother model as previously done in pham et al 2016 the sponge layer width is chosen to be about 10 grid points giorgi and mearns 1999 and sponge viscosity diffusivity can be up to 0 1 horizontal resolution for instance with lb resolution of 1 km the sponge layer width can be 10 km and maximum sponge viscosity diffusivity is 100 m2 s since the big brother and little brother vertical resolutions are identical the simulation could avoid errors due to inconsistencies and imbalances of vertical resolution between driving data and driven model as mentioned in caya and laprise 1999 denis et al 2002a and pham et al 2016 the spatial resolution jump ratio is defined as 1 j ℓ b b ℓ l b here ℓ b b is the big brother driver s cut off filter wavelength ℓ l b is the shortest resolvable wavelength in little brother which equals twice the little brother grid resolution therefore if a resolution jump of j 3 j3 is required and the little brother resolution is 1 km then ℓ l b is 2 km and the big brother cut off wavelength ℓ b b becomes 6 km similarly as shown in table 1 for j6 and j9 the filter cut off wavelengths in the original big brother are 12 km and 18 km respectively it is noted that small scale signals of atmospheric variables of wrf model s output were also removed over the little brother by a spatial low pass filter depend on the spatial jump ratio 3 results in downscaling the global information to a regional scale domain sizes types of boundary conditions and even the orcm model itself degrade the results of nesting warner et al 1997 denis et al 2002a pham et al 2016 therefore as a first step the ability of orcms to regenerate kinetic energies over every scale is investigated also the present work is aimed at identifying how during the nesting procedure with the ocean regional circulation model small scale motions are generated when stimulating sources are absent then we introduce a new method to improve the quality of solutions in such cases 3 1 the impact of the sponge layers on the results it is well known that open boundary conditions are based on hyperbolic equations marchesiello et al 2001 therefore the mathematical treatment of the lbc for the averaged navier stokes equation is an ill posed problem palma and matano 1998 marchesiello et al 2001 when flow is directed outward the prescribed boundary conditions lead to inconsistency between specified conditions at the boundaries with those of the interior domain this generates waves reflecting back from the lateral boundaries thus deteriorating the interior solutions palma and matano 1998 giorgi and mearns 1999 marchesiello et al 2001 in order to mitigate such errors open boundary conditions often use supplementary methodologies such as sponge nudging to absorb disturbances and suppress computational noise by horizontal viscosity near the open boundary palma and matano 1998 giorgi and mearns 1999 marchesiello et al 2001 blayo and debreu 2005 oddo and pinardi 2008 since the range of sponge viscosity diffusivity values is large up to 120 m2 s it is necessary to select a suitable value therefore this work tests a set of nested procedures with various sponge viscosities diffusivities ranging from 0 to 120 m2 s as shown in table 1 raymond and kuo radiation r k radiation with the supplementary methodology of sponge nudging is employed since that is very reliable as discussed by pham et al 2016 the time scale was set at 3 days for nudging during outward propagation and 365 days for nudging during inward propagation all cases were simulated at j1 spatial resolution which means that small scales are not filtered out in other words all scales of big brother are specified in ics and bcs for little brother first normalized kinetic energy spectra are compared at the surface layer in big and little brothers as a reference case a sponge layer was not applied in other words sponge viscosity diffusivity was 0 m2 s after 60 days of simulation fig 3 a the normalized kinetic energy spectra are calculated in the interior domain with 10 grid points further from lateral boundaries in order to remove the sponge layer normalized surface layer kinetic energy ke at a given wavelength ℓ is given by 2 k e ℓ 1 n x n y 1 n x 1 n y 1 2 u ℓ 2 v ℓ 2 k e b b ℓ where n x and n y are respectively the numbers of grid points in the longitudinal x and latitudinal y directions u ℓ and v ℓ are the velocity components in the x and y directions respectively and k e b b ℓ is surface layer kinetic energy of big brother at a given wavelength in general most energy is contained in larger scales with magnitudes gradually decreasing at smaller scales fig 3 a at larger scales j1 00 and big brother show similar amounts of spectral energy however at intermediate scales wavelengths 18 km to 60 km and small scales 2 km to 18 km little brother energy differs from that of big brother since there is no sponge layer disturbance and noise generated by discontinuities between internal and external information are not suppressed by viscosity and diffusivity in a sponge region near open boundaries errors due to discontinuities can be reflected back to the domain interiors and deteriorate the inner model solution as discussed by marchesiello et al 2001 on the other hand large scale signals can freely leave the domain disturbance and noise due to discontinuities at the open boundary are at relatively small scales and being small they do not affect the large scales but can cause differences in the neighboring intermediate scales when a sponge layer was employed with viscosity diffusivity set at 20 j1 20 not shown 40 j1 40 and 60 m2 s j1 60 not shown disturbances and noise near the sponge regions were well absorbed and the disturbances were less reflected at the boundaries marchesiello et al 2001 oddo and pinardi 2008 therefore the distortions at the smaller scales of little brother were mitigated well fig 3 a the energy spectra of those three cases were similar to each other however when the sponge viscosity diffusivity was set at 80 m2 s not shown energies of both small and even intermediate scales are weaker than those of the original bb and they are weaker still with a sponge viscosity diffusivity of 120 m2 s fig 3 b so high sponge viscosity diffusivity can damp fluctuations even at larger scales and it may also reflect the outgoing waves oddo and pinardi 2008 therefore we avoid using sponges with excessive viscosity and diffusivity finally when the spectra for the j1 20 j1 40 and j1 60 cases are compared although the three cases are very different from each other the j1 40 spectra show the best performance among them based on their statistical terms the j1 40 spectra deviated from big brother by only about 3 while deviation of j1 20 and j1 60 are 3 2 and 4 1 respectively the cor of j1 40 and j1 20 are the same at 99 8 and a little higher than j1 60 by about 0 4 moreover j1 40 has errors of 2 5 in comparison with big brother while j1 20 and j1 60 have slightly larger errors of 2 8 and 3 7 respectively thus for the present work we chose 40 m2 s for the sponge viscosity diffusivity for all experiments 3 2 small scale motions lacking stimulations the principle behind the nesting approach is this we use large scale information to supply the boundary conditions incorporating detailed local information and thus use a highly resolved orcm simulation to describe over a limited region the physical processes occurring including detailed small scale motions such small scale motions developed in higher resolution orcms are attributed to two types of stimulating sources as discussed in the previous section this section will investigate how small scale motions develop in a highly resolved orcm without the support of the stimulating sources time averaged relative vorticity fields in the surface layer are first analyzed and presented in fig 4 since relative vorticity is a fundamental quantity in fluid dynamics and a higher order variable related to velocity lam 2015 and the relative vorticity strongly highlights small scales of the flow denis et al 2002a fig 4 a b shows all scales of time averaged vorticity at the surface layer while fig 4 c d shows only the small scale 6km components the results show that j3 is able to regenerate the stationary large scale features successfully with all scale stationary correlation coefficient scor of 99 3 scor is defined by eq a 11 appendix a however since small scales are absent from the ic and bc they are newly generated and develop during the downscaling due to large scales incorporation with stimulated sources fig 4 c d and scor values show agreement of the small scale stationary component between big brother and j3 is not as good as that of the large scale stationary component the correlation of small scale stationary components is somewhat higher when they are considered only near the coast and small islands within 15 grid points from coastline and island of 95 6 while the correlation coefficient is weaker in the areas far away from the coast and small islands scor 86 4 this is not surprising since small islands and coasts are considered as local sources producing small scale motions eddies formed by wakes behind islands and irregular coastlines shear the flow generating and developing small scale turbulent motions therefore the ratio of domain averaged stationary small scale variance referring to eq a 12 appendix a near the coast and small islands is 1 01 while it is only 0 92 in the area far from the coast and small islands the energy spectra of big brother j1 j3 and j9 which are simulated in the real domain are compared in fig 5 for the big brother and j1 cases the small scales are not filtered out but for the j3 and j9 cases small scales are filtered out as discussed in the previous section fig 5 a after 30 days the energies over all scales in little brother have increased considerably but they still have not reached the same energy level as in big brother fig 5 b c in the little brother case small scale motions appear and grow by shearing but still have not grown fully enough to be at the same level as big brother due to the lack of sources stimulating and growing the small scales after 60 days energies decrease even at scales larger than 18 km fig 5 c these decreases at the larger scales may indicate that energy transfers from large to small scales occur through internal interaction processes classified as type 1 however the energy transfer is not enough to feed small scales reaching the same level as that of big brother at the higher spatial resolution jump ratio of j6 not shown or j9 fig 5 c without any external stimulating sources to activate small scale motions the absence of small scales affects the corresponding larger scales deflecting the large scale spectra with deflections which increase as the resolution jump becomes larger fig 5 c the absence of small scales during downscaling then degrades the quality of the nested solutions this agrees well with the observations reported in previous works e g antic et al 2004 denis et al 2002a herceg et al 2006 that the results of regional climate models do not perform well in regions where stimulating sources are absent for the smaller domain lbs whose linear size is less than half that of lb without any local stimuli of small scales within the domain fig 2 the spectral energies of j3 and j9 at the smaller scales after 60 simulated days are significantly deficient compared to big brother whereas the spectral energy of j1 matches well with big brother s fig 6 the under production of small scale features is due to two reasons 1 there is no source for stimulating and rapidly developing the small scales therefore the cascade of energy from larger scales to smaller scales through internal interactions is not sufficient to enable small scales to grow fully 2 since the lbs domain size is so small motions at the small scales do not have enough space to develop as pointed out by denis et al 2002a they also mentioned that the one way nested domain should have an appropriate size to leave space for small scale features to develop pham et al 2016 also observed that the larger the domain size that is set the higher the quality achieved in one way nested simulation in other words the development of finer scales is sensitive to the size of the fine domain the recommended domain sizes of the orcms are range from 1 10 to 1 2 of the ogcms domain size pham et al 2016 3 3 enhancement of downscaling ability when the small scale fluctuations are absent at ics and bcs due to the lack of any generating source their patterns and energies cannot fully recover during the nesting procedure such underestimation of small scale motions causes bias in the energies of associated larger scales compared with big brother in the j1 case little brother reproduces well features of all big brother scales figs 5 b c 6 b the lack of small scale eddies is the main difference between the big and little brothers therefore the present work proposes a new method to mitigate such discrepancies during downscaling the method is named the boundary small eddy additions bsea technique the concept of this method is the artificial addition of small scale eddies to the coarse data which have no small scale features the procedure for the artificial addition of small scale fluctuations is described as follows with resolution jump j 1 the big brother has only large scale information as follows 3 φ φ l s then when new small scales φ s s n e w are constructed based on the above large scale big brother as described in appendix b the new field for the ic and bc can be constructed for little brother as 4 φ b s e a φ l s φ s s n e w here the new total field φ b s e a includes both large and small scale eddies which can be used to drive the little brother the sizes of the small scale eddies added to the coarse data depend on the spatial jump ratio in the case of j3 the shortest resolvable little brother wavelength is 2 km 1 km grid size and the spatial jump ratio is 3 hence the scales of the eddies which need to be added are in the range from 2 km to 6 km in the j6 case eddies need to be added in the scale range from 2 km to 12 km and in the j9 case from 2 km to 18 km the procedure for adding small scales to the coarse data is schematically described in fig 7 in terms of the kinetic energy spectrum as illustrated this procedure is based on the j6 case so the velocity fluctuations are added at scales smaller than 12 km only larger scale components exist in the coarse big brother data fig 7 a the constructed small scale components fig 7 b are summed with the larger scale components of the coarse big brother data to construct a new field of velocity which includes components of all scales fig 7 c lastly the new field of velocity is used to drive little brother the procedure for adding small scale information is applied to all variables including u and v velocity components and scalar variables of oceanic and atmospheric variables the bsea approach is somewhat similar to the addition of diagnostic values for the kinetic energy k at the inlet boundary in a k ε or k ω turbulence model to activate and grow small scale turbulence artificially sullivan et al 1994 franklin et al 2005 rao and de bruyn kops 2011 however in such turbulence models kinetic energy is added at only one turbulence length scale based on the mixing length while in bsea small scales are added at each length scale as in such a turbulence model artificially adding small scale motions at the boundaries in a nested model helps finer small scales fully develop rapidly and so can reduce the spin up time needed to raise up fine scale features to their equilibrium amplitudes denis et al 2002a laprise 2008 pham et al 2016 in order to find out how the bsea technique improves the reproduction quality of big brother in little brother four experiments in the real j6 domain have been examined with the addition of small scale motions to the ic and bc as described in table 2 with a purpose of finding how important the spatial spin up of small scale development in the ic and from the bc is following this we performed three experiments with different spatial resolution jumps including j3 j6 and j9 employing the bsea technique to find out how improvement of the nested model s results occurred when employing the bsea technique fig 8 shows the crmsds of depth averaged z vorticity between little and big brothers for j6 and j6r j6r represents j6 with the addition of small scale energy by the bsea technique likewise for jnr with other values of n see table 2 for this and for descriptions of j6io and j6bo since small scale fluctuations were removed in j6 and j6r initially errors due to the discrepancies between big brother and j6 and j6r appear over the whole domain in particular around small islands and the coastline of ca mau cape at the southern tip of viet nam not shown after 30 days of simulation such errors due to inconsistencies of the ics significantly decrease nevertheless significant errors occur along the western boundary between southern boundary and 8 5 n latitude in j6 spreading latitudinally and propagating toward the eastern boundary during the first 30 days fig 8 a b the errors occur and grow from the lateral boundary during the spatial spin up time of small scale development before they reach equilibrium amplitude denis et al 2003 such errors repeatedly occur whenever updating the lateral boundaries and then they propagate following the eastward flow to the inner domain denis et al 2003 pham et al 2016 laprise 2008 therefore the errors are generated mainly along the western boundary and spread to the whole inner domain in particular where eastward flow occurs south of 8 5 n latitude compared to j6 the error magnitudes and area occupied are significantly less in j6r in particular along the western boundary fig 8 c d this improvement gives evidence that adding small scales to the boundary conditions can reduce the error from small scale generation propagating from the boundary fig 9 compares the results of each of the cases simulated in the real domain the result of case j6 in which the small scale motions in the ic and bc are filtered out is worst compared to the j6io j6bo and j6r cases the spectral energy of j6 deviates from to big brother s with the sd r e l a t i v e of 82 4 and getting 25 of error in the case of non filtering of small scales in the ic but filtering out small scales in the bc j6io the quality of j6io is almost the same as that of j6 it is clear that the inclusion of the small scale fluctuations in the ic does not much improve the quality of the nested solution this agrees well with denis et al 2002a and pham et al 2016 that the spatial spin up of small scale development from the ic after one day is not as important as that from the bc therefore small scale fluctuations should be imposed on the bc in order to assess how the quality of orcm results can be improved by employing the bsea technique an experiment with non filtered small scale motions in the bc j6bo is also performed for comparison with j6r as shown in fig 9 the performance of j6r in which small scale energies are added is significantly improved compared with j6 although the spectral energy of j6r is not as good as that of j6bo in terms of crmsd r e l a t i v e and cor it fits well with that of big brother having a correlation coefficient of up to 99 8 its sd r e l a t i v e is only 3 and error is 5 fig 10 shows the energy spectra of j3 and j9 without a and with b the addition of small scales along with the spectral energy of j1 for comparison of the simulations it is recognized that in the original j3 and j9 kinetic energies at the small scales were filtered out from the initial and boundary conditions after 60 days of simulation small scale kinetic energy recovers fig 10 a but still does not reach the same level as that of big brother the filtering effects are more significant with a higher jump ratio than with a lower jump ratio in j3 the kinetic energies at small scales recover well becoming much more similar to those of big brother than do those in j9 after adding small scales to the bcs in j3r and j9r the energy at smaller scales than the filter cut off wavelengths of both j3r and j9r returns to a level very close to the big brother amplitude after 60 days as shown in fig 10 b it is interesting that before applying bsea fig 10 a the energies which are filtered out in the range from 2 km to 6 km in the case of j3 cannot grow to the same level of bb and energies in the range from 7 km to 18 km which is larger scale than cut off wavelength 6 km do not grow to the level of the bb either during a long period in j9 as in j3 the energies in the range from 18 km to 30 km which is just larger than cut off wavelength 18 km also do not grow fast however after employing bsea fig 10 b energies in filtered scales and larger scales than cut off wavelength in all cases grow fast to the level of bb by inversely cascading from the smallest scale which is same to the grid size such inverse cascading seems to be observed in the many previous 2 dimensional turbulence researches e g kraichnan 1976 gage and nastrom 1986 danilow and gurarie 2000 therefore even the intermediate scales which are near or even larger than the cut off wavelength are also affected if small scales are insufficiently excited some statistics of surface layer energy spectra after 60 days for j1 j3 j6 j9 and also j3r j6r j9r which include additions of small scale eddies were calculated and plotted in a taylor diagram as shown in fig 11 as the jump ratios decrease from j9 to j1 the correlation coefficients increase the crmsd r e l a t i v e decreases and the sd r e l a t i v e increases therefore as expected the reproducibility by the nested procedure becomes better as the jump ratios become smaller after adding small scales all qualities of the simulations significantly improve j9r performs better than j6 while j6r performs much better than j3 and j3r is almost the same as j1 fig 11 however although the qualities of j6r and j9r are significantly improved j9r is still not as good as j6r nor is j6r as good as j3r since it takes j6r and j9r a longer time than j3r to recover fig 12 shows time series of squared relative vorticity averaged over the domain before and after adding small scales for cases j1 j3 and j9 after 60 days of simulation along with their statistical terms presented as a taylor diagram as shown j1 generally reproduces well the features of big brother with a high correlation coefficient of 99 3 the relative vorticity deviates from that of big brother by only 4 and has crmsd r e l a t i v e of 10 fig 12 a c for j 1 before employing bsea the little brother vorticity is not reproduced well and so deviates slightly from that of big brother such deviation becomes larger with an increase of the jump ratio however after adding small scale fluctuations in the j3r and j9r cases the relative vorticity is reproduced much better than without these additions fig 12 b c the performance of j3r is particularly good being the closest to the non filtered case j1 even j9r reproduces well with higher cor than j9 in addition compared with j9 j9r s sd r e l a t i v e increases from 77 to 93 and crmsd r e l a t i v e decreases from 35 to 23 taylor diagrams present the enhancement of downscaling ability obtained for temperature and salinity by employing bsea fig 13 the quality of reproduction of cases before employing bsea is inadequate and becomes worse as the jump ratios increase from 1 to 9 as expected after adding small scale fluctuations to the lateral boundaries of j3r j6r and j9r temperatures are reproduced much better than in the cases without the additions comparing j3r temperature with that of j3 the correlation coefficient increases from 98 1 to 99 7 the sd r e l a t i v e improves by 4 and crmsd r e l a t i v e decreases from 19 to 5 similar to the j3 case j6r performs better than j6 j6r is even close to j3 comparing j6r temperature with that of j6 the correlation coefficient increases from 96 4 to 97 5 sd r e l a t i v e improves by 13 and crmsd r e l a t i v e decreases from 30 to 21 also thanks to bsea temperature is much better reproduced with j9r than with j9 comparing j9r temperature with that of j9 the correlation coefficient is increased by 2 3 the sd r e l a t i v e is improved by 10 and notably crmsd r e l a t i v e drops by nearly 10 similar to temperature the quality of salinity in all cases is also improved after employing bsea fig 13 b in comparison with cases not employing bsea their salinities are in better agreement with big brother with higher correlation coefficients smaller crmsd r e l a t i v e and standard deviations almost equal to those of big brother j3r j6r and j9r reproduce salinities much better than j3 j6 and j9 respectively for the orcm with the coarser grid ocean gcm there seems to be an optimal jump ratio as pham et al 2016 pointed out and so a multiple nesting or cascading model approach is necessary as denis et al 2002a and blayo and debreu 2005 have suggested however such multiple nesting takes more time and computational cost to ensure the quality of the orcm results and even with the multiple nesting technique one still has unwanted errors at every step of nesting denis et al 2002a antic et al 2004 here by adding small scales using the bsea technique the qualities of the orcm results in cases j3r j6r and j9r are significantly improved the j9r case even shows results close to those of j3 for some diagnostic fields j3 has the optimized jump ratio suggested by denis et al 2002a and pham et al 2016 therefore addition of small scale fluctuations to large scales along the bcs helping to perform a high resolution simulation over time can in only one step reproduce big brother s results better than a multiple nesting scheme 4 summary and conclusions one way nesting with an ocean regional circulation model is an efficient way to produce highly resolved oceanic data from the coarse information of global models the orcm specifies the large scale information from a global model in the initial and boundary conditions incorporating local forcing to generate the finer scale features denis et al 2002a herbert et al 2014 pham et al 2016 since the generation and development of small scale features relies significantly on the stimulating sources denis et al 2002a feser et al 2011 without such stimulating sources the small scale features are too weak and can even lead to distortions of the larger scale kinetic energy thus contaminating nested solutions over the whole domain through a framework of big brother experiments which can help in determining the conditions and the separate stimulating sources for small scale generation we can assess the effects of small scale features on the larger scales and the nested solutions in the case without stimulating sources to energize small scale motion kinetic energies at smaller scales never grow to the big brother level based on this fact a boundary small eddy additions technique is proposed to activate small scale motions by suitably stimulating boundary conditions from our discussion in the previous sections the main results are as follows 1 the generation and development of small scale features relies strongly on the stimulating sources without such stimulating sources a nested model cannot generate small scales at the appropriate level and distorts the kinetic energy spectrum as time passes such under estimation of kinetic energy increases with increase of the spatial resolution ratio between driving information and driven model the bias of kinetic energy at small scales accumulated over a long time may also distort ensuing kinetic energy even at larger scales degrading the quality of the orcm results moreover the development of small scales is also sensitive to the size of the nested domain the one way nested domain needs to be large enough for small scales to grow 2 adding small scale motions at the boundaries in a nested model can help fluctuations at small scales develop at the right level even without stimulating sources thus avoiding underestimation of kinetic energy at small scales as a result kinetic energy at the larger scales can be kept stable and this helps to improve the quality of the nested solution moreover this method can also help to run a one way nested model with higher spatial resolution without multi downscaling strategies instead of the previous optimal resolution jump of 3 pham et al 2016 bsea permits the nested model running with spatial resolution differences up to j6 or j9 with the addition of random kinetic energy at the smaller scales the present work was based only on the framework of a specific big brother experiment configuration to address the characteristics of generation and development of small scale motions together with their impacts on the larger scales and explain how their existence causes degradation of the orcm solution as mentioned in numerous previous studies warner et al 1997 denis et al 2002a 2003 huang et al 2008 pham et al 2016 the quality of a nested regional model depends on various parameters such as the driving information from the global model local forcing geographical domain seasonality horizontal resolution jumps update frequencies of the lbcs and the numerical strategy of the nested model itself etc therefore results of a nested model may be very different depending on such aforementioned parameters however despite such limits on the present conclusions our finding on the role of stimulating sources to small scale motions and their development and the proposed method of adding kinetic energy at small scales to the boundary conditions could be applied in any nesting procedure to increase the quality of the solution and increase the spatial resolution jump ratio between the driver data and the nested model

coarse resolution model or observational data they have only larger scale low wave number information and the results are deficient in the smaller scales which play major roles in the energy budget to redress this small scale energy deficiency the present work proposes the boundary small eddy addition bsea method the bsea method first constructs a spectrum by extension of the spectrum at the larger scales to the smaller scales assuming the energy cascades monotonically from the large scale after thus constructing the spectrum realistic velocity fields are created by inverse transformation of the spectrum then the resulting finer scale signals are added to the original coarser boundary conditions b 1 1 constructing the smaller scale high wavenumber energy spectrum from the larger scale low wavenumber spectrum we present here an example of the procedure by which we generate a realistic all scales velocity field when the coarse data which have 6 km resolution hence 12 km smallest wavelength are used to drive the highly resolved regional model with a resolution of 1 km hence resolved wavelength of 2 km we want to infer data at the smaller scales with ℓ representing wavelength e l ℓ is the energy spectrum of the larger scales which is already known and e s ℓ is the unknown energy spectrum of the smaller scales e s ℓ values are trigonometrically generated based on the large

23997,we present a creek to ocean 3d baroclinic model based on unstructured grids that aims to unite traditional hydrologic and ocean models in a single modeling platform by taking full advantage of the polymorphism i e a single model grid can seamlessly morph between full 3d 2dv 2dh and quasi 1d configurations using hurricane irene 2011 s impact on the delaware bay as an example a seamless 2d 3d model grid is implemented to include the entire us east coast and gulf of mexico with a highly resolved delaware bay down to 20 m resolution the model is forced by flows from a hydrological model national water model at the landward boundary we demonstrate the model s accuracy stability and robustness with the simulation of the storm surge and subsequent river flooding events and compound surges through a series of sensitivity tests we illustrate the importance of including in the simulation the baroclinic effects as provided by the large scale gulf stream in order to correctly capture the adjustment process following the main surge and the subsequent compound flooding events the baroclinicity can explain up to 14 of the elevation error during the adjustment phase after the storm keywords storm surge 3d model baroclinicity schism national water model delaware bay usa 1 introduction the catastrophic loss from floods world wide costs hundreds of billions of dollars each year including property damages and loss of lives blake 2007 the flood and inundation hazard due to either coastal storm surges or river flooding has been well studied using physical and statistical models wolf 2009 teng et al 2017 however a critical knowledge gap exists in the attempt to address the effects of compound flooding due to the combined effects of different flood sources in general three types of inundation processes are of concern to coastal communities coastal storm surge and inundation pluvial inundation precipitation driven flooding and fluvial inundation river flooding traditionally these processes have been studied separately using different types of models hydrodynamic models for storm surge and hydrological hydraulic models for pluvial fluvial flooding a hydrodynamic model generally excludes the watershed mostly because of the constraints induced by numerical stability and or computational cost whereas a hydrologic model s capability roughly stops at mean sea level msl because it is not designed for estuarine oceanic processes a plethora of models are available for these two types of simulations e g kerr et al 2013 chen et al 2013 sharma et al 2019 these models however often neglect the important interaction between coastal and inland processes such as the compound flooding and backflow effects the compound effects from the combination of all these processes including the 3d baroclinic effects have not been studied in detail before and are the subject of this study the issue of compound flooding has recently garnered a great deal of attention because of the increased concurrences of storms and heavy precipitation in coastal areas wahl et al 2015 for example during hurricane harvey 2017 galveston bay received freshwater inputs of approximately three times the bay s volume du and park 2019 causing catastrophic flooding along the texas coast as the climate warms many of the climate models predict increasing occurrences of such wet storms in the coming decades knutson et al 2010 which sets the perfect conditions for compound flooding this trend highlights the urgency of understanding the detailed mechanism of compound flooding to accurately forecast its impact for effective mitigation and planning to this end national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has initiated the noaa water initiative 1 1 url https

that includes signals propagating up and downstream in coastal estuarine and riverine environments particularly during storm events the goal is to establish an integrated water forecasting system that

water noaa gov about nwm last accessed in july 2019 or nwm to holistically simulate the total water level and its individual components the flexibility and robustness of schism are indispensable for traversing large contrasts of temporal and spatial scales from oceanic processes such as the gulf stream to inland flooding in small creeks in doing so we have built a very reconfigurable and flexible modeling platform that can be extended to cover a larger domain with sufficient resolution in the areas of interest effort is on going to extend the current model to cover all major estuaries and bays in the us east coast and gulf of mexico in this study we focus on the importance of including the 3d effects in the storm surge simulations the model is first validated using observational data derived from noaa usgs and satellite products sensitivity tests are then conducted to examine the importance of 3d effects in particular the baroclinicity minato 1998 was among the first to elucidate the implication of incorporating 3d effects in simulating storm surges and he gave a simple explanation on why finer vertical resolution led to higher surges in tosa bay japan zheng et al 2013 compared results from 2d and 3d barotropic models for the storm surges in the gulf of mexico and showed that both models can adequately simulate the surge provided that the bottom frictions were properly calibrated li et al 2006 and cho et al 2012 studied the impact of hurricane floyd 1999 and isabel 2003 in the chesapeake bay using 3d baroclinic models but did not explicitly expound the influence of baroclinicity on surface elevation partly because of the small model domain used orton et al 2012 used a 3d baroclinic model on a small domain to simulate storm surges near new york city and estimated that neglecting water density variations led to typical reductions of 1 13 in the peak surge but as suggested by zheng et al 2013 these numbers are highly sensitive to the choices of bottom friction in addition the exclusion of large scale baroclinic processes such as the gulf stream led to additional uncertainties in their model therefore the impact of 3d baroclinic effects on storm surge needs to be further assessed one of the key differences between the current study and previous studies is that we compare the best calibrated results from different configurations 2d 3d barotropic and 3d baroclinic by adjusting model parameters independently to achieve best possible results under each configuration this ascertains that the differences are not due to calibration issues or of numerical origin our results from numerous sensitivity tests indicate that the 3d baroclinic effects do not significantly alter the main surge as the latter is mostly governed by large scale barotropic processes but play an important role in the restoration process afterward mainly through the large scale oceanic response as found in the gulf stream results from sensitivity tests clearly indicate that the restoration process in the water surface elevation rebounding waves cannot be properly captured by barotropic models the importance of the gulf stream on coastal inundation has been reported recently by ezer 2013 2018 but the focus there was on the remote connection between storms and coastal flooding far away from the storm path our results provide direct evidence on the importance of including the baroclinic oceanic response in storm surge simulations for bays and estuaries in what follows section 2 briefly describes the hurricane event irene 2011 used in this study as well as available observational data collected by multiple agencies section 3 presents the details of our model setups including the baseline simulation using a 3d baroclinic configuration as well as other sensitivity simulations section 4 presents the validation of the baseline setup for surface elevation salinity and temperature section 5 discusses the effects from wind waves then in section 6 we use results from sensitivity experiments to elucidate the effects from 3d processes including baroclinicity highlighting the stabilization effect of the gulf stream in the restoration process after the storm a summary is given in section 7 2 study case 2 1 hurricane irene 2011 hurricane irene the first major atlantic hurricane in 2011 was selected here as a case study the hurricane made its landfall along the us east coast at outer bank nc on aug 27 2011 as a category 1 hurricane the hurricane re entered atlantic coastal waters in virginia delaware and new jersey and weakened to a tropical storm before making the second landfall in new jersey and the third landfall in new york city as seen from the weather maps fig 1 while there was only one major wind event related to irene there were two large precipitation events associated with irene and the subsequent tropical storm lee the latter originated from gulf of mexico and swept over land over eastern states these events led to two streamflow peaks in delaware bay s largest tributary the delaware river fig 2b the first peak flow of about 4000 m3 s 1 occurred on aug 28 2011 around the landfall of irene the second peak about 1500 m3 s 1 higher than the first occurred 10 days later under tropical storm lee 2011 mainly resulting from the precipitation and the subsequent pluvial fluvial processes rather than a storm surge the streamflow of the second largest tributary the schuylkill river exhibits similar patterns fig 2b the different flood origins ocean and inland made this event an ideal test for compound flood

hybrid finite element finite volume method and hybrid triangular quadrangular ugs in the horizontal and hybrid localized sigma coordinates with shaved cells lsc2 grid in the vertical zhang et al 2015 2016 the model uses a semi implicit time stepping scheme to enhance robustness and efficiency and the numerical dissipation is kept low with a judicious combination of higher order monotone schemes ye et al 2018 2019 and the semi implicit finite element formulation a schism based regional model has been developed which covers the northwest atlantic ocean the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea fig 3a the large spatial domain used here accommodates different storm paths that make landfalls in this region and includes the path of the most important western boundary current in this region the gulf stream in order to study its baroclinic responses during storms ezer 2018 2019 the focus site in this pilot study is the delaware bay which is a major estuary on the u s east coast tidal portions of the delaware river start at trenton new jersey and the total length of the estuary from trenton to the mouth is 210 km the total terrestrial drainage of the estuary is 4 2 104 km2 sharp 1983 a key characteristic of the estuary as far as the tides are concerned is that it constricts rapidly from the widest point in the lower bay near the noaa station brandywine fig 3b to the mid bay the funneling effect from width variation leads to a hypersynchronous system with tides generally increasing landward friedrichs 2010 but the channel meandering in the mid bay near the noaa station reedy point fig 3b considerably complicates the dynamics there section 4 1 the bay is mostly shallow with a mean depth of 7 m harleman 1966 the delaware river provides 58 of the freshwater inflow the confluence of the schuylkill river below philadelphia adds another 14 other tributaries collectively account for the remaining 28 sharp 1983 the average freshwater inflow is 570 m3 s 1 with high flow conditions occurring during the spring freshets whitney and garvine 2006 even under peak freshwater inflow the estuary is vertically mixed by the tides most of time wong 1995 the freshwater outflow from the bay is generally weak the plume is typically in contact with the frictional bottom boundary layer and confined within 20 km offshore under normal conditions münchow and garvine 1993 wong and münchow 1995 yankovsky and chapman 1997 the model domain includes a part of the delaware bay watershed up to the 10 m isobath above mean sea level msl in the delaware river the largest tributary of the delaware bay the domain extends to the usgs gauge of riegelsville fig 3b at 40 m above msl such a domain choice requires that the model directly simulates some pluvial and fluvial processes normally handled by hydrological models the bathymetry information fig 3 is derived from two dem digital elevation model sources the global relief model etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 for the ocean and the 1 m usgs coastal national elevation database danielson et al 2018 for the delaware bay the inclusion of a large portion of delaware bay watershed complicates the use of a curved vertical datum such as ngvd29 and therefore the model is based on a flat datum of navd88 the latter is convenient because 1 the usgs dem is given in navd88 2 most new instruments use this datum accordingly all model data comparisons on elevation are also based on navd88 a datum conversion from navd88 to ngvd29 e g using the vdatum 7 7 url https vdatum noaa gov last accessed in june 2019 tool which itself relies on model simulation would introduce uncertainties especially in the upper bay near the fall line so we choose to rely on observation instead among the nine noaa tide stations used fig 3b the differences between the local msls and the navd88 datum are available at three stations the lower bay station lewes 0 121 m i e the local msl is below the navd88 datum the mid bay station reedy point 0 015 m and the upper bay station philadelphia 0 118 m as shown later section 4 1 the model is able to correctly set up the surface slope with the local msl asymptotically increasing toward upper bay as observed the datum differences between msl and navd88 at the three stations are linearly interpolated onto other stations based on the along thalweg distance with linear extrapolation for berlington and newbold which are up estuary from philadelphia this procedure is expected to introduce uncertainties on the order of a few centimeters in the model data comparison of elevation 3 2 grid generation one of the key steps and challenges in ug modeling is the grid generation the stability and robustness of schism greatly simplifies the grid generation process effort is mostly focused on resolving key bathymetric and geometric features without worrying about computational cost or numerical instability courtesy of the implicit scheme used furthermore polymorphism allows a very faithful representation of the underlying bathymetry and topography without the need for any smoothing as required by many other terrain following coordinate models zhang et al 2016 as explained in ye et al 2018 bathymetry smoothing in an estuarine regime should be avoided because it alters fundamental aspects of estuarine circulation such as salt intrusion channel shoal contrast and the related lateral circulation the grid generation software sms surface water modeling system 8 8 url https aquaveo com last accessed in june 2019 was used to generate the horizontal grid the horizontal spatial domain was discretized by an ug with 667 k nodes and 1273 k elements including 39 k quadrangular elements used to represent the shipping channel fig 4 a quasi uniform triangular grid with a resolution of 6 7 km was applied in the open ocean which was smoothly transitioned to about 2 km resolution near the coastline locally high resolution was applied in the delaware bay with a typical resolution of 600 m in the lower bay channel 50 m in the upper bay channel 150 m in the watershed areas above msl and down to 20 m in some small creeks during the grid generation process feature arcs fig 4a were used mainly to 1 explicitly incorporate features such as the nwm segments into schism s horizontal grid red arcs in fig 4b 2 align the quadrilateral elements with main channels thus resembling a structured grid locally black arcs in fig 4b after the grid was generated the dems were linearly interpolated onto the computational grid without any bathymetry smoothing the vertical discretization used in the model took full advantage of the hybrid terrain following like lsc2 coordinate zhang et al 2015 with variable number of layers at different horizontal locations the average number of layers was 18 3 with a maximum of 44 layers in the deepest ocean and only 1 layer in shallow areas with depths less than 0 5 m fig 5 as a result 2d representation was applied for about 57 of the delaware bay watershed or 30 of the total grid elements an element was deemed wet when the local water depth calculated from the implicit finite element solver exceeded 10 6 m such a small threshold was needed to accurately capture the very thin layer of fluid initially formed on dry land during precipitation events a smaller value 10 8 does not significantly change the results the model was stable even with this choice of small threshold for wetting and drying courtesy of the implicit scheme because the vertical flow structure can be safely ignored for the pluvial and inundation processes the single layer configuration greatly reduced the computational cost and meanwhile enhanced the robustness of the model zhang et al 2016 3 3 baseline model setup 3 3 1 forcing and parameters the baseline setup used a 3d baroclinic model wave effects were excluded in the baseline model but examined in subsequent sensitivity analysis section 5 atmospheric forcing applied at the air sea interface consisted of two sources the first source was derived from ecwmf s era5 reanalysis dataset 9 9 url https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era5 last accessed in june 2019 and the variables included air temperature air pressure reduced to msl humidity wind speed and direction at 10 m above msl downward short wave and long wave radiations and precipitation rate this product has a spatial resolution of 30 km and temporal resolution of 1 h the second source was a high resolution product from ecmwf with a spatial resolution of 5 km magnusson et al 2014 the comparison shown in fig 2 suggests that the atmospheric forcing used in the model is sufficiently accurate for simulating the storm surge occasionally there are noticeable mismatches about 4 m s 1 in wind speed between the forcing and the observation e g at the peak of irene and one day afterwards day 32 33 in fig 2a and during the river flooding period day 42 5 in fig 2a these mismatches contribute to the uncertainties in the simulated water level the surface wind stress and heat exchange were calculated from the bulk aerodynamic model of zeng et al 1998 other parameterizations for surface stress e g from the bulk formulas of pond and pickard 1998 hwang 2018 or from the wave model ardhuin et al 2010 yielded similar results a major calibration parameter for surface elevation was the bottom friction although some information on bottom sediment composition was available and suggested different bottom characteristics in the lower and upper bay gebert and searfoss 2012 the total bed roughness that accounts for macro roughness such as bed form was not available and it is also expected to be temporally varying therefore the roughness used in the model was selected through calibration we used a bottom roughness of 0 5 mm in the ocean and the lower delaware bay and then transitioned it to 0 05 mm in the mid and upper bay along the main channel in upland areas 3 m above msl we used a uniform 1 mm roughness a bi harmonic viscosity was added to the horizontal momentum equation zhang et al 2016 to control the spurious inertial modes that often arise in large scale ug models le roux et al 2005 danilov 2012 in addition a laplacian viscosity in the form of shapiro filter shapiro 1970 zhang et al 2016 was locally added for the steep bathymetry fig 6 where spurious modes would otherwise be exacerbated by the pressure gradient errors the specified shapiro filter strength γ non dimensional zhang et al 2016 was a function of the local bathymetric slopes α non dimensional expressed as γ 0 5 tanh α α 0 where α 0 was a reference slope chosen as 0 5 in the current setup this led to a maximum filter strength of 0 5 for the steepest bathymetric slope horizontal diffusivity was not explicitly added because the 3rd order weno transport scheme used is essentially monotone ye et al 2019 in shallow waters with depths less than 5 m the 3rd order weno scheme was replaced by a 1st order but more efficient upwind scheme the vertical viscosity and diffusivity were calculated by the generic length scale model k kl umlauf and burchard 2003 the model was initialized from the hycom reanalysis product on july 27 2011 and run with a non split time step of 150 s in a fully implicit mode i e with implicitness factor of 1 an implicitness factor of 0 6 gives essentially the same results the boundary conditions b c for temperature salinity and the sub tidal components of the sea surface height ssh and horizontal velocity along the ocean boundary were also derived from hycom note that hycom used an unknown vertical datum and therefore the ssh was adjusted by 0 5 m based on the calibration results at a coastal gauge lewes de the tidal components of the b c for the elevation and barotropic velocity were then added using the fes2014 product carrere et al 2016 to prevent long term drift the tracer field salinity and temperature was relaxed to hycom results in a region within 1 from the ocean boundary with a maximum relaxation constant of 1 day the simulation period starts on july 27 2011 i e one month before irene s landfall on the us east coast one month was deemed sufficient for spin up because the initial conditions were from the fully dynamic conditions provided by the data assimilated hycom product cf zeng and he 2016 separate runs with an additional 30 day spin up led to essentially same results not shown the simulation covered 50 days that included the main surge and the subsequent river flooding events for the purpose of salinity validation we used another period in 1984 cf section 4 3 because salinity observation is unavailable during the irene period 3 3 2 coupling to nwm the freshwater delivery into the delaware bay was derived from the nwm i e a reanalysis product 10 10 url https registry opendata aws nwm archive last accessed in june 2019 from nwm v1 2 provided by the noaa team we first determined all nwm segments that intersected the schism land boundary and then the streamflow at each segment was then imposed in the adjacent schism elements as a point source for inflow segments or sink for outflow segments fig 7 implementation of volume and mass sources and sinks inside schism was rather straightforward via simple volume integrations in the finite element equations although we have only considered the one way coupling between nwm and schism so far the simplicity of this coupling strategy bodes well for the eventual two way coupling between the two models the effects of direct precipitation onto the schism model domain are not discussed in this paper and are left for a future study 3 4 sensitivity runs sensitivity runs were conducted to examine the importance of different processes including baroclinic response 3d barotropic processes wind wave effects etc table 1 shows the setups of important sensitivity runs used in this paper in the 3d barotropic run tracer transport was turned off and the baroclinic force from temperature and salinity gradient was excluded to assess the importance of 3d barotropic processes a 2d barotropic run was also included as explained in zheng et al 2013 both 2d and 3d models can simulate a storm surge well if bottom friction coefficients are properly adjusted in each model the near bottom velocities in 2d and 3d models differ by orders of magnitude so drag coefficients need to be adjusted accordingly to achieve comparable bottom stress which is one of the key controls for surges in general 3d baroclinic models should use a much smaller coefficient than 2d models because the former produce larger near bottom velocity inside stratified regions due to the two layer exchange flow this considerably complicates the inter comparison of 2d and 3d models zheng et al 2013 a key difference between the current and previous studies is that we calibrated the three configurations table 1 of the model separately to achieve best possible results in terms of overall mean absolute error or mae before the results were inter compared different choices of surface stress formulations time steps and other parameters were tested but the dominant control was found to be the bottom friction this approach largely removes the ambiguity of the bottom friction parameterizations used in each configuration and ensures that the findings in subsequent sections are not unduly influenced by parameter choices for the 2d model we used a uniform manning s n of 0 019 s m 1 3 for the 3d barotropic model the same roughness height as in the baseline was found to give best results wave effects are also important in nearshore regions kennedy et al 2012 guérin et al 2018 in particular wave breaking induces a setup near the shoreline and embayment and alters the mean circulation nearshore to examine this we included a run called base wave where the base model was fully coupled with the wind wave model wwm roland et al 2012 on the same horizontal grid the wave effect was incorporated into schism via the 3d vortex formalism of bennis et al 2011 as implemented and validated in guérin et al 2018 in addition the formulation of wave enhanced bottom boundary layer was from soulsby 1997 and the formulation of wave breaking induced turbulence followed that of craig and banner 1994 the wave model was initialized using a global hindcast product based on wwiii 11 11 url ftp ftp ifremer fr ifremer ww3 hindcast last accessed in june 2019 rascle and ardhuin 2013 and was also forced at the ocean boundary by the same product five variables significant wave height peak frequency mean wave period tm02 and direction and directional spread were extracted to construct wave spectra at the ocean boundary using the jonswap formula hasselmann et al 1973 wwm was run with the implicit mode and the coupling time step was set to be 600 s thirty six bins were used to resolve the directional and frequency domain 4 model validation in this section we first validate the baseline model using the observational datasets shown in section 2 2 the elevation skills at all noaa tide stations in the delaware bay are examined first followed by salinity inside the bay and sea surface temperature sst in the ocean the last two are important for the baroclinic processes 4 1 surface elevation the simulated total water levels generally agree well with the observations fig 8 the mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient cc averaged over all stations are 13 cm and 0 98 respectively larger errors are found at upstream stations most likely caused by a combination of model errors uncertainties errors in the dem and the nwm predicted flows cf fig 2 these uncertainties generally have more impact on the narrower and shallower channels in the upper bay than on the wider and deeper lower bay the average mae in the lower and mid bay first 5 stations is only 9 cm most interestingly even though the model has errors in predicting both the primary first surge around day 32 5 and the second surge around day 44 5 at the most upstream station newbold it correctly predicts that the second surge is higher than the first surge there fig 8 the observation suggests that the second surge is 5 cm vs 11 cm as suggested by the model higher than the first indicating very strong river influence in the upper delaware bay on the other hand this strong river influence also implies that the errors in nwm fig 2 explain part of the model errors a tidal harmonic analysis is also conducted on major tidal constituents including m 2 k 1 o 1 and n 2 fig 9 from day 10 to day 50 of the simulation period although this period includes flooding surge the model data comparison is still valid because the same period is applied to both model and data the baseline again shows good agreement with observation the average maes for the m 2 constituent which accounts for 93 of the total tidal energy of all stations are 4 0 cm in amplitude and 7 5 degree 15 5 min in phase the observed m 2 amplitude increases from the mouth to the mid bay and then slightly decreases around the mid bay from ship john shoal to reedy point see station locations in fig 3b and increases again into the upper bay this longitudinal variability is attributed to the balance between the funneling effects due to the trumpet shape of the channel and the bottom friction du et al 2018 but the meandering near reedy point further complicates the dynamics and leads to the local extrema in general the model captures this trend but has slightly larger errors near the mid bay extrema than elsewhere the model also tends to lag the observation at upper bay stations 4 2 sea surface temperature sst as explained by ezer 2013 2018 2019 gulf stream as a major western boundary current plays an important role in the coastal response to global sea level rise and tropical cyclones in particular the weakening of the gulf stream transport is often responsible for fair weather flooding events along mid atlantic bight mab coast to ensure that the baroclinic processes in the open ocean mainly controlled by temperature gradient are well captured by the baseline model the simulated sst is compared with a satellite derived product nasa s ghrsst level 4 g1sst during the passage of hurricane irene the gulf stream is greatly disturbed as evidenced by the fluctuations in its volume transport cf fig 17b the restoration of the coastal ocean takes several days ezer 2018 by sept 7 2011 the gulf stream is largely restored to its pre storm condition fig 10 schism qualitatively captures the restored sst condition with the free meandering north of cape hatteras slightly improved from that in hycom also apparent in both observation and model results is a cold wake in the middle of atlantic left by another storm hurricane katia also see the bottom left panel of fig 1 which did not land on the us east coast the complex eddies and meanders as shown in fig 10 cannot be reproduced by barotropic models and are responsible for setting up large surface slopes along the path of the gulf stream cf figs 18 and 19 which has implications for the rebounding water level inside the bay section 6 more detailed assessment of the model skill including the vertical structure of the gulf stream has been reported in ye et al 2019 4 3 salinity delaware bay is a weakly stratified estuary with a nearly linear axial salinity distribution garvine et al 1992 previously a multi model comparison for this system using the observational data collected during the 1984 hydrographic surveys has been shown in patchen 2007 during the surveys several stations reported salinity measurements three of which had data at more than one depth note that the measurements at different stations were collected at different time periods because of the lack of salinity measurements during irene we re ran the base model for the period in 1984 when intensive hydrographic surveys were conducted by noaa the model was initialized on april 2 1984 and run for 100 days the comparison shown in fig 11 indicates that the model is able to capture the salinity variation with an averaged mae of 0 86 psu overall as well as the larger stratification found in the mid bay therefore the model can capture the 3d density structure inside the bay which is important for simulating the baroclinic response the depth averaged salinity in the bay from the last 70 days of the model results is shown in fig 12 the pattern is qualitatively similar to that in whitney and garvine 2006 and shows clear lateral gradients between channel and shoal as discussed in garvine et al 1992 the lateral variation of salinity generally exceeds its weak vertical stratification which is one of the main reasons that the salt intrusion in the bay is relatively insensitive to the variations in the river inflow 5 wind wave effects to assess the wave effects on the water surface elevation we restarted the baseline simulation on august 21 2017 and ran the base wave table 1 model for 10 days we first validate the base wave model using the observation at two nearby ndbc buoys see locations in fig 3 the modeled significant wave heights and peak periods match the observation well fig 13 with the average maes being 24 cm for the significant wave height and 2 1 s for the peak period respectively during the storm large waves of relatively longer periods fig 13 entered the bay from the south and large wave breaking occurred near the steep bathymetric slopes near the entrance fig 14 the influence of the waves on the elevation inside the bay is shown in figs 14 and 15 the comparison of the model results with and without waves at the noaa stations shows mostly anemic differences that occur during the main surge fig 14ab the increase in the main surge due to the wave effects is less than 5 cm on the other hand large wave breaking occurs at some steep slopes near the bay entrance which in turn results in a larger impact on the surface elevation there up to 30 cm figs 14 and 15c e as shown in fig 14a the wave effects are mostly negligible 2 cm in the upper bay and in the watershed during hurricane irene 6 discussion on 3d effects and baroclinic adjustment 6 1 overall comparison for total water level the effects of including excluding 3d barotropic processes and 3d baroclinic effects are elucidated through a comparison among baseline 3d barotropic and 2d barotropic table 1 the error statistics from the three configurations are listed in table 2 the best overall skill is achieved by baseline larger differences are found during the adjustment period from day 45 to 50 a closer look at the time series of total elevation also indicates that the largest differences among the three runs occur during the post surge adjustment period fig 16bc besides the main surge that occurred around aug 28 a second surge mostly attributed to river flooding induced by tropical storm lee occurred around sept 8 during irene while all three configurations have produced the maximum surge well the baseline reproduces the observed water level fluctuations best on average especially during the rebounding phase after the peak surge fig 16b whereas the 2d barotropic run has the largest error for the rebounding phase similarly the baseline is best at sustaining the high water level during the river flooding phase especially at the upper bay stations e g philadelphia in fig 16c whereas the flood recedes too quickly in the other two configurations as shown in table 2 the difference between the maes of the two 3d configurations suggests that neglecting baroclinic effects increases the error in elevation by 14 during the adjustment period 6 2 role of large scale processes to examine the effects of large scale processes on the water level inside the bay we first look at the impact of the hurricane on these processes themselves the volume transports calculated from the three model runs at a coastal transect along the path of the hurricane are compared in fig 17 overall the volume transports calculated from the two barotropic runs are close to each other and are significantly lower but with larger fluctuations than that from the baseline baroclinic run these findings suggest that the baroclinic adjustment is significant in the coastal ocean which is consistent with the findings of ezer 2018 moreover the 3d barotropic effect is not negligible either which produces a mean absolute difference of 2 1 sv between the 3d and 2d barotropic runs or 19 of the latter s mean the differences are attributed to 3d barotropic processes e g ekman transport which have apparently led to the small differences in the elevations inside the bay between the two barotropic models as seen in fig 16 compared to the barotropic runs the smaller water level fluctuations found in the baseline run are attributed to the stabilizing effects of the large scale baroclinic processes the prevailing northward current in the gulf stream core has partially buffered the disruption caused by the passage of the hurricane the northward current is accompanied by a significant surface slope in the shelf seas due to geostrophic balance which is absent in the barotropic runs fig 18 the existence of the surface slope aids in accelerating the restoration after the passage of the storm as it works against the prevailing surface slope induced by the storm with higher elevation nearshore fig 18 as soon as the gulf stream restores to its pre storm condition day 37 fig 17 the accompanying surface slope works actively to sustain the high water level in the delaware bay fig 16c without the contribution from the gulf stream the elevations from the two barotropic runs show larger swings especially in the river flooding period fig 19 as compared to the baroclinic run as a result the largest discrepancies in the simulated bay elevations between baroclinic and barotropic runs are found in the adjustment period 6 3 baroclinic vs barotropic pressure gradients to quantify the importance of baroclinicity during and after the storm we compare the baroclinic pressure gradient force pgf with the barotropic pgf at three representative stations from the bay mouth to the ocean 1 3 in fig 3a the results from the baseline 3d baroclinic run are used to make these two forces comparable to each other the baroclinic pgf is depth averaged as f b c 1 h h η f b c z d z with f b c z g ρ 0 z η ρ d ζ where is the horizontal gradient operator x y g is gravity acceleration in m s 2 ρ is water density in kg m 3 ρ 0 is a reference water density in kg m 3 η is surface elevation in m h is the bathymetry in m h η h is the total water depth in m the barotropic pgf is denoted as f b t g η as shown in fig 20 the barotropic pgf is dominant near the delaware bay mouth at the height of hurricane irene day 32 station 1 in fig 20 barotropic pgf peaks while baroclinic pgf drops to a minimum confirming the dominance of the barotropic pgf in generating the main surge but after the passage of the storm day 33 station 1 in fig 20 the importance of baroclinicity increases considerably as it works actively to restore increase the water level the magnitude of the baroclinic pgf reaches up to 67 of the barotropic pgf during the subsequent restoration phase further offshore the baroclinic pgf becomes increasingly important as expected station 2 and 3 in fig 20 without the baroclinic gradient in the momentum equation the depth averaged velocities calculated from the two barotropic models are different from those from the baseline fig 21 at the two offshore stations the discrepancies among the three setups are obvious because the signals from the mab slope current and the gulf stream are absent in the two barotropic runs but even at the nearshore station the difference is up to 17 between 3d barotropic and baseline and 54 between 2d barotropic and baseline therefore the results here confirm the importance of baroclinicity during the restoration phase 6 4 computational performance we briefly remark on the relative efficiency of the three configurations the baseline model achieves a performance of 80 times faster than real time using 1440 cores of nasa s pleiades the 3d barotropic model runs 190 time faster than real time on 960 cores and the 2d barotropic model runs 230 time faster than real time on 72 cores therefore the 2d and 3d barotropic models are approximately 57 and 3 5 times faster than the baseline respectively 6 5 summary and future work the focus of the discussion is on the interaction between oceanic and estuarine processes the 3d baroclinic effects are shown to play an important role in the restoration phase on the other hand results for smaller scale hydrological and hydraulic processes in the watershed including backwater effect precipitation induced flash flooding etc are not discussed in this paper but will be the focus of a follow up paper 7 conclusion we have successfully applied a creek to ocean 3d baroclinic model to study the response of the delaware bay during and after hurricane irene 2011 a single unstructured grid was constructed to cover a large domain and provide high resolution in the bay to accurately simulate the riverine response the model was forced by the national water model at the landward boundary located at 10 m above sea level the model was shown to exhibit good skill in predicting the total water levels as well as the 3d density structure through comparison among the baseline 3d baroclinic model and sensitivity tests with a 3d barotropic and 2d barotropic model we examined the importance of baroclinicity during and after the storm including a subsequent river flooding period the largest differences in elevation were found during the post surge adjustment period that lasted more than 2 weeks the baroclinic model better captured the rebounding water level and the sustained high water level during the ensuing river flooding the difference was attributed to the stabilizing force provided by the large scale gulf stream therefore our results confirmed that the baroclinicity is a major driving force behind fair weather flooding events as suggested by ezer the coupled modeling system bridges a critical knowledge gap between the hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes and

23997,we present a creek to ocean 3d baroclinic model based on unstructured grids that aims to unite traditional hydrologic and ocean models in a single modeling platform by taking full advantage of the polymorphism i e a single model grid can seamlessly morph between full 3d 2dv 2dh and quasi 1d configurations using hurricane irene 2011 s impact on the delaware bay as an example a seamless 2d 3d model grid is implemented to include the entire us east coast and gulf of mexico with a highly resolved delaware bay down to 20 m resolution the model is forced by flows from a hydrological model national water model at the landward boundary we demonstrate the model s accuracy stability and robustness with the simulation of the storm surge and subsequent river flooding events and compound surges through a series of sensitivity tests we illustrate the importance of including in the simulation the baroclinic effects as provided by the large scale gulf stream in order to correctly capture the adjustment process following the main surge and the subsequent compound flooding events the baroclinicity can explain up to 14 of the elevation error during the adjustment phase after the storm keywords storm surge 3d model baroclinicity schism national water model delaware bay usa 1 introduction the catastrophic loss from floods world wide costs hundreds of billions of dollars each year including property damages and loss of lives blake 2007 the flood and inundation hazard due to either coastal storm surges or river flooding has been well studied using physical and statistical models wolf 2009 teng et al 2017 however a critical knowledge gap exists in the attempt to address the effects of compound flooding due to the combined effects of different flood sources in general three types of inundation processes are of concern to coastal communities coastal storm surge and inundation pluvial inundation precipitation driven flooding and fluvial inundation river flooding traditionally these processes have been studied separately using different types of models hydrodynamic models for storm surge and hydrological hydraulic models for pluvial fluvial flooding a hydrodynamic model generally excludes the watershed mostly because of the constraints induced by numerical stability and or computational cost whereas a hydrologic model s capability roughly stops at mean sea level msl because it is not designed for estuarine oceanic processes a plethora of models are available for these two types of simulations e g kerr et al 2013 chen et al 2013 sharma et al 2019 these models however often neglect the important interaction between coastal and inland processes such as the compound flooding and backflow effects the compound effects from the combination of all these processes including the 3d baroclinic effects have not been studied in detail before and are the subject of this study the issue of compound flooding has recently garnered a great deal of attention because of the increased concurrences of storms and heavy precipitation in coastal areas wahl et al 2015 for example during hurricane harvey 2017 galveston bay received freshwater inputs of approximately three times the bay s volume du and park 2019 causing catastrophic flooding along the texas coast as the climate warms many of the climate models predict increasing occurrences of such wet storms in the coming decades knutson et al 2010 which sets the perfect conditions for compound flooding this trend highlights the urgency of understanding the detailed mechanism of compound flooding to accurately forecast its impact for effective mitigation and planning to this end national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has initiated the noaa water initiative 1 1 url https

that includes signals propagating up and downstream in coastal estuarine and riverine environments particularly during storm events the goal is to establish an integrated water forecasting system that

water noaa gov about nwm last accessed in july 2019 or nwm to holistically simulate the total water level and its individual components the flexibility and robustness of schism are indispensable for traversing large contrasts of temporal and spatial scales from oceanic processes such as the gulf stream to inland flooding in small creeks in doing so we have built a very reconfigurable and flexible modeling platform that can be extended to cover a larger domain with sufficient resolution in the areas of interest effort is on going to extend the current model to cover all major estuaries and bays in the us east coast and gulf of mexico in this study we focus on the importance of including the 3d effects in the storm surge simulations the model is first validated using observational data derived from noaa usgs and satellite products sensitivity tests are then conducted to examine the importance of 3d effects in particular the baroclinicity minato 1998 was among the first to elucidate the implication of incorporating 3d effects in simulating storm surges and he gave a simple explanation on why finer vertical resolution led to higher surges in tosa bay japan zheng et al 2013 compared results from 2d and 3d barotropic models for the storm surges in the gulf of mexico and showed that both models can adequately simulate the surge provided that the bottom frictions were properly calibrated li et al 2006 and cho et al 2012 studied the impact of hurricane floyd 1999 and isabel 2003 in the chesapeake bay using 3d baroclinic models but did not explicitly expound the influence of baroclinicity on surface elevation partly because of the small model domain used orton et al 2012 used a 3d baroclinic model on a small domain to simulate storm surges near new york city and estimated that neglecting water density variations led to typical reductions of 1 13 in the peak surge but as suggested by zheng et al 2013 these numbers are highly sensitive to the choices of bottom friction in addition the exclusion of large scale baroclinic processes such as the gulf stream led to additional uncertainties in their model therefore the impact of 3d baroclinic effects on storm surge needs to be further assessed one of the key differences between the current study and previous studies is that we compare the best calibrated results from different configurations 2d 3d barotropic and 3d baroclinic by adjusting model parameters independently to achieve best possible results under each configuration this ascertains that the differences are not due to calibration issues or of numerical origin our results from numerous sensitivity tests indicate that the 3d baroclinic effects do not significantly alter the main surge as the latter is mostly governed by large scale barotropic processes but play an important role in the restoration process afterward mainly through the large scale oceanic response as found in the gulf stream results from sensitivity tests clearly indicate that the restoration process in the water surface elevation rebounding waves cannot be properly captured by barotropic models the importance of the gulf stream on coastal inundation has been reported recently by ezer 2013 2018 but the focus there was on the remote connection between storms and coastal flooding far away from the storm path our results provide direct evidence on the importance of including the baroclinic oceanic response in storm surge simulations for bays and estuaries in what follows section 2 briefly describes the hurricane event irene 2011 used in this study as well as available observational data collected by multiple agencies section 3 presents the details of our model setups including the baseline simulation using a 3d baroclinic configuration as well as other sensitivity simulations section 4 presents the validation of the baseline setup for surface elevation salinity and temperature section 5 discusses the effects from wind waves then in section 6 we use results from sensitivity experiments to elucidate the effects from 3d processes including baroclinicity highlighting the stabilization effect of the gulf stream in the restoration process after the storm a summary is given in section 7 2 study case 2 1 hurricane irene 2011 hurricane irene the first major atlantic hurricane in 2011 was selected here as a case study the hurricane made its landfall along the us east coast at outer bank nc on aug 27 2011 as a category 1 hurricane the hurricane re entered atlantic coastal waters in virginia delaware and new jersey and weakened to a tropical storm before making the second landfall in new jersey and the third landfall in new york city as seen from the weather maps fig 1 while there was only one major wind event related to irene there were two large precipitation events associated with irene and the subsequent tropical storm lee the latter originated from gulf of mexico and swept over land over eastern states these events led to two streamflow peaks in delaware bay s largest tributary the delaware river fig 2b the first peak flow of about 4000 m3 s 1 occurred on aug 28 2011 around the landfall of irene the second peak about 1500 m3 s 1 higher than the first occurred 10 days later under tropical storm lee 2011 mainly resulting from the precipitation and the subsequent pluvial fluvial processes rather than a storm surge the streamflow of the second largest tributary the schuylkill river exhibits similar patterns fig 2b the different flood origins ocean and inland made this event an ideal test for compound flood

hybrid finite element finite volume method and hybrid triangular quadrangular ugs in the horizontal and hybrid localized sigma coordinates with shaved cells lsc2 grid in the vertical zhang et al 2015 2016 the model uses a semi implicit time stepping scheme to enhance robustness and efficiency and the numerical dissipation is kept low with a judicious combination of higher order monotone schemes ye et al 2018 2019 and the semi implicit finite element formulation a schism based regional model has been developed which covers the northwest atlantic ocean the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea fig 3a the large spatial domain used here accommodates different storm paths that make landfalls in this region and includes the path of the most important western boundary current in this region the gulf stream in order to study its baroclinic responses during storms ezer 2018 2019 the focus site in this pilot study is the delaware bay which is a major estuary on the u s east coast tidal portions of the delaware river start at trenton new jersey and the total length of the estuary from trenton to the mouth is 210 km the total terrestrial drainage of the estuary is 4 2 104 km2 sharp 1983 a key characteristic of the estuary as far as the tides are concerned is that it constricts rapidly from the widest point in the lower bay near the noaa station brandywine fig 3b to the mid bay the funneling effect from width variation leads to a hypersynchronous system with tides generally increasing landward friedrichs 2010 but the channel meandering in the mid bay near the noaa station reedy point fig 3b considerably complicates the dynamics there section 4 1 the bay is mostly shallow with a mean depth of 7 m harleman 1966 the delaware river provides 58 of the freshwater inflow the confluence of the schuylkill river below philadelphia adds another 14 other tributaries collectively account for the remaining 28 sharp 1983 the average freshwater inflow is 570 m3 s 1 with high flow conditions occurring during the spring freshets whitney and garvine 2006 even under peak freshwater inflow the estuary is vertically mixed by the tides most of time wong 1995 the freshwater outflow from the bay is generally weak the plume is typically in contact with the frictional bottom boundary layer and confined within 20 km offshore under normal conditions münchow and garvine 1993 wong and münchow 1995 yankovsky and chapman 1997 the model domain includes a part of the delaware bay watershed up to the 10 m isobath above mean sea level msl in the delaware river the largest tributary of the delaware bay the domain extends to the usgs gauge of riegelsville fig 3b at 40 m above msl such a domain choice requires that the model directly simulates some pluvial and fluvial processes normally handled by hydrological models the bathymetry information fig 3 is derived from two dem digital elevation model sources the global relief model etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 for the ocean and the 1 m usgs coastal national elevation database danielson et al 2018 for the delaware bay the inclusion of a large portion of delaware bay watershed complicates the use of a curved vertical datum such as ngvd29 and therefore the model is based on a flat datum of navd88 the latter is convenient because 1 the usgs dem is given in navd88 2 most new instruments use this datum accordingly all model data comparisons on elevation are also based on navd88 a datum conversion from navd88 to ngvd29 e g using the vdatum 7 7 url https vdatum noaa gov last accessed in june 2019 tool which itself relies on model simulation would introduce uncertainties especially in the upper bay near the fall line so we choose to rely on observation instead among the nine noaa tide stations used fig 3b the differences between the local msls and the navd88 datum are available at three stations the lower bay station lewes 0 121 m i e the local msl is below the navd88 datum the mid bay station reedy point 0 015 m and the upper bay station philadelphia 0 118 m as shown later section 4 1 the model is able to correctly set up the surface slope with the local msl asymptotically increasing toward upper bay as observed the datum differences between msl and navd88 at the three stations are linearly interpolated onto other stations based on the along thalweg distance with linear extrapolation for berlington and newbold which are up estuary from philadelphia this procedure is expected to introduce uncertainties on the order of a few centimeters in the model data comparison of elevation 3 2 grid generation one of the key steps and challenges in ug modeling is the grid generation the stability and robustness of schism greatly simplifies the grid generation process effort is mostly focused on resolving key bathymetric and geometric features without worrying about computational cost or numerical instability courtesy of the implicit scheme used furthermore polymorphism allows a very faithful representation of the underlying bathymetry and topography without the need for any smoothing as required by many other terrain following coordinate models zhang et al 2016 as explained in ye et al 2018 bathymetry smoothing in an estuarine regime should be avoided because it alters fundamental aspects of estuarine circulation such as salt intrusion channel shoal contrast and the related lateral circulation the grid generation software sms surface water modeling system 8 8 url https aquaveo com last accessed in june 2019 was used to generate the horizontal grid the horizontal spatial domain was discretized by an ug with 667 k nodes and 1273 k elements including 39 k quadrangular elements used to represent the shipping channel fig 4 a quasi uniform triangular grid with a resolution of 6 7 km was applied in the open ocean which was smoothly transitioned to about 2 km resolution near the coastline locally high resolution was applied in the delaware bay with a typical resolution of 600 m in the lower bay channel 50 m in the upper bay channel 150 m in the watershed areas above msl and down to 20 m in some small creeks during the grid generation process feature arcs fig 4a were used mainly to 1 explicitly incorporate features such as the nwm segments into schism s horizontal grid red arcs in fig 4b 2 align the quadrilateral elements with main channels thus resembling a structured grid locally black arcs in fig 4b after the grid was generated the dems were linearly interpolated onto the computational grid without any bathymetry smoothing the vertical discretization used in the model took full advantage of the hybrid terrain following like lsc2 coordinate zhang et al 2015 with variable number of layers at different horizontal locations the average number of layers was 18 3 with a maximum of 44 layers in the deepest ocean and only 1 layer in shallow areas with depths less than 0 5 m fig 5 as a result 2d representation was applied for about 57 of the delaware bay watershed or 30 of the total grid elements an element was deemed wet when the local water depth calculated from the implicit finite element solver exceeded 10 6 m such a small threshold was needed to accurately capture the very thin layer of fluid initially formed on dry land during precipitation events a smaller value 10 8 does not significantly change the results the model was stable even with this choice of small threshold for wetting and drying courtesy of the implicit scheme because the vertical flow structure can be safely ignored for the pluvial and inundation processes the single layer configuration greatly reduced the computational cost and meanwhile enhanced the robustness of the model zhang et al 2016 3 3 baseline model setup 3 3 1 forcing and parameters the baseline setup used a 3d baroclinic model wave effects were excluded in the baseline model but examined in subsequent sensitivity analysis section 5 atmospheric forcing applied at the air sea interface consisted of two sources the first source was derived from ecwmf s era5 reanalysis dataset 9 9 url https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era5 last accessed in june 2019 and the variables included air temperature air pressure reduced to msl humidity wind speed and direction at 10 m above msl downward short wave and long wave radiations and precipitation rate this product has a spatial resolution of 30 km and temporal resolution of 1 h the second source was a high resolution product from ecmwf with a spatial resolution of 5 km magnusson et al 2014 the comparison shown in fig 2 suggests that the atmospheric forcing used in the model is sufficiently accurate for simulating the storm surge occasionally there are noticeable mismatches about 4 m s 1 in wind speed between the forcing and the observation e g at the peak of irene and one day afterwards day 32 33 in fig 2a and during the river flooding period day 42 5 in fig 2a these mismatches contribute to the uncertainties in the simulated water level the surface wind stress and heat exchange were calculated from the bulk aerodynamic model of zeng et al 1998 other parameterizations for surface stress e g from the bulk formulas of pond and pickard 1998 hwang 2018 or from the wave model ardhuin et al 2010 yielded similar results a major calibration parameter for surface elevation was the bottom friction although some information on bottom sediment composition was available and suggested different bottom characteristics in the lower and upper bay gebert and searfoss 2012 the total bed roughness that accounts for macro roughness such as bed form was not available and it is also expected to be temporally varying therefore the roughness used in the model was selected through calibration we used a bottom roughness of 0 5 mm in the ocean and the lower delaware bay and then transitioned it to 0 05 mm in the mid and upper bay along the main channel in upland areas 3 m above msl we used a uniform 1 mm roughness a bi harmonic viscosity was added to the horizontal momentum equation zhang et al 2016 to control the spurious inertial modes that often arise in large scale ug models le roux et al 2005 danilov 2012 in addition a laplacian viscosity in the form of shapiro filter shapiro 1970 zhang et al 2016 was locally added for the steep bathymetry fig 6 where spurious modes would otherwise be exacerbated by the pressure gradient errors the specified shapiro filter strength γ non dimensional zhang et al 2016 was a function of the local bathymetric slopes α non dimensional expressed as γ 0 5 tanh α α 0 where α 0 was a reference slope chosen as 0 5 in the current setup this led to a maximum filter strength of 0 5 for the steepest bathymetric slope horizontal diffusivity was not explicitly added because the 3rd order weno transport scheme used is essentially monotone ye et al 2019 in shallow waters with depths less than 5 m the 3rd order weno scheme was replaced by a 1st order but more efficient upwind scheme the vertical viscosity and diffusivity were calculated by the generic length scale model k kl umlauf and burchard 2003 the model was initialized from the hycom reanalysis product on july 27 2011 and run with a non split time step of 150 s in a fully implicit mode i e with implicitness factor of 1 an implicitness factor of 0 6 gives essentially the same results the boundary conditions b c for temperature salinity and the sub tidal components of the sea surface height ssh and horizontal velocity along the ocean boundary were also derived from hycom note that hycom used an unknown vertical datum and therefore the ssh was adjusted by 0 5 m based on the calibration results at a coastal gauge lewes de the tidal components of the b c for the elevation and barotropic velocity were then added using the fes2014 product carrere et al 2016 to prevent long term drift the tracer field salinity and temperature was relaxed to hycom results in a region within 1 from the ocean boundary with a maximum relaxation constant of 1 day the simulation period starts on july 27 2011 i e one month before irene s landfall on the us east coast one month was deemed sufficient for spin up because the initial conditions were from the fully dynamic conditions provided by the data assimilated hycom product cf zeng and he 2016 separate runs with an additional 30 day spin up led to essentially same results not shown the simulation covered 50 days that included the main surge and the subsequent river flooding events for the purpose of salinity validation we used another period in 1984 cf section 4 3 because salinity observation is unavailable during the irene period 3 3 2 coupling to nwm the freshwater delivery into the delaware bay was derived from the nwm i e a reanalysis product 10 10 url https registry opendata aws nwm archive last accessed in june 2019 from nwm v1 2 provided by the noaa team we first determined all nwm segments that intersected the schism land boundary and then the streamflow at each segment was then imposed in the adjacent schism elements as a point source for inflow segments or sink for outflow segments fig 7 implementation of volume and mass sources and sinks inside schism was rather straightforward via simple volume integrations in the finite element equations although we have only considered the one way coupling between nwm and schism so far the simplicity of this coupling strategy bodes well for the eventual two way coupling between the two models the effects of direct precipitation onto the schism model domain are not discussed in this paper and are left for a future study 3 4 sensitivity runs sensitivity runs were conducted to examine the importance of different processes including baroclinic response 3d barotropic processes wind wave effects etc table 1 shows the setups of important sensitivity runs used in this paper in the 3d barotropic run tracer transport was turned off and the baroclinic force from temperature and salinity gradient was excluded to assess the importance of 3d barotropic processes a 2d barotropic run was also included as explained in zheng et al 2013 both 2d and 3d models can simulate a storm surge well if bottom friction coefficients are properly adjusted in each model the near bottom velocities in 2d and 3d models differ by orders of magnitude so drag coefficients need to be adjusted accordingly to achieve comparable bottom stress which is one of the key controls for surges in general 3d baroclinic models should use a much smaller coefficient than 2d models because the former produce larger near bottom velocity inside stratified regions due to the two layer exchange flow this considerably complicates the inter comparison of 2d and 3d models zheng et al 2013 a key difference between the current and previous studies is that we calibrated the three configurations table 1 of the model separately to achieve best possible results in terms of overall mean absolute error or mae before the results were inter compared different choices of surface stress formulations time steps and other parameters were tested but the dominant control was found to be the bottom friction this approach largely removes the ambiguity of the bottom friction parameterizations used in each configuration and ensures that the findings in subsequent sections are not unduly influenced by parameter choices for the 2d model we used a uniform manning s n of 0 019 s m 1 3 for the 3d barotropic model the same roughness height as in the baseline was found to give best results wave effects are also important in nearshore regions kennedy et al 2012 guérin et al 2018 in particular wave breaking induces a setup near the shoreline and embayment and alters the mean circulation nearshore to examine this we included a run called base wave where the base model was fully coupled with the wind wave model wwm roland et al 2012 on the same horizontal grid the wave effect was incorporated into schism via the 3d vortex formalism of bennis et al 2011 as implemented and validated in guérin et al 2018 in addition the formulation of wave enhanced bottom boundary layer was from soulsby 1997 and the formulation of wave breaking induced turbulence followed that of craig and banner 1994 the wave model was initialized using a global hindcast product based on wwiii 11 11 url ftp ftp ifremer fr ifremer ww3 hindcast last accessed in june 2019 rascle and ardhuin 2013 and was also forced at the ocean boundary by the same product five variables significant wave height peak frequency mean wave period tm02 and direction and directional spread were extracted to construct wave spectra at the ocean boundary using the jonswap formula hasselmann et al 1973 wwm was run with the implicit mode and the coupling time step was set to be 600 s thirty six bins were used to resolve the directional and frequency domain 4 model validation in this section we first validate the baseline model using the observational datasets shown in section 2 2 the elevation skills at all noaa tide stations in the delaware bay are examined first followed by salinity inside the bay and sea surface temperature sst in the ocean the last two are important for the baroclinic processes 4 1 surface elevation the simulated total water levels generally agree well with the observations fig 8 the mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient cc averaged over all stations are 13 cm and 0 98 respectively larger errors are found at upstream stations most likely caused by a combination of model errors uncertainties errors in the dem and the nwm predicted flows cf fig 2 these uncertainties generally have more impact on the narrower and shallower channels in the upper bay than on the wider and deeper lower bay the average mae in the lower and mid bay first 5 stations is only 9 cm most interestingly even though the model has errors in predicting both the primary first surge around day 32 5 and the second surge around day 44 5 at the most upstream station newbold it correctly predicts that the second surge is higher than the first surge there fig 8 the observation suggests that the second surge is 5 cm vs 11 cm as suggested by the model higher than the first indicating very strong river influence in the upper delaware bay on the other hand this strong river influence also implies that the errors in nwm fig 2 explain part of the model errors a tidal harmonic analysis is also conducted on major tidal constituents including m 2 k 1 o 1 and n 2 fig 9 from day 10 to day 50 of the simulation period although this period includes flooding surge the model data comparison is still valid because the same period is applied to both model and data the baseline again shows good agreement with observation the average maes for the m 2 constituent which accounts for 93 of the total tidal energy of all stations are 4 0 cm in amplitude and 7 5 degree 15 5 min in phase the observed m 2 amplitude increases from the mouth to the mid bay and then slightly decreases around the mid bay from ship john shoal to reedy point see station locations in fig 3b and increases again into the upper bay this longitudinal variability is attributed to the balance between the funneling effects due to the trumpet shape of the channel and the bottom friction du et al 2018 but the meandering near reedy point further complicates the dynamics and leads to the local extrema in general the model captures this trend but has slightly larger errors near the mid bay extrema than elsewhere the model also tends to lag the observation at upper bay stations 4 2 sea surface temperature sst as explained by ezer 2013 2018 2019 gulf stream as a major western boundary current plays an important role in the coastal response to global sea level rise and tropical cyclones in particular the weakening of the gulf stream transport is often responsible for fair weather flooding events along mid atlantic bight mab coast to ensure that the baroclinic processes in the open ocean mainly controlled by temperature gradient are well captured by the baseline model the simulated sst is compared with a satellite derived product nasa s ghrsst level 4 g1sst during the passage of hurricane irene the gulf stream is greatly disturbed as evidenced by the fluctuations in its volume transport cf fig 17b the restoration of the coastal ocean takes several days ezer 2018 by sept 7 2011 the gulf stream is largely restored to its pre storm condition fig 10 schism qualitatively captures the restored sst condition with the free meandering north of cape hatteras slightly improved from that in hycom also apparent in both observation and model results is a cold wake in the middle of atlantic left by another storm hurricane katia also see the bottom left panel of fig 1 which did not land on the us east coast the complex eddies and meanders as shown in fig 10 cannot be reproduced by barotropic models and are responsible for setting up large surface slopes along the path of the gulf stream cf figs 18 and 19 which has implications for the rebounding water level inside the bay section 6 more detailed assessment of the model skill including the vertical structure of the gulf stream has been reported in ye et al 2019 4 3 salinity delaware bay is a weakly stratified estuary with a nearly linear axial salinity distribution garvine et al 1992 previously a multi model comparison for this system using the observational data collected during the 1984 hydrographic surveys has been shown in patchen 2007 during the surveys several stations reported salinity measurements three of which had data at more than one depth note that the measurements at different stations were collected at different time periods because of the lack of salinity measurements during irene we re ran the base model for the period in 1984 when intensive hydrographic surveys were conducted by noaa the model was initialized on april 2 1984 and run for 100 days the comparison shown in fig 11 indicates that the model is able to capture the salinity variation with an averaged mae of 0 86 psu overall as well as the larger stratification found in the mid bay therefore the model can capture the 3d density structure inside the bay which is important for simulating the baroclinic response the depth averaged salinity in the bay from the last 70 days of the model results is shown in fig 12 the pattern is qualitatively similar to that in whitney and garvine 2006 and shows clear lateral gradients between channel and shoal as discussed in garvine et al 1992 the lateral variation of salinity generally exceeds its weak vertical stratification which is one of the main reasons that the salt intrusion in the bay is relatively insensitive to the variations in the river inflow 5 wind wave effects to assess the wave effects on the water surface elevation we restarted the baseline simulation on august 21 2017 and ran the base wave table 1 model for 10 days we first validate the base wave model using the observation at two nearby ndbc buoys see locations in fig 3 the modeled significant wave heights and peak periods match the observation well fig 13 with the average maes being 24 cm for the significant wave height and 2 1 s for the peak period respectively during the storm large waves of relatively longer periods fig 13 entered the bay from the south and large wave breaking occurred near the steep bathymetric slopes near the entrance fig 14 the influence of the waves on the elevation inside the bay is shown in figs 14 and 15 the comparison of the model results with and without waves at the noaa stations shows mostly anemic differences that occur during the main surge fig 14ab the increase in the main surge due to the wave effects is less than 5 cm on the other hand large wave breaking occurs at some steep slopes near the bay entrance which in turn results in a larger impact on the surface elevation there up to 30 cm figs 14 and 15c e as shown in fig 14a the wave effects are mostly negligible 2 cm in the upper bay and in the watershed during hurricane irene 6 discussion on 3d effects and baroclinic adjustment 6 1 overall comparison for total water level the effects of including excluding 3d barotropic processes and 3d baroclinic effects are elucidated through a comparison among baseline 3d barotropic and 2d barotropic table 1 the error statistics from the three configurations are listed in table 2 the best overall skill is achieved by baseline larger differences are found during the adjustment period from day 45 to 50 a closer look at the time series of total elevation also indicates that the largest differences among the three runs occur during the post surge adjustment period fig 16bc besides the main surge that occurred around aug 28 a second surge mostly attributed to river flooding induced by tropical storm lee occurred around sept 8 during irene while all three configurations have produced the maximum surge well the baseline reproduces the observed water level fluctuations best on average especially during the rebounding phase after the peak surge fig 16b whereas the 2d barotropic run has the largest error for the rebounding phase similarly the baseline is best at sustaining the high water level during the river flooding phase especially at the upper bay stations e g philadelphia in fig 16c whereas the flood recedes too quickly in the other two configurations as shown in table 2 the difference between the maes of the two 3d configurations suggests that neglecting baroclinic effects increases the error in elevation by 14 during the adjustment period 6 2 role of large scale processes to examine the effects of large scale processes on the water level inside the bay we first look at the impact of the hurricane on these processes themselves the volume transports calculated from the three model runs at a coastal transect along the path of the hurricane are compared in fig 17 overall the volume transports calculated from the two barotropic runs are close to each other and are significantly lower but with larger fluctuations than that from the baseline baroclinic run these findings suggest that the baroclinic adjustment is significant in the coastal ocean which is consistent with the findings of ezer 2018 moreover the 3d barotropic effect is not negligible either which produces a mean absolute difference of 2 1 sv between the 3d and 2d barotropic runs or 19 of the latter s mean the differences are attributed to 3d barotropic processes e g ekman transport which have apparently led to the small differences in the elevations inside the bay between the two barotropic models as seen in fig 16 compared to the barotropic runs the smaller water level fluctuations found in the baseline run are attributed to the stabilizing effects of the large scale baroclinic processes the prevailing northward current in the gulf stream core has partially buffered the disruption caused by the passage of the hurricane the northward current is accompanied by a significant surface slope in the shelf seas due to geostrophic balance which is absent in the barotropic runs fig 18 the existence of the surface slope aids in accelerating the restoration after the passage of the storm as it works against the prevailing surface slope induced by the storm with higher elevation nearshore fig 18 as soon as the gulf stream restores to its pre storm condition day 37 fig 17 the accompanying surface slope works actively to sustain the high water level in the delaware bay fig 16c without the contribution from the gulf stream the elevations from the two barotropic runs show larger swings especially in the river flooding period fig 19 as compared to the baroclinic run as a result the largest discrepancies in the simulated bay elevations between baroclinic and barotropic runs are found in the adjustment period 6 3 baroclinic vs barotropic pressure gradients to quantify the importance of baroclinicity during and after the storm we compare the baroclinic pressure gradient force pgf with the barotropic pgf at three representative stations from the bay mouth to the ocean 1 3 in fig 3a the results from the baseline 3d baroclinic run are used to make these two forces comparable to each other the baroclinic pgf is depth averaged as f b c 1 h h η f b c z d z with f b c z g ρ 0 z η ρ d ζ where is the horizontal gradient operator x y g is gravity acceleration in m s 2 ρ is water density in kg m 3 ρ 0 is a reference water density in kg m 3 η is surface elevation in m h is the bathymetry in m h η h is the total water depth in m the barotropic pgf is denoted as f b t g η as shown in fig 20 the barotropic pgf is dominant near the delaware bay mouth at the height of hurricane irene day 32 station 1 in fig 20 barotropic pgf peaks while baroclinic pgf drops to a minimum confirming the dominance of the barotropic pgf in generating the main surge but after the passage of the storm day 33 station 1 in fig 20 the importance of baroclinicity increases considerably as it works actively to restore increase the water level the magnitude of the baroclinic pgf reaches up to 67 of the barotropic pgf during the subsequent restoration phase further offshore the baroclinic pgf becomes increasingly important as expected station 2 and 3 in fig 20 without the baroclinic gradient in the momentum equation the depth averaged velocities calculated from the two barotropic models are different from those from the baseline fig 21 at the two offshore stations the discrepancies among the three setups are obvious because the signals from the mab slope current and the gulf stream are absent in the two barotropic runs but even at the nearshore station the difference is up to 17 between 3d barotropic and baseline and 54 between 2d barotropic and baseline therefore the results here confirm the importance of baroclinicity during the restoration phase 6 4 computational performance we briefly remark on the relative efficiency of the three configurations the baseline model achieves a performance of 80 times faster than real time using 1440 cores of nasa s pleiades the 3d barotropic model runs 190 time faster than real time on 960 cores and the 2d barotropic model runs 230 time faster than real time on 72 cores therefore the 2d and 3d barotropic models are approximately 57 and 3 5 times faster than the baseline respectively 6 5 summary and future work the focus of the discussion is on the interaction between oceanic and estuarine processes the 3d baroclinic effects are shown to play an important role in the restoration phase on the other hand results for smaller scale hydrological and hydraulic processes in the watershed including backwater effect precipitation induced flash flooding etc are not discussed in this paper but will be the focus of a follow up paper 7 conclusion we have successfully applied a creek to ocean 3d baroclinic model to study the response of the delaware bay during and after hurricane irene 2011 a single unstructured grid was constructed to cover a large domain and provide high resolution in the bay to accurately simulate the riverine response the model was forced by the national water model at the landward boundary located at 10 m above sea level the model was shown to exhibit good skill in predicting the total water levels as well as the 3d density structure through comparison among the baseline 3d baroclinic model and sensitivity tests with a 3d barotropic and 2d barotropic model we examined the importance of baroclinicity during and after the storm including a subsequent river flooding period the largest differences in elevation were found during the post surge adjustment period that lasted more than 2 weeks the baroclinic model better captured the rebounding water level and the sustained high water level during the ensuing river flooding the difference was attributed to the stabilizing force provided by the large scale gulf stream therefore our results confirmed that the baroclinicity is a major driving force behind fair weather flooding events as suggested by ezer the coupled modeling system bridges a critical knowledge gap between the hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes and greatly simplifies the eventual two way coupling between the two types of models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

23998,rapidly melting sea ice processes during the summer tend to enlarge the open water in the arctic region the resulting larger potential fetch for surface waves can allow significant wave generation and development in the region the sea ice plays an energy dissipation role for waves propagating into the ice covered sea a spherical coordinate surface wave model was established within the unstructured grid finite volume community ocean model fvcom to examine the influence of ice induced wave attenuation on waves propagating into the ice in the arctic ocean ice induced wave attenuation parameterizations were implemented with an effective methodology to reduce numerical dissipation during the energy advection in geographic space wave partition and source tracking methods were added to distinguish the windsea and swell as well as to backtrack swell waves to their sources the model simulated significant wave heights and peak periods were compared with available buoy and jason 2 satellite measurements results from a process oriented model show that simulations of the surface waves in the arctic region are improved when ice induced attenuation is included in the model system an empirical method is used to statistically estimate wave induced ice breakage based on the wave induced internal ice strain as waves penetrate into the ice zone the simulation results support the ice retreat wave growth positive feedback mechanism keywords arctic ocean wave attenuation ice breakage ocean modeling positive feedback 1 introduction the arctic ocean fig 1 has been in a rapidly changing phase since the latter half of the 20th century stephenson et al 2011 comiso 2006 comiso et al 2008 the sea ice extent in the summer through fall has decreased at an average rate of about 3 8 10 5 km2 per decade since 1978 cavalieri et al 2003 meier et al 2005 the minimum ice extent in september was 7 2 10 6 km2 in 1979 and dropped to 4 7 10 6 km2 in 2018 with an extremely low coverage of 4 3 106 km 2 in 2007 and an even lower coverage of 3 6 10 6 km2 in 2012 this trend toward a larger summer open water area in the arctic ocean has produced potentially enlarged fetches for the growth of wind induced surface waves as a result wave ice interactions have become a dynamically important process not only for the breaking of ice floes and the melting of ice but also for wave generation propagation and dispersion in the arctic basin and coastal regions squire et al 2009 williams et al 2013b to our knowledge there have been few studies done on wave ice interactions in the arctic ocean kohout et al 2014 compared the change of the significant wave heights with the variation of the ice edge latitude in the antarctic sea and found that the ice retreat correlated well with the development of the waves compared with the southern ocean the arctic ocean is quite different because the maximum fetch for wave growth is limited although maximum fetches for wave growth in the norwegian sea barents sea and greenland sea have remained essentially unchanged the fetches have become larger in the pacific pan arctic region collins et al 2015 moreover winds have also changed slightly during the period of 1971 2013 from june through september the winds have intensified by only 0 1 0 3 per year whereas the average significant wave height grew by 3 0 4 1 per year and the averaged peak period increased by 0 5 0 8 per year wang et al 2015 as a result of the ice retreat the enlarged maximum potential fetch favors increased wave growth in the pacific pan arctic region and thus increased wave generation and propagation in the arctic ocean the recent sea state boundary layer experiment by thomson et al 2016 http www apl washington edu project project php id arctic sea state produced a new dataset for wave ice interaction studies this dataset provides the basis for a new set of model studies the arctic has limited monitoring sites for surface waves due to severe natural conditions and difficulties in deploying and maintaining instruments to measure waves in the miz numerical wave models have become a popular tool to examine the ice wave interactions in the arctic ocean there are only a few such wave models that cover the partial or entire arctic ocean one example is the global noaa wavewatch iii nwwiii which has a computational domain bounded by 77 s 77 n and is configured on a structured spherical rectangular grid with a 1 2 5 1 00 horizontal resolution tolman et al 2002 tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 this model has been placed into 24 7 forecast operations as an ensemble system driven by the operational global data assimilation scheme gdas and the aviation cycle of the medium range forecast model http polar ncep noaa gov waves implementations shtml tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 thomson and rogers 2014 a second example is the 1979 2009 noaa cfsr wave hindcast product wavewatch iii 30 year hindcast phase 2 it has included global and arctic ocean curvilinear grids with the horizontal resolutions of 30 and 15 mins respectively https polar ncep noaa gov waves hindcasts nopp phase2 php thirdly the european center for medium range weather forecasting wave model named ecwam was configured to cover the entire arctic ocean with the inclusion of the north pole bidlot 2012 ecmwf 2014 li and saulter 2014 made a multi resolution implementation of wwiii for the entire arctic ocean using a spherical multiple cell smc grid this model was designed to relax the cfl restriction of the eulerian advection time step at high latitudes by merging the conventional latitude longitude grid cells their approach was also designed to overcome the north pole singularity issue similar works were also done recently casas prat et al 2018 conducted a cmip5 based global wave climate projections in addition to the global scale wwiii model there are several regional wave models established for the arctic ocean or adjacent coastal areas one example is the wwiii based alaskan waters model with a computational domain covering a portion of the bering sea alaska coast and the beaufort sea chao et al 2004 various theories and observation based methods such as the scattering viscous and mass loading models have been proposed to simulate wave evolution and dissipation in the ice covered sea peters 1950 keller and weitz 1953 shapiro and simpson 1953 wadhams et al 1986 weber 1987 liu and mollo christensen 1988 liu et al 1991 squire et al 1995 perrie and hu 1996 meylan and masson 2006 dumont et al 2011a b doble and bidlot 2013 williams et al 2013a b li et al 2015 the basic difference among these methods is the manner in which the ice field is defined one approach follows a scattering method formulation in which the ice field is treated as individual ice floes with the inclusion of wave energy attenuation reflection and transmission an alternate approach which is valid for different sea ice situations is to consider the ice as a continuous material covering the sea surface and wave attenuation is parameterized in terms of empirical formulations assuming parameterizations for ice viscosity ice strain and deformation rates for mass loading models the ice field is treated as composed of mass points which exert pressure on the sea surface but no coherence or rheological properties are assumed squire et al 1995 squire 2007 in the recent years the wave ice interaction process and ice induced attenuation have been implemented into wwiii tolman 2003 2009 tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 there are three options for wave damping by the sea ice the first option is the damping of wave energy by a pre determined uniform attenuation coefficient in the frequency space the other two options assume the ice is a thin elastic plate or a viscous elastic layer and the wave energy is attenuated non uniformly in the frequency space tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 a model simulation of the storm generated large waves in the arctic ocean has revealed that further reductions in seasonal ice cover tend to result in larger waves which in turn provides a mechanism to break up sea ice and accelerate ice retreat thomson and rogers 2014 following kohout and meylan 2008 an attenuation scheme for wave ice interactions particularly in the range of periods of 6 16 s was implemented into the ecwam this model was applied to simulate the waves in the sea ice off antarctica doble and bidlot 2013 the upper bound of the wave period was selected on the basis of wave observations in the antarctic marginal ice zone miz which showed that waves with periods of 16 s experienced very low attenuation kohout et al 2014 this finding however was only applied to the marginal ice zone in which the ice concentration was relatively low squire et al 2009 proposed an ice induced wave attenuation coefficient formulation for waves with periods longer than 10 s this formulation can resolve the penetration of longer period waves into the ice covered arctic waters across the miz in fact ice induced wave decay has previously been suggested to be a function of sea ice properties such as ice thickness ice concentration and the size of ice floes perrie and hu 1996 meylan and masson 2006 the unstructured grid finite volume community ocean model fvcom is an unstructured grid finite volume coupled ice ocean wave model originally developed by chen et al 2003 and improved by the fvcom team and users chen et al 2006 2013 this model has been configured for the arctic and global oceans to establish the arctic global ocean finite volume community ocean model ao fvcom global fvcom chen et al 2009 gao et al 2011 chen et al 2016 the ao fvcom global fvcom contains an unstructured grid sea ice model ug cice gao et al 2011 and surface wave model swave qi et al 2009 which were developed on the framework of the structured grid versions of cice hunke and lipscomb 2006 and the simulation waves nearshore swan model booij et al 1999 swan team 2006a b respectively the ice and ocean were fully coupled within fvcom but the ice wave interactions have not been formulated until this study our effort is to configure swave for global and basin scale arctic ocean applications with an inclusion of the north pole in the spherical coordinate system moreover our studies focus on the influences of ice induced wave attenuation on the generation propagation and dissipation of surface waves in the arctic ocean an effective methodology is introduced to reduce numerical dissipation during the energy advection in geographic space a series of numerical experiments are made to validate swave through comparisons with observed significant wave heights and periods the wave induced ice breakage and an ice retreat wave growth positive feedback mechanism is examined based on the validated results the remaining text is organized as follows in section 2 the global arctic ocean swave model is described with a focus on the implementation of ice induced wave attenuation in section 3 model data comparisons at available buoy sites and satellite strips are presented a discussion is given in section 4 and conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 the arctic ocean swave and design of numerical experiments the arctic ocean swave was developed under the framework of fvcom by qi et al 2009 the finite volume advection scheme used in swave performs with the same numerical accuracy as the third order finite difference method used in swan qi et al 2009 to apply swave for the arctic global ocean we made the following modifications first a coordinate projection method is improved to solve the singularity issue at the north pole and the meridian convergence problem at high latitude second an ice induced wave attenuation parameterization is designed and added to the form of the action density flux term over geographic space in the wave spectral action balance equation the treatment and method used in the first part are derived and discussed in appendix a the formulation for the second part and design of numerical experiments are described below 2 1 ice induced wave attenuations in spherical coordinates the wave growth and dissipation are governed by the wave action density spectrum balance equation given as 1 n γ 1 r cos λ c g λ u n λ cos φ c g φ v n φ c σ n σ c θ n θ s tot σ where n is the wave action density spectrum σ is the relative frequency θ is the wave direction c σ and c θ are the wave propagation velocities in spectral space σ θ γ λ and φ are the time longitude zonal and latitude meridian respectively c g λ and c g φ are the zonal and meridian components of the wave group velocity u and v are the zonal and meridian components of the ambient ocean current velocity s tot is the source sink term given as 2 s tot s in s nl 3 s nl 4 s ds w s ds b s ds br s att ice where s in is a function for the wind induced wave growth s nl 3 is the nonlinear transfer of wave energy due to triadic three wave interactions s nl 4 is the nonlinear transfer of wave energy due to four wave interactions s ds w s ds b and s ds br are the three wave energy dissipation terms which represent the wave energy dissipation due to white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking respectively and s att ice is the ice induced wave attenuation term the empirical formula of s att ice which has been used in previous studies doble and bidlot 2013 williams et al 2013a b is a dissipation function as given as 3 n θ σ t n 1 n θ σ t n exp β c g δ t where β is the dimensional attenuation coefficient δ t t n 1 t n and subscript n presents the n th time step and c g is group velocity following the approach used in previous modeling works dumont et al 2011a b williams et al 2013a b ardhuin et al 2016 we use the ice free dispersion relation ω 2 g k tanh k d in our present model here ω is the wave angular frequency g is the gravitational acceleration k is the wave number and d is the water depth the transport speed c g of wave energy is assumed to be the same in the ice covered sea as in the open ocean dumont et al 2011a b williams et al 2013a b ardhuin et al 2016 the exponential decay function in eq 3 was developed based on the observational evidence from various types of measurements robin 1963 dean 1966 wadhams et al 1988 squire and moore 1980 liu et al 1991 with a summary given by kohout and meylan 2008 hereafter referred to as km08 these measurements show that wave energy decays exponentially with distance as it travels into the marginal ice zone on each finite control volume cv in the ice covered sea based on eq 3 the total wave energy should be damped by a factor of exp β c g δ t this approach works for the case in which the wave energy is uniformly distributed in the miz where the wave energy gradient is large however it might lead to an unrealistic result if the traveling distance of wave energy is calculated by discrete determined group velocities let us assume that n is the wave energy newly added into an ice covered cv over a time interval δ t according to eq 3 in the main loop of the model n will be attenuated after the advection in the discrete finite volume method the traveling distance δ r of n is actually the distance between the centroids of the adjacent cvs which might differ from the true distance traveled at the wave group velocity c g δ t if c g δ t δ r the width of the wave attenuation zone calculated by eq 3 can be underestimated and vice versa this is a typical numerical dissipation issue that needs to be taken into account when eq 3 is used it is more reasonable to calculate the attenuation rate by considering the distance that the wave energy really travels over one time step to do this we re designed s att ice with eq 4 given as 4 n θ σ t n 1 n θ σ t n δ r ω i 1 l n i 1 exp β δ r i δ l i where n i is the newly added wave energy to the cv l is the number of the groups of newly added wave energy to the cv δ r are the distances from a triangle s node to the triangle centroids connected to this node ω is the area of the cv with its center at an individual triangle node and bounded by the sections linked to the centroids and the mid point of the adjacent sides in the surrounding triangles δ l i are the perimeters of ω δ r i are the traveling distances of newly added wave energy which are defined as the distances between the centroids of the adjacent control volumes in eq 4 β is a function of wave period and direction as well as ice concentration and floe size in general it can be expressed as 5 β c i α d where α is a non dimensional attenuation coefficient c i is the average ice concentration of the two adjacent control volumes and d is the average diameter of the floes doble and bidlot 2013 in swave c i can be determined either from observations or ice models and d can be specified on the basis of the so called fragility parameter probability of ice breakage and the specification of the minimum and maximum floe sizes as described by dumont et al 2011a b and doble and bidlot 2013 in this study following doble and bidlot 2013 the number of the fragmentation steps m is given as 6 m l o g ε d m a x d m i n where ε determines the number of pieces that each floe will be fragmented into and is set to be 2 d m a x and d m i n are the maximum and minimum floe diameters respectively the mean floe diameter is calculated by 7 d m 0 m ε 2 f m ε m d m a x m 0 m ε 2 f m where f is the possibility of the ice floe fragment and is set to be 0 9 d 36 for d m a x and d m i n are given as 200 and 20 respectively and m 3 α describes the attenuation rate per ice floe that the wave encounters observations have suggested that this coefficient is a function of wave period t and ice floe thickness h km08 derived an elastic plate model and used it to predict a logarithm distribution for α versus t in the wave period range of 6 16 s and ice floe thickness h in a range of 0 4 3 2 m see fig 8 in km08 re drawn in fig 2 in this paper compared with those obtained from the theoretical formulations derived by wadhams et al 1988 and masson and leblond 1989 the parameterization of α derived by km08 has provided credible results for capturing observed wave attenuation in the greenland sea this method was used by perrie and hu 1996 for case studies in the labrador sea implementing km08 derived ice induced wave attenuation into wam doble and bidlot 2013 found that this model was capable of reproducing the wave measurements of buoys in the miz and nearby ice covered areas off antarctica they also reported that adding an additional sea ice drag attenuation could weaken the wave energy into the miz and thus improve the simulated waves over certain time periods the dissipation term is α v d c d h k 2 in which c d is the constant ice wave drag coefficient given as 1 1 0 2 and h is the wave height of a given wave component ardhuin et al 2016 deployed a dissipation term based on the under ice laminar friction theory liu and mollo christensen 1988 the dissipation rate is α v a k v ω c g in which k is the wave number v 1 83 1 0 6 m 2 s and represents the molecular viscosity at the freezing temperature of sea water ω is the angular frequency and c g is the group velocity an experiment for idealized cases is established to evaluate the contributions of α v d and α v a to the significant wave height in the ice covered sea the simulation results indicate that α v a is negligible while α v d significantly decreases the significant wave heights not shown here we have adopted the km08 derived parameterization for the non dimensional wave attenuation coefficient α in swave for the wave period range of 6 16 s fig 2 with the understanding that other attenuation mechanisms can be added in the future with careful validations the ice floe thickness h in km08 required to determine α can be estimated from an ice model or from satellite measurements krinner et al 2010 also proposed an empirical formulation in the form of 8 h a 0 a 1 a 2 c i min a 3 a 4 c i c i min where c i min is the minimum value of c i in real cases we assume that c i min 0 if c i 1 0 and c i min 1 0 if c i 1 0 a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 are the constants given as 0 0 0 2 2 8 1 0 2 0 respectively recently zhang et al 2016b collected the ice thickness data available in the arctic ocean for the model validation from icesat the ice cloud and land elevation satellite campaigns over the period 2003 2008 kwok et al 2009 em airbone the electromagnetic airborne measurements over the period 2001 2009 haas et al 2009 romanov atlas the atlas of ice and snow of the arctic basin and siberian shelf seas over period 1978 1989 romanov 1995 and coastal stations the drill hole fast sea ice thickness measurements at 51 coastal stations over the period 1998 2008 a proshutinsky personal communication most of these measurements include relatively large uncertainties that are not quantitatively estimated and do not cover our 2013 simulation period we collected the cryosat 2 monthly averaged remote sensing data over october 2013 and compared satellite derived sea ice thickness with eq 8 derived h values with respect to ice concentration the results show that eq 8 derived h remain around the lower bound of the observed sea ice thickness in the range of c i 1 0 however this value overestimates sea ice thickness at c i 1 0 fig 3a we also made the same comparison with the coastal stations measurements and the results are similar fig 3b in spite of these incongruences this empirical equation reasonably represents the trend of the sea ice thickness with respect to the sea ice concentration to capture the mean value of the sea ice thickness variation via the sea ice concentration recorded on either satellites or coastal stations we modified eq 8 by adjusting a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 to be 0 4 0 2 1 4 1 0 2 0 respectively fig 3 the km08 formulation for α was designed for wave periods in the range of 6 16 s for real ocean applications such as when the wave period is shorter than 6 s we used an α value of 6 s in the arctic the waves with a period of 16 s can penetrate deeply within the miz and the pack ice area squire et al 2009 which may influence both the ice properties and wave fields across the miz and in the ice covered region to take this effect into account we have adopted the empirical wave attenuation formulation suggested by squire et al 2009 for the case when wave periods exceeded 16 s see fig 2 this formulation is given as 9 β 0 02 exp 0 386 t thus the dimensional attenuation coefficient β is derived from the combination of the two wave attenuation schemes according to the wave periods generally the higher frequency wave energy decays faster while in the directional domain the wave energy is uniformly attenuated it should be noted that both attenuation mechanisms are old but they are well validated and therefore appropriate for numerical simulations new parameterization schemes can be implemented in the future with careful validations 2 2 design of numerical experiments the arctic ocean swave hereafter referred to as ao swave model was configured using the same global arctic ocean nested unstructured grid as that of ao fvcom fig 4 chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a the horizontal resolution in the computational domain varies from 2 km near the coast and around the islands to 40 km in open ocean areas the ao swave can run either using the arctic ocean subdomain grid through nesting with the global domain swave or by merging the arctic ocean subdomain grid to the global domain as a single global scale model in our experiments we ran ao swave as a single global scale model and focused our analysis in the arctic ocean subdomain only the ice concentration used in ao swave is the daily ssm i and ssmis data produced by remote sensing systems and sponsored by the nasa earth science measures program with a spatial resolution of 12 5 km wentz 2013 to quantify the contribution of the ice induced wave attenuation we made numerical experiments for cases with and without the ice induced wave attenuation in case i the ice concentration was taken into account in the wind forcing exerted at the sea surface through the following formulation 10 τ wind input τ wind real 1 c i where τ wind input is the input wind stress at the ice sea interface τ wind real is the wind stress calculated based on the national center for environmental prediction and the national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar dataset zhang et al 2016a the other parameters for s in remain the same as the default setup for swave in this case the experiment was made with inclusion of the parameterization for ice induced wave attenuation in case ii the ocean was treated as ice free and the experiment did not include the ice concentration in the wind forcing field or the ice induced wave attenuation parameterization in case iii the ice concentration was taken into account for the wind input term in the action conservation eqs 1 and 2 but no ice induced wave attenuation was considered for all 3 cases directions were divided into 36 equally distributed angular bins and frequencies were distributed exponentially in 40 bins in the range of 0 04 1 0 hz we have adopted the wave partitioning program from wwiii and implemented it in swave this program was used to separate windsea and swell waves in the wave simulation the model results were compared with observed wave data available at buoys in the arctic ocean and adjacent regions the locations of the fixed buoys are listed in table 1 and shown in fig 1 our major interests are to examine how the sea ice influences the wave energy distribution in the arctic ocean and to evaluate the ao swave performance for this purpose we ran the simulations for the three cases for the period from 00 00 00 june 1 to 24 00 00 october 31 2013 during which time wave measurements were available at buoys 48211 48213 and 48214 all the buoy data were downloaded from the database of national data buoy center http sdf ndbc noaa gov and the national centers for environmental information https www ncei noaa gov significant wave height swh data from the jason 2 program ftp avisoftp cnes fr aviso pub jason 2 were also used for comparisons in the north atlantic ocean and north pacific ocean the model was also run for the period from 00 00 00 june 1 to 24 00 00 october 31 2014 during which time wave data were collected in the beaufort sea using three surface wave instrument floats with tracking buoys swifts smith and thomson 2016 3 model assessment 3 1 model data comparisons in the bering sea of the pan arctic ocean the model data comparisons were made for stations 46070 and 46075 in the bering sea the pacific ocean of the pan arctic region and the jason 2 satellite derived data in the high latitude region between 55 n to 66 n the purpose of these comparisons was to determine if the model can reliably simulate ocean surface waves on the pan arctic scale which is essential if swell waves in the arctic ocean were to be discussed the comparisons were first made for significant wave heights swh and peak periods t peak and then for wind sea and swell waves for case i the model data comparisons shown in fig 5 suggest that the model is capable of reproducing the swh temporal variability observed at these two stations with correlation coefficients of 0 75 and 0 91 biases of 0 10 m and 0 19 m and root mean square error rmse of 0 82 m and 0 56 m at 46070 and 46075 respectively table 2 the correlation was estimated with a significant testing at a p value of 0 01 the linear regression function of the computed swhs with respect to observed swhs had a slope of 0 9 with an intercept of 0 13 m at 46070 and 0 03 m at 46075 swave showed relatively larger errors in t peak than in swh although the model did reasonably resolve the temporal variability of t peak the linear regression function of the computed t peak with respect to the observed t peak has slopes of 0 31 and 0 33 with intercepts of 5 47 s and 5 18 s and correlation coefficients of 0 28 and 0 34 at 46070 and 46075 respectively table 3 the bias was around 1 0 1 32 s with rsmes of 2 78 and 3 17 s respectively following the wave spectra partition method introduced by hanson and phillips 2001 hanson et al 2009 and tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 we also compared the simulated and observed significant wave heights of the windsea swhws and swell swhsw at station 46075 fig 6 the correlation coefficients between model simulated and observed swhws values are shown to exceed 0 74 the model over predicts the observed swhws in the bering sea during the storm events in september october which is a key reason for a relatively large bias and rmse reported in table 4 the model is also reasonably capable of reproducing the swhsw at this station fig 6 in particular it accurately reproduces the swell peaks in june and september but under predicts swhsw in late october observed swhsw values exhibit high frequency variability which appear to be smoothed out in the simulated swhsw this is partially due to insufficient resolution in the wind forcing in time and space and intrinsic model biases such as inadequacies in the basic source term physics in eq 2 these factors contribute to the relatively low correlation coefficients between model simulated and observed swhsw values table 4 we also repeated the model data comparison for cases ii and iii without the inclusion of sea ice in the surface forcing nor the ice induced wave attenuation and the results are mostly identical the maximum difference in the swhs between the cases with and without these sea ice formulations is less than 0 2 m with an overall bias of 0 02 m this is not surprising since these two stations were located around 55 08 n which is outside of the permanent ice coverage areas in the arctic additional comparisons were made with the jason 2 satellite derived swh hereafter referred to as swh j2 in the ao swave computational domain up to 66 n the simulated swhs for cases i and ii were interpolated to the sites with swh j2 data a scatter plot was created for the simulated swh via swh j2 in fig 7 with the statistics given in table 5 in both cases the correlation coefficients between swh and swh j2 are 0 77 and 0 78 with biases being close to zero and rmses of 0 55 m and 0 56 m respectively for cases i and ii the linear regression function of computed swhs with respect to observed swh j2 has the same slope of 0 84 and intercepts of 0 29 m and 0 28 m it is evident that neither the inclusion nor exclusion of ice induced attenuation significantly affects the wave simulation results in the pan arctic region though the swh tends to be underestimated in case i and overestimated in case ii the disparities between model simulated and observed values of swhs t peak swh ws and swh sw are caused by multiple issues associated with model physics the inaccuracy of external forcing and the parameterization of empirical model coefficients the wind forcing used to drive the model was interpolated from the ncep reanalysis product with a horizontal resolution of 1 9 degree which is not able to resolve the small to meso scale spatial wind variability or short term variability of the significant wave heights and frequencies observed on the buoys insufficient resolutions for wave frequency and directional domains may also cause errors in magnitude and direction of the group velocity and thus the timing of the arrival of swells at observed stations the simulation accuracy can be also significantly affected by the parameterizations used for s in particularly for the growth of the waves these issues should be addressed in the future when ao swave is placed into operational forecasts 3 2 model data comparisons at three stations in the arctic ocean during the simulation period only three stations 48211 48213 and 48214 on the northern coast of alaska were available for comparison with model results this coastal area is fully covered by ice during winter and spring of each year and intermittently contains ice during early periods of the summers the wave records at these three buoys started in july after the area was free of ice to investigate the impact of the ice in the interior arctic ocean on the swhs and t peak at the three buoys on the alaska shelf we compared the model results with the buoy observations for cases i ii and iii taking swh as an example the model performance was assessed using the model skill coefficient msc defined as 11 msc 1 i 1 i n swh m i swh o i 2 i 1 i n swh m i swh o swh o i swh o 2 where swh m i and swh o i are the model simulated and observed swhs respectively swh o is the mean value of swh o i n is the total number of the measurements and the subscript i is the i th measurement record the performance is perfect when msc 1 but very poor when msc 0 table 6 summarizes the msc values for the three cases the best is case i which takes into account the ice influence on surface forcing and ice induced wave attenuation the worst is case ii which assumed ice free conditions since the buoys were located in the ice free area the msc difference is about 0 1 0 29 between cases i and ii and about 0 05 0 26 between cases i and iii a similar conclusion can be derived from comparisons of the correlation coefficients and rmse table 6 overall case i shows the best performance swh is overestimated in case ii and case iii and underestimated in case i the performance of the ao swave for cases i ii and iii can also be viewed in the model data comparison of the time series of swh shown in fig 8 over the period during which the observed swhs are available the model computed swhs for all three cases show similar performance levels at the crests but not at the troughs good model data agreement is evident at the troughs in case i but the model computed swh is significantly higher than the observed data for cases ii and iii although no wave data were recorded over the period from june to mid july the three buoy areas were intermittently covered by thin ice as a result the model computed swhs remain near zero for case i ignoring either ice induced wave attenuation or ice reduced surface wind forcing over the open ocean can significantly overestimate swh at station 48211 the results for cases ii and iii show relatively high values of swh at levels 0 1 m with maximum values up to 1 2 m and 0 8 m respectively similar evidence also occurs at stations 48213 and 48214 in late june the model predicts a peak swh at a level of 0 3 m at stations 48213 and 48214 in case i but this peak is exaggerated by as much as to 2 0 m in case ii and 1 8 m in case iii we also compared model simulated and observed peak periods at 48211 48213 and 48214 for the three cases fig 9 with the bias correlation rmse and msc shown in table 7 the performance of case i is much better than cases ii and iii based on the absolute values of bias rmse and msc case i is the best and case iii is the worst at 48211 the correlation coefficient in case i is 0 31 but is negative in case ii and case iii similarly the msc is remarkably higher in case i than in case ii and case iii at these three stations over a certain time period cases ii and iii exhibit some unrealistic longer peak periods that were not evident in the observations unrealistic peaks do not occur in case i it is clear that restricting the wind input and attenuation of swells to the ice covered zone play a critical role in capturing the period of surface wave simulation at these three stations the comparison results are summarized using the taylor diagrams shown in fig 10 as indicated by tables 6 and 7 both correlation coefficients and rmses show that the case i exhibited a better overall performance than case ii and case iii especially for tpeak fig 10 shows that compared with the standard deviation std of observed swh case 1 performs better than cases ii and iii for example at 48211 the std of the observed swh is 0 50 and the stds of model simulated swhs are 0 47 0 41 and 0 40 respectively for cases i ii and iii 3 3 model data comparisons with swift buoys in the arctic ocean surface wave instrument floats with tracking swifts were purposely designed to measure the wave fields in the arctic ocean wave data were collected by three swifts in the beaufort sea in 2014 smith and thomson 2016 the drift tracks of these three swifts are shown in fig 1 of smith and thomson 2016 and replotted as fig 11 the gray image over the sea is the ice concentration c i on september 1 from daily ssm i and ssmis data compared with the fraction of sea ice cover also is the ice concentration in fig 1 of smith and thomson 2016 c i was obviously high in the vicinity of 155 w 75 n both swifts 10 and 11 were deployed on july 27 from the r v ukpik in the open ocean and shared similar tracks until september 1 when swift 10 traveled north and was trapped in the ice covered sea until september 15 while swift 11 drifted west swift 15 was deployed on august 5 in the partial ice cover and was caught in the miz until it was recovered these swift data are used to validate the model results fig 12 a c shows the time series of swh recorded by swift 10 11 and 15 and the corresponding simulation results respectively in which the ice induced wave attenuation is fully considered table 8 shows the performance of the model compared with the swift data the red and black squares in fig 12 a c are the swifts recorded swhs and the corresponding simulated swhs respectively while the lines show the 9 day moving averages from september 1 to september 15 swift 10 was caught in the ice covered sea but the daily ssm i and ssmis data did not show any ice along this track thus the simulation results show obvious overestimation during these 15 days for the other days the moving average shows good agreement between simulation and observations while the model underestimates swh before august 8 swift 11 drifted on an ice free sea surface and the daily ssm i and ssmis data did not show any ice thus the model can accurately represent the swh under these conditions and the correlation coefficient and msc are very high the model also shows underestimation at high swhs but the overall performance is good swift 15 was deployed in the ice covered sea and recorded the swh in the miz fig 12 d shows the ice concentration during the track according to the daily ssm i and ssmis data the simulation results reproduced the trend of the swh in the miz well although the available observed swh data from swift 15 are scarce on average the simulation results underestimate swh before august 10 and exhibit overestimations after this time the trend is similar between simulation and observations and the parameters in table 8 also show that the performance of the model is good the simulation results accurately met the observed swh values along the track of swift 11 because the ice concentration along the track is zero which corresponds well with the real ice state when swifts were trapped by ice specifically the whole track of swift 15 and partial track of swift 10 higher errors were experienced however the simulation results still conform to the observed data at swift 10 and 15 well the resolution and accuracy of the ice concentration is a key impact factor in the swh simulations comparing fig 1 of smith and thomson 2016 and fig 11 there are obvious differences between the daily ssm i and ssmis sea ice data and the daily amsr2 sea ice data thus it is possible that inaccurate ice forcing and poor resolution of the ice fields are the main factors in the differences between model and observations 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of ice induced wave attenuation on wave generation and evolution to evaluate the impact of ice induced wave attenuation on wave generation and evolution in the ice free coastal region we selected station 48214 as a comparison site for the model computed wave vector histories for cases i ii and iii over the period from july 6 to july 19 during which this location was intermittently covered by sea ice the analysis was done for both windsea and swell fig 13 buoy 48214 was dominated by weak southerly winds during july 6 northeasterly winds with a maximum speed of 9 3 m s during july 7 11 and then south southeasterly winds with a maximum speed of 8 3 m s during july 12 19 fig 13a this site was within the marginal ice zone during july 7 14 but remained ice free after july 15 fig 13b ice coverage attenuated the wave energy and reduced the energy of wind forcing over the ocean and thus directly influenced the windsea generation and evolution for case i fig 13c in this case the wind waves were generated on july 7 when the ice concentration was 0 15 after generation during its development period the wave energy gradually downshifted from high to low frequencies and then rapidly dissipated when the ice concentration increased to 0 24 on july 8 the windsea was regenerated again when the ice concentration dropped to 0 16 on july 9 and experienced additional high to low frequency downshifting during its evolution until july 10 during this period the ice concentration increased to 0 5 such variability in the windsea energy continued until the site became ice free on july 13 after that the windsea followed a regular growth pattern in the miz the model results suggest that the energy dissipation of the windsea was generally accompanied by an apparent frequency increase as the ice concentration increased actual shifting of the spectral peak frequency occurred as the result of nonlinear wave wave interactions which were originally elucidated by hasselmann 1962 and verified by the jonswap experiment of hasselmann et al 1973 relatively low ice concentrations appear to result in an upshift of the energy spectra because the ice induced wave attenuation is apparently more effective at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies in case ii without the ice induced wave attenuation and the blocking effect of the ice on the open ocean surface forcing the model computed windsea is just a result of normal wind generation fig 13d a northeasterly windsea developed when the northeasterly wind appeared on july 7 during the wave evolution period the energy of this windsea increased when the wind speed became strong and its frequency shifted from high to low the windsea grew steadily as the northeasterly wind continued for 5 days reaching a relatively stable peak period of 5 s after july 10 case iii considered the blocking effect of the ice on the open ocean surface forcing but not the ice induced wave attenuation thus although the development of the windsea was quite similar to that observed in case i the wave energy reached higher values at a lower peak frequency as the ice concentration increased the change in frequency was not as remarkable as that in case i fig 13e the energy of this windsea was at most about 3 times higher than that of case i and it developed even when the ice concentration dropped to zero these features were more evident later in time suggesting that the ice induced wave attenuation played a key role in the wave dissipation and the apparent downshifting of the peak frequency in case ii by comparison in case iii only nonlinear wave wave interactions affected the downshifting of the peak frequency energy therefore the process occurred at an apparently slower rate development and evolution of swell waves significantly differed among the three cases with and without inclusion of the ice the number and intensity of these swell groups are considerably distinct in case i before july 15 no remarkable swell groups were detected at station 48124 but some swells with very small amplitudes occurred over the periods of july 6 7 and july 13 14 respectively fig 13c although the amplitudes were of the order of 0 01 m the characteristics of the swell groups and frequency upshift were still visible these tiny swells were the products of ice induced wave attenuation after july 12 the ice completely disappeared and the site was dominated by two groups of swells groups i 1 and i 2 which propagated northeastward with amplitudes of 0 6 m and periods of 6 8 s when the ice induced wave attenuation and the blocking effect of the ice on the ocean surface forcing were removed the location exhibited different types of swells at all times fig 13d during the first four days one group of swells was detected group ii 1 which propagated southward with an amplitude of 0 6 m and periods of 10 15 s after july 10 several groups of swells were found which mainly propagated southward with amplitudes of 0 05 1 0 m and periods of 5 10 s there are too many wave groups to be individually analyzed among them groups ii 2 ii 3 and ii 4 in case ii were also clearly detected as groups iii 2 iii 3 and iii 4 in case iii if the blocking effect of the ice on the ocean surface wind forcing was considered but not ice induced wave attenuation case iii some swell groups in case ii either disappeared or weakened swells inside the red polygon during the first five days in case iii the site was dominated by one group of the southward propagating swells group iii 1 with an amplitude of about 0 55 m and periods of 10 s group iii 1 corresponded to groups ii 1 after july 11 three distinct groups of swells were detected groups iii 3 and iii 4 are the same as groups i 1 and i 2 in case i groups ii 3 and ii 4 in case ii traveled from the southwest group iii 2 was identified in both case ii and case iii though in case ii it was partially lost because the spectrum had too many other interacting energy components this swell group group ii 2 and group iii 2 may correspond to the tiny swells during the period of july 10 12 in case i which was effectively attenuated by the ice cover in summary swells from the ice free ocean area in the southern region of the domain were detected in all three cases case iii removed swells that were generated in the ice covered area in case ii the complicated swell groups in the red polygon in case ii in addition case i attenuated swells that were either generated in the ice covered area or traveled though the ice covered sea groups iii 1 and iii 2 we used a swell tracking method hanson and phillips 2001 described in appendix b to locate the generation location and time of group i 1 for case i and group iii 2 for case iii group i 1 was detected at station 48214 during the period july 15 17 the original source of this swell group is shown in fig 14a indicating that this swell group was generated at 18 00 00 july 9 a persistent wind field in the northwest pacific ocean with a speed of 10 m s developed a robust swell group which traveled through bering strait and reached station 48214 group iii 2 was originally generated in the ice free area of the arctic ocean around 10 00 00 july 7 and traveled through the ice covered area to reach station 48214 fig 14b this swell group represents an artificial result because the effect of the ice induced wave attenuation was ignored in the case iii wave simulation 4 2 an ice retreat wave growth positive feedback mechanism in our study implementing wave induced attenuation allowed the wave energy to propagate into the miz and the ice covered area as the ice concentration increased and the waves encountered more ice floes the wave energy rapidly dissipated as its travel increasing distances into the miz increased since short waves attenuated more rapidly than long waves as the waves propagated deeper into the miz the peak of the wave energy tended to shift to lower frequencies in the energy spectrum under conditions where the daily ice fields are derived from remote sensing data and the wave field is from simulation results an ice retreat wave growth positive feedback mechanism can be further proposed and analyzed the ice free sea surface area increases with the retreating ice which directly promotes the waves growth in turn wave dissipation can induce ice floe breakage and thus accelerate the melting of ice and thus the retreat of the ice here a brief discussion is given on a the impacts of the ice retreat on wave growth and ice breakage and b the influence of ice breakage on ice melting 4 2 1 impacts of ice retreat on wave growth and ice breakage williams et al 2013a introduced a method to estimate the conditions whereby the waves in the miz can break ice floes the basic idea is to compare the significant strain amplitude e s for the ice floes with the critical breaking strain ε c through a criterion given as 12 e s e c ε c 2 log p c where e c is the critical significant strain amplitude and p c is the probability criterion specified as p c e 2 0 14 ε c is given as 13 ε c σ c y where y is the strain modulus equaling 14 y y 0 1 3 51 v b 1 gpa with y 0 10 gpa and σ c is the flexural strength equaling to 15 σ c σ 0 exp 5 88 v b where v b is the brine volume and σ 0 is a constant specified as 1 76 mpa in our experiments v b is assumed to be 0 1 in our approach e s was calculated from swh and t peak was deduced from the wave spectrum assuming that ice breakage events happen in the direction of the highest wave energy θ m and only the wave energy within the direction segment θ m θ π 2 contribute to ice breaking we can calculate e s by 16 e s 2 θ m π 2 θ m π 2 0 04 1 s ω θ cos θ m θ h 2 k ice 3 γ k d ω d θ where h is the thickness of the ice floe γ 0 8 is the transmission coefficient for waves traveling from the water into the ice ω is the angular frequency k is the wave number k ice is the wave number of the ice plate and is taken as the positive real root as given by williams et al 2013a specifically their eq a 7 following eqs 12 16 we can estimate the average value of e s in the arctic ocean as examples the results for july and september 2013 are represented in fig 15 in july the significant ice breakage was mainly located within the miz on the north atlantic side of the arctic ocean where the breaking event can occur in the area with ice concentration c i being up to 0 6 fig 15 upper panels although most of the entire arctic ocean was still covered by sea ice it did have ice free areas in the chukchi sea and laptev sea and ice breakage occurred in these two regions by september a large portion of the arctic had become ice free providing potentially long fetch conditions for wave generation and growth the ice breakage area in the chukchi and laptev seas became larger and extended to the beaufort sea and east siberian sea with rapid ice melting the miz on the atlantic side retreated toward the arctic accompanied by an intensification of ice breakage fig 15 lower panels in order to quantify the influence of the ice retreat on wave growth and ice breakage we divided the arctic ocean region with latitudes 66 n into three sector zones sector i 30 w 90 e sector ii 90 e 180 e and sector iii 120 w 180 w fig 1 for simplicity sectors i ii iii are hereafter referred to as s i s ii and s iii respectively in each sector we estimated the ratios of the open water area ω free and ice breakage area ω break to the total sector area ω s fig 16a c hereafter we defined these two ratios as r free ω free ω s and r break ω break ω s we also calculated the averaged swh and t peak in the open water in each sector and related them to the percentages of ice free and ice breakage areas fig 16d f the imaginary lines refer to the variation trend of swh or t peak before or after ω free reaches the peak values the responses of r break to change in r free differed significantly in these three sectors in s i fig 16a r free increased from 0 51 to 0 84 during the time period june 1 september 20 however r break did not follow the change in the ice free area oscillating around 0 06 during june early july dropping to around 0 03 in mid july and then varying around 0 03 0 06 until late september after september 20 the ice formation caused r free to start to decrease but r break did not drop instead it showed an increase in s ii fig 16b r break generally followed the same growth and decline trends as r free although with a 0 5 month time delay r break increased from nearly 0 to 0 15 as r free grew from nearly 0 to 0 48 over the period june early october it then rapidly decreased toward 0 as r free dropped to 0 over the october period in s iii fig 16c r break showed an obvious increasing trend during both the increasing phase and the early decreasing phase of r free except in late october when r break began to decrease theoretically speaking wind generated wave growth is the consequence of ice retreat and the increase of open water which is also the reason for increased ice breakage area in s i the linear regression lines of swh and t peak suggest that regardless of how the period of r free increased or decreased both amplitudes and periods of the surface waves show overall increasing trends during the june october period the rates of increase exhibited two time phases the first is a gradual increase during the r free increasing period and the second a rapid increase during the r free decreasing period in this sector changes in r break follow changes in swh and t peak but do not directly correlate with the change in r free in s iii the increase of r break follows change in swh rather than change in r free in s ii changes in swh and t peak share the same trend as r free and therefore change in r break follows change in r free from june through october on the atlantic side of the arctic ocean s i because r free remains above 0 5 it is clear that fetch does not restrict wave growth therefore wave ice interactions can remain active and are limited by the wind field over the time period from june to october on the pacific side of arctic ocean s iii the fetch is a critical limit on wave growth for surface waves swh can increase with increasing fetch and during the early ice formation period as r free kept decreasing toward the end of october swh generally decreased and r break dropped rapidly to 0 02 while r free decreased to 0 14 s ii is geographically between s i and s iii where fetch plays a critical role in limiting wave growth in this region the temporal change in r break is directly correlated with variability in r free 4 2 2 influence of ice breakage on ice melting we evaluate the influence of ice breakage on ice melting by examining the change in ice concentration c i before and after the occurrence of breakage events during this study c i was limited to be within the range of 0 4 0 6 when ice breakage occurred the averaged anomaly value for c i over a 5 day period is calculated and shown in fig 17 which includes the day when the ice breakage occurred plus two days before and after using the ice breakage day as a reference the difference in c i relative to that day was 0 16 and 0 21 one day before and after the occurrence of the ice breakage event respectively this implies 31 increase in the ice melting rate after the breaking of the ice over a 2 day period the differences are 0 27 and 0 34 indicating an average rate increase of 26 by contrast the ice melting rate after c i reaches the range 0 4 0 6 does not accelerate if there is no ice breakage this estimate suggests that ice breakage can accelerate the ice melting rate through a positive feedback process 4 3 advantage of the improved algorithm to estimate s att ice in section 2 we introduced a new algorithm to improve the estimation of s att ice to evaluate this new method we compare the monthly averaged values for swh and ω break between the traditional and improved algorithms described in eqs 3 and 9 for the sake of discussion we denote the traditional and improved wave induced attenuation algorithms as t wa and i wa for example fig 18 shows the monthly average values for swh and ω break obtained from t wa for september 2013 and the differences in the results obtained from i wa compared with the results shown in fig 15 the t wa approach produces higher values for swh and deeper penetrating areas into the miz especially on the atlantic side fig 18a the differences are mostly located within the miz where the ice concentration was higher than 0 6 the t wa results indicate that swh can even reach 0 2 m in regions where the latitude is higher than 85 n and where the ice concentration is higher than 0 8 given that the ice concentration was close to 1 it is unreasonable for the wave energy to still be noteworthy based on the field measurement data kohout et al 2014 estimated the decay rate for waves swh to be 1 07 1 0 6 m 1 after the surface waves penetrated into the miz when swh 0 2 m we also estimated the decay rate for swh from t wa and i wa respectively by measuring the distance over which swh decayed from 0 2 m to 0 1 m in the direction of the wave energy propagation these results are 4 1 0 7 m 1 for t wa and 1 13 1 0 6 m 1 for i wa the decay rate derived from t wa was significantly lower than that derived from the field measurements this implies that given the same amplitude of swh then t wa requires more than twice the distance to attenuate the wave energy it is clear that t wa can significantly overestimate the wave penetration distance into the miz the decay rate derived from i wa is of the same order of magnitude as that derived from the field measurement data further comparisons were made for the change of temporally and spatially averaged swh t peak and e s over the entire simulation period and the ice covered region with respect to ice concentrations in increments of 0 1 c i fig 19 as c i increases swh decreases faster for t wa than for i wa similarly t peak showed a higher rate of increase for i wa than for the t wa case correspondingly e s showed a faster decay for i wa than for the t wa case on average ice breakage does not happen when c i 0 4 in the i wa case but persists until c i reaches 0 55 for the t wa case 5 summary and conclusions fvcom swave was modified by a the inclusion of a parameterization for ice induced wave attenuation with a newly designed dissipation term in the wave spectral action balance equation and b the development and implementation of a coordinate projection method for sea surface wave simulation at high latitudes this modified version of the unstructured grid surface wave model was configured within the global fvcom grid to examine the influence of ice induced wave attenuation on waves windsea and swells propagating into and out of the miz in the arctic ocean numerical experiments were carried out for three cases to estimate the effect of the inclusion of the ice induced wave attenuation on the wave simulations and the blocking effect of the ice on ocean surface forcing we found that simulation results improved when the ice induced attenuation and the blocking effect of the ice on the surface forcing mechanisms were included in the model system for simulating surface waves the global fvcom model is capable of reproducing the wave evolution trend in the arctic ocean both in open waters and ice covered areas in particular the process oriented experiment suggests that the ice induced wave attenuation plays a key role in the dissipation of windsea and swell waves in the ice covered region ignoring this process can lead to biases in simulations of both windsea and swells the new wave attenuation algorithm introduced in our study which takes into account the grid dependent numerical dissipation error can provide more realistic estimates of wave attenuation in the miz and in the ice breakage area using simulated wave spectra an empirical method derived by williams et al 2013a was introduced to estimate the probability for wave induced ice breakage in the miz the results show that wave induced ice breakage mostly occurs in regions where ice concentration is lower than 0 4 in this study we examined the importance of fetch on wave ice interactions and its relationship with wave field and ice breakage we found that the wind generated wave growth is limited by fetch as found in pioneering field experiments like jonswap by hasselmann et al 1973 and numerous efforts since that time especially in sectors ii and iii wave induced ice breakage consistently occurs more frequently on the atlantic side of the arctic ocean because the vast expanse of open water in the north atlantic provides essentially unlimited fetch conditions for wave generation on the pacific side of arctic although the fetch limits wave growth the magnitude of the surface waves can still intensify during the ice formation period and thus the wave ice interactions can be active until the middle of october when wave energy and ice breakage are both limited by fetch inside the arctic ocean particularly in the region between 90 e and 180 e fetch plays a critical role in limiting wave growth in this region the temporal change of the ice breakage area is directly correlated with the variability of the open water area the notable difference between the ice melting rates before or after the ice breakage events suggests that ice breakage has a positive impact on ice melting which supports the ice retreat wave growth positive

wave data and significant strain amplitude of ice can be obtained from yang zhang email yzhang sio org cn appendix a treatment of meridian convergence and north pole singularity in swave the spectral wave energy is calculated as a matrix composed of the sum of the energy segments for each frequency and direction this was done by the conservation equation for spectral action density used in modern state of art third generation wave models wwiii and swan booij et al 1999 tolman et al 2002 tolman 2009 tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 qi et al 2009 bidlot 2012 following wwiii and swan the wave energy spectrum in swave is defined as discrete directional components with the spherical convention defining a reference direction at the local east and each component is calculated as a scalar when a local gradient is calculated this scalar assumption treats the corresponding vector components at two adjacent cells or nodes as having the same direction li 2012 as waves propagate toward the pole the meridian convergence induces an increasing directional difference between the local east directions of two adjacent nodes li 2012 tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 meridian convergence at the north pole makes the spherical coordinate equations of swave invalid chen et al 2013 there longitude does not have a unique value and wave direction cannot be defined which is a singularity issue at the pole when the global fvcom was developed the singularity issue at the pole was solved by using the spherical stereographic conversion coordinate system chen et al 2009 gao et al 2011 chen et al 2013 however because of the directional feature of wave energy the spherical stereographic conversion coordinate system needs to be modified and deployed to the global wave model two popular approaches are widely used to avoid the north pole problem in the spherical coordinate system one is the so called grid rotation by which a new spherical grid is defined on a rotated coordinate system with the north pole on land e g mom eby and holloway 1994 pacanowski and griffies 2000 this method is simple and costless in terms of needed code modification but as pointed out by pacanowski and griffies 2000 it may make the post processing of model results complicated particularly for current vectors the other is the pole stereographic projection by which all variables in the spherical coordinate system are projected to the well defined cartesian polar coordinate system so that the governing equations can be solved while avoiding the singularity issue at the north pole and the limitation due to the convergence of longitude lines phillips 1957 this method is accurate but limited to a regional ocean multi projection methods are required to cover northern and southern hemispheres for the global ocean following the spherical stereographic conversion coordinate system at the north pole in global ao fvcom gao et al 2011 we configured swave with symmetric triangular grids within 13 circles originating from the north pole 8 triangles in the first circle connecting to the north pole and progressively more triangles in succeeding circles with up to 148 triangles in the thirteenth circle this is the first time that fvcom swave is extended to the north pole the original global ao fvcom scalars e g temperature salinity etc were first calculated based on a control volume composed of 8 triangles connected to the pole on stereographic coordinates fig a 1b and then converted back to the spherical coordinates fig a 1a in common wave models the wave spectra were dispersed into scalar bins and the bins still retain directional properties if the wave spectra were simply treated as scalars in the spherical coordinate the directions of the currents would not match the directions of the wave spectra in the control volume with its center at the north pole to avoid this issue the stereographic coordinate system was designed for the 8 triangles connected to the north pole fig a 1 in which the northward direction of the north pole points to 180 the directions of the wave spectrum ambient current velocity and wave group velocity should be uniformly unified to this stereographic coordinate the advection of the wave energy spectrum is first simulated in this coordinate system and then converted back to the spherical coordinates this approach was directly adopted from the spherical coordinate fvcom system and the detailed mathematics can be found in chen et al 2013 taking advantage of the flexibility of the unstructured grid this method allows swave to run directly on the spherical coordinates for basin or even global scale ocean applications without the need for grid rotation or multi projections in addition to the singularity issue the meridian convergence induces an increasing directional difference between the local east directions of two adjacent nodes this occurs when the difference in longitude between two adjacent nodes in the control volume is larger than 18 0 n d where n d is the number of angular bins in this study n d was set to 36 and 18 0 n d 5 and adjacent nodes with latitudes lower than 85 n are not impacted by meridian convergence li 2012 introduced a method to solve this problem for wave models specifically the transfer of the local east is mapped to east as defined in the form a 1 θ ˆ sgn cos φ sin λ cos 1 cos λ sin φ 1 cos λ sin φ 2 in high latitude regions the major issue is the mismatch of the local east directions between the coordinate systems of two adjacent nodes this issue however does not happen everywhere on the varying resolution unstructured grid system thus to reduce the computational demand a simple criterion was implemented in swave in swave the treatment starts with a latitude threshold according to the property of the mesh grid the treatment is only made when the latitude difference between two adjacent nodes is less that the threshold value with the modification being made according to the latitude difference between two adjacent nodes this approach takes advantage of the unstructured grid s ability to improve computational efficiency in global wave simulations in our method both the local east directions of the group velocity and the wave spectrum are transferred when the criterion is satisfied in particular assuming a and b are two adjacent nodes before computing the wave energy flux between a and b we first calculate the longitude difference between the adjacent nodes using a 2 θ ˆ θ ˆ b θ ˆ a if θ ˆ 18 0 n d the direction difference between the local east directions of two adjacent nodes should not be ignored in this case the treatment should be made the individual wave direction segment is equal to 36 0 n d the corresponding direction segments of a and b are determined by the rotated angles θ ˆ a and θ ˆ b given as a 3 k a k b δ k k b round θ ˆ 360 n d where k a and k b are the direction segment indexes at a and b and δ k is the direction segment difference due to the longitude difference between a and b round x is a function that rounds off the quantity in the brackets to the nearest integer the advection of wave energy is then calculated based on the corresponding direction segments to test the modified swave code we conducted an idealized case experiment under a constant wind forcing condition the experiment was made on a flat bottom computational domain with a center at the north pole in the spherical coordinate system the domain was configured with an unstructured triangular grid with a minimum horizontal resolution of 10 km and a boundary at 78 n fig a 2 the mean water depth is 1000 m everywhere this is a barotropic ocean case with no sea ice the model was driven by a constant wind of 5 m s parallel to 90 e 90 w meridian at the sea surface fig a 2 and ran for a total of 5 days to validate the model we ran this idealized case by turning on and off the correction methodology listed above and comparisons were made for these two runs fig a 3 shows snapshots of the distributions of the wave direction at the end of the 24 h simulation with and without the inclusion of the correction treatment in this case driven by a uniformly distributed constant wind the surface waves should propagate in the same direction everywhere it is clear that without the correction the surface waves tend to converge in the region where the latitude is higher than 89 degrees with an unrealistic direction at the north pole fig a 3 upper panel the energy convergence in the high latitude region and the energy accumulation at the north pole become worse with longer integration times these issues disappear after the correction treatments are turned on fig a 3 lower panel this result indicates that the treatment method implemented into swave is capable of correcting issues caused by the meridian convergence and north pole singularity appendix b method to track the origin of swell waves in space and time in the ocean surface waves disperse and evolve into swell after propagating out of their generation area in general swell waves are weakly dissipated and can propagate across an ocean basin over a spatial scale of 104 km barber and ursell 1948 snodgrass et al 1966 munk et al 1963 small amplitude swell waves can be persistent with an energy decay e folding scale of 2 104 km ardhuin et al 2009 half of earth s perimeter therefore swells generated in one region may carry wave energy across the entire ocean alves 2006 according to wave dispersion theory swell waves with different frequencies belonging to the same swell group arrive at the same location at different times the wave group velocity can be determined by either c g g 2 ω or c g d δ t where d is the distance between locations where waves were observed and generated g is the gravitational acceleration ω is the angular frequency of the wave and δ t is the time over which the wave has traveled the slope shown in fig 14 of the swell vector df dt is related to the travel distance of the swell group df dt g 4 π d and therefore d g 4 π dt df the original time at which the swell was generated is t 0 f s dt df where f s is the peak frequency at the time when this swell group was first observed given d θ the mean swell direction λ s longitude and φ s latitude at the observation site the location λ g φ g where the swell group was originally generated can be determined by b 1 λ g sin 1 sin λ s cos ω d sin ω d cos λ s cos θ b 2 φ g φ s sin 1 sin ω d sin θ cos λ g b 3 ω d d r e where r e is the earth s radius and ω d is the angular travel distance of the wave 
23998,rapidly melting sea ice processes during the summer tend to enlarge the open water in the arctic region the resulting larger potential fetch for surface waves can allow significant wave generation and development in the region the sea ice plays an energy dissipation role for waves propagating into the ice covered sea a spherical coordinate surface wave model was established within the unstructured grid finite volume community ocean model fvcom to examine the influence of ice induced wave attenuation on waves propagating into the ice in the arctic ocean ice induced wave attenuation parameterizations were implemented with an effective methodology to reduce numerical dissipation during the energy advection in geographic space wave partition and source tracking methods were added to distinguish the windsea and swell as well as to backtrack swell waves to their sources the model simulated significant wave heights and peak periods were compared with available buoy and jason 2 satellite measurements results from a process oriented model show that simulations of the surface waves in the arctic region are improved when ice induced attenuation is included in the model system an empirical method is used to statistically estimate wave induced ice breakage based on the wave induced internal ice strain as waves penetrate into the ice zone the simulation results support the ice retreat wave growth positive feedback mechanism keywords arctic ocean wave attenuation ice breakage ocean modeling positive feedback 1 introduction the arctic ocean fig 1 has been in a rapidly changing phase since the latter half of the 20th century stephenson et al 2011 comiso 2006 comiso et al 2008 the sea ice extent in the summer through fall has decreased at an average rate of about 3 8 10 5 km2 per decade since 1978 cavalieri et al 2003 meier et al 2005 the minimum ice extent in september was 7 2 10 6 km2 in 1979 and dropped to 4 7 10 6 km2 in 2018 with an extremely low coverage of 4 3 106 km 2 in 2007 and an even lower coverage of 3 6 10 6 km2 in 2012 this trend toward a larger summer open water area in the arctic ocean has produced potentially enlarged fetches for the growth of wind induced surface waves as a result wave ice interactions have become a dynamically important process not only for the breaking of ice floes and the melting of ice but also for wave generation propagation and dispersion in the arctic basin and coastal regions squire et al 2009 williams et al 2013b to our knowledge there have been few studies done on wave ice interactions in the arctic ocean kohout et al 2014 compared the change of the significant wave heights with the variation of the ice edge latitude in the antarctic sea and found that the ice retreat correlated well with the development of the waves compared with the southern ocean the arctic ocean is quite different because the maximum fetch for wave growth is limited although maximum fetches for wave growth in the norwegian sea barents sea and greenland sea have remained essentially unchanged the fetches have become larger in the pacific pan arctic region collins et al 2015 moreover winds have also changed slightly during the period of 1971 2013 from june through september the winds have intensified by only 0 1 0 3 per year whereas the average significant wave height grew by 3 0 4 1 per year and the averaged peak period increased by 0 5 0 8 per year wang et al 2015 as a result of the ice retreat the enlarged maximum potential fetch favors increased wave growth in the pacific pan arctic region and thus increased wave generation and propagation in the arctic ocean the recent sea state boundary layer experiment by thomson et al 2016 http www apl washington edu project project php id arctic sea state produced a new dataset for wave ice interaction studies this dataset provides the basis for a new set of model studies the arctic has limited monitoring sites for surface waves due to severe natural conditions and difficulties in deploying and maintaining instruments to measure waves in the miz numerical wave models have become a popular tool to examine the ice wave interactions in the arctic ocean there are only a few such wave models that cover the partial or entire arctic ocean one example is the global noaa wavewatch iii nwwiii which has a computational domain bounded by 77 s 77 n and is configured on a structured spherical rectangular grid with a 1 2 5 1 00 horizontal resolution tolman et al 2002 tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 this model has been placed into 24 7 forecast operations as an ensemble system driven by the operational global data assimilation scheme gdas and the aviation cycle of the medium range forecast model http polar ncep noaa gov

phase 2 it has included global and arctic ocean curvilinear grids with the horizontal resolutions of 30 and 15 mins respectively https polar ncep noaa gov waves hindcasts nopp phase2 php thirdly the european center for medium range weather forecasting wave model named ecwam was configured to cover the entire arctic ocean with the inclusion of the north pole bidlot 2012 ecmwf 2014 li and saulter 2014 made a multi resolution implementation of wwiii for the entire arctic ocean using a spherical multiple cell smc grid this model was designed to relax the cfl restriction of the eulerian advection time step at high latitudes by merging the conventional latitude longitude grid cells their approach was also designed to overcome the north pole singularity issue similar works were also done recently casas prat et al 2018 conducted a cmip5 based global wave climate projections in addition to the global scale wwiii model there are several regional wave models established for the arctic ocean or adjacent coastal areas one example is the wwiii based alaskan waters model with a computational domain covering a portion of the bering sea alaska coast and the beaufort sea chao et al 2004 various theories and observation based methods such as the scattering viscous and mass loading models have been proposed to simulate wave evolution and dissipation in the ice covered sea peters 1950 keller and weitz 1953 shapiro and simpson 1953 wadhams et al 1986 weber 1987 liu and mollo christensen 1988 liu et al 1991 squire et al 1995 perrie and hu 1996 meylan and masson 2006 dumont et al 2011a b doble and bidlot 2013 williams et al 2013a b li et al 2015 the basic difference among these methods is the manner in which the ice field is defined one approach follows a scattering method formulation in which the ice field is treated as individual ice floes with the inclusion of wave energy attenuation reflection and transmission an alternate approach which is valid for different sea ice situations is to consider the ice as a continuous material covering the sea surface and wave attenuation is parameterized in terms of empirical formulations assuming parameterizations for ice viscosity ice strain and deformation rates for mass loading models the ice field is treated as composed of mass points which exert pressure on the sea surface but no coherence or rheological properties are assumed squire et al 1995 squire 2007 in the recent years the wave ice interaction process and ice induced attenuation have been implemented into wwiii tolman 2003 2009 tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 there are three options for wave damping by the sea ice the first option is the damping of wave energy by a pre determined uniform attenuation coefficient in the frequency space the other two options assume the ice is a thin elastic plate or a viscous elastic layer and the wave energy is attenuated non uniformly in the frequency space tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 a model simulation of the storm generated large waves in the arctic ocean has revealed that further reductions in seasonal ice cover tend to result in larger waves which in turn provides a mechanism to break up sea ice and accelerate ice retreat thomson and rogers 2014 following kohout and meylan 2008 an attenuation scheme for wave ice interactions particularly in the range of periods of 6 16 s was implemented into the ecwam this model was applied to simulate the waves in the sea ice off antarctica doble and bidlot 2013 the upper bound of the wave period was selected on the basis of wave observations in the antarctic marginal ice zone miz which showed that waves with periods of 16 s experienced very low attenuation kohout et al 2014 this finding however was only applied to the marginal ice zone in which the ice concentration was relatively low squire et al 2009 proposed an ice induced wave attenuation coefficient formulation for waves with periods longer than 10 s this formulation can resolve the penetration of longer period waves into the ice covered arctic waters across the miz in fact ice induced wave decay has previously been suggested to be a function of sea ice properties such as ice thickness ice concentration and the size of ice floes perrie and hu 1996 meylan and masson 2006 the unstructured grid finite volume community ocean model fvcom is an unstructured grid finite volume coupled ice ocean wave model originally developed by chen et al 2003 and improved by the fvcom team and users chen et al 2006 2013 this model has been configured for the arctic and global oceans to establish the arctic global ocean finite volume community ocean model ao fvcom global fvcom chen et al 2009 gao et al 2011 chen et al 2016 the ao fvcom global fvcom contains an unstructured grid sea ice model ug cice gao et al 2011 and surface wave model swave qi et al 2009 which were developed on the framework of the structured grid versions of cice hunke and lipscomb 2006 and the simulation waves nearshore swan model booij et al 1999 swan team 2006a b respectively the ice and ocean were fully coupled within fvcom but the ice wave interactions have not been formulated until this study our effort is to configure swave for global and basin scale arctic ocean applications with an inclusion of the north pole in the spherical coordinate system moreover our studies focus on the influences of ice induced wave attenuation on the generation propagation and dissipation of surface waves in the arctic ocean an effective methodology is introduced to reduce numerical dissipation during the energy advection in geographic space a series of numerical experiments are made to validate swave through comparisons with observed significant wave heights and periods the wave induced ice breakage and an ice retreat wave growth positive feedback mechanism is examined based on the validated results the remaining text is organized as follows in section 2 the global arctic ocean swave model is described with a focus on the implementation of ice induced wave attenuation in section 3 model data comparisons at available buoy sites and satellite strips are presented a discussion is given in section 4 and conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 the arctic ocean swave and design of numerical experiments the arctic ocean swave was developed under the framework of fvcom by qi et al 2009 the finite volume advection scheme used in swave performs with the same numerical accuracy as the third order finite difference method used in swan qi et al 2009 to apply swave for the arctic global ocean we made the following modifications first a coordinate projection method is improved to solve the singularity issue at the north pole and the meridian convergence problem at high latitude second an ice induced wave attenuation parameterization is designed and added to the form of the action density flux term over geographic space in the wave spectral action balance equation the treatment and method used in the first part are derived and discussed in appendix a the formulation for the second part and design of numerical experiments are described below 2 1 ice induced wave attenuations in spherical coordinates the wave growth and dissipation are governed by the wave action density spectrum balance equation given as 1 n γ 1 r cos λ c g λ u n λ cos φ c g φ v n φ c σ n σ c θ n θ s tot σ where n is the wave action density spectrum σ is the relative frequency θ is the wave direction c σ and c θ are the wave propagation velocities in spectral space σ θ γ λ and φ are the time longitude zonal and latitude meridian respectively c g λ and c g φ are the zonal and meridian components of the wave group velocity u and v are the zonal and meridian components of the ambient ocean current velocity s tot is the source sink term given as 2 s tot s in s nl 3 s nl 4 s ds w s ds b s ds br s att ice where s in is a function for the wind induced wave growth s nl 3 is the nonlinear transfer of wave energy due to triadic three wave interactions s nl 4 is the nonlinear transfer of wave energy due to four wave interactions s ds w s ds b and s ds br are the three wave energy dissipation terms which represent the wave energy dissipation due to white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking respectively and s att ice is the ice induced wave attenuation term the empirical formula of s att ice which has been used in previous studies doble and bidlot 2013 williams et al 2013a b is a dissipation function as given as 3 n θ σ t n 1 n θ σ t n exp β c g δ t where β is the dimensional attenuation coefficient δ t t n 1 t n and subscript n presents the n th time step and c g is group velocity following the approach used in previous modeling works dumont et al 2011a b williams et al 2013a b ardhuin et al 2016 we use the ice free dispersion relation ω 2 g k tanh k d in our present model here ω is the wave angular frequency g is the gravitational acceleration k is the wave number and d is the water depth the transport speed c g of wave energy is assumed to be the same in the ice covered sea as in the open ocean dumont et al 2011a b williams et al 2013a b ardhuin et al 2016 the exponential decay function in eq 3 was developed based on the observational evidence from various types of measurements robin 1963 dean 1966 wadhams et al 1988 squire and moore 1980 liu et al 1991 with a summary given by kohout and meylan 2008 hereafter referred to as km08 these measurements show that wave energy decays exponentially with distance as it travels into the marginal ice zone on each finite control volume cv in the ice covered sea based on eq 3 the total wave energy should be damped by a factor of exp β c g δ t this approach works for the case in which the wave energy is uniformly distributed in the miz where the wave energy gradient is large however it might lead to an unrealistic result if the traveling distance of wave energy is calculated by discrete determined group velocities let us assume that n is the wave energy newly added into an ice covered cv over a time interval δ t according to eq 3 in the main loop of the model n will be attenuated after the advection in the discrete finite volume method the traveling distance δ r of n is actually the distance between the centroids of the adjacent cvs which might differ from the true distance traveled at the wave group velocity c g δ t if c g δ t δ r the width of the wave attenuation zone calculated by eq 3 can be underestimated and vice versa this is a typical numerical dissipation issue that needs to be taken into account when eq 3 is used it is more reasonable to calculate the attenuation rate by considering the distance that the wave energy really travels over one time step to do this we re designed s att ice with eq 4 given as 4 n θ σ t n 1 n θ σ t n δ r ω i 1 l n i 1 exp β δ r i δ l i where n i is the newly added wave energy to the cv l is the number of the groups of newly added wave energy to the cv δ r are the distances from a triangle s node to the triangle centroids connected to this node ω is the area of the cv with its center at an individual triangle node and bounded by the sections linked to the centroids and the mid point of the adjacent sides in the surrounding triangles δ l i are the perimeters of ω δ r i are the traveling distances of newly added wave energy which are defined as the distances between the centroids of the adjacent control volumes in eq 4 β is a function of wave period and direction as well as ice concentration and floe size in general it can be expressed as 5 β c i α d where α is a non dimensional attenuation coefficient c i is the average ice concentration of the two adjacent control volumes and d is the average diameter of the floes doble and bidlot 2013 in swave c i can be determined either from observations or ice models and d can be specified on the basis of the so called fragility parameter probability of ice breakage and the specification of the minimum and maximum floe sizes as described by dumont et al 2011a b and doble and bidlot 2013 in this study following doble and bidlot 2013 the number of the fragmentation steps m is given as 6 m l o g ε d m a x d m i n where ε determines the number of pieces that each floe will be fragmented into and is set to be 2 d m a x and d m i n are the maximum and minimum floe diameters respectively the mean floe diameter is calculated by 7 d m 0 m ε 2 f m ε m d m a x m 0 m ε 2 f m where f is the possibility of the ice floe fragment and is set to be 0 9 d 36 for d m a x and d m i n are given as 200 and 20 respectively and m 3 α describes the attenuation rate per ice floe that the wave encounters observations have suggested that this coefficient is a function of wave period t and ice floe thickness h km08 derived an elastic plate model and used it to predict a logarithm distribution for α versus t in the wave period range of 6 16 s and ice floe thickness h in a range of 0 4 3 2 m see fig 8 in km08 re drawn in fig 2 in this paper compared with those obtained from the theoretical formulations derived by wadhams et al 1988 and masson and leblond 1989 the parameterization of α derived by km08 has provided credible results for capturing observed wave attenuation in the greenland sea this method was used by perrie and hu 1996 for case studies in the labrador sea implementing km08 derived ice induced wave attenuation into wam doble and bidlot 2013 found that this model was capable of reproducing the wave measurements of buoys in the miz and nearby ice covered areas off antarctica they also reported that adding an additional sea ice drag attenuation could weaken the wave energy into the miz and thus improve the simulated waves over certain time periods the dissipation term is α v d c d h k 2 in which c d is the constant ice wave drag coefficient given as 1 1 0 2 and h is the wave height of a given wave component ardhuin et al 2016 deployed a dissipation term based on the under ice laminar friction theory liu and mollo christensen 1988 the dissipation rate is α v a k v ω c g in which k is the wave number v 1 83 1 0 6 m 2 s and represents the molecular viscosity at the freezing temperature of sea water ω is the angular frequency and c g is the group velocity an experiment for idealized cases is established to evaluate the contributions of α v d and α v a to the significant wave height in the ice covered sea the simulation results indicate that α v a is negligible while α v d significantly decreases the significant wave heights not shown here we have adopted the km08 derived parameterization for the non dimensional wave attenuation coefficient α in swave for the wave period range of 6 16 s fig 2 with the understanding that other attenuation mechanisms can be added in the future with careful validations the ice floe thickness h in km08 required to determine α can be estimated from an ice model or from satellite measurements krinner et al 2010 also proposed an empirical formulation in the form of 8 h a 0 a 1 a 2 c i min a 3 a 4 c i c i min where c i min is the minimum value of c i in real cases we assume that c i min 0 if c i 1 0 and c i min 1 0 if c i 1 0 a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 are the constants given as 0 0 0 2 2 8 1 0 2 0 respectively recently zhang et al 2016b collected the ice thickness data available in the arctic ocean for the model validation from icesat the ice cloud and land elevation satellite campaigns over the period 2003 2008 kwok et al 2009 em airbone the electromagnetic airborne measurements over the period 2001 2009 haas et al 2009 romanov atlas the atlas of ice and snow of the arctic basin and siberian shelf seas over period 1978 1989 romanov 1995 and coastal stations the drill hole fast sea ice thickness measurements at 51 coastal stations over the period 1998 2008 a proshutinsky personal communication most of these measurements include relatively large uncertainties that are not quantitatively estimated and do not cover our 2013 simulation period we collected the cryosat 2 monthly averaged remote sensing data over october 2013 and compared satellite derived sea ice thickness with eq 8 derived h values with respect to ice concentration the results show that eq 8 derived h remain around the lower bound of the observed sea ice thickness in the range of c i 1 0 however this value overestimates sea ice thickness at c i 1 0 fig 3a we also made the same comparison with the coastal stations measurements and the results are similar fig 3b in spite of these incongruences this empirical equation reasonably represents the trend of the sea ice thickness with respect to the sea ice concentration to capture the mean value of the sea ice thickness variation via the sea ice concentration recorded on either satellites or coastal stations we modified eq 8 by adjusting a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 to be 0 4 0 2 1 4 1 0 2 0 respectively fig 3 the km08 formulation for α was designed for wave periods in the range of 6 16 s for real ocean applications such as when the wave period is shorter than 6 s we used an α value of 6 s in the arctic the waves with a period of 16 s can penetrate deeply within the miz and the pack ice area squire et al 2009 which may influence both the ice properties and wave fields across the miz and in the ice covered region to take this effect into account we have adopted the empirical wave attenuation formulation suggested by squire et al 2009 for the case when wave periods exceeded 16 s see fig 2 this formulation is given as 9 β 0 02 exp 0 386 t thus the dimensional attenuation coefficient β is derived from the combination of the two wave attenuation schemes according to the wave periods generally the higher frequency wave energy decays faster while in the directional domain the wave energy is uniformly attenuated it should be noted that both attenuation mechanisms are old but they are well validated and therefore appropriate for numerical simulations new parameterization schemes can be implemented in the future with careful validations 2 2 design of numerical experiments the arctic ocean swave hereafter referred to as ao swave model was configured using the same global arctic ocean nested unstructured grid as that of ao fvcom fig 4 chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a the horizontal resolution in the computational domain varies from 2 km near the coast and around the islands to 40 km in open ocean areas the ao swave can run either using the arctic ocean subdomain grid through nesting with the global domain swave or by merging the arctic ocean subdomain grid to the global domain as a single global scale model in our experiments we ran ao swave as a single global scale model and focused our analysis in the arctic ocean subdomain only the ice concentration used in ao swave is the daily ssm i and ssmis data produced by remote sensing systems and sponsored by the nasa earth science measures program with a spatial resolution of 12 5 km wentz 2013 to quantify the contribution of the ice induced wave attenuation we made numerical experiments for cases with and without the ice induced wave attenuation in case i the ice concentration was taken into account in the wind forcing exerted at the sea surface through the following formulation 10 τ wind input τ wind real 1 c i where τ wind input is the input wind stress at the ice sea interface τ wind real is the wind stress calculated based on the national center for environmental prediction and the national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar dataset zhang et al 2016a the other parameters for s in remain the same as the default setup for swave in this case the experiment was made with inclusion of the parameterization for ice induced wave attenuation in case ii the ocean was treated as ice free and the experiment did not include the ice concentration in the wind forcing field or the ice induced wave attenuation parameterization in case iii the ice concentration was taken into account for the wind input term in the action conservation eqs 1 and 2 but no ice induced wave attenuation was considered for all 3 cases directions were divided into 36 equally distributed angular bins and frequencies were distributed exponentially in 40 bins in the range of 0 04 1 0 hz we have adopted the wave partitioning program from wwiii and implemented it in swave this program was used to separate windsea and swell waves in the wave simulation the model results were compared with observed wave data available at buoys in the arctic ocean and adjacent regions the locations of the fixed buoys are listed in table 1 and shown in fig 1 our major interests are to examine how the sea ice influences the wave energy distribution in the arctic ocean and to evaluate the ao swave performance for this purpose we ran the simulations for the three cases for the period from 00 00 00 june 1 to 24 00 00 october 31 2013 during which time wave measurements were available at buoys 48211 48213 and 48214 all the buoy data were downloaded from the database of national data buoy center http sdf ndbc noaa gov and the national centers for environmental information https www ncei noaa gov significant wave height swh data from the jason 2 program ftp avisoftp cnes fr aviso pub jason 2 were also used for comparisons in the north atlantic ocean and north pacific ocean the model was also run for the period from 00 00 00 june 1 to 24 00 00 october 31 2014 during which time wave data were collected in the beaufort sea using three surface wave instrument floats with tracking buoys swifts smith and thomson 2016 3 model assessment 3 1 model data comparisons in the bering sea of the pan arctic ocean the model data comparisons were made for stations 46070 and 46075 in the bering sea the pacific ocean of the pan arctic region and the jason 2 satellite derived data in the high latitude region between 55 n to 66 n the purpose of these comparisons was to determine if the model can reliably simulate ocean surface waves on the pan arctic scale which is essential if swell waves in the arctic ocean were to be discussed the comparisons were first made for significant wave heights swh and peak periods t peak and then for wind sea and swell waves for case i the model data comparisons shown in fig 5 suggest that the model is capable of reproducing the swh temporal variability observed at these two stations with correlation coefficients of 0 75 and 0 91 biases of 0 10 m and 0 19 m and root mean square error rmse of 0 82 m and 0 56 m at 46070 and 46075 respectively table 2 the correlation was estimated with a significant testing at a p value of 0 01 the linear regression function of the computed swhs with respect to observed swhs had a slope of 0 9 with an intercept of 0 13 m at 46070 and 0 03 m at 46075 swave showed relatively larger errors in t peak than in swh although the model did reasonably resolve the temporal variability of t peak the linear regression function of the computed t peak with respect to the observed t peak has slopes of 0 31 and 0 33 with intercepts of 5 47 s and 5 18 s and correlation coefficients of 0 28 and 0 34 at 46070 and 46075 respectively table 3 the bias was around 1 0 1 32 s with rsmes of 2 78 and 3 17 s respectively following the wave spectra partition method introduced by hanson and phillips 2001 hanson et al 2009 and tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 we also compared the simulated and observed significant wave heights of the windsea swhws and swell swhsw at station 46075 fig 6 the correlation coefficients between model simulated and observed swhws values are shown to exceed 0 74 the model over predicts the observed swhws in the bering sea during the storm events in september october which is a key reason for a relatively large bias and rmse reported in table 4 the model is also reasonably capable of reproducing the swhsw at this station fig 6 in particular it accurately reproduces the swell peaks in june and september but under predicts swhsw in late october observed swhsw values exhibit high frequency variability which appear to be smoothed out in the simulated swhsw this is partially due to insufficient resolution in the wind forcing in time and space and intrinsic model biases such as inadequacies in the basic source term physics in eq 2 these factors contribute to the relatively low correlation coefficients between model simulated and observed swhsw values table 4 we also repeated the model data comparison for cases ii and iii without the inclusion of sea ice in the surface forcing nor the ice induced wave attenuation and the results are mostly identical the maximum difference in the swhs between the cases with and without these sea ice formulations is less than 0 2 m with an overall bias of 0 02 m this is not surprising since these two stations were located around 55 08 n which is outside of the permanent ice coverage areas in the arctic additional comparisons were made with the jason 2 satellite derived swh hereafter referred to as swh j2 in the ao swave computational domain up to 66 n the simulated swhs for cases i and ii were interpolated to the sites with swh j2 data a scatter plot was created for the simulated swh via swh j2 in fig 7 with the statistics given in table 5 in both cases the correlation coefficients between swh and swh j2 are 0 77 and 0 78 with biases being close to zero and rmses of 0 55 m and 0 56 m respectively for cases i and ii the linear regression function of computed swhs with respect to observed swh j2 has the same slope of 0 84 and intercepts of 0 29 m and 0 28 m it is evident that neither the inclusion nor exclusion of ice induced attenuation significantly affects the wave simulation results in the pan arctic region though the swh tends to be underestimated in case i and overestimated in case ii the disparities between model simulated and observed values of swhs t peak swh ws and swh sw are caused by multiple issues associated with model physics the inaccuracy of external forcing and the parameterization of empirical model coefficients the wind forcing used to drive the model was interpolated from the ncep reanalysis product with a horizontal resolution of 1 9 degree which is not able to resolve the small to meso scale spatial wind variability or short term variability of the significant wave heights and frequencies observed on the buoys insufficient resolutions for wave frequency and directional domains may also cause errors in magnitude and direction of the group velocity and thus the timing of the arrival of swells at observed stations the simulation accuracy can be also significantly affected by the parameterizations used for s in particularly for the growth of the waves these issues should be addressed in the future when ao swave is placed into operational forecasts 3 2 model data comparisons at three stations in the arctic ocean during the simulation period only three stations 48211 48213 and 48214 on the northern coast of alaska were available for comparison with model results this coastal area is fully covered by ice during winter and spring of each year and intermittently contains ice during early periods of the summers the wave records at these three buoys started in july after the area was free of ice to investigate the impact of the ice in the interior arctic ocean on the swhs and t peak at the three buoys on the alaska shelf we compared the model results with the buoy observations for cases i ii and iii taking swh as an example the model performance was assessed using the model skill coefficient msc defined as 11 msc 1 i 1 i n swh m i swh o i 2 i 1 i n swh m i swh o swh o i swh o 2 where swh m i and swh o i are the model simulated and observed swhs respectively swh o is the mean value of swh o i n is the total number of the measurements and the subscript i is the i th measurement record the performance is perfect when msc 1 but very poor when msc 0 table 6 summarizes the msc values for the three cases the best is case i which takes into account the ice influence on surface forcing and ice induced wave attenuation the worst is case ii which assumed ice free conditions since the buoys were located in the ice free area the msc difference is about 0 1 0 29 between cases i and ii and about 0 05 0 26 between cases i and iii a similar conclusion can be derived from comparisons of the correlation coefficients and rmse table 6 overall case i shows the best performance swh is overestimated in case ii and case iii and underestimated in case i the performance of the ao swave for cases i ii and iii can also be viewed in the model data comparison of the time series of swh shown in fig 8 over the period during which the observed swhs are available the model computed swhs for all three cases show similar performance levels at the crests but not at the troughs good model data agreement is evident at the troughs in case i but the model computed swh is significantly higher than the observed data for cases ii and iii although no wave data were recorded over the period from june to mid july the three buoy areas were intermittently covered by thin ice as a result the model computed swhs remain near zero for case i ignoring either ice induced wave attenuation or ice reduced surface wind forcing over the open ocean can significantly overestimate swh at station 48211 the results for cases ii and iii show relatively high values of swh at levels 0 1 m with maximum values up to 1 2 m and 0 8 m respectively similar evidence also occurs at stations 48213 and 48214 in late june the model predicts a peak swh at a level of 0 3 m at stations 48213 and 48214 in case i but this peak is exaggerated by as much as to 2 0 m in case ii and 1 8 m in case iii we also compared model simulated and observed peak periods at 48211 48213 and 48214 for the three cases fig 9 with the bias correlation rmse and msc shown in table 7 the performance of case i is much better than cases ii and iii based on the absolute values of bias rmse and msc case i is the best and case iii is the worst at 48211 the correlation coefficient in case i is 0 31 but is negative in case ii and case iii similarly the msc is remarkably higher in case i than in case ii and case iii at these three stations over a certain time period cases ii and iii exhibit some unrealistic longer peak periods that were not evident in the observations unrealistic peaks do not occur in case i it is clear that restricting the wind input and attenuation of swells to the ice covered zone play a critical role in capturing the period of surface wave simulation at these three stations the comparison results are summarized using the taylor diagrams shown in fig 10 as indicated by tables 6 and 7 both correlation coefficients and rmses show that the case i exhibited a better overall performance than case ii and case iii especially for tpeak fig 10 shows that compared with the standard deviation std of observed swh case 1 performs better than cases ii and iii for example at 48211 the std of the observed swh is 0 50 and the stds of model simulated swhs are 0 47 0 41 and 0 40 respectively for cases i ii and iii 3 3 model data comparisons with swift buoys in the arctic ocean surface wave instrument floats with tracking swifts were purposely designed to measure the wave fields in the arctic ocean wave data were collected by three swifts in the beaufort sea in 2014 smith and thomson 2016 the drift tracks of these three swifts are shown in fig 1 of smith and thomson 2016 and replotted as fig 11 the gray image over the sea is the ice concentration c i on september 1 from daily ssm i and ssmis data compared with the fraction of sea ice cover also is the ice concentration in fig 1 of smith and thomson 2016 c i was obviously high in the vicinity of 155 w 75 n both swifts 10 and 11 were deployed on july 27 from the r v ukpik in the open ocean and shared similar tracks until september 1 when swift 10 traveled north and was trapped in the ice covered sea until september 15 while swift 11 drifted west swift 15 was deployed on august 5 in the partial ice cover and was caught in the miz until it was recovered these swift data are used to validate the model results fig 12 a c shows the time series of swh recorded by swift 10 11 and 15 and the corresponding simulation results respectively in which the ice induced wave attenuation is fully considered table 8 shows the performance of the model compared with the swift data the red and black squares in fig 12 a c are the swifts recorded swhs and the corresponding simulated swhs respectively while the lines show the 9 day moving averages from september 1 to september 15 swift 10 was caught in the ice covered sea but the daily ssm i and ssmis data did not show any ice along this track thus the simulation results show obvious overestimation during these 15 days for the other days the moving average shows good agreement between simulation and observations while the model underestimates swh before august 8 swift 11 drifted on an ice free sea surface and the daily ssm i and ssmis data did not show any ice thus the model can accurately represent the swh under these conditions and the correlation coefficient and msc are very high the model also shows underestimation at high swhs but the overall performance is good swift 15 was deployed in the ice covered sea and recorded the swh in the miz fig 12 d shows the ice concentration during the track according to the daily ssm i and ssmis data the simulation results reproduced the trend of the swh in the miz well although the available observed swh data from swift 15 are scarce on average the simulation results underestimate swh before august 10 and exhibit overestimations after this time the trend is similar between simulation and observations and the parameters in table 8 also show that the performance of the model is good the simulation results accurately met the observed swh values along the track of swift 11 because the ice concentration along the track is zero which corresponds well with the real ice state when swifts were trapped by ice specifically the whole track of swift 15 and partial track of swift 10 higher errors were experienced however the simulation results still conform to the observed data at swift 10 and 15 well the resolution and accuracy of the ice concentration is a key impact factor in the swh simulations comparing fig 1 of smith and thomson 2016 and fig 11 there are obvious differences between the daily ssm i and ssmis sea ice data and the daily amsr2 sea ice data thus it is possible that inaccurate ice forcing and poor resolution of the ice fields are the main factors in the differences between model and observations 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of ice induced wave attenuation on wave generation and evolution to evaluate the impact of ice induced wave attenuation on wave generation and evolution in the ice free coastal region we selected station 48214 as a comparison site for the model computed wave vector histories for cases i ii and iii over the period from july 6 to july 19 during which this location was intermittently covered by sea ice the analysis was done for both windsea and swell fig 13 buoy 48214 was dominated by weak southerly winds during july 6 northeasterly winds with a maximum speed of 9 3 m s during july 7 11 and then south southeasterly winds with a maximum speed of 8 3 m s during july 12 19 fig 13a this site was within the marginal ice zone during july 7 14 but remained ice free after july 15 fig 13b ice coverage attenuated the wave energy and reduced the energy of wind forcing over the ocean and thus directly influenced the windsea generation and evolution for case i fig 13c in this case the wind waves were generated on july 7 when the ice concentration was 0 15 after generation during its development period the wave energy gradually downshifted from high to low frequencies and then rapidly dissipated when the ice concentration increased to 0 24 on july 8 the windsea was regenerated again when the ice concentration dropped to 0 16 on july 9 and experienced additional high to low frequency downshifting during its evolution until july 10 during this period the ice concentration increased to 0 5 such variability in the windsea energy continued until the site became ice free on july 13 after that the windsea followed a regular growth pattern in the miz the model results suggest that the energy dissipation of the windsea was generally accompanied by an apparent frequency increase as the ice concentration increased actual shifting of the spectral peak frequency occurred as the result of nonlinear wave wave interactions which were originally elucidated by hasselmann 1962 and verified by the jonswap experiment of hasselmann et al 1973 relatively low ice concentrations appear to result in an upshift of the energy spectra because the ice induced wave attenuation is apparently more effective at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies in case ii without the ice induced wave attenuation and the blocking effect of the ice on the open ocean surface forcing the model computed windsea is just a result of normal wind generation fig 13d a northeasterly windsea developed when the northeasterly wind appeared on july 7 during the wave evolution period the energy of this windsea increased when the wind speed became strong and its frequency shifted from high to low the windsea grew steadily as the northeasterly wind continued for 5 days reaching a relatively stable peak period of 5 s after july 10 case iii considered the blocking effect of the ice on the open ocean surface forcing but not the ice induced wave attenuation thus although the development of the windsea was quite similar to that observed in case i the wave energy reached higher values at a lower peak frequency as the ice concentration increased the change in frequency was not as remarkable as that in case i fig 13e the energy of this windsea was at most about 3 times higher than that of case i and it developed even when the ice concentration dropped to zero these features were more evident later in time suggesting that the ice induced wave attenuation played a key role in the wave dissipation and the apparent downshifting of the peak frequency in case ii by comparison in case iii only nonlinear wave wave interactions affected the downshifting of the peak frequency energy therefore the process occurred at an apparently slower rate development and evolution of swell waves significantly differed among the three cases with and without inclusion of the ice the number and intensity of these swell groups are considerably distinct in case i before july 15 no remarkable swell groups were detected at station 48124 but some swells with very small amplitudes occurred over the periods of july 6 7 and july 13 14 respectively fig 13c although the amplitudes were of the order of 0 01 m the characteristics of the swell groups and frequency upshift were still visible these tiny swells were the products of ice induced wave attenuation after july 12 the ice completely disappeared and the site was dominated by two groups of swells groups i 1 and i 2 which propagated northeastward with amplitudes of 0 6 m and periods of 6 8 s when the ice induced wave attenuation and the blocking effect of the ice on the ocean surface forcing were removed the location exhibited different types of swells at all times fig 13d during the first four days one group of swells was detected group ii 1 which propagated southward with an amplitude of 0 6 m and periods of 10 15 s after july 10 several groups of swells were found which mainly propagated southward with amplitudes of 0 05 1 0 m and periods of 5 10 s there are too many wave groups to be individually analyzed among them groups ii 2 ii 3 and ii 4 in case ii were also clearly detected as groups iii 2 iii 3 and iii 4 in case iii if the blocking effect of the ice on the ocean surface wind forcing was considered but not ice induced wave attenuation case iii some swell groups in case ii either disappeared or weakened swells inside the red polygon during the first five days in case iii the site was dominated by one group of the southward propagating swells group iii 1 with an amplitude of about 0 55 m and periods of 10 s group iii 1 corresponded to groups ii 1 after july 11 three distinct groups of swells were detected groups iii 3 and iii 4 are the same as groups i 1 and i 2 in case i groups ii 3 and ii 4 in case ii traveled from the southwest group iii 2 was identified in both case ii and case iii though in case ii it was partially lost because the spectrum had too many other interacting energy components this swell group group ii 2 and group iii 2 may correspond to the tiny swells during the period of july 10 12 in case i which was effectively attenuated by the ice cover in summary swells from the ice free ocean area in the southern region of the domain were detected in all three cases case iii removed swells that were generated in the ice covered area in case ii the complicated swell groups in the red polygon in case ii in addition case i attenuated swells that were either generated in the ice covered area or traveled though the ice covered sea groups iii 1 and iii 2 we used a swell tracking method hanson and phillips 2001 described in appendix b to locate the generation location and time of group i 1 for case i and group iii 2 for case iii group i 1 was detected at station 48214 during the period july 15 17 the original source of this swell group is shown in fig 14a indicating that this swell group was generated at 18 00 00 july 9 a persistent wind field in the northwest pacific ocean with a speed of 10 m s developed a robust swell group which traveled through bering strait and reached station 48214 group iii 2 was originally generated in the ice free area of the arctic ocean around 10 00 00 july 7 and traveled through the ice covered area to reach station 48214 fig 14b this swell group represents an artificial result because the effect of the ice induced wave attenuation was ignored in the case iii wave simulation 4 2 an ice retreat wave growth positive feedback mechanism in our study implementing wave induced attenuation allowed the wave energy to propagate into the miz and the ice covered area as the ice concentration increased and the waves encountered more ice floes the wave energy rapidly dissipated as its travel increasing distances into the miz increased since short waves attenuated more rapidly than long waves as the waves propagated deeper into the miz the peak of the wave energy tended to shift to lower frequencies in the energy spectrum under conditions where the daily ice fields are derived from remote sensing data and the wave field is from simulation results an ice retreat wave growth positive feedback mechanism can be further proposed and analyzed the ice free sea surface area increases with the retreating ice which directly promotes the waves growth in turn wave dissipation can induce ice floe breakage and thus accelerate the melting of ice and thus the retreat of the ice here a brief discussion is given on a the impacts of the ice retreat on wave growth and ice breakage and b the influence of ice breakage on ice melting 4 2 1 impacts of ice retreat on wave growth and ice breakage williams et al 2013a introduced a method to estimate the conditions whereby the waves in the miz can break ice floes the basic idea is to compare the significant strain amplitude e s for the ice floes with the critical breaking strain ε c through a criterion given as 12 e s e c ε c 2 log p c where e c is the critical significant strain amplitude and p c is the probability criterion specified as p c e 2 0 14 ε c is given as 13 ε c σ c y where y is the strain modulus equaling 14 y y 0 1 3 51 v b 1 gpa with y 0 10 gpa and σ c is the flexural strength equaling to 15 σ c σ 0 exp 5 88 v b where v b is the brine volume and σ 0 is a constant specified as 1 76 mpa in our experiments v b is assumed to be 0 1 in our approach e s was calculated from swh and t peak was deduced from the wave spectrum assuming that ice breakage events happen in the direction of the highest wave energy θ m and only the wave energy within the direction segment θ m θ π 2 contribute to ice breaking we can calculate e s by 16 e s 2 θ m π 2 θ m π 2 0 04 1 s ω θ cos θ m θ h 2 k ice 3 γ k d ω d θ where h is the thickness of the ice floe γ 0 8 is the transmission coefficient for waves traveling from the water into the ice ω is the angular frequency k is the wave number k ice is the wave number of the ice plate and is taken as the positive real root as given by williams et al 2013a specifically their eq a 7 following eqs 12 16 we can estimate the average value of e s in the arctic ocean as examples the results for july and september 2013 are represented in fig 15 in july the significant ice breakage was mainly located within the miz on the north atlantic side of the arctic ocean where the breaking event can occur in the area with ice concentration c i being up to 0 6 fig 15 upper panels although most of the entire arctic ocean was still covered by sea ice it did have ice free areas in the chukchi sea and laptev sea and ice breakage occurred in these two regions by september a large portion of the arctic had become ice free providing potentially long fetch conditions for wave generation and growth the ice breakage area in the chukchi and laptev seas became larger and extended to the beaufort sea and east siberian sea with rapid ice melting the miz on the atlantic side retreated toward the arctic accompanied by an intensification of ice breakage fig 15 lower panels in order to quantify the influence of the ice retreat on wave growth and ice breakage we divided the arctic ocean region with latitudes 66 n into three sector zones sector i 30 w 90 e sector ii 90 e 180 e and sector iii 120 w 180 w fig 1 for simplicity sectors i ii iii are hereafter referred to as s i s ii and s iii respectively in each sector we estimated the ratios of the open water area ω free and ice breakage area ω break to the total sector area ω s fig 16a c hereafter we defined these two ratios as r free ω free ω s and r break ω break ω s we also calculated the averaged swh and t peak in the open water in each sector and related them to the percentages of ice free and ice breakage areas fig 16d f the imaginary lines refer to the variation trend of swh or t peak before or after ω free reaches the peak values the responses of r break to change in r free differed significantly in these three sectors in s i fig 16a r free increased from 0 51 to 0 84 during the time period june 1 september 20 however r break did not follow the change in the ice free area oscillating around 0 06 during june early july dropping to around 0 03 in mid july and then varying around 0 03 0 06 until late september after september 20 the ice formation caused r free to start to decrease but r break did not drop instead it showed an increase in s ii fig 16b r break generally followed the same growth and decline trends as r free although with a 0 5 month time delay r break increased from nearly 0 to 0 15 as r free grew from nearly 0 to 0 48 over the period june early october it then rapidly decreased toward 0 as r free dropped to 0 over the october period in s iii fig 16c r break showed an obvious increasing trend during both the increasing phase and the early decreasing phase of r free except in late october when r break began to decrease theoretically speaking wind generated wave growth is the consequence of ice retreat and the increase of open water which is also the reason for increased ice breakage area in s i the linear regression lines of swh and t peak suggest that regardless of how the period of r free increased or decreased both amplitudes and periods of the surface waves show overall increasing trends during the june october period the rates of increase exhibited two time phases the first is a gradual increase during the r free increasing period and the second a rapid increase during the r free decreasing period in this sector changes in r break follow changes in swh and t peak but do not directly correlate with the change in r free in s iii the increase of r break follows change in swh rather than change in r free in s ii changes in swh and t peak share the same trend as r free and therefore change in r break follows change in r free from june through october on the atlantic side of the arctic ocean s i because r free remains above 0 5 it is clear that fetch does not restrict wave growth therefore wave ice interactions can remain active and are limited by the wind field over the time period from june to october on the pacific side of arctic ocean s iii the fetch is a critical limit on wave growth for surface waves swh can increase with increasing fetch and during the early ice formation period as r free kept decreasing toward the end of october swh generally decreased and r break dropped rapidly to 0 02 while r free decreased to 0 14 s ii is geographically between s i and s iii where fetch plays a critical role in limiting wave growth in this region the temporal change in r break is directly correlated with variability in r free 4 2 2 influence of ice breakage on ice melting we evaluate the influence of ice breakage on ice melting by examining the change in ice concentration c i before and after the occurrence of breakage events during this study c i was limited to be within the range of 0 4 0 6 when ice breakage occurred the averaged anomaly value for c i over a 5 day period is calculated and shown in fig 17 which includes the day when the ice breakage occurred plus two days before and after using the ice breakage day as a reference the difference in c i relative to that day was 0 16 and 0 21 one day before and after the occurrence of the ice breakage event respectively this implies 31 increase in the ice melting rate after the breaking of the ice over a 2 day period the differences are 0 27 and 0 34 indicating an average rate increase of 26 by contrast the ice melting rate after c i reaches the range 0 4 0 6 does not accelerate if there is no ice breakage this estimate suggests that ice breakage can accelerate the ice melting rate through a positive feedback process 4 3 advantage of the improved algorithm to estimate s att ice in section 2 we introduced a new algorithm to improve the estimation of s att ice to evaluate this new method we compare the monthly averaged values for swh and ω break between the traditional and improved algorithms described in eqs 3 and 9 for the sake of discussion we denote the traditional and improved wave induced attenuation algorithms as t wa and i wa for example fig 18 shows the monthly average values for swh and ω break obtained from t wa for september 2013 and the differences in the results obtained from i wa compared with the results shown in fig 15 the t wa approach produces higher values for swh and deeper penetrating areas into the miz especially on the atlantic side fig 18a the differences are mostly located within the miz where the ice concentration was higher than 0 6 the t wa results indicate that swh can even reach 0 2 m in regions where the latitude is higher than 85 n and where the ice concentration is higher than 0 8 given that the ice concentration was close to 1 it is unreasonable for the wave energy to still be noteworthy based on the field measurement data kohout et al 2014 estimated the decay rate for waves swh to be 1 07 1 0 6 m 1 after the surface waves penetrated into the miz when swh 0 2 m we also estimated the decay rate for swh from t wa and i wa respectively by measuring the distance over which swh decayed from 0 2 m to 0 1 m in the direction of the wave energy propagation these results are 4 1 0 7 m 1 for t wa and 1 13 1 0 6 m 1 for i wa the decay rate derived from t wa was significantly lower than that derived from the field measurements this implies that given the same amplitude of swh then t wa requires more than twice the distance to attenuate the wave energy it is clear that t wa can significantly overestimate the wave penetration distance into the miz the decay rate derived from i wa is of the same order of magnitude as that derived from the field measurement data further comparisons were made for the change of temporally and spatially averaged swh t peak and e s over the entire simulation period and the ice covered region with respect to ice concentrations in increments of 0 1 c i fig 19 as c i increases swh decreases faster for t wa than for i wa similarly t peak showed a higher rate of increase for i wa than for the t wa case correspondingly e s showed a faster decay for i wa than for the t wa case on average ice breakage does not happen when c i 0 4 in the i wa case but persists until c i reaches 0 55 for the t wa case 5 summary and conclusions fvcom swave was modified by a the inclusion of a parameterization for ice induced wave attenuation with a newly designed dissipation term in the wave spectral action balance equation and b the development and implementation of a coordinate projection method for sea surface wave simulation at high latitudes this modified version of the unstructured grid surface wave model was configured within the global fvcom grid to examine the influence of ice induced wave attenuation on waves windsea and swells propagating into and out of the miz in the arctic ocean numerical experiments were carried out for three cases to estimate the effect of the inclusion of the ice induced wave attenuation on the wave simulations and the blocking effect of the ice on ocean surface forcing we found that simulation results improved when the ice induced attenuation and the blocking effect of the ice on the surface forcing mechanisms were included in the model system for simulating surface waves the global fvcom model is capable of reproducing the wave evolution trend in the arctic ocean both in open waters and ice covered areas in particular the process oriented experiment suggests that the ice induced wave attenuation plays a key role in the dissipation of windsea and swell waves in the ice covered region ignoring this process can lead to biases in simulations of both windsea and swells the new wave attenuation algorithm introduced in our study which takes into account the grid dependent numerical dissipation error can provide more realistic estimates of wave attenuation in the miz and in the ice breakage area using simulated wave spectra an empirical method derived by williams et al 2013a was introduced to estimate the probability for wave induced ice breakage in the miz the results show that wave induced ice breakage mostly occurs in regions where ice concentration is lower than 0 4 in this study we examined the importance of fetch on wave ice interactions and its relationship with wave field and ice breakage we found that the wind generated wave growth is limited by fetch as found in pioneering field experiments like jonswap by hasselmann et al 1973 and numerous efforts since that time especially in sectors ii and iii wave induced ice breakage consistently occurs more frequently on the atlantic side of the arctic ocean because the vast expanse of open water in the north atlantic provides essentially unlimited fetch conditions for wave generation on the pacific side of arctic although the fetch limits wave growth the magnitude of the surface waves can still intensify during the ice formation period and thus the wave ice interactions can be active until the middle of october when wave energy and ice breakage are both limited by fetch inside the arctic ocean particularly in the region between 90 e and 180 e fetch plays a critical role in limiting wave growth in this region the temporal change of the ice breakage area is directly correlated with the variability of the open water area the notable difference between the ice melting rates before or after the ice breakage events suggests that ice breakage has a positive impact on ice melting which supports the ice retreat wave growth positive

wave energy is calculated as a matrix composed of the sum of the energy segments for each frequency and direction this was done by the conservation equation for spectral action density used in modern state of art third generation wave models wwiii and swan booij et al 1999 tolman et al 2002 tolman 2009 tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 qi et al 2009 bidlot 2012 following wwiii and swan the wave energy spectrum in swave is defined as discrete directional components with the spherical convention defining a reference direction at the local east and each component is calculated as a scalar when a local gradient is calculated this scalar assumption treats the corresponding vector components at two adjacent cells or nodes as having the same direction li 2012 as waves propagate toward the pole the meridian convergence induces an increasing directional difference between the local east directions of two adjacent nodes li 2012 tolman and the wavewatchiii development group 2014 meridian convergence at the north pole makes the spherical coordinate equations of swave invalid chen et al 2013 there longitude does not have a unique value and wave direction cannot be defined which is a singularity issue at the pole when the global fvcom was developed the singularity issue at the pole was solved by using the spherical stereographic conversion coordinate system chen et al 2009 gao et al 2011 chen et al 2013 however because of the directional feature of wave energy the spherical stereographic conversion coordinate system needs to be modified and deployed to the global wave model two popular approaches are widely used to avoid the north pole problem in the spherical coordinate system one is the so called grid rotation by which a new spherical grid is defined on a rotated coordinate system with the north pole on land e g mom eby and holloway 1994 pacanowski and griffies 2000 this method is simple and costless in terms of needed code modification but as pointed out by pacanowski and griffies 2000 it may make the post processing of model results complicated particularly for current vectors the other is the pole stereographic projection by which all variables in the spherical coordinate system are projected to the well defined cartesian polar coordinate system so that the governing equations can be solved while avoiding the singularity issue at the north pole and the limitation due to the convergence of longitude lines phillips 1957 this method is accurate but limited to a regional ocean multi projection methods are required to cover northern and southern hemispheres for the global ocean following the spherical stereographic conversion coordinate system at the north pole in global ao fvcom gao et al 2011 we configured swave with symmetric triangular grids within 13 circles originating from the north pole 8 triangles in the first circle connecting to the north pole and progressively more triangles in succeeding circles with up to 148 triangles in the thirteenth circle this is the first time that fvcom swave is extended to the north pole the original global ao fvcom scalars e g temperature salinity etc were first calculated based on a control volume composed of 8 triangles connected to the pole on stereographic coordinates fig a 1b and then converted back to the spherical coordinates fig a 1a in common wave models the wave spectra were dispersed into scalar bins and the bins still retain directional properties if the wave spectra were simply treated as scalars in the spherical coordinate the directions of the currents would not match the directions of the wave spectra in the control volume with its center at the north pole to avoid this issue the stereographic coordinate system was designed for the 8 triangles connected to the north pole fig a 1 in which the northward direction of the north pole points to 180 the directions of the wave spectrum ambient current velocity and wave group velocity should be uniformly unified to this stereographic coordinate the advection of the wave energy spectrum is first simulated in this coordinate system and then converted back to the spherical coordinates this approach was directly adopted from the spherical coordinate fvcom system and the detailed mathematics can be found in chen et al 2013 taking advantage of the flexibility of the unstructured grid this method allows swave to run directly on the spherical coordinates for basin or even global scale ocean applications without the need for grid rotation or multi projections in addition to the singularity issue the meridian convergence induces an increasing directional difference between the local east directions of two adjacent nodes this occurs when the difference in longitude between two adjacent nodes in the control volume is larger than 18 0 n d where n d is the number of angular bins in this study n d was set to 36 and 18 0 n d 5 and adjacent nodes with latitudes lower than 85 n are not impacted by meridian convergence li 2012 introduced a method to solve this problem for wave models specifically the transfer of the local east is mapped to east as defined in the form a 1 θ ˆ sgn cos φ sin λ cos 1 cos λ sin φ 1 cos λ sin φ 2 in high latitude regions the major issue is the mismatch of the local east directions between the coordinate systems of two adjacent nodes this issue however does not happen everywhere on the varying resolution unstructured grid system thus to reduce the computational demand a simple criterion was implemented in swave in swave the treatment starts with a latitude threshold according to the property of the mesh grid the treatment is only made when the latitude difference between two adjacent nodes is less that the threshold value with the modification being made according to the latitude difference between two adjacent nodes this approach takes advantage of the unstructured grid s ability to improve computational efficiency in global wave simulations in our method both the local east directions of the group velocity and the wave spectrum are transferred when the criterion is satisfied in particular assuming a and b are two adjacent nodes before computing the wave energy flux between a and b we first calculate the longitude difference between the adjacent nodes using a 2 θ ˆ θ ˆ b θ ˆ a if θ ˆ 18 0 n d the direction difference between the local east directions of two adjacent nodes should not be ignored in this case the treatment should be made the individual wave direction segment is equal to 36 0 n d the corresponding direction segments of a and b are determined by the rotated angles θ ˆ a and θ ˆ b given as a 3 k a k b δ k k b round θ ˆ 360 n d where k a and k b are the direction segment indexes at a and b and δ k is the direction segment difference due to the longitude difference between a and b round x is a function that rounds off the quantity in the brackets to the nearest integer the advection of wave energy is then calculated based on the corresponding direction segments to test the modified swave code we conducted an idealized case experiment under a constant wind forcing condition the experiment was made on a flat bottom computational domain with a center at the north pole in the spherical coordinate system the domain was configured with an unstructured triangular grid with a minimum horizontal resolution of 10 km and a boundary at 78 n fig a 2 the mean water depth is 1000 m everywhere this is a barotropic ocean case with no sea ice the model was driven by a constant wind of 5 m s parallel to 90 e 90 w meridian at the sea surface fig a 2 and ran for a total of 5 days to validate the model we ran this idealized case by turning on and off the correction methodology listed above and comparisons were made for these two runs fig a 3 shows snapshots of the distributions of the wave direction at the end of the 24 h simulation with and without the inclusion of the correction treatment in this case driven by a uniformly distributed constant wind the surface waves should propagate in the same direction everywhere it is clear that without the correction the surface waves tend to converge in the region where the latitude is higher than 89 degrees with an unrealistic direction at the north pole fig a 3 upper panel the energy convergence in the high latitude region and the energy accumulation at the north pole become worse with longer integration times these issues disappear after the correction treatments are turned on fig a 3 lower panel this result indicates that the treatment method implemented into swave is capable of correcting issues caused by the meridian convergence and north pole singularity appendix b method to track the origin of swell waves in space and time in the ocean surface waves disperse and evolve into swell after propagating out of their generation area in general swell waves are weakly dissipated and can propagate across an ocean basin over a spatial scale of 104 km barber and ursell 1948 snodgrass et al 1966 munk et al 1963 small amplitude swell waves can be persistent with an energy decay e folding scale of 2 104 km ardhuin et al 2009 half of earth s perimeter therefore swells generated in one region may carry wave energy across the entire ocean alves 2006 according to wave dispersion theory swell waves with different frequencies belonging to the same swell group arrive at the same location at different times the wave group velocity can be determined by either c g g 2 ω or c g d δ t where d is the distance between locations where waves were observed and generated g is the gravitational acceleration ω is the angular frequency of the wave and δ t is the time over which the wave has traveled the slope shown in fig 14 of the swell vector df dt is related to the travel distance of the swell group df dt g 4 π d and therefore d g 4 π dt df the original time at which the swell was generated is t 0 f s dt df where f s is the peak frequency at the time when this swell group was first observed given d θ the mean swell direction λ s longitude and φ s latitude at the observation site the location λ g φ g where the swell group was originally generated can be determined by b 1 λ g sin 1 sin λ s cos ω d sin ω d cos λ s cos θ b 2 φ g φ s sin 1 sin ω d sin θ cos λ g b 3 ω d d r e where r e is the earth s radius and ω d is the angular travel distance of the wave 
23999,the role of open boundary conditions in modelling the seasonal variation of the north equatorial current bifurcation latitude nbl is studied based on a linear rossby wave model 1 5 layer reduced gravity model and hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom for a regional ocean model that covers the western pacific it is found that the seasonal variation of the nbl can be well reproduced as long as the data at the open boundary is provided by the corresponding basin experiment no matter where the location is however the south north migration of nbl as well as its peak seasons is not properly simulated if we apply other types of data at the open boundary as its location is close to the west sensitivity experiments indicate that the bad performance is attributed to the over specification error and incomplete adjustment of interaction between wind forcing and westward propagating signals from incompatible open boundary data the performance gets better as we set the open boundary at proper location and choose suitable open boundary condition these conclusions can be extended to the simulations of low latitude western boundary currents keywords north equatorial current bifurcation open boundary conditions regional model seasonal variation 1 introduction it has become increasingly evident in recent decades that the oceanic mesoscale submesoscale processes have a profound influence on the multi scale ocean atmosphere interactions and thus the global climate farneti et al 2010 qiu and chen 2013 zhang et al 2014 ma et al 2016 su et al 2018 the fundamental requirement for properly simulating these processes is to increase the spatial resolution of ocean models and it will definitely require huge computational resources particularly for running a high resolution global ocean circulation model a practical way is to adopt a regional ocean circulation model which enables us to improve the model s resolution substantially and adequately reproduce the relevant processes like mesoscale submesoscale eddies xiu and chai 2011 qiu et al 2014 luo et al 2016 sasaki et al 2017 except for high spatial temporal resolutions of the model another important prerequisite is that the model must be capable of reproducing the observed oceanic background such as the large scale ocean circulation and the associated changes of mixed layer and thermocline it has been suggested in previous studies that the oceanic background bears significant seasonal to inter annual variations and will considerably modulate the mesoscale submesoscale processes e g hole et al 2010 qiu and chen 2010 chern 2011 waterman and jayne 2011 therefore a high resolution model should get qualified in reproducing the large scale ocean circulation before properly simulating the mesoscale submesoscale processes with respect to a regional model it may encounter additional difficulties to simulate well the large scale characteristics of the ocean circulation in the low latitude pacific ocean for instance the seasonal to inter annual variations of the western boundary currents like kuroshio and mindanao current are determined by both local and remote forcing lukas 1988 qiu and lukas 1996 kim et al 2004 zhai et al 2014 that is except for local wind heat flux in the western pacific the forcing from remote area central eastern pacific will exert significant effects on the western pacific via propagations of planetary waves like the rossby waves meyers 1979 qiu and joyce 1992 especially as the origin of the kuroshio the north equatorial current nec bifurcation is suggested to play an important role in the partition of the water mass as well as the heat transport between the poleward and equatorward and exhibits significant seasonal and inter annual variations as well this partition not only has a great influence upon the low latitude western boundary currents but is also believed to be important in determining the interactions between the atmosphere and ocean lukas et al 1996 up to now it has reached a consensus that the seasonal and inter annual variations of nec bifurcation latitude nbl are determined by both local wind forcing in the western pacific and westward propagating rossby waves that are excited by remote winds in the central eastern pacific qiu and lukas 1996 kim et al 2004 chen and wu 2011 2012 in this regard to well simulate the nec bifurcation in a regional model that excludes the central eastern pacific we must be careful about the open boundary 1 1 unless otherwise specified the open boundary throughout this study is the eastern boundary of a regional model conditions since they serve as important agents of remote forcing in this study we will verify the role of open boundary conditions in modelling the seasonal variation of the nbl with special focus on the type of data input and the open boundary locations this paper is organized as follows theoretical approach using a linear rossby wave model towards understanding the essence of a regional model will be presented in section 2 in section 3 sensitivity experiments are performed by a nonlinear reduced gravity model and hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom with detailed analysis on the role of open boundary conditions discussion on modelling the seasonal cycle of nbl using flather boundary condition and kuroshio transport will be presented in section 4 section 5 provides the conclusions and implications for regional models 2 theoretical approach 2 1 the linear model previous studies suggested that the seasonal variation of the nbl is predominantly determined by the linear rossby wave dynamics qiu and lukas 1996 chen and wu 2011 2012 in other words the south north migration as well as the peak seasons of the nbl seasonal cycle can be well reproduced by the linear first mode baroclinic rossby wave model hereinafter linear model it is the simplest model representing the upper ocean response to local wind forcing and westward propagating rossby waves from remote eastern region the model can be expressed as 1 h t c r h x 1 ρ f τ ε h where h is the upper layer thickness deviation from the prescribed mean upper layer thickness h f the coriolis parameter ρ the mean density τ the vector of surface wind stress and ε the newtonian dissipation rate with the unit of yr 1 in this study we choose ε 0 to simplify the model note that c r β c 2 f 2 is the phase speed of the first mode baroclinic rossby waves and the negative sign denotes westward propagation where β is the meridional gradient of f and c is the phase speed of the internal gravity waves for the wind forcing we use the wind stress curl derived from the era interim monthly climatological wind stress datasets uppala et al 2011 the model covers most of the low latitude north pacific which extends from 5 n to 25 n in the meridional direction and from 120 e to the american coast in the zonal direction integrating eq 1 from the eastern boundary x e along the baroclinic rossby wave characteristic line x c r t const yields solution as 2 h x y t 1 ρ f x e x 1 c r τ x y t x x c r d x in eq 2 we have ignored the part of the solution due to the eastern boundary forcing because its influence is limited to the eastern boundary as reported in previous studies like fu and qiu 2002 and cabanes et al 2006 in this case the h field at a given time can be derived numerically based on the input of wind stress curl field and the background parameters following qiu and lukas 1996 mass conservation requires the inflow at the western boundary to bifurcate where h 0 so we define the nbl in this linear model as the position where the mean h within 2 off the western boundary is zero it is shown that the linear model reasonably captures the observed seasonal variation of the nbl in terms of its south north migration and peak seasons fig 1 although there remains a slight difference in amplitude qu and lukas 2003 the discrepancy may arise from the absence of nonlinearity and the negligence of the detailed flow structure inside the western boundary in the linear model in general the linear model is capable of reproducing the seasonal variation of the nbl most importantly it sets up a basic consensus that the upper ocean response at low latitudes is largely caused by the linear rossby wave dynamics in other words the rossby waves which play a role of messenger deliver the packs of wind forcing in the form of ekman pumping excited at different locations time propagate to the west gradually and determine the change of h as well as the associated nbl rhs of eq 2 2 2 the modified regional model next we made some modifications on eq 2 whose expression is then converted into an analytical regional model with an open boundary at a given longitude the solution at the western boundary of this regional model is 3 h x w y t 1 ρ f x b x w 1 c r τ x y t x x w c r d x h x b y t x b x w c r where x b is the arbitrary longitudinal location of the open boundary x w denotes the location of the western boundary i e the philippine coast according to eq 3 h at the western boundary is determined by integral effect which involves different packs of wind forcing at different locations time over the model domain first term of rhs of eq 3 and the equivalent h at the open boundary x b second term of rhs of eq 3 note that the equivalent h can be delivered from eq 2 acting as the agent of remote wind forcing that is absent from the regional model essentially the solution of eq 3 is determined by both the local integral effects of rossby wave propagations and the involvement of equivalent h at the open boundary x b theoretically we can get the same response at the western boundary if equivalent h is applied at any open boundaries in the regional model we then conducted a series of numerical calculations with different open boundary locations in this model not surprisingly the simulated western boundary layer thickness deviation h as well as the nbl from these calculations is exactly identical to each other figure not shown it explicitly shows that the result of the basin model green line in fig 1 can be well reproduced by the regional model as long as the equivalent h is properly set at any open boundaries the above linear model calculations highlight the role of open boundary conditions and provide us an important theoretical approach towards understanding the essence of a regional model we hypothesise that the open boundary conditions will lead to incorrect results at the western boundary if they are not properly used in the following part we will go into the potential effects of different type of data input and locations of open boundary on modelling the nbl 3 model and results 3 1 the 1 5 layer nonlinear reduced gravity model in consideration of the absence of nonlinearity and detailed flow in the linear model we adopt a 1 5 layer nonlinear reduced gravity primitive equation model hereinafter 1 5 layer model to examine the open boundary effects on simulating the seasonal variation of the nec bifurcation the governing equations can be written as 4 u t u u x u u y f v g h x a h 2 u τ x ρ h h v t u v x u v y f u g h y a h 2 v τ y ρ h h h t h u x v y 0 where u and v are the zonal and meridional velocity f is the coriolis parameter g the reduced gravity acceleration h the mean upper layer thickness h the upper layer thickness deviation from h a h the coefficient of horizontal eddy viscosity ρ the reference water density τ x and τ y the surface wind stress the horizontal resolution of the 1 5 layer model is 0 25 and the model domain covers the subtropical and tropical region in the north pacific fig 2 which extends from 20 s to 35 n in meridional direction and 100 e to american coast 290 e in the zonal direction marginal seas shallower than 600 m are treated as land in this model the luzon strait which connects the south china sea and the western pacific is closed eq 4 is discretized on the arakawa c grid arakawa 1972 central difference method was applied in the momentum equation and we use the semi implicit finite difference method to solve the whole equation no normal flow and nonslip boundary conditions are used along the coast but with free slip condition applied to the northern and southern boundaries from 25 n to 35 n a h increases linearly from 2000 m 2 s 1 to 6000 m 2 s 1 for the purpose of suppressing numerical instabilities in the kuroshio extension regions and damping spurious coastal kelvin waves along the artificial northern boundary the density contrast between the infinite ocean ρ 1025 kg m 3 and the upper layer ocean is δ ρ 3 kg m 3 and the initial upper layer thickness h 350 m to satisfy the cfl stability criterion a time step of δ t 480 s was used the phase speed of the first mode baroclinic rossby wave is approximately 0 16 m s 1 that is consistent with observational values around the nec bifurcation latitude chelton and schlax 1996 chelton et al 1998 this model is first spun up from rest by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era40 climatological wind stress for 20 years uppala et al 2005 after that the model is forced by the monthly climatological wind stress for an additional 20 years which is denoted as the control experiment r ctrl the monthly climatological wind stress is derived from the daily wind stress dataset spanning from 1978 to 2001 of the era40 it is beneficial to first examine the simulated broad scale upper layer circulation in different seasons before we go into the nbl it is shown in figs 3 and 4 that the 1 5 layer model reasonably captured the basic structure of the upper layer circulation in the east of philippine coast the simulated flow structure and the upper layer thickness are roughly consistent with previous observational studies based on historical datasets qu et al 1998 1999 and world ocean atlas 2013 woa13 product locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 which is indicative of a good performance of the 1 5 layer model simulation in the low latitude western pacific the seasonal cycle of the nbl is shown in fig 5 in this study the nbl is defined as the latitude where the averaged meridional flow 2 band off the philippine coast is zero which has been conventionally used by many studies qu and lukas 2003 kim et al 2004 chen and wu 2011 2012 the mean position of the simulated nbl is 14 7 n which is about 1 south of that obtained by qu and lukas 2003 and 1 north of that by wang and hu 2006 this is not surprising at all since the observed nbl is characterized by a northward shift with increasing depth nitani 1972 qu and lukas 2003 guo et al 2019 while this feature cannot be resolved by the 1 5 layer model as for the seasonal variation the simulated nbl reaches the southernmost position in july and the northernmost position in december with its south north migration of about 1 2 which is in good agreement with previous observational modelling studies qu and lukas 2003 kim et al 2004 chen and wu 2011 2012 the 1 5 layer model used here reasonably captures the major features of the upper ocean circulation in the western pacific and the seasonal variations of the nbl in terms of phase and amplitude in the next part we will convert it into a regional model to qualitatively demonstrate how open boundary conditions would affect the modelled seasonal variation of the nbl 3 2 role of open boundary locations we have theoretically verified in section 2 that the seasonal cycles of the nbl in the linear model are all identical wherever the open boundary is the essence of the linear model is the integral effect of wind stress curl from different time and different places however it still remains unclear whether this effect holds in a nonlinear model here we will assess this effect based on the 1 5 layer model first we set up a series of regional model experiments with different open boundaries extending gradually from 150 e to 80 w with 10 interval the one way nesting method is applied in each experiment in which the upper layer thickness deviation h and the flow field u v at time t from r ctrl case table 1 are set to the open boundary at time t it is shown in fig 6 that the seasonal variation of nbl in terms of peak days which is defined as the model day when the nbl reaches its southernmost northernmost position during a year in addition the amplitude from all sensitivity experiments is basically identical to each other which are quite similar to the nbl seasonal cycle derived from r ctrl case recall fig 5 it suggests that the western boundary response in this nonlinear regional model is not sensitive to the locations of the open boundary we examined the time longitude plots of the upper layer thickness anomalies around the bifurcation latitude in some typical sensitivity experiments fig 7a b and c the upper layer thickness anomalies vary seasonally exhibiting negative positive off the philippine coast from december to january june to july it leads to southward northward anomalous flow which is in favour of northward southward shift of the bifurcation latitude it is worth noting that the propagation of rossby wave packet in the form of annually reversed upper layer thickness anomalies can be clearly distinguished in fig 7d and we can readily figure out the 3 year transit time for these signals the resemblance of hövmoller diagram of upper layer thickness anomalies in all sensitivity experiments suggests that the regional model is capable of simulating the circulation pattern analogues to the r ctrl case although the remote forcing is not involved in the region model we can take them into account properly at the open boundary to get the same result like the r ctrl case 3 3 role of open boundary data as discussed previously both theoretical model analysis and 1 5 layer model experiments indicate that the modelled seasonal variation of the nbl is not sensitive to the open boundary location recall fig 6 this implies that we can set up a regional model with an open boundary close to the philippine coast as much as possible when we focus on the circulation in the low latitude western pacific however the above conclusions are all based on the regional models that are generated from the original full basin models in which the data input at the open boundary are well specified here specified means the geography forcing model parameterization and dynamical framework are identical in both the regional and basin model different from the above mentioned regional models the open boundary conditions in many current researches e g chen et al 2010 li et al 2012 dewitte et al 2013 ham and hong 2013 shchepetkin et al 2017 are provided by frequently used ocean reanalysis assimilation data like simple ocean data assimilation soda carton and giese 2008 and ncep global ocean data assimilation system goads behringer 2007 etc thus the robustness of locational sensitivity on the seasonal variation of nbl should be further assessed if this type of data is applied at the open boundary to address this point we conducted a new series of sensitivity experiments using soda data as the open boundary to assess the performance of regional model in simulating the seasonal variation of the nbl table 1 to accommodate the 1 5 layer model the upper layer thickness h is set as the depth of 26 7 σ θ isopycnal and the flow field u v are depth averaged value above 26 7 σ θ isopycnal at the corresponding time derived from soda as pointed by qu et al 1998 the nec bifurcation is mainly confined between the surface and the 26 7 σ θ isopycnal this depth which represents the interface between the upper and the lower thermocline is a good proxy for the thermocline in the western pacific fig 8 shows the nbl seasonal variation derived from three sensitivity experiments in which the open boundary is set at 150 e 180 e and 210 e respectively compared with the simulated nbl in the r ctrl case it can be visually identified that the seasonal variation of the nbl in the r 150e soda case is poorly simulated in terms of its phase and amplitude with a correlation coefficient cc of 0 23 and the root mean square error rmse value is 0 96 the bad performance of this case indicates that a regional model with an open boundary close to the philippine coast may not be a feasible option due to the absence of compatible data input at the boundary here we refer to compatible data as the data from the corresponding full basin experiments i e r ctrl case in 1 5 layer model compared with r 150e soda case the other two sensitivity experiments r 180e soda and r 210e soda are capable of reproducing the correct nbl seasonal cycle reasonably here for the 1 5 layer model we provide the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse to quantify the capability of reproducing the nbl seasonal cycle compared with r ctrl case the cc values for both experiments are 0 91 and the rmse values are 0 18 and 0 19 respectively the above results raise the possibility that the simulated upper ocean response of the western pacific circulation is not sensitive to data type as long as the location of open boundary is far from the west again we examined the time longitude plots of the upper layer thickness anomalies around the bifurcation latitude in the cases above it is shown in fig 9 that the overall pattern of annually reversed upper layer thickness anomalies in sensitivity experiments are consistent with that in the r ctrl case in the r 150e soda case however the annually reversed upper layer thickness anomalies are kind of mess signals and eventually reached the western boundary with 3 4 months lag which leads to the incorrect phase of the nbl seasonal cycle the anomalous pattern of upper layer thickness gets better as we apply the open boundary further east as mentioned above it takes at least 3 years for the annual rossby waves propagating from east to west these signals are gradually cancelled by ekman pumping from local annually reversed wind stress curl along the propagation paths nevertheless for the r 150e soda case fig 9a the regional model cannot provide enough time for adjustment of tuning interactions between local forcing and incoming signals from soda under such circumstance the open boundary data discrepancy between soda and r ctrl at 150 e is manifested at the western boundary due to insufficient time for damping the false signals this kind of false signals can be referred to as specification error marchesiello et al 2001 i e if the boundary information is not harmony with the interior solutions the over specification error can result which lead to instability if not enough information is provided to an active open boundary then under specification results which leads to degradation in the solution from the results of sensitivity experiments a reflective obc response may lead to the over specification error under the effect of clamped boundary condition for the cases that the open boundary of regional model locating farther east the open boundary data discrepancy between soda and r ctrl does not pose too much effects on the upper layer thickness pattern fig 9b and c this can be understood that the regional model has enough time to minimize the bias from false signals through interactions between wind forcing and westward propagating waves the above experiments indicate that the dependence of model results on type of data input at the open boundary will be reduced as the boundary locates farther east in other words we can get the correct seasonal cycle of the nbl using different types of data compatible data from corresponding basin experiment or incompatible data like soda at the open boundary on the condition that the regional model extends farther east here incompatible can be understood that the boundary information is not in harmony with the interior solutions of the model the domain of a regional model is suggested to extend to east of 180 e so that complete annual rossby wave adjustment can be resolved especially when we focus on the seasonal variation of nec bifurcation 3 4 ogcm experiments the dynamics of the linear model and 1 5 layer model are succinct it still remains uncertain whether a complex ocean general circulation model ogcm behaves the same as simple models in the following part we will conduct some ogcm experiments in the same way to examine the role of location and data input of a regional ogcm we adopt the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom which evolves from the miami isopycnic coordinate ocean model micom bleck 2002 halliwell 2004 in this study the hycom was implemented from global ocean to a full basin covering the entire north pacific 30 s 50 n 99 e 70 w with the horizontal resolution 0 25 the model includes 28 hybrid vertical layers and the initial configuration is delivered from the polar science center hydrographic climatology phc datasets steele et al 2001 the model was forced by monthly data derived from the ecmwf era15 reanalysis products kallberg et al 1999 from 1979 to 1993 which is referred to as the control experiment hereinafter h ctrl case for more detailed descriptions of hycom and the design of the model experiments the readers are referred to table 2 and appendix it is helpful to first validate the performance of hycom in simulating the regional circulation in the western pacific figs 10 and 11 shows that both the upper layer circulations and the seasonal cycle of the nbl are well simulated by hycom note that the upper layer thickness is defined as the depth of 26 7 σ θ isopycnal derived from h ctrl case and the nbl is the averaged value within the upper layer to examine the role of location and data type of open boundary we converted it to a regional model and conducted two groups of sensitivity experiments table 2 same as the way in previous experiments using 1 5 layer model the open boundary of the regional model is set 150 e 180 e and 210 e respectively in addition in the two groups of sensitivity experiments compatible data derived from h ctrl case and incompatible data derived from soda are set as input at the open boundary it is shown in fig 12 that the seasonal cycles of the nbl are generally analogues to each other despite tiny difference in their mean positions the resemblance of the results again indicates that the modelled seasonal variation of the nbl is not sensitive to the location of open boundary if we use the compatible open boundary data that is derived from the corresponding basin experiment as we replace the compatible open boundary data by soda data as shown in fig 13 the seasonal variation of the nbl in the h 150e soda case is poorly simulated the results of the above sensitivity experiments together with the 1 5 layer model experiments highlight important roles of compatible data and reasonable location as open boundary condition in modelling the seasonal variation of the nbl 4 discussion 4 1 type of open boundary methodology we have discussed in this study the role of open boundary condition in simulating the seasonal variation of nbl it should be noted that the type of open boundary we employed in the 1 5 layer model is so called clamped boundary condition which has been recognized as improper boundary condition there is a consensus that clamped boundaries i e simply prescribing external data at the boundary result in a reflective boundary which may lead to build up of energy in the model domain chapman 1985 based on the previous studies the interior of the regional model often generates transient waves that are transmitted through the open boundary without reflection marchesiello et al 2001 palma and matano 2001 therefore whether the robustness of our previous conclusion is related to the type of open boundary condition should be further assessed instead of the clamped boundary condition we consider another type of boundary condition that is the radiation condition proposed by flather 1976 combining the sommerfeld equation with a one dimensional version of continuity equation applied in the outwardly normal direction at an open boundary 5 u n u n e x t g h η η e x t where u n e x t represents the external data i e the velocity input in open boundary and h is the local water depth i e the upper layer thickness in this model in this equation the differences between the external data and the model predictions are allowed to propagate out of the domain at the speed of the external gravity waves based on this open boundary condition we conducted another two sets of sensitivity experiments the first set of experimentsadopted the compatible data derived from r ctrl case while the second set of experiments adopted the incompatible data derived from soda product as the open boundary locating at 150 e 180 e and 210 e in the first set of experiments the seasonal variations of the nbl in terms of phase and amplitude are exactly identical to each other which are almost the same as the nbl seasonal cycle derived from the r ctrl case the cc values are 0 999 for all three cases and the rmse values are 0 002 0 003 and 0 002 respectively therefore for radiation boundary condition i e flather boundary condition the western boundary response can still perform well and the result is not sensitive to the locations of the open boundary using compatible data the second set of experimentsuses the incompatible data derived from soda product as the open boundary which locate at 150 e 180 e and 210 e the nbl seasonal variation of three sensitivity experiments is shown in fig 14 compared with the simulated nbl in r ctrl case the cc values are 0 1 0 93 0 91 and the rmse values are 0 69 0 30 and 0 22 respectively recall that the seasonal amplitude of nbl is 1 24 in r ctrl case compared to the previous r 150e soda case in which the modelled seasonal cycle of nbl is unrecognizable the nbl in r 150e f soda case exhibits a distinct seasonal cycle this suggests that the flather boundary condition is somehow better than the clamped boundary condition however the phase of nbl in r 150e f soda case shows 3 month shift in its southernmost position and 1 month shift in its northernmost position comparing with the r ctrl case thus even though we have adopted an appropriate open boundary condition methodology in r 150e f soda case we still failed to reproduce the seasonal cycle of nbl the results get improved as complete annual cycle rossby wave packets are permitted for other cases using the open boundary farther east from the additional experiments mentioned above it can be confirmed that if the boundary information is not in harmony with the interior solutions i e incompatible data are set to the open boundary over specification error induced by clamped open boundary condition occurs leading to instability in interior domain eventually mess of signals are produced at the western boundary and incorrect nbl is derived according to flather boundary condition experiments the specification error was significantly reduced but the phase mismatch of westward propagating signals still exists in r 150e f soda case this implies that an open boundary condition that better deals with specification error can improve the solution significantly but does not necessarily produce a perfect solution in this sense there is still possibility that the seasonal variation of nbl can be well reproduced in the 150e case if a full suite of boundary approaches is applied as we extend the open boundary to 180 e or father east complete annual rossby wave packets are permitted which are in favour of harmony between interior solutions and open boundary information therefore under a more preferable dynamical framework the model results are found less dependent on the obc methodologies and the solution is substantially improved 4 2 bifurcation related nascent western boundary currents as a key of the nec kuroshio mindanao current nkm system the nbl determines the meridional heat and water mass exchanges which can regulate the warm pool and east asian climate but also to the regional biological processes and to fisheries management in the western pacific ocean lukas et al 1991 fine et al 1994 kimura et al 2001 in addition the nbl related kuroshio at its origin forms a pathway by which water parcels reach the mid latitude region thus acts as important factor in local dynamic system and eddy generation ebuchi and hanawa 2003 miyazawa et al 2004 xue 2004 rudnick et al 2011 lien et al 2014 nan et al 2015 therefore we further examined the modelled transport of kuroshio from sensitivity experiments using 1 5 layer model hycom and assessed the robustness of the above conclusion the definition of kuroshio transport in the east of philippines follows the earlier diagnostic studies by wijffels et al 1995 and qu et al 1998 it is shown in fig 15 that for the r ctrl case of 1 5 layer model the mean kuroshio transport is 17 7 sv with a seasonal maximum minimum of 20 sv 14 7 sv in spring fall for the h ctrl case of hycom the kuroshio has a seasonal maximum minimum of 23 5 sv 19 8 sv in spring fall the modelled transport is to some extent in good agreement with recent observations johns et al 2001 qiu 2008 rudnick et al 2011 with a mean transport of 21 sv and also has a maximum transport in spring and a minimum transport in fall results from sensitivity experiments using compatible data show that the seasonal variation of the kuroshio is identical to each other no matter where the open boundary is in spite of tiny difference of mean value figure not shown nevertheless similar to the nbl the seasonal variation of kuroshio transport in r 150e soda case and h 150e soda case are performing bad compared with other sensitivity experiments fig 15 thus we believe that the conclusion from the model experiments is robust 5 conclusions in this study we theoretically and numerically investigated the role of open boundary conditions in simulating the seasonal variation of the north equatorial current bifurcation latitude nbl using a linear rossby wave model a 1 5 layer nonlinear reduced gravity model and the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom we highlight an important role of the location and the data type of the open boundary in a regional model and the major conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the seasonal variation of the nbl can be well reproduced by regional models wherever the location of the open boundary is as long as they are provided by compatible data that is derived from corresponding basin experiment 2 the seasonal variation of the nbl is not properly simulated if we apply other types of data like soda as boundary input when the location of the open boundary is close to the west the performance will get better as we set the appropriate open boundary condition methodologies and its location for ocean modellers who adopt a regional model to downscale from the basin scale and study the relevant processes we would suggest the modellersshould apply a suitable open boundary condition methodology and avoid choosing the domain of a regional model arbitrarily when using incompatible data at the open boundary it is highly suggested that modellers be aware of the key dynamics of the phenomenon they care about e g the time scale or spatial scale of the processes before setting up a regional model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

23999,the role of open boundary conditions in modelling the seasonal variation of the north equatorial current bifurcation latitude nbl is studied based on a linear rossby wave model 1 5 layer reduced gravity model and hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom for a regional ocean model that covers the western pacific it is found that the seasonal variation of the nbl can be well reproduced as long as the data at the open boundary is provided by the corresponding basin experiment no matter where the location is however the south north migration of nbl as well as its peak seasons is not properly simulated if we apply other types of data at the open boundary as its location is close to the west sensitivity experiments indicate that the bad performance is attributed to the over specification error and incomplete adjustment of interaction between wind forcing and westward propagating signals from incompatible open boundary data the performance gets better as we set the open boundary at proper location and choose suitable open boundary condition these conclusions can be extended to the simulations of low latitude western boundary currents keywords north equatorial current bifurcation open boundary conditions regional model seasonal variation 1 introduction it has become increasingly evident in recent decades that the oceanic mesoscale submesoscale processes have a profound influence on the multi scale ocean atmosphere interactions and thus the global climate farneti et al 2010 qiu and chen 2013 zhang et al 2014 ma et al 2016 su et al 2018 the fundamental requirement for properly simulating these processes is to increase the spatial resolution of ocean models and it will definitely require huge computational resources particularly for running a high resolution global ocean circulation model a practical way is to adopt a regional ocean circulation model which enables us to improve the model s resolution substantially and adequately reproduce the relevant processes like mesoscale submesoscale eddies xiu and chai 2011 qiu et al 2014 luo et al 2016 sasaki et al 2017 except for high spatial temporal resolutions of the model another important prerequisite is that the model must be capable of reproducing the observed oceanic background such as the large scale ocean circulation and the associated changes of mixed layer and thermocline it has been suggested in previous studies that the oceanic background bears significant seasonal to inter annual variations and will considerably modulate the mesoscale submesoscale processes e g hole et al 2010 qiu and chen 2010 chern 2011 waterman and jayne 2011 therefore a high resolution model should get qualified in reproducing the large scale ocean circulation before properly simulating the mesoscale submesoscale processes with respect to a regional model it may encounter additional difficulties to simulate well the large scale characteristics of the ocean circulation in the low latitude pacific ocean for instance the seasonal to inter annual variations of the western boundary currents like kuroshio and mindanao current are determined by both local and remote forcing lukas 1988 qiu and lukas 1996 kim et al 2004 zhai et al 2014 that is except for local wind heat flux in the western pacific the forcing from remote area central eastern pacific will exert significant effects on the western pacific via propagations of planetary waves like the rossby waves meyers 1979 qiu and joyce 1992 especially as the origin of the kuroshio the north equatorial current nec bifurcation is suggested to play an important role in the partition of the water mass as well as the heat transport between the poleward and equatorward and exhibits significant seasonal and inter annual variations as well this partition not only has a great influence upon the low latitude western boundary currents but is also believed to be important in determining the interactions between the atmosphere and ocean lukas et al 1996 up to now it has reached a consensus that the seasonal and inter annual variations of nec bifurcation latitude nbl are determined by both local wind forcing in the western pacific and westward propagating rossby waves that are excited by remote winds in the central eastern pacific qiu and lukas 1996 kim et al 2004 chen and wu 2011 2012 in this regard to well simulate the nec bifurcation in a regional model that excludes the central eastern pacific we must be careful about the open boundary 1 1 unless otherwise specified the open boundary throughout this study is the eastern boundary of a regional model conditions since they serve as important agents of remote forcing in this study we will verify the role of open boundary conditions in modelling the seasonal variation of the nbl with special focus on the type of data input and the open boundary locations this paper is organized as follows theoretical approach using a linear rossby wave model towards understanding the essence of a regional model will be presented in section 2 in section 3 sensitivity experiments are performed by a nonlinear reduced gravity model and hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom with detailed analysis on the role of open boundary conditions discussion on modelling the seasonal cycle of nbl using flather boundary condition and kuroshio transport will be presented in section 4 section 5 provides the conclusions and implications for regional models 2 theoretical approach 2 1 the linear model previous studies suggested that the seasonal variation of the nbl is predominantly determined by the linear rossby wave dynamics qiu and lukas 1996 chen and wu 2011 2012 in other words the south north migration as well as the peak seasons of the nbl seasonal cycle can be well reproduced by the linear first mode baroclinic rossby wave model hereinafter linear model it is the simplest model representing the upper ocean response to local wind forcing and westward propagating rossby waves from remote eastern region the model can be expressed as 1 h t c r h x 1 ρ f τ ε h where h is the upper layer thickness deviation from the prescribed mean upper layer thickness h f the coriolis parameter ρ the mean density τ the vector of surface wind stress and ε the newtonian dissipation rate with the unit of yr 1 in this study we choose ε 0 to simplify the model note that c r β c 2 f 2 is the phase speed of the first mode baroclinic rossby waves and the negative sign denotes westward propagation where β is the meridional gradient of f and c is the phase speed of the internal gravity waves for the wind forcing we use the wind stress curl derived from the era interim monthly climatological wind stress datasets uppala et al 2011 the model covers most of the low latitude north pacific which extends from 5 n to 25 n in the meridional direction and from 120 e to the american coast in the zonal direction integrating eq 1 from the eastern boundary x e along the baroclinic rossby wave characteristic line x c r t const yields solution as 2 h x y t 1 ρ f x e x 1 c r τ x y t x x c r d x in eq 2 we have ignored the part of the solution due to the eastern boundary forcing because its influence is limited to the eastern boundary as reported in previous studies like fu and qiu 2002 and cabanes et al 2006 in this case the h field at a given time can be derived numerically based on the input of wind stress curl field and the background parameters following qiu and lukas 1996 mass conservation requires the inflow at the western boundary to bifurcate where h 0 so we define the nbl in this linear model as the position where the mean h within 2 off the western boundary is zero it is shown that the linear model reasonably captures the observed seasonal variation of the nbl in terms of its south north migration and peak seasons fig 1 although there remains a slight difference in amplitude qu and lukas 2003 the discrepancy may arise from the absence of nonlinearity and the negligence of the detailed flow structure inside the western boundary in the linear model in general the linear model is capable of reproducing the seasonal variation of the nbl most importantly it sets up a basic consensus that the upper ocean response at low latitudes is largely caused by the linear rossby wave dynamics in other words the rossby waves which play a role of messenger deliver the packs of wind forcing in the form of ekman pumping excited at different locations time propagate to the west gradually and determine the change of h as well as the associated nbl rhs of eq 2 2 2 the modified regional model next we made some modifications on eq 2 whose expression is then converted into an analytical regional model with an open boundary at a given longitude the solution at the western boundary of this regional model is 3 h x w y t 1 ρ f x b x w 1 c r τ x y t x x w c r d x h x b y t x b x w c r where x b is the arbitrary longitudinal location of the open boundary x w denotes the location of the western boundary i e the philippine coast according to eq 3 h at the western boundary is determined by integral effect which involves different packs of wind forcing at different locations time over the model domain first term of rhs of eq 3 and the equivalent h at the open boundary x b second term of rhs of eq 3 note that the equivalent h can be delivered from eq 2 acting as the agent of remote wind forcing that is absent from the regional model essentially the solution of eq 3 is determined by both the local integral effects of rossby wave propagations and the involvement of equivalent h at the open boundary x b theoretically we can get the same response at the western boundary if equivalent h is applied at any open boundaries in the regional model we then conducted a series of numerical calculations with different open boundary locations in this model not surprisingly the simulated western boundary layer thickness deviation h as well as the nbl from these calculations is exactly identical to each other figure not shown it explicitly shows that the result of the basin model green line in fig 1 can be well reproduced by the regional model as long as the equivalent h is properly set at any open boundaries the above linear model calculations highlight the role of open boundary conditions and provide us an important theoretical approach towards understanding the essence of a regional model we hypothesise that the open boundary conditions will lead to incorrect results at the western boundary if they are not properly used in the following part we will go into the potential effects of different type of data input and locations of open boundary on modelling the nbl 3 model and results 3 1 the 1 5 layer nonlinear reduced gravity model in consideration of the absence of nonlinearity and detailed flow in the linear model we adopt a 1 5 layer nonlinear reduced gravity primitive equation model hereinafter 1 5 layer model to examine the open boundary effects on simulating the seasonal variation of the nec bifurcation the governing equations can be written as 4 u t u u x u u y f v g h x a h 2 u τ x ρ h h v t u v x u v y f u g h y a h 2 v τ y ρ h h h t h u x v y 0 where u and v are the zonal and meridional velocity f is the coriolis parameter g the reduced gravity acceleration h the mean upper layer thickness h the upper layer thickness deviation from h a h the coefficient of horizontal eddy viscosity ρ the reference water density τ x and τ y the surface wind stress the horizontal resolution of the 1 5 layer model is 0 25 and the model domain covers the subtropical and tropical region in the north pacific fig 2 which extends from 20 s to 35 n in meridional direction and 100 e to american coast 290 e in the zonal direction marginal seas shallower than 600 m are treated as land in this model the luzon strait which connects the south china sea and the western pacific is closed eq 4 is discretized on the arakawa c grid arakawa 1972 central difference method was applied in the momentum equation and we use the semi implicit finite difference method to solve the whole equation no normal flow and nonslip boundary conditions are used along the coast but with free slip condition applied to the northern and southern boundaries from 25 n to 35 n a h increases linearly from 2000 m 2 s 1 to 6000 m 2 s 1 for the purpose of suppressing numerical instabilities in the kuroshio extension regions and damping spurious coastal kelvin waves along the artificial northern boundary the density contrast between the infinite ocean ρ 1025 kg m 3 and the upper layer ocean is δ ρ 3 kg m 3 and the initial upper layer thickness h 350 m to satisfy the cfl stability criterion a time step of δ t 480 s was used the phase speed of the first mode baroclinic rossby wave is approximately 0 16 m s 1 that is consistent with observational values around the nec bifurcation latitude chelton and schlax 1996 chelton et al 1998 this model is first spun up from rest by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era40 climatological wind stress for 20 years uppala et al 2005 after that the model is forced by the monthly climatological wind stress for an additional 20 years which is denoted as the control experiment r ctrl the monthly climatological wind stress is derived from the daily wind stress dataset spanning from 1978 to 2001 of the era40 it is beneficial to first examine the simulated broad scale upper layer circulation in different seasons before we go into the nbl it is shown in figs 3 and 4 that the 1 5 layer model reasonably captured the basic structure of the upper layer circulation in the east of philippine coast the simulated flow structure and the upper layer thickness are roughly consistent with previous observational studies based on historical datasets qu et al 1998 1999 and world ocean atlas 2013 woa13 product locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 which is indicative of a good performance of the 1 5 layer model simulation in the low latitude western pacific the seasonal cycle of the nbl is shown in fig 5 in this study the nbl is defined as the latitude where the averaged meridional flow 2 band off the philippine coast is zero which has been conventionally used by many studies qu and lukas 2003 kim et al 2004 chen and wu 2011 2012 the mean position of the simulated nbl is 14 7 n which is about 1 south of that obtained by qu and lukas 2003 and 1 north of that by wang and hu 2006 this is not surprising at all since the observed nbl is characterized by a northward shift with increasing depth nitani 1972 qu and lukas 2003 guo et al 2019 while this feature cannot be resolved by the 1 5 layer model as for the seasonal variation the simulated nbl reaches the southernmost position in july and the northernmost position in december with its south north migration of about 1 2 which is in good agreement with previous observational modelling studies qu and lukas 2003 kim et al 2004 chen and wu 2011 2012 the 1 5 layer model used here reasonably captures the major features of the upper ocean circulation in the western pacific and the seasonal variations of the nbl in terms of phase and amplitude in the next part we will convert it into a regional model to qualitatively demonstrate how open boundary conditions would affect the modelled seasonal variation of the nbl 3 2 role of open boundary locations we have theoretically verified in section 2 that the seasonal cycles of the nbl in the linear model are all identical wherever the open boundary is the essence of the linear model is the integral effect of wind stress curl from different time and different places however it still remains unclear whether this effect holds in a nonlinear model here we will assess this effect based on the 1 5 layer model first we set up a series of regional model experiments with different open boundaries extending gradually from 150 e to 80 w with 10 interval the one way nesting method is applied in each experiment in which the upper layer thickness deviation h and the flow field u v at time t from r ctrl case table 1 are set to the open boundary at time t it is shown in fig 6 that the seasonal variation of nbl in terms of peak days which is defined as the model day when the nbl reaches its southernmost northernmost position during a year in addition the amplitude from all sensitivity experiments is basically identical to each other which are quite similar to the nbl seasonal cycle derived from r ctrl case recall fig 5 it suggests that the western boundary response in this nonlinear regional model is not sensitive to the locations of the open boundary we examined the time longitude plots of the upper layer thickness anomalies around the bifurcation latitude in some typical sensitivity experiments fig 7a b and c the upper layer thickness anomalies vary seasonally exhibiting negative positive off the philippine coast from december to january june to july it leads to southward northward anomalous flow which is in favour of northward southward shift of the bifurcation latitude it is worth noting that the propagation of rossby wave packet in the form of annually reversed upper layer thickness anomalies can be clearly distinguished in fig 7d and we can readily figure out the 3 year transit time for these signals the resemblance of hövmoller diagram of upper layer thickness anomalies in all sensitivity experiments suggests that the regional model is capable of simulating the circulation pattern analogues to the r ctrl case although the remote forcing is not involved in the region model we can take them into account properly at the open boundary to get the same result like the r ctrl case 3 3 role of open boundary data as discussed previously both theoretical model analysis and 1 5 layer model experiments indicate that the modelled seasonal variation of the nbl is not sensitive to the open boundary location recall fig 6 this implies that we can set up a regional model with an open boundary close to the philippine coast as much as possible when we focus on the circulation in the low latitude western pacific however the above conclusions are all based on the regional models that are generated from the original full basin models in which the data input at the open boundary are well specified here specified means the geography forcing model parameterization and dynamical framework are identical in both the regional and basin model different from the above mentioned regional models the open boundary conditions in many current researches e g chen et al 2010 li et al 2012 dewitte et al 2013 ham and hong 2013 shchepetkin et al 2017 are provided by frequently used ocean reanalysis assimilation data like simple ocean data assimilation soda carton and giese 2008 and ncep global ocean data assimilation system goads behringer 2007 etc thus the robustness of locational sensitivity on the seasonal variation of nbl should be further assessed if this type of data is applied at the open boundary to address this point we conducted a new series of sensitivity experiments using soda data as the open boundary to assess the performance of regional model in simulating the seasonal variation of the nbl table 1 to accommodate the 1 5 layer model the upper layer thickness h is set as the depth of 26 7 σ θ isopycnal and the flow field u v are depth averaged value above 26 7 σ θ isopycnal at the corresponding time derived from soda as pointed by qu et al 1998 the nec bifurcation is mainly confined between the surface and the 26 7 σ θ isopycnal this depth which represents the interface between the upper and the lower thermocline is a good proxy for the thermocline in the western pacific fig 8 shows the nbl seasonal variation derived from three sensitivity experiments in which the open boundary is set at 150 e 180 e and 210 e respectively compared with the simulated nbl in the r ctrl case it can be visually identified that the seasonal variation of the nbl in the r 150e soda case is poorly simulated in terms of its phase and amplitude with a correlation coefficient cc of 0 23 and the root mean square error rmse value is 0 96 the bad performance of this case indicates that a regional model with an open boundary close to the philippine coast may not be a feasible option due to the absence of compatible data input at the boundary here we refer to compatible data as the data from the corresponding full basin experiments i e r ctrl case in 1 5 layer model compared with r 150e soda case the other two sensitivity experiments r 180e soda and r 210e soda are capable of reproducing the correct nbl seasonal cycle reasonably here for the 1 5 layer model we provide the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse to quantify the capability of reproducing the nbl seasonal cycle compared with r ctrl case the cc values for both experiments are 0 91 and the rmse values are 0 18 and 0 19 respectively the above results raise the possibility that the simulated upper ocean response of the western pacific circulation is not sensitive to data type as long as the location of open boundary is far from the west again we examined the time longitude plots of the upper layer thickness anomalies around the bifurcation latitude in the cases above it is shown in fig 9 that the overall pattern of annually reversed upper layer thickness anomalies in sensitivity experiments are consistent with that in the r ctrl case in the r 150e soda case however the annually reversed upper layer thickness anomalies are kind of mess signals and eventually reached the western boundary with 3 4 months lag which leads to the incorrect phase of the nbl seasonal cycle the anomalous pattern of upper layer thickness gets better as we apply the open boundary further east as mentioned above it takes at least 3 years for the annual rossby waves propagating from east to west these signals are gradually cancelled by ekman pumping from local annually reversed wind stress curl along the propagation paths nevertheless for the r 150e soda case fig 9a the regional model cannot provide enough time for adjustment of tuning interactions between local forcing and incoming signals from soda under such circumstance the open boundary data discrepancy between soda and r ctrl at 150 e is manifested at the western boundary due to insufficient time for damping the false signals this kind of false signals can be referred to as specification error marchesiello et al 2001 i e if the boundary information is not harmony with the interior solutions the over specification error can result which lead to instability if not enough information is provided to an active open boundary then under specification results which leads to degradation in the solution from the results of sensitivity experiments a reflective obc response may lead to the over specification error under the effect of clamped boundary condition for the cases that the open boundary of regional model locating farther east the open boundary data discrepancy between soda and r ctrl does not pose too much effects on the upper layer thickness pattern fig 9b and c this can be understood that the regional model has enough time to minimize the bias from false signals through interactions between wind forcing and westward propagating waves the above experiments indicate that the dependence of model results on type of data input at the open boundary will be reduced as the boundary locates farther east in other words we can get the correct seasonal cycle of the nbl using different types of data compatible data from corresponding basin experiment or incompatible data like soda at the open boundary on the condition that the regional model extends farther east here incompatible can be understood that the boundary information is not in harmony with the interior solutions of the model the domain of a regional model is suggested to extend to east of 180 e so that complete annual rossby wave adjustment can be resolved especially when we focus on the seasonal variation of nec bifurcation 3 4 ogcm experiments the dynamics of the linear model and 1 5 layer model are succinct it still remains uncertain whether a complex ocean general circulation model ogcm behaves the same as simple models in the following part we will conduct some ogcm experiments in the same way to examine the role of location and data input of a regional ogcm we adopt the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom which evolves from the miami isopycnic coordinate ocean model micom bleck 2002 halliwell 2004 in this study the hycom was implemented from global ocean to a full basin covering the entire north pacific 30 s 50 n 99 e 70 w with the horizontal resolution 0 25 the model includes 28 hybrid vertical layers and the initial configuration is delivered from the polar science center hydrographic climatology phc datasets steele et al 2001 the model was forced by monthly data derived from the ecmwf era15 reanalysis products kallberg et al 1999 from 1979 to 1993 which is referred to as the control experiment hereinafter h ctrl case for more detailed descriptions of hycom and the design of the model experiments the readers are referred to table 2 and appendix it is helpful to first validate the performance of hycom in simulating the regional circulation in the western pacific figs 10 and 11 shows that both the upper layer circulations and the seasonal cycle of the nbl are well simulated by hycom note that the upper layer thickness is defined as the depth of 26 7 σ θ isopycnal derived from h ctrl case and the nbl is the averaged value within the upper layer to examine the role of location and data type of open boundary we converted it to a regional model and conducted two groups of sensitivity experiments table 2 same as the way in previous experiments using 1 5 layer model the open boundary of the regional model is set 150 e 180 e and 210 e respectively in addition in the two groups of sensitivity experiments compatible data derived from h ctrl case and incompatible data derived from soda are set as input at the open boundary it is shown in fig 12 that the seasonal cycles of the nbl are generally analogues to each other despite tiny difference in their mean positions the resemblance of the results again indicates that the modelled seasonal variation of the nbl is not sensitive to the location of open boundary if we use the compatible open boundary data that is derived from the corresponding basin experiment as we replace the compatible open boundary data by soda data as shown in fig 13 the seasonal variation of the nbl in the h 150e soda case is poorly simulated the results of the above sensitivity experiments together with the 1 5 layer model experiments highlight important roles of compatible data and reasonable location as open boundary condition in modelling the seasonal variation of the nbl 4 discussion 4 1 type of open boundary methodology we have discussed in this study the role of open boundary condition in simulating the seasonal variation of nbl it should be noted that the type of open boundary we employed in the 1 5 layer model is so called clamped boundary condition which has been recognized as improper boundary condition there is a consensus that clamped boundaries i e simply prescribing external data at the boundary result in a reflective boundary which may lead to build up of energy in the model domain chapman 1985 based on the previous studies the interior of the regional model often generates transient waves that are transmitted through the open boundary without reflection marchesiello et al 2001 palma and matano 2001 therefore whether the robustness of our previous conclusion is related to the type of open boundary condition should be further assessed instead of the clamped boundary condition we consider another type of boundary condition that is the radiation condition proposed by flather 1976 combining the sommerfeld equation with a one dimensional version of continuity equation applied in the outwardly normal direction at an open boundary 5 u n u n e x t g h η η e x t where u n e x t represents the external data i e the velocity input in open boundary and h is the local water depth i e the upper layer thickness in this model in this equation the differences between the external data and the model predictions are allowed to propagate out of the domain at the speed of the external gravity waves based on this open boundary condition we conducted another two sets of sensitivity experiments the first set of experimentsadopted the compatible data derived from r ctrl case while the second set of experiments adopted the incompatible data derived from soda product as the open boundary locating at 150 e 180 e and 210 e in the first set of experiments the seasonal variations of the nbl in terms of phase and amplitude are exactly identical to each other which are almost the same as the nbl seasonal cycle derived from the r ctrl case the cc values are 0 999 for all three cases and the rmse values are 0 002 0 003 and 0 002 respectively therefore for radiation boundary condition i e flather boundary condition the western boundary response can still perform well and the result is not sensitive to the locations of the open boundary using compatible data the second set of experimentsuses the incompatible data derived from soda product as the open boundary which locate at 150 e 180 e and 210 e the nbl seasonal variation of three sensitivity experiments is shown in fig 14 compared with the simulated nbl in r ctrl case the cc values are 0 1 0 93 0 91 and the rmse values are 0 69 0 30 and 0 22 respectively recall that the seasonal amplitude of nbl is 1 24 in r ctrl case compared to the previous r 150e soda case in which the modelled seasonal cycle of nbl is unrecognizable the nbl in r 150e f soda case exhibits a distinct seasonal cycle this suggests that the flather boundary condition is somehow better than the clamped boundary condition however the phase of nbl in r 150e f soda case shows 3 month shift in its southernmost position and 1 month shift in its northernmost position comparing with the r ctrl case thus even though we have adopted an appropriate open boundary condition methodology in r 150e f soda case we still failed to reproduce the seasonal cycle of nbl the results get improved as complete annual cycle rossby wave packets are permitted for other cases using the open boundary farther east from the additional experiments mentioned above it can be confirmed that if the boundary information is not in harmony with the interior solutions i e incompatible data are set to the open boundary over specification error induced by clamped open boundary condition occurs leading to instability in interior domain eventually mess of signals are produced at the western boundary and incorrect nbl is derived according to flather boundary condition experiments the specification error was significantly reduced but the phase mismatch of westward propagating signals still exists in r 150e f soda case this implies that an open boundary condition that better deals with specification error can improve the solution significantly but does not necessarily produce a perfect solution in this sense there is still possibility that the seasonal variation of nbl can be well reproduced in the 150e case if a full suite of boundary approaches is applied as we extend the open boundary to 180 e or father east complete annual rossby wave packets are permitted which are in favour of harmony between interior solutions and open boundary information therefore under a more preferable dynamical framework the model results are found less dependent on the obc methodologies and the solution is substantially improved 4 2 bifurcation related nascent western boundary currents as a key of the nec kuroshio mindanao current nkm system the nbl determines the meridional heat and water mass exchanges which can regulate the warm pool and east asian climate but also to the regional biological processes and to fisheries management in the western pacific ocean lukas et al 1991 fine et al 1994 kimura et al 2001 in addition the nbl related kuroshio at its origin forms a pathway by which water parcels reach the mid latitude region thus acts as important factor in local dynamic system and eddy generation ebuchi and hanawa 2003 miyazawa et al 2004 xue 2004 rudnick et al 2011 lien et al 2014 nan et al 2015 therefore we further examined the modelled transport of kuroshio from sensitivity experiments using 1 5 layer model hycom and assessed the robustness of the above conclusion the definition of kuroshio transport in the east of philippines follows the earlier diagnostic studies by wijffels et al 1995 and qu et al 1998 it is shown in fig 15 that for the r ctrl case of 1 5 layer model the mean kuroshio transport is 17 7 sv with a seasonal maximum minimum of 20 sv 14 7 sv in spring fall for the h ctrl case of hycom the kuroshio has a seasonal maximum minimum of 23 5 sv 19 8 sv in spring fall the modelled transport is to some extent in good agreement with recent observations johns et al 2001 qiu 2008 rudnick et al 2011 with a mean transport of 21 sv and also has a maximum transport in spring and a minimum transport in fall results from sensitivity experiments using compatible data show that the seasonal variation of the kuroshio is identical to each other no matter where the open boundary is in spite of tiny difference of mean value figure not shown nevertheless similar to the nbl the seasonal variation of kuroshio transport in r 150e soda case and h 150e soda case are performing bad compared with other sensitivity experiments fig 15 thus we believe that the conclusion from the model experiments is robust 5 conclusions in this study we theoretically and numerically investigated the role of open boundary conditions in simulating the seasonal variation of the north equatorial current bifurcation latitude nbl using a linear rossby wave model a 1 5 layer nonlinear reduced gravity model and the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom we highlight an important role of the location and the data type of the open boundary in a regional model and the major conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the seasonal variation of the nbl can be well reproduced by regional models wherever the location of the open boundary is as long as they are provided by compatible data that is derived from corresponding basin experiment 2 the seasonal variation of the nbl is not properly simulated if we apply other types of data like soda as boundary input when the location of the open boundary is close to the west the performance will get better as we set the appropriate open boundary condition methodologies and its location for ocean modellers who adopt a regional model to downscale from the basin scale and study the relevant processes we would suggest the modellersshould apply a suitable open boundary condition methodology and avoid choosing the domain of a regional model arbitrarily when using incompatible data at the open boundary it is highly suggested that modellers be aware of the key dynamics of the phenomenon they care about e g the time scale or spatial scale of the processes before setting up a regional model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
